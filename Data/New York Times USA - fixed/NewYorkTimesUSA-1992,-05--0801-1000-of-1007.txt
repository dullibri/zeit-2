The Economy
The Bush Administration is promoting enterprise zones as the centerpiece of its plan to revive inner cities, but the zones that have sprouted under state programs have made only a slight dent in urban blight. Still, after a decade of criticizing the White House for neglecting the cities, many state and local officials and urban experts applaud the Administration's proposal, saying every little bit will help. [Page 1.] 
 Orders for U.S. machine tools fell 9.4 percent in April as orders from foreign customers sagged, according to the monthly report of an industry trade association. But orders rose from a year earlier, leading some analysts and executives to predict increased spending to modernize factories. [35.]
A web of zealously guarded beliefs and policies sets the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers apart from other unions. Critics say the U.E. is a relic, but admirers see it as a model for reinvigorating the labor movement by hewing to old-time principles under which workers fared better than they do today. [35.]
Just as New York was about to exhaust the last of its available transportation money, the state will soon begin receiving almost $16 billion in transportation funds. A tough political fight is breaking out in Albany over how to spend it. [21.]
Columbia University has suffered many uncomfortable moments in this year of hard times. At commencement, a flyer given out by angry students protested the adminstration's moves to limit student financial aid and make other cuts to help close a $50 million budget shortfall. [1.]
 
International
The scientists who will gather next month in Rio de Janeiro at the United Nations Earth Summit say action is needed now to limit global warming. Their science may be right, but their timing could not be worse. Burning less fuel to cut carbon emissions will be extremely difficult because fuel prices are now so low. [35.]
China's economic revolution may be dotting the countryside with new factories and electricity plants, but it is also having an unintended effect: China is contributing to global warming faster than any other large country, and there seems to be little awareness of the problem. [1.]
 
Companies
The French Government named a new chairman for Renault, selecting the managing director, Louis Schweitzer, to succeed Raymond Levy as head of the state-controlled auto maker. Mr. Levy will turn 65 next month, the mandatory retirement age. [35.]
 
The Media Business
Turner Broadcasting has created the Checkout Channel, a network of supermarket television monitors that display snippets of news, fashion tips, weather reports and advertisements to shoppers waiting to pay for their groceries. NBC, ABC and Whittle Communications are exploring similar ventures. These ventures are expected to give The National Enquirer serious competition for the attention of waiting grocery shoppers. [35.]
Growth came steadily over the last decade to Mendoza, Dillon & Asociados, the nation's largest Hispanic advertising agency. But now it and other Hispanic agencies are confronting a problem born of their own success: there are no longer many new big clients that are not already advertising in Spanish. [37.]
Genre and Out are trying to prove that gay publications can succeed without the sexually explicit ads that have repelled many major advertisers. But The Advocate, the oldest and largest gay magazine, will keep personal ads in a saddle-stitched section that must be pulled out of the magazine to be read. Advertisers are also reacting favorably to The Advocate's redesign, particularly its switch from newsprint to glossy paper. Deirdre Carmody: Magazine Notes. [37.]
Thousands of bookstore owners, managers and sales people are attending the annual American Booksellers Association convention in Anaheim, Calif., where they are previewing the books that will be published this fall and next year. [37.]

St. John's University conferred 2,146 undergraduate degrees at three graduation ceremonies held over the weekend.
The Rev. Donald J. Harrington, president of the university, gave the keynote address at all ceremonies for the 122d commencement exercises. 
 Addressing the students at the campus in Jamaica, Queens, yesterday, Father Harrington told the students that "the quality of life in society rests upon the quality of education in our grammar and high schools and in our colleges and universities."
Referring to the rioting in Los Angeles, he said, "Regardless of how we interpret the events of the past month, regardless of where we seek to place the blame, I submit to you that an essential part of any solution must be the renewal of the educational system of our land."
 
Industry, Health, Banking
 At the first ceremony, held in Alumni Hall in the morning, an honorary doctor of commercial science degree was awarded to Michael E. Maher, an alumnus of the university who is chairman of Maher Terminals Inc. in New Jersey, one of the largest independent container terminal operators.

Cornell University
 Cornell University's 124th commencement took place yesterday in a cold rain with temperatures in the 30's, prompting the university's president, Frank H. T. Rhodes, to cut short his prepared remarks to the 5,900 graduates. University officials said it was the first time in 17 years that it had rained on commencement.
Each of the graduates of Cornell's 11 schools and colleges at the ceremony, which was still held outdoors on the campus in Ithaca, N.Y., was given a red rose. Mr. Rhodes used the occasion to remind them to "take time to smell the roses."
In keeping with a longstanding Cornell tradition, there were no other speakers or honorary degree recipients at the main commencement ceremony.
 
College of New Rochelle
 Robin Toner, national political correspondent for The New York Times, addressed the graduates yesterday at the 85th commencement of the College of New Rochelle. About 900 degrees were awarded to graduates of the school's undergraduate and graduate programs.
Ms. Toner received an honorary doctorate of humane letters, as did Dr. Ruth Watson Lubric, general director of New York City's Maternity Center Association and Sister Doris Smith, S.C., president of the College of Mt. St. Vincent in Riverdale, N.Y. Gordon Parks, a photographer, author and film maker, was awarded an honorary doctor of fine arts degree.
 
University of Rochester
 The 142d commencement of the University of Rochester was held yesterday at Fauver Stadium.

 Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's nonvoting delegate to Congress, addressed the 620 graduates at Vassar College's 128th commencement ceremony held yesterday on the campus in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
Ms. Norton, a civil rights and women's rights leader, was the first woman elected to represent the District of Columbia in the House of Representatives when she won her first bid for elective office in November 1990.

 
 
Brandeis University
 Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, told graduates at Brandeis University's 41st commencement yesterday that being a member of Congress had about as much appeal "as life in a leper colony."
But Nevertheless, Mr. Solarz urged students to be optimistic in the face of national crises like the riots in Los Angeles and unemployment.
"I won't be so bold as to suggest that you emulate my example and choose a career in elective office," said Mr. Solarz, a 1962 Brandeis graduate.
But, he said, the past 30 years have proved that individuals have the ability to bring about tremendous changes in society.
Brandeis conferred 732 undergraduate degrees, 107 master's degrees and 57 doctorate degrees at its campus in Waltham, Mass.
Mr. Solarz was one of eight people who received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters.

HEADLINE: New Support but Few Gains For Urban Enterprise Zones

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is promoting enterprise zones as the centerpiece of its plan to revive the nation's inner cities, but the more than 600 zones that have sprouted under state programs have made only a slight dent in urban blight.
Still, after a decade of criticizing the White House for neglecting the cities, many state and local officials and urban experts applaud the Administration's proposal, saying every little bit will help. They see a Federal enterprise zone program not as a panacea but as a catalyst, or perhaps a nucleus to build around. 
 Enterprise zones are designated areas, usually in rundown city neighborhoods, that offer tax credits and other incentives to attract investment and jobs.
 
 
Need for Related Programs
 The Federal tax credits will not by themselves turn around inner cities, government officials and urban experts say. But by tying the zones into a host of other programs, from job training and increased police patrols to street improvements, experts predict that the zones might make an appreciable difference.
"If you look around the country, there are very few enterprise zones that have a sufficient package of incentives to have had a pronounced impact on local development," said Robert Mier, a University of Illinois planning professor who used to be Chicago's director of economic development. "What you need is a mixture of business commitment and government programs, and you're going to have to spend a lot of money to make it work."
Some urban experts say that judging from the mixed record of the enterprise zones in 36 states, it would be naive to think that such zones can rescue urban America. The more than 600 zones include a few successes, but most have made only a minor mark.
The Park Circle Enterprise Zone, for example, which sprouted in a once-desolate Baltimore neighborhood, now employs 1,400 workers. But teen-age unemployment among blacks in the area still hovers near 40 percent.
In Miami, the enterprise zone in Liberty City, a community where a three-day riot left 18 dead in 1980, has helped create a safer, palpably more prosperous area by using tax incentives to attract a supermarket, new private housing and several manufacturers.
But downtown Gary, Ind., remains a mosaic of empty lots and boarded-up storefronts. A six-year-old enterprise zone there has failed to attract nearly as many businesses or jobs as anticipated.
"If you have an enterprise zone that makes life better for businesses, then you can perhaps encourage a little job creation," said Christopher Walker, a researcher at the Urban Institute. "You have to have very modest expectations for programs like these. But if the option is doing nothing, then I say go ahead and do it."
 President Ronald Reagan pushed for enterprise zones in the early 1980's to bring jobs and hope to inner cities. But Congress has failed to agree with the Reagan or Bush Administrations on setting up such a program. States took it upon themselves to create their own zones, partly to qualify for Federal benefits that never came.
When the Los Angeles riots catapulted urban problems toward the top of the nation's agenda, enterprise zones suddenly received a warm bipartisan embrace in Washington.
With the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Jack F. Kemp, sponsoring the idea, Republicans have endorsed the zones as a supply-side formula for resuscitating urban America -- not through more Federal spending, but through beloved Republican tools like entrepreneurship and tax cuts. Democrats have signed on, believing the zones offer some hope at a time when the Administration will not spend billions of additional dollars on cities.
"It makes a lot of sense, given that economic development is one of the urgent and most fundamental needs of urban communities," said Billy Tidwell, director of research for the Urban League. "Enterprise zones are an idea whose time has come."
 
 
Bush Plan for 50 Zones
 The Bush Administration is backing a $1.9 billion program to set up 50 Federal zones over four years, 15 of them in rural areas. For businesses expanding or locating in zones, the Administration would eliminate capital gains taxes on the sale of investments made in the zones and held for at least two years.
It would also give tax deductions of up to $50,000 a year for people who buy stock in small companies in the zones. Workers earning up to $20,000 would receive a 5 percent employment tax credit for the first $10,500 of wages.
To supplement enterprise zones, the Administration has called for programs to weed out criminals from inner cities, reform welfare and improve job training.
"Federal enterprise-zone legislation should provide meaningful incentives that will build on the successes of the states, which have fewer incentives to offer," Mr. Kemp told Congress recently. He said eliminating capital gains taxes on inner-city investments in depressed areas would spur a new generation of entrepreneurs and "set in motion a process of self-improvement and job generation."
Despite their aversion to capital gains tax cuts, most Democrats accept the proposed cuts in the hope that they will spur inner-city investment. Still, many Democrats say enterprise zones fall far short of the multibillion-dollar Marshall Plan they say is needed to rescue America's cities.
 
Hope for Broad Legislation
 State officials hope the proposed Federal program, when combined with state programs, will greatly increase the flow of investment into distressed cities.
Enterprise zones have not "worked well because there aren't enough incentives from the city and the state," said Sidney Haifetz, president of the American Street Corridor Business Association, which runs an enterprise zone in Philadelphia. "There must be Federal enterprise-zone legislation for urban America to begin to turn around."
In early May, President Bush visited the American Street enterprise zone, which politicians say is one of the nation's most successful. But Mr. Haifetz says that despite the boosterism and political oratory about the zone, it has not accomplished much.
 
 
Less Than Appearances
 Mr. Haifetz, whose wholesale company sells kitchen and bathroom furnishings, said the zone had an attractive appearance because state and local money had spruced up the streets. But he said few new businesses have located there partly because Philadelphia has had to raise taxes because of the recession and Federal aid cutbacks. This makes Philadelphia less inviting to investors.
The zone "has changed a lot since it started, but the changes have not created a lot of jobs for the people," Mr. Haifetz said. Not only that, the area's crime rate remains high, many nearby homes are still abandoned, and the black unemployment rate in the area remains above 15 percent.
State officials say the nine-year-old zone has created or retained 2,200 jobs, but many experts say it is impossible to tell whether the jobs were created because of the zone's benefits or the nation's expanding economy.
Pennsylvania offers companies that expand or locate in its 45 zones credits on their corporate income taxes, depending on the size of their investments. Companies that hire one low-income person for each $15,000 in investment receive additional tax credits. To attract investors, Pennsylvania also offers money for job training and low-cost loans.
"There is a history of business disinvestment from the cities for a quarter-century," said David Messner, coordinator of Pennsylvania's enterprise zones. "Business won't invest in the cities just because we wish it to happen. You have to offer incentives."
 
Different Conclusions
 There is considerable debate in government and academia about whether enterprise zones actually encourage job creation. Mr. Kemp says zones have saved or created 180,000 jobs and spurred $9 billion in private investment. But when the General Accounting Office studied Maryland's zones, it found the job gains "could not be attributed to the enterprise-zone program."
In surveying 350 zones in 17 states, Rodney Erickson, a professor of business administration at Pennsylvania State University, found that 215 jobs were created each year, on average, in each zone. Concluding that zones bring jobs to the inner cities, his study found that this was 10 percent above the job growth in comparable areas outside zones.
"The real question is whether zones can generate the number of jobs on a broad enough basis to make a big impact in an inner-city area," Professor Erickson said. His study found that 90 percent of the new investments in zones had come from companies that were already there.
In another study, Marilyn Rubin, an economics professor at John Jay College in Manhattan, found that only 32 percent of businesses in New Jersey's enterprise zones said the benefits had been the primary or only reason for expanding or relocating there.
She said the most successful zones usually shared three factors: strong development potential, like a good local work force and solid buildings; strong cooperation between government and business, and the availability of programs that supplement tax credits, like low-interest loans or public money to improve streets and sewers.
 
From Brooklyn to Miami
 Critics often say enterprise zones merely woo jobs from other areas, rather than create new jobs. Kantor Brothers Neckwear, a tie maker that moved to a Miami zone from the impoverished East New York section of Brooklyn, is an example of how zones can rob jobs from Peter and give them to Paul.
"The work force in Brooklyn was atrocious," said Scott Kantor, the company's general manager. "We found that South Florida has a much better pool of workers." He said his company, which has 100 workers, moved to the zone in the Liberty City area of Miami because of the work force, not the zone's tax incentives. But, he added, "that extra little bonus helps."
Enterprise zones face other criticisms. Apparel manufacturers or grocery stores outside zones often complain that competitors inside zones have an unfair advantage. The sprawling zone in Louisville, Ky., is criticized because it includes not just a depressed inner-city area, but also more fortunate suburbs.
Otis Pitts, president of a neighborhood development agency in Miami, said, "Often, the skilled jobs go to people from outside the area."
 
Debate on Hiring Policies
 Some state officials say requiring companies to hire a certain percentage of zone residents will discourage many from locating in zones, because they do not want their hands tied about whom they hire.
Even if companies hire few zone residents, zone supporters say, they help the neighborhood when employees spend money in nearby restaurants or shops. Everyone agrees, however, that more money for job training would encourage the hiring of local residents.
Richard Cowden, executive director of the American Association of Enterprise Zones, argues that the benefits of zones far outweigh their shortcomings.
"If enterprise-zone incentives cause a company to make an investment in a distressed area instead of a prosperous area, that's good for the nation," he said. "Enterprise zones help rebuild a city's tax base and reduce unemployment and welfare. That's good public policy."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Price of Success for a Top Hispanic Ad Agency

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.

 BODY:
Growth came steadily over the last decade to Mendoza, Dillon & Asociados, the nation's largest Hispanic advertising agency. With the Spanish-speaking population in the United States expanding rapidly, companies like Johnson & Johnson, Ford, Sears, Levi Strauss and General Foods flocked to the agency and allocated small but increasing portions of their advertising budgets to peddling their products to the Hispanic market.
But now Mendoza, Dillon and other Hispanic agencies are confronting a problem born of their own success: There are no longer many new big clients out there that are not already advertising in Spanish. 
 "Ten years ago, most of our time was spent convincing companies of the Hispanic opportunity," said Robert Howells, the president of Mendoza, Dillon, which is owned by the WPP Group, the parent of J. Walter Thompson. "Now, a majority of our time is spent with existing clients, telling them they should consider spending more against the Hispanic market or adding new products. The growth is going to be different."
 
Difficult Strategy
 Squeezing more business out of existing clients, however, is a difficult strategy for any agency. Most consumer-products companies are still feeling the recession and are seeking ways to cut ad spending. And it is particularly difficult for Hispanic agencies, even the large ones like Mendoza, Dillon, because clients generally do not attach nearly as much importance to Spanish-language campaigns as they do to campaigns aimed at the general market.
As a result, the growth in Mendoza, Dillon's business, and in Hispanic advertising as a whole, has slowed to 5 to 10 percent a year over the last several years, putting the agency's billings today at more than $60 million, up from $48 million in 1990. For a decade after its founding in 1979, Mendoza, Dillon grew an average of 20 percent a year.
Still, slower growth is better than the little or no growth at many general-market agencies and some of the smaller Hispanic agencies.
 
Part of the Marketing Mix
 Despite the slowdown, Mendoza, Dillon and its biggest competitors -- including Casanova-Pendrill Publicidad of Irvine, Calif., Font & Vaamonde of New York, Conill Advertising of New York and Sosa, Bromley, Aguilar & Asociados of San Antonio -- have convinced most large consumer-products companies that Spanish-language advertising should be a part of the marketing mix.
"It's become a routine thing," said Roger Sennott, the general manager of Market Development Inc., a San Diego research firm. "There are a lot of long-term players who are very committed to the market, and for them it's an accepted part of the marketing effort."
Indeed, industry executives said, the prospects for the top-tier Hispanic agencies remain bright. In part, they said, that is because the Spanish-speaking population in the United States, already 10 percent of the total population and more than 20 percent in crucial markets like California, is growing faster than any other large ethnic group.
In addition, they said, the quality of Spanish-language advertising and marketing has improved, making it more appealing for companies.
 
Mendoza's Strategy
 The key to Mendoza, Dillon's success, Mr. Howells said, has been a strategy of persuading clients to start by advertising on a small scale and then showing them the results in the form of increased sales.
The agency's first big client was Tylenol, which is made by the McNeil Consumer Products division of Johnson & Johnson. The company gradually started to advertise more brands in Spanish. Today, Mendoza, Dillon handles advertising for four McNeil products and several other Johnson & Johnson brands, including Band-Aids.
In some cases, the advertising that Mendoza, Dillon produces mirrors the English-language campaigns. Commercials for Band-Aids, for example, even use the same jingle.
But for the most part, the agency's campaigns are tailored to the Spanish-speaking market. Reebok advertises its shoes to the general market primarily in terms of how they help athletic performance. For the Spanish-speaking market, the commercials developed by Mendoza, Dillon portray Reeboks as shoes to be worn during leisure time, reflecting the agency's research into why Hispanic consumers buy athletic shoes.
And the agency's commercials for Levi jeans are much slower-paced than the English-language campaign, and show many family scenes, reflecting the strong emphasis on family in the Hispanic culture.
In some ways, advertising to Hispanic consumers is easier than advertising to the general market because there are fewer Spanish-language campaigns vying for the audience's attention.
"You're often introducing a product to the market for the first time," Mr. Howells said. "If you have a good campaign, advertising will move the needle quickly, more quickly than in the general market because there's less clutter."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Booksellers Reassert Their Role in Publishing

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif., May 24

 BODY:
Magic Johnson is here, and so is Judith Krantz and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf and P. J. O'Rourke and Jimmy Carter and Stephen King. And the publishers who bring out books by these celebrities and celebrity authors are out here, too, throwing fancy parties and cocktail cruises and dinners.
But illustrious as they are, these stars are not the reason that nearly 2,000 publishers and even more staff members have come here. No, they have come because of John Valentine and Christy Meisner and Bob Bresee and Roz Parr and Fern Jaffe and Lew Rosenbaum.
Who? 
 These people are the link between the readers and the publishers' star authors (as well as lesser-known or yet-unknown authors). They are a handful of the thousands of bookstore owners, managers and sales people who have come to the annual American Booksellers Association convention to preview books that will be published this fall and next year.
 
'Partners to Publishers'
 "We're not just customers to publishers; we're partners to publishers," said Chuck Robinson, owner of Village Books in Bellingham, Wash., and the new president of the Booksellers Association. "If we sell books, they sell books."
Despite the recession, booksellers have been selling books and selling them well. Statistics from the Commerce Department show that booksellers increased their sales last year more than any other sector of the retail economy, bringing 8.25 percent growth. Commerce Department analysts say the upward trend for booksellers has continued this year.
The convention is a time to check out publishers' lists, a kind of literary equivalent of the fall fashion shows in Paris and Milan. This year, big biographies are in, as well as books about race relations. But it is also a time for booksellers to pick each other's brains and to compare notes.
The booksellers gathered here, particularly the owners and managers of independent stores, say this success is not accidental. They say it is even more impressive considering that it occurred as rents and other basic costs rose and heavy competition from the chain and super bookstores threatened smaller establishments.
 
Coping With the Economy
 While the chain stores, like Waldenbooks, B. Dalton and Barnes & Noble, have problems unique to the way they sell books, they also have the financial support of large corporations and tremendous influence with publishers, who need their vast outlets. But most of the booksellers here own or run independent stores, and they have had to find their own ways to cope with the current economy.
John Valentine, an owner of the Regulator Bookshop, an independent store in Durham, N.C., said he and his partner started two "aggressive marketing programs" this year to compete with the chain stores.
They began offering 20 percent discounts on the top 10 hardcover books on the New York Times best-seller list for fiction and the top 10 on the Times list for nonfiction.
They also started a lifetime discount club, in which customers can pay $15 for an individual or $20 per household and get 10 percent off on all books for the rest of their lives. In the club, households include gay couples, an important audience for a store that prides itself on its extensive selection of gay titles.
Sometimes, booksellers said, they compete by not competing. Donna Pohlman, who owns Much Ado About Books in Redlands, Calif., said that rather than imitate the chains, she decided to distinguish her store from them. "We handle a lot of midlist books; not so much the best sellers," she said. "And we do special orders that the chains just don't handle."
Many booksellers said they needed much more cooperation from publishers. Kathleen Murphy, the manager of the children's department at Page One, an independent bookstore in Albuquerque, N.M., said publishers would benefit if they abandoned their efforts to push too many books on reluctant booksellers.
"The hard sell ends up costing everyone money and time," Ms. Murphy said. "Publishers should spend more time learning who our customers are so they can help us to promote their books better."
 
Other Complaints
 Sandy Wilson, the owner of Bookstore in Elko, Nev., said she wanted publishers to send her the same publicity posters and displays that they send to bigger stores "who have more clout with the publishers."
Mr. Robinson said he frequently heard complaints from booksellers about the lack of standardization in the industry. He wondered why, for example, publishers could not use the same abbreviations for common words in book titles, like American or history or collection.
"There has just got to be a more efficient way for all of us to handle the bureaucracy," Mr. Robinson said. "If we spend less time on paperwork, we can spend more time selling books to people."

HEADLINE: Cheap Fuel Hurts Goal For Climate

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The scientists who will gather at the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro next month say that action is needed now to limit global warming. Their science may be right, but their timing could not be worse.
Taking the most important step in slowing climate warming -- burning less fuel to cut heat-retaining carbon emissions into the atmosphere -- will be extremely difficult because fuel prices are now so low. 
 Ten years ago, planners were predicting oil at $75 or $100 a barrel in the 90's. Now, said Lee J. Schipper, senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory International Energy Studies Group, the price is so stable that "there's nothing to predict."
"It isn't interesting any more," he added.
 
Unexpected Stability
 The price of oil -- now around $20 a barrel -- has proved in the last 18 months to be more stable than almost anyone had believed; even a war in the Persian Gulf did not move it higher for long.
In addition, the price of coal is low and has remained stable, and the price of natural gas is declining in some areas, most notably in North America.
None of this makes it impossible to cut fuel use; it just means that science and the energy market are completely out of step. And unlike a decade ago, when the world believed oil should be conserved because the supply was running out, any action today to limit fuel use runs against the economics of cheap energy.
 
The White House's Mood
 Conservation also goes against the mood in the White House, which would have to lend its support for any global conservation action -- like a consumption tax -- to take hold.
The world is like a patient with a cholesterol problem. Tofu and sprouts are available, but steak and lobster are plentiful, too. Consider the following:
*The price of driving a car has never been lower, in inflation-adjusted terms. Partly as a result, the number of miles traveled each year on American roads has quadrupled in the last 40 years. The car population around the world is rising far faster than the human population.
*Nuclear power, a source of energy that produces nearly no carbon emissions, will probably lose share in the world electricity market in coming years because of public unease with the technology and the low prices of other fuels.
*Solar power and wind power are still under development, but the low price of oil has blunted the urgency of research.
*Technology has improved the efficiency of the oil companies so that it costs far less now to find a barrel of oil than it did a few years ago.
In fact, in the last 10 years, the amount of oil that has been found and is waiting to be pumped has doubled, to about one trillion barrels; natural gas projects are proliferating, and in most parts of the world engineers have long since given up looking for coal. With advancing technology, those fuels can now be substituted for each other to a growing degree.
 
Plentiful Supplies
 The result is that fossil fuels, the "nonrenewable" energy sources, are hard to run out of. The May 15 issue of Science carries an article by three researchers from the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility research consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif., that states flatly, "There is little likelihood that a serious scarcity of fuels will develop during the next century on a global scale."
The conclusion is startling because of the growth in demand. The researchers -- Chauncey Starr, who founded the institute and is an elder statesman of the electricity world; Milton F. Searl, and Sy Alport -- project that by 2060, global population will nearly double, and average output of goods and services per captia will increase 2.8 times. That means that economic activity will be more than five times as large as today.
In the same period, the researchers say, energy consumption will increase slightly more slowly because of increased efficiency, rising to 4.5 times the current level if there are no major gains in efficiency, and 2.5 times if there are.
That energy equation resembles the dismaying prospects laid out by Malthus that the population will grow faster than the food supply. In this case, energy efficiency increases arithmetically, but energy consumption increases geometrically.
And prices will not help slow the growth of consumption.
"The market is giving no assistance whatsoever," said Geoffrey M. Heal, an economist and specialist in energy and natural resources at the Columbia Business School. "For all of the basic energy sources, as a trend over the last 10 years, prices have fallen."
Statistics collected by Conoco Inc., the oil company subsidiary of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, illustrate the problem. Through the 1960's, America's oil bill was about 2 percent of gross national product, hardly worth worrying about. It jumped to 4 percent with the oil price shock of 1973, and 9 percent with the price shock of 1979-80. Now it is back down to about 2 percent.
"The price of oil will not be one that makes the world want to develop with less oil," said John Sauer, Conoco's chief economist. And oil tends to drag the prices of other fuels up or down with it.
Carbon dioxide output need not rise in lockstep with energy use; some energy could come from non-carbon sources. But the two largest such sources today -- hydroelectricity and nuclear power -- are growing only slightly because of environmental problems and public opposition.
Other sources, like the direct conversion of sunlight to electricity, or generation of liquid fuels from crops or organic wastes, are not financially attractive on a large scale.
The Earth Summit goal for limiting carbon emissions -- freezing emissions at 1990 levels -- seems ambitious. But even that goal is modest relative to the problem. Carbon emissions in 1990 were far larger than the earth's biosphere could absorb, so if emissions were stabilized at that level, the amount of carbon in the atmosphere would continue to rise.
 
Room for Change
 The economics of natural resources could change again, of course. Professor Heal of Columbia points out that the warming of the earth is measured in decades, and some time in a decade or two, the world could want to cut fuel use to save costs.
But if carbon emissions must be cut, there is a reason to begin with carbon-emission taxes now, he said. "From a government-policy position, it may be easier to start a tradition of raising prices with carbon taxes at a time of low prices," he said.
But no industrial nation is likely to embark on this course alone, thus handing an economic advantage to its trading partners. And so far, the logic of instituting a tax now does not seem appealing in the United States.

HEADLINE: Labor's True-Blue-Collar Union

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
Their 24th-floor headquarters here gives the leaders of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America a panoramic view, much like that enjoyed by the powerful chief executives, influential bankers and wealthy lawyers in nearby skyscrapers.
But the U.E., as the union is known, goes out of its way to make sure its top officers are not too tempted to identify with their neighbors in the skyline. The union's constitution limits executive salaries to $32,494, helping to make sure that the U.E.'s president, John H. Hovis Jr., its secretary-treasurer, Amy R. Newell, and its director of organization, Edmund L. Bruno, do not lose the perspective of the union's 40,000 members. 
 In an era when huge salary gaps between executives and employees are attracting Congressional attention and when leaders of many other labor unions have compensation packages topping $100,000 a year, the electrical workers' union salary limits and quirks like treating the head of organizing on a par with the president stand out like a Model T Ford at the Indy 500. But these are only part of a larger web of zealously guarded beliefs and policies, like opposition to such worker-management cooperation programs as quality circles, that sets the union apart from others.
 
Relics of Class Warfare?
 In the eyes of critics, the U.E. is a relic. But admirers see it as a model for reinvigorating the labor movement by hewing to the old-time principles under which workers fared a lot better than they do today.
"There's no one like them," said Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University of California at San Diego. "They combine militancy with a broader ideological spirit that reflects an earlier time."
As a result, the U.E.'s health may well be the purest indicator available of the staying power of the battered Marxist view: that workers form a class of citizens with shared interests separate from those who own and control business.
"We don't talk about what is happening to workers in terms of class warfare these days," Mr. Bruno said, "but it's hard to look at the last 20 years and describe it otherwise."
Some U.E. policies that are derived from the class-warfare ideology, like opposition to free-trade agreements, are widely shared by other unions and by scholars of the labor movement. But others, like the belief that a shorter workweek is the solution to saving jobs that would be lost to automation, are dismissed by most other labor leaders as unrealistic.
"If we got a short week, it would just send more jobs to Mexico or Taiwan," said William Bywater, president of the 150,000-member International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers. "They are living somewhat in the past."
The very existence of the I.U.E. shows how dearly the U.E. has sometimes paid for its fidelity to the social values of those who founded it in 1936. When critics began attacking the union as Communist-dominated as the Cold War gathered steam in the late 1940's, the I.U.E. was formed by dissidents who eventually forced the U.E. out of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. The U.E.'s membership plummeted from a peak of 600,000 in 1947 to just 90,000 by 1956, an exodus encouraged by executives in U.E.-organized companies like Westinghouse and General Electric.
The two electrical unions have worked closely in bargaining since 1969, and Mr. Bywater has proposed merging, but the rift remains deep.
The years of the U.E.'s membership decline have also seen the fall of union representation in the industrial work force in general, from about 35 percent to less than 12 percent. The U.E.'s organizing successes have come largely at small plastics plants, where Hispanic workers, women or other minorities make up most of the work force.
Often, the union's officials complain, plant owners refuse to bargain for months after the union has won a representation election, secure in the knowledge that there are few penalties for resistance. And the spreading practice of firing striking workers has also undermined union clout.
"The right to organize really exists only on paper," Mr. Hovis said.
Nevertheless, the union continues to spend heavily on organizing and trying new approaches. In a recent failed attempt to organize workers at G.E.'s plastics plant in Parkersburg, W.Va., the United Electrical Workers welcomed help from the International Union of Electrical Workers.
 
A Hard Line Toward Management
 Industrial companies remain the U.E.'s prime target, but the newest local was formed this spring by employees of Ohio's turnpike system. The union also has welcomed approaches over the years by employees of radio stations like WBAI in New York and WBCN in Boston, which became U.E. locals.
Trade unionism U.E. style includes fervent opposition to company-sponsored quality circles, worker-team concepts and other forms of cooperation now widely used in American factories to raise productivity. In one case in 1986, members at a United Electrical local in G.E.'s Erie, Pa., locomotive plant removed eight officers and stewards from office for traveling with G.E. officials at company expense to Japan to see quality-improvement programs in action.
"If we thought the Japanese had anything to teach us, we'd pay for sending our members ourselves," Adam Fiorvanti, the local's business agent, told a visitor several months later. G.E. officials decline to be quoted about their relations with the U.E. Some of them, however, privately express admiration for its adherence to principle.
As the U.E. sees it, programs like G.E.'s are part of a never-ending effort by executives to get workers to identify their long-term welfare with company goals and to push independent unions to the sidelines.
The views of the United Electrical Workers are shared by substantial minorities in other unions and even, in some cases, by leaders. "We haven't had any success trying to convince people not to participate in quality circles, so our policy has become to try to take them over and make them union instruments," said Bob Wages, president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union.
Critics say that the rigid view of managers as "them" will only hurt the United Electrical Workers and that the U.E.'s meager salary structure is also obsolete.
"I don't think a worker wants to be represented by another poor person," said Gabe Villareal, a former U.E. field organizer who now is a personnel executive in Sanger, Calif., for the General Cable division of Penn Central. "They want someone who's a visible success, who looks like they have the resources to help."
Union officials say they still prefer the formula laid out decades ago by the charismatic James J. Matles, a former union president who declared that union leaders should be paid so that they feel "like the members and not for the members."
Mr. Hovis, a quiet-talking 48-year-old Seattle native, has been elected president annually since 1987. He joined the union as a field official in 1972 after working as a machinist.
Ms. Newell, a chain-smoking 44-year-old daughter of U.E. officials, is a native of Pittsburgh. She studied political theory at the London School of Economics and drifted through a variety of what she called drop-out jobs before plunging into an unsuccessful effort to organize assembly workers in Silicon Valley in the early 1970's. She became a field organizer in 1974 and was first elected secretary-treasurer in 1985.
Mr. Bruno, also 44, grew up in Athol, Mass., and was impressed by the U.E. in his high school years when it organized a machine tool plant in his town. He joined the U.E.'s organizing staff in Boston in 1973 after working in a lens factory in New Hampshire.
They spend a large part of their time traveling. It was a rare occasion when all three were recently in Pittsburgh together for an interview.
The U.E. officials and many labor scholars note that American executives repeatedly rejected efforts by unions in the 1930's and 1940's to reach some of the same power-sharing arrangements companies are now proposing, like reductions in military-type supervision by foremen.
"They want them now that labor is weak, but the parties have to be a equal strength for these things to really work," Mr. Bruno said.
Shop floor concerns aside, U.E. officials said they were heartened by the number of other unions now working with them and nonlabor groups in organizations like Jobs With Justice to pursue a broader social agenda.
"There's a lot of things percolating," Ms. Newell said.

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Off 9.4% in April

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools fell 9.4 percent in April, compared with March, according to the latest monthly report by an industry trade association. The report, prepared for release today, indicated that demand from foreign buyers had sagged.
But orders rose from a year earlier, leading some analysts and industry executives to predict increased spending to modernize factories. Machine tools are used to cut and form metal parts for a huge number of goods, from household appliances to supersonic jetliners. Because the auto industry accounts for about a third of the machine tool makers' output, Detroit's slump has hurt those companies. 
 "We're seeing some signs of life in the machine tool industry," said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst at Paine Webber.
The trade group, the Association for Manufacturing Technology, said machine tool orders fell to $219.9 million in April, from $242.8 million in March. But orders rose 13.6 percent compared with April 1991.
Orders for the first four months of 1992 were 6.2 percent higher than in the comparable period a year earlier.
Several industry analysts cited those increases as evidence that demand was picking up and that manufacturers in a wide range of industries were beginning to spend more to upgrade their plants and equipment.
"We have seen better automotive business through most of this year," Mr. Lustgarten said, "and that's because it's becoming more of a priority for auto makers to upgrade and improve their operations."
Dale H. Norton, vice president for planning and business development for Giddings & Lewis Inc., a leading machine tool maker, said increased purchases in recent months indicated that the recession was ending.
"We are certainly hearing from our customers that there is more activity in terms of inquiries and their own plans to buy," Mr. Norton said. "We are getting indications that the corner has been turned, and we expect that it will be a better year, although we don't expect it to be an ebullient year."
But the decline in exports sharply affected orders, at least in April, the association said. "In the last year to year and a half, export orders have offset declines in domestic orders," said Albert W. Moore, president of the association, which is based in McLean, Va. "Now export orders are down, reflecting the economic distress our trade partners are experiencing."
Mr. Moore said he expected more competition in the United States machine tool market because of an erosion of demand in many countries. That erosion will cause foreign machine tool builders to "look to offset domestic declines with exports to the United States," he said.
 
Shipments Down Sharply
 Shipments of machine tools plunged 32.6 percent in April, compared with March. Compared with April of last year, shipments were down 6.8 percent; they were down 3.3 percent for the first four months of the year.
Orders for metal-cutting tools, which account for nearly three-fourths of the industry, were down 13.9 percent in April from March's level. But for the first four months of the year, orders for metal-cutting tools were up 8.8 percent from the similar period last year. And orders were 15.7 percent higher than in April of last year.
Orders for metal-forming tools were up 4.5 percent for the month and down four-tenths of a percent for the first four months. Orders for metal-forming tools were 8.5 percent higher than in April of last year.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Faces Pressure To Allow Use of Gasohol

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 22

 BODY:
Prodded by the grain-alcohol lobby, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency is considering whether to force New Jersey to permit the sale of an ethanol fuel mixture commonly called gasohol.
While the lobbyists say ethanol can reduce emissions of carbon monoxide from motor vehicles, New Jersey says it can increase other pollutants, including ground-level ozone, or smog. And that's just about the last thing New Jersey wants to do. The whole state is out of compliance with Federal standards for ozone, and 18 of the state's 21 counties have severe problems. Only Los Angeles is worse. 
 "The economic interests of the ethanol industry should not take precedence over the health and environmental interests of New Jersey citizens," said the state's environmental commissioner, Scott A. Weiner.
He said he was particularly concerned that the introduction of ethanol could negate the effects of a state program to promote car pooling. This program, which affects businesses with 100 or more employees, is among the steps mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency to help New Jersey reduce its ozone levels 42 percent by the year 2005 to comply with the Clean Air Act.
 
'Promote Its Own Interests'
 "The ethanol industry has sought to promote its own interests by keeping steady pressure on the E.P.A.," Mr. Weiner said. "Now they seek to undermine clean air" by rule making, he added.
In the last decade, interest in gasohol has grown with national concerns about air pollution from oil and other fossil fuels. Gasohol's proponents say the ethanol-gasoline mixture would help reduce dependence on foreign oil because ethanol is made from a renewable source: corn. Political leaders like Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, have thrown their weight behind the farmers, lobbying for an industry that accounts for about 5 percent of the 115 billion gallons of motor fuel sold annually.
Ethanol in gasoline produces more complete combustion and thereby reduces noxious emissions. But because ethanol is so volatile, it can increase vapors, particularly nitrogen oxide, emitted from gas tanks or from under car hoods. These unburned hydrocarbons react with sunlight, particularly in the summer, to create ozone, a major source of respiratory problems.
Ethanol may be used in the winter under New Jersey's air standards, because the sun's rays are not as strong and ozone formation is not as serious a problem, but it is barred in summer. As a result, the ethanol industry says it cannot make a dent in New Jersey or the rest of the Northeast because petroleum companies, many with large refineries or storage plants here, cannot accommodate seasonal sales of gasohol.
 
Lobby Seeks U.S. Pressure
 "When you talk to companies like Amerada Hess or Getty or Sun you find these companies will tell you, 'We have to plan our supply storage, terminaling and contracts on an annual basis, not four months in, four months out,' " said Eric Vaughn, president of the Renewable Fuels Association in Washington, the main industry lobby for ethanol.
At a hearing in Manhattan on May 5, the fuels association asked the E.P.A. to require New Jersey to change its summer standards for gasohol evaporation. A few years ago the E.P.A. said it would permit such changes largely as an accommodation to the ethanol industry, said Richard D. Wilson, director of the agency's Office of Mobile Sources, which conducted the hearing. "We were stuck with either giving them a break or putting them out of business," Mr. Wilson said.
He said he expected the E.P.A. to rule by midsummer on whether to force New Jersey to grant a waiver for ethanol.
New Jersey's allowable vapor pressure is 9 pounds per square inch; the grain-alcohol lobby wants a waiver to 10, the Federal standard.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: New Jersey;
A Signature Is Not a Vote, but on Perot Petitions, It Comes Close

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERNARDSVILLE, N.J., May 23

 BODY:
After leaving the supermarket with some holiday groceries today, Leonard Orr and his daughter Danae stopped by the table where people were signing petitions to get Ross Perot, the billionaire Texan, on the presidential ballot in the New Jersey primary this November.
Mr. Orr, 50-year-old owner of a construction company, signed eagerly. 
 Miss Orr, 22, who just returned home with a degree in comparative literature from Wesleyan University, refused.
That stirred a father-daughter debate on the merits of Mr. Perot and his independent presidential campaign.
Miss Orr said Mr. Perot was "absolutely irresponsible" for not formally declaring his candidacy while his volunteers around the country were circulating petitions to have him put on the ballot in all 50 states.
"It's a way for him to avoid answering questions on national issues," she said.
Mr. Orr argued with his daughter's view. "That's an opinion from the intellect," he said. "Mine's from the emotion."
He said he was not troubled by what he saw as Mr. Perot's lack of positions on issues.
"I'm ready to vote for Perot," Mr. Orr said. "I don't know what he stands for. But I'm to the point he can't do any worse than what we've got now."
Mr. Orr said he was frustrated by the "standard party line we're getting from the Democrats and Republicans." An example, he said, was Vice President Quayle's use of the TV sitcom "Murphy Brown" the other night to criticize unwed motherhood.
"That was just a charade to steer us from confronting the real issues," he said. "Let's get back to boring issues, like health care."
Between 9 A.M. and 1 P.M., 70 other shoppers like Mr. Orr signed at the Perot table, one of 23 that Perot organizers said they planned to set up around Somerset County, long a Republican bastion in New Jersey, this holiday weekend.
Almost overnight, the Perot petition tables have popped up outside train stations, malls, libraries and supermarkets around the state. On May 12, volunteers submitted petitions with 2,947 signatures to New Jersey's Secretary of State, well above the 800 needed to earn a spot on New Jersey's ballot.
"There are 3,000 petitions still out there, and we have a goal of getting 50,000 to 100,000 signed up," said Stephen Maynard, the Perot organization's spokesman in New Jersey.
The table here this morning was not exactly overwhelmed with business. Most of the shoppers who packed the store's aisles just wheeled their baskets past the table.
Those who stopped to sign talked of frustration about taxes and the recession and of weariness with President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. There was a yearning for a wider choice in November and for fresh faces and fresh approaches.
 
'Scary Time for the Country'
 "Nothing's working now; that's why the country's in the mess it's in," said June Sturges, who described herself as an avid Republican. "It's time for a change."
Like Mr. Orr, few seemed troubled that they did not know Mr. Perot's stands on the issues.
"I'm not sure what he would do and I'm not sure he'll have a power base," said Constance L. Hermes of Basking Ridge. "But it's a scary time for the country now. The other guys will have to prove why Perot shouldn't have my vote."
Michael Panesis, a 29-year-old management consultant, said: "The other candidates are just not up to being President, including the President."

HEADLINE: John Gates, 78, Former Editor Of The Daily Worker, Is Dead

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
John Gates, who quit as a top American Communist official and chief editor of The Daily Worker after losing a campaign to democratize the party and free it from Moscow's control, died on Saturday at the Miami Heart Institute in Miami Beach. He was 78 years old and lived in North Miami Beach.
He died of heart disease and a stroke, his family said. 
 Mr. Gates broke from the party in 1958 after much soul-searching, which began while he served a five-year prison sentence. He and other party leaders were convicted of advocating the overthrow of the Government, which they denied.
After his release in 1955, new revelations came of the abuses of Stalinism. In 1956, Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin and the Soviets crushed the rebellion in Hungary.
"For the first time, I feel ashamed of the name Communist," Mr. Gates said. He led a faction in intense infighting to change the party, but lost.
 
A Parting Rebuke
 He quit with a rebuke. "The ideals that attracted me to socialism still motivate me," his resignation said, but "the Communist Party has ceased to be an effective force for democracy, peace and socialism."
After writing a book on his experience, he became a senior research assistant at the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. He helped members with workers' compensation, unemployment and Social Security claims. He retired in 1987.
He felt vindicated by the recent collapse of Communism and the Soviet Union, "but it was an unhappy vindication, because it took so long and so many people suffered," his wife, Lillian, said.
Mr. Gates remained concerned about the issues that led him to Communism: poverty, discrimination, homelessness, hunger and inadequate schools and health care. He said that capitalism placed profit above the public welfare and kept power in the hands of a few but he grew wary of ideological prescriptions.
"After being so certain and dogmatic," he wrote after quitting the party, "I do not profess to have all the answers."
Mr. Gates, born in Manhattan and reared there and in the Bronx, joined the Communists at the age of 17 as an outgrowth of a protest at City College. In the Depression of the early 1930's, he left his college studies to mobilize jobless youths in Ohio. He ran for the Youngstown City Council and was jailed on a charge of making a loud noise without a permit.
He fought in the Spanish Civil War, becoming the commissar of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade at the age of 24, the highest-ranking American in the war. In World War II, he enlisted in the United States Army and volunteered as a paratrooper in Europe.
Resuming his Communist work after the war, he became one of seven national secretaries and the editor of the Worker. Despite his conviction in the nation's first Communist trials, he always maintained his loyalty to America. He said he favored peaceful, democratic change to socialism, and opposed force, violence and espionage.
In prison, he later wrote, "We talked endlessly, of what we might have done better in the past, what we could do in the future." His discussions and introspection eventually led him to say: "Today, the Communist Party has become irrelevant."
Surviving are his wife of 47 years, the former Lillian Schwartz; a brother, Nat Regenstreif, of Hollywood, Fla., and three sisters, Blanche Smiles of the Bronx, Irene Travis of Charlotte, N.C., and Marlene Seml of Boca Raton, Fla.

An article in Business Day on Friday about new Federal rules setting limits on bank interest rates and brokered deposits misstated the amount of brokered deposits held at the end of the year by the First Union National Bank, of Charlotte, N.C. It was $319.3 million.
A table with the article, listing the two groups of banks that face regulation of their brokered deposits and interest rates under the new rules, included two banks incorrectly in the group that would be prohibited from accepting brokered deposits or paying unusually high rates. The York Bank and Trust Company and the Massachusetts Company should not have been listed. 
 The article also referred incompletely to the role of Sheshunoff Information Services in providing data for the article and the table. The company drew no conclusions about the weakness or strength of any bank mentioned in the article.

HEADLINE: Agreed. Peru Needs Democracy.

 BODY:
Peru's strongman President, Alberto Fujimori, bristled with his usual truculence when he appeared unexpectedly last week at a meeting of the Organization of American States in the Bahamas. But he also announced an accelerated timetable for new elections. That, and the O.A.S.'s cautiously encouraging response, raise new hopes for resolving the crisis ignited by Mr. Fujimori's dismissal of Congress, the judiciary and constitutional rule last month.
Mr. Fujimori continues to offend democrats and insult diplomats with belligerent words and deeds. His latest proposal would create a presidential dictatorship seductively disguised as "direct democracy." His plan excludes Peru's strongly rooted political parties and offers no effective checks against executive power. 
 O.A.S. diplomats neither accepted nor rejected Mr. Fujimori's plan. Instead, they encouraged him to take further steps in the direction of the "formal democracy" he scorns. They cited restoration of representative democracy and "full respect for the principle of separation of powers and the rule of law" as essential preconditions for unfreezing "international assistance and support."
Mr. Fujimori's modest concessions testify to the success of the Bush Administration's campaign to coordinate international financial pressure. Spain, Germany and Britain, though regrettably not Japan, have supported the O.A.S. stand. International development banks have put key loans on hold.
Apologists for the Peruvian regime cite polls showing strong support for Mr. Fujimori's coup. But the same surveys show that Peruvians now expect their President to keep his promises to revive the economy, defeat the Shining Path guerrillas and restore democracy.
After seven weeks of unrestricted power, Mr. Fujimori has little to show. By alienating international lenders he has jeopardized prospects for economic revival. An unprovoked air force attack against a U.S. intelligence plane has set back plans for cooperation against drug traffickers. Army brutality in Lima's shanty towns may even be creating new guerrilla recruits.
Peru's problems won't be conjured away by strong-armed rule or political stunts. But broadening a political system dominated by the white minority and pruning bureaucracy would help. Real reforms would quickly win hemispheric support. But so long as Mr. Fujimori prefers gimmickry and bombast, democratic states need to sustain, even heighten, their pressure.

HEADLINE: Letter: On Defense Spending;
A Budget for New World Realities

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I applaud "The War Democrats, 1992 Style," your editorial of May 13 on defense spending. Let me apprise The Times and its readers of an effort to achieve precisely the dramatic and justifiable reductions in military spending for which you call, an effort that was debated on the House floor for seven hours on March 5.
Recognizing that the cold war was over, the Warsaw Pact had disbanded and the former Soviet Union had significantly receded as a military threat, the Congressional Black Caucus, in alliance with the newly formed House Progressive Caucus, introduced "A Budget for New World Realities and for Rebuilding America." The proposal, lauded on both sides of the aisle for its technical excellence, rested on four cornerstones. 
 First, take down the artificial wall that Congress and the President erected between military and discretionary domestic spending, thereby allowing military budget savings to be shifted to meet urgent domestic needs. Second, reduce the defense budget authority by one-sixth, or $50 billion, in the first year, cancel many of the programs that The Times justifiably criticizes, and place the military budget on a glide path toward a 50 percent reduction within four years.
Third, embark upon an ambitious program of national renewal by allocating Federal resources for economic conversion planning, job training and veterans' adjustments, as well as by making the necessary investments in housing, transportation, education and health care that would both solve national problems and generate jobs and economic growth.
This proposal, supported by 77 Democratic members of the House, reflected a deep commitment to meet the total national security needs of our nation, needs that include a vibrant economy, housing, education and health care for our people, and a commitment to reach out to all of our citizens and insure that we fully include them in all our economic, social and political institutions.

HEADLINE: New York City Fighting to Keep 4 U.N. Agencies From Moving

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Four United Nations agencies are considering offers to move out of New York City later in the decade -- three of them to Germany -- and Mayor David N. Dinkins and his top economic aides have mounted a major counteroffensive to stem the loss of thousands of jobs and millions of dollars to the city's hard-pressed economy, officials in New York and Bonn said yesterday.
City officials said the departure of the agencies could mean the loss of 2,300 jobs, more than a third of the United Nations work force in New York, and up to $200 million in salaries, rents, supplies and other spending in New York -- a fifth of the $1 billion the United Nations contributes annually to the local economy. 
 Germany's offer to lure away three of the agencies represented a major effort to turn Bonn into an international hub of the post-cold-war world in a few years, when the capital of reunified Germany, with all its ministries and employees, is itself moved to Berlin. The offer also posed a daring challenge to New York as the world's pre-eminent international city.
"It is our position that the United Nations should stay united," Jennifer Kimball, a spokeswoman for Mayor Dinkins, said last night in confirming a report on the prospective moves that appears in today's edition of Crain's New York Business.
"We are taking these proposals very seriously," Ms. Kimball added. "We think that we will have success in persuading the United Nations agencies that New York is the premier world city, the international capital of business and finance and government and commerce, not to mention culture and art."
 
An Offer From New Rochelle
 One of the agencies, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, which has 950 employees and spends $10 million a year for rent alone in New York City, is considering an offer from the city of New Rochelle, in Westchester County, for space in a new 20-story office building for a rental of just $531,156 a year.
Crain's said that, in addition to the offer from New Rochelle, Unicef, which has its headquarters at 331 East 38th Street, was considering another site in Westchester and two others in Long Island City, Queens.
Founded in 1946, the agency assists developing countries to improve conditions for children, providing health, nutrition, and social welfare aid.
Ms. Kimball declined to give details of New York City's counteroffers, except to say that they were competitive.
Officials in Bonn said that the German government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl had offered three of the United Nations agencies -- the Development Program, the Fund for Population Activities and the Development Fund for Women -- rent-free accommodations in Bonn, $184 million in relocation costs and a substantial increase in Germany's voluntary contributions to the world organization.
City officials said the Development Program was the largest of the agencies, with 1,050 employees, while the Fund for Population Activities had 250 employees and the Development Fund for Women 30 employees. All three deal mainly with third world development.
To cushion the impact of the move on employees, the German government has also offered free German language lessons for those who make the move, officials in Germany said.
The reunification of Germany and the prospective move of the nation's capital to Berlin later in the decade would deprive Bonn of a large bureaucracy that has sustained the city throughout the postwar era.
 
Empty Buildings
 It would also leave Bonn with dozens of empty government buildings -- including a new Parliament, whose construction was begun before reunification vote last year -- and with thousands of empty homes and apartments now occupied by government officials and employees, not to mention the loss of business ranging from restaurant meals to office supplies.
To fill that void, the German government has mapped ambitious plans to develop Bonn as a center for international agencies, including United Nations and perhaps even European Community agencies. Mr. Kohl's government has already decided to leave the German Ministry for Development Aid, its foreign aid agency, in Bonn when the rest of the bureaucracy moves to Berlin.
The date of that move has not yet been determined, but the government has said it would probably be in time for Germany's 1998 Parliamentary elections.
Chancellor Kohl is believed to have made the German offer to the United Nations agencies on May 5, when he was in New York to speak at a convention of American newspaper publishers. Mr. Kohl is scheduled to be in New York again from June 6 to June 9 to meet with Jewish leaders and attend to other nonstate business.
 
The Argument to Stay
 Crain's said the three agencies considering Germany's offer now pay a total of $14 million a year in rent to landlords in New York.
Ms. Kimball said that Mr. Sullivan was "personally charged with overseeing the efforts to keep the United Nations agencies in New York City." Mr. Sullivan replaced Deputy Mayor Sally Hernandez-Pinero, who became chairman of the city Housing Authority, and assumed office on May 1, shortly before City Hall learned the city was in danger of losing major agencies of the United Nations.
That the city suddenly finds itself in competition with a foreign government is "not really surprising," she said. "New York City regularly competes with London, Paris, Hamburg, Bonn and other cities because we are an international city," she said. "And because we are an international city, we like to think the nations of the world look to New York City first."

HEADLINE: SWITCHING POLICY, U.S. WILL RETURN REFUGEES TO HAITI

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., May 24

 BODY:
The White House significantly toughened its efforts today to discourage a flood of Haitian refugees to the United States, saying it had authorized the Coast Guard to halt all boats carrying the refugees from their homeland and to escort them back to Haiti.
The decision, issued in the form of an executive order by President Bush, departs from a policy adopted only on Thursday to stop picking up Haitians from boats unless the vessels were in imminent danger of sinking. 
 Administration officials have said the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the holding site for Haitians seeking asylum in this country, is already overflowing with more than 12,000 refugees.
 
Order Issued From Maine
 The President issued the order from his vacation home here after concluding that no alternatives for housing additional Haitian refugees were available, the White House said.
It is widely assumed that Mr. Bush acted out of concern that southern Florida would be overwhelmed by a surge in Haitian boat people and that some unseaworthy boats would sink unless they were forced back to port.
Tens of thousands of people have tried to flee from Haiti since September, when the military overthrew the democratically elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
The exodus increased, as did the poor Caribbean country's economic misery, after the Organization of American States imposed an embargo against Haiti in October to press for Father Aristide's return to power.
 
Not Likely a Deterrent
 The new policy seems unlikely to deter departures by the Haitians, who appear determined to escape widening military repression and the food shortage resulting from the embargo. [Page 4.]
The White House action was immediately challenged by human rights groups and by legal groups representing Haitian refugees. Its practical effect may be to return fleeing Haitians without first determining whether they have good cause to be granted political asylum, a principle enshrined in a United Nations convention on the treatment of refugees and forcefully advocated by the White House in the past.
Arthur C. Helton, director of the refugee project of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, called Mr. Bush's order a "gross violation of international law."
"This is as wrong as it gets in terms of international refugee law," Mr. Helton said. "Congress must intervene to provide recourse to the boat people."
A White House spokeswoman, Judy Smith, said the new order covered all Haitians trying to flee to the United States without permission.
Commanders of Coast Guard vessels will also have discretion to take aboard Haitians who are experiencing medical emergencies or have what are believed to be legitimate claims for asylum.
Haitians who are escorted home will be told to apply for entry at the United States Embassy in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, once they are returned to the island, the White House said.
The policy of allowing Haitians to apply at the embassy for refugee status and direct resettlement in the United States has existed since January. When it was first announced, diplomats expressed concern that the embassy's staff would be overwhelmed.
Refugee advocates said the policy would not help Haitians who live far from the capital because the fuel shortage caused by the embargo had crippled public transportation. Further, they said, people trying to reach the embassy would be vulnerable to reprisals by the authorities because their intent to leave would be obvious.
Haiti's military-backed Government has said it would not persecute refugees who follow those procedures. Ms. Smith said surveys by American officials in Haiti indicated that the Government was living up to that promise, but Haitians have told journalists of brutal repression at the hands of policemen and soldiers after being returned.
More than 10,000 Haitians have been picked up at sea by the Coast Guard this month, more than in any month since Father Aristide was ousted.
Until Thursday, the Government had rescued all boatloads of Haitians found in the Caribbean and escorted them to Guantanamo Bay, where they were held until their requests for asylum could be processed.
 
Immediate Criticism
 But that policy was abandoned on Thursday after Guantanamo was filled with more than 12,000 of the refugees. The order issued that day to assist only those boats that appeared to be in distress quickly led to charges by human rights groups that the Administration was acting heartlessly toward the fleeing Haitians, abandoning them to the elements instead of addressing the conditions that caused them to seek refuge.
Administration officials disputed that tonight, saying that Haitians could seek asylum in nations around the world or could walk across the border, to the Dominican Republic, Haiti's neighbor on the island of Hispaniola, if they genuinely feared persecution.
Ms. Smith said the order gives Attorney General William P. Barr the option to grant asylum to selected refugees.
The Administration finds itself caught in an unpleasant political and diplomatic predicament over the situation in Haiti, unwilling to easily accommodate the huge influx of refugees streaming toward Florida, but hesitant to tempt further criticism by refusing to give them at least temporary asylum.
The majority of Haitians seeking refuge here are looking to escape crushing poverty, not political persecution.
The White House sought today to cast its actions in humanitarian terms, saying that the Coast Guard had picked up 34,000 Haitians in the Caribbean since September. Of those, about 9,000 have been allowed to pursue claims of political asylum, 6,000 of them in the United States.
The action today does not change American policy toward Haiti, the White House spokeswoman asserted, because "we have long sought to discourage Haitians from taking to unseaworthy vessels to emigrate to the United States," she said.
 
Hong Kong Comparison
 Only last week, the Administration noted, 18 Haitians had drowned when their leaky boat sank during an attempt to make the arduous sail to the American mainland.
But the new American position is likely to be compared to the White House's own recent condemnations of the British in Hong Kong and of some Asian nations, like Malaysia, for their refusal to accept as refugees boatloads of people fleeing Vietnam.

HEADLINE: Tough Choices On Campus -- A special report.;
Short of Money, Columbia Weighs How Best to Change

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Columbia University's 238th year may have ended officially earlier this month with a regal commencement graced by the presence of Katharine Hepburn. But it was clear from the fliers that students handed out near Delacorte Gate on 116th Street afterwards that the troubles that rocked the university this year are far from over.
"Do you know where your money goes?" read the flier given to proud parents and future alumni donors still in their caps and gowns. It stated that after increasing President Michael I. Sovern's salary and benefits to over $400,000, and stenciling the foyers of faculty housing in gold, Columbia's administration "had the audacity" to limit student financial aid and make other cuts to help close a $50 million budget shortfall. 
 "This was to let them know they're not going to have any place to rest," said M. Todd Chretien, a junior majoring in history who was handing out the fliers.
Columbia has suffered many such uncomfortable moments in this year of hard times, and it was not alone. From Yale to Stanford, many of the nation's elite universities are suffering under the weight of reduced government spending, a sagging economy and increasing demands on all the services universities have traditionally provided.
In addition, universities are under great scrutiny over how they charge the Government for federally sponsored research; just last week Federal auditors discovered that Columbia had destroyed certain records that were being reviewed for improprieties.
 
A Quite Public Dispute
 But unlike the struggles at other universities, Columbia's have been played out in public on an unusual scale that included strident attacks by a large segment of the faculty on Mr. Sovern and his administration.
Mr. Sovern maintains the support of the university's board of trustees and many of the faculty. And not all is bleak at the school: last year the university hired two Nobel laureates, saw applications rise in every one of its schools, and introduced innovative new curriculums at the medical and business schools.
Mr. Sovern says he is taking the current troubles as an opportunity to look at the kind of things Columbia can do best in the long term.
"I don't think that the changes are likely to be the sort that anyone outside of the institution will see," Mr. Sovern said. "Significant changes will occur, not because we have to deal with the shortfalls, but because we need to reallocate in order to do new things."
"To deal with existing budget problems that come to something on the order of 5 or 10 percent is not something that requires you to go to the heart of the enterprise."
Although the belt-tightening at Columbia is so far not as severe as the measures being considered at Yale, which include the elimination of several departments and consolidation of several others, the situation at Columbia has created the fear among some faculty members and students that the university is in danger of losing the momentum it established in rebounding from the problems it faced in the 1960's and 70's.
In fact the student protests of 1968 and New York's fiscal problems in the mid-70's so damaged Columbia's ability to raise money and attract the best students and faculty that it is not uncommon to hear people at the university talk, guardedly, about Columbia's glory years as those preceding the revolts.
"Many departments now are right on the brink of becoming world-class departments again," said Katherine S. Newman, an associate professor of anthropology who is chairwoman-elect of the executive committee of the faculty of arts and sciences, "only to have their advantages erode under these costs factors."
 
Going Into the Endowment
 Columbia has already had to make $35 million in cuts to reduce a projected $50 million shortfall in the 1992-93 budget to a more-manageable $15 million deficit that will be covered by dipping into the university's $1.5 billion endowment. Spending endowment principal is considered a last resort because it reduces the money, derived from interest, that will be available in future years for scholarships, salaries and construction.
For the 1993-1994 academic year, Columbia will again have to cut deep, this time trimming $72 million to bring its first $1 billion budget into the same range of acceptable deficit of $15 million, which will also come from the endowment principal.
While the effects of the budget problem might not be immediately apparent to the entering freshman class, Columbia itself will be different in many ways. All of its schools have had to make some cuts, but the most noticeable have been in arts and sciences programs. These include:
*The crowded 36-acre campus will be even more crowded. There will be 50 additional undergraduates and 60 additional graduate students, admitted essentially for their tuition.
*Faculty positions will be cut 8.6 percent, bringing the faculty down to about where it was in 1978. Combined with the additional students being admitted, this is likely to make some classes more crowded. The faculty will also be getting slightly smaller raises than they had expected, saving about $500,000.
*Cuts will be made in the support staff that students rely on for help with housing, employment and guidance. The extent of the cuts will not be known until the Board of Trustees votes on the budget next month.
*While severe financial aid cuts have been delayed for one year, scholarship students will still make a sacrifice: their two trips home have been cut to one. Also, they will spend the 1992-93 academic year not knowing what will happen to their aid the next year.
*The $60-million renovation of Butler Library has been delayed indefinitely.
 
The Questions
A Tough Decade, A Different Future
 Columbia's financial squeeze is expected to last through the rest of the decade, presenting the university with a host of questions.
With subjects like geography and linguistics already eliminated, should other traditional subjects be dropped to make room for advances in new fields like neurobiology or computer science? Should other schools, besides Library Services, which graduated its last 104 students this month and now is being dismantled after 66 years, also be closed?
Should Columbia emphasize undergraduate teaching over high-powered research? How will it continue to attract the most prominent faculty? Do its professional schools, especially the ones like the School of Social Work, whose graduates often do not enter academic fields, detract from or add to the university's reputation as a world-class intellectual power?
Should Columbia capitalize on its full name -- Columbia University in the City of New York -- and use its talent more intimately in the city, or should it further embrace its growing international focus?
"What might emerge," said Martin Meisel, the departing vice president of arts and sciences, "is likely to be a very different institution."
Mr. Meisel is a member of a strategic planning committee, composed of 45 administrators, faculty and students, that is trying to chart the university's future. The members have only begun their work and have until January to make their first preliminary report.
 
Impact of Federal Cuts
 Many of the most vexing decisions about Columbia's future stem not from thorny philosophical debates over curriculum but the simple accounting of such items as health insurance. Insurance and other fringe benefits account for nearly 60 percent of the university's budget problems, said Jonathan R. Cole, the provost.
To cover soaring costs, Columbia took $28 million from spending on such things as clerical staff, the renovation of Butler Library and the employees who perform such student services as housing, employment and non-academic guidance.
The university has also been hurt by cuts in Federal and state government grants for student aid. In 1979-80, government grants accounted for $6.4 million in student aid, while Columbia's share was about $16.6 million. In the academic year that just ended, the government provided $6.8 million, while Columbia provided $54 million.
Such cutbacks, combined with rising costs and the loss of other government support, have had an impact on each of the university's 16 schools and divisions. The School of Business, for instance, has instituted a hiring freeze, halted equipment and furniture purchases and scaled back salary increases to less than 3 percent rather than the 7 or 8 percent that had been planned.
But the heaviest blows are falling in arts and sciences, which covers the undergraduate program, known as Columbia College, and the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of International and Public Affairs and the School of the Arts.
 
Seeking More Revenue
 Of all the schools, arts and sciences had the largest deficit, in large part because it receives few research grants. It is responsible for cutting costs or raising extra revenue to total $5.1 million of the $35 million that Columbia is attempting to remove from its shortfall. Even so, arts and sciences will have a an undetermined deficit on its $150 million budget.
The university originally proposed cutting $1.1 million in financial aid for undergraduates in Columbia College, but students protested so strongly, including a brief occupation of an administrative office, that a one-year emergency plan was developed to delay the cuts. Aid will still be cut in some ways, including the cutback in trips home. And the issue is not dead.
The other half of the budget plan in arts and sciences is several attempts to bring in more money by increasing the size of the incoming class at Columbia College from 800 to about 850, increasing the number of masters-only degree programs, and renegotiating the rate Columbia pays Barnard College for its students who take a course there.
Each of those items will have an impact on Columbia but no one yet knows what, cumulatively, they will mean for the university. Take for instance the proposal to increase the masters programs. Roger S. Bagnall, dean of the graduate school of arts and sciences, said it might be possible to bring in 50 or 60 graduate students who will go after a one-year or two-year master's degrees and are willing to pay the $16,676 it costs annually without financial aid.
But doing so, Mr. Bagnall said, raises serious academic questions. The market for people with such degrees is limited, for today nearly all universities insist that faculty members have a Ph.D.
In the humanities, Columbia has essentially eliminated all of its masters-only programs and focused its attention on its Ph.D. candidates. Mr. Bagnall said that only about 800 of 3,300 graduate students in the school are pursuing their masters without planning to go on for a doctorate.
Some professors are worried that the pressure for revenue could make Columbia resemble a degree mill. David N. Damrosch, an associate professor of English, said that a survey of the first 400 applications to the graduate program this year showed only two were for masters-only; the rest intended to go for the Ph.D.
"This clearly becomes a problem if it's perceived as an absolute lowering of quality for the sake of drawing income for the university," Mr. Damrosch said.
 
The Furor
A Worried Faculty And A Public Debate
 Compact as the Columbia campus is, with new buildings like computer science squeezed under existing buildings, emotions spread quickly. For most of the year the financial crisis and the suggestions for dealing with it produced concern and mistrust in virtually every meeting and every office.
Those feelings first surfaced last November, when, just before the initial meeting of the newly organized faculty of arts and sciences, the chairmen of the 26 academic departments refused to go along with any budget cuts that they saw as threatening academic excellence.
The new organization, which represents Columbia's 500 arts and sciences faculty members, quickly took the lead in prodding the university administration to address Columbia's financial situation. The group criticized Mr. Sovern and Mr. Cole, saying they moved too slowly.
Discontent mounted all year, culminating in the faculty's executive committee year-end report, which stated: "Our consultations with faculty in the arts and sciences suggest that the competence of the administration is being questioned and that trust is low."
Those consultations uncovered a laundry list of worries that was presented in the year-end report under the title "Slouching Toward Competitive Disadvantage." The concerns ranged from deteriorating classrooms to fears that Columbia's ability to recruit and retain faculty was being hurt by the financial problems.
"We lost a recruit in my department last year to the University of Michigan," said Professor Newman, of the anthropology department. "It was someone with two school-age daughters and we just couldn't offer him the salary it took to bring him here." Even though the cost of living in New York is among the highest in the nation, average faculty salaries at Columbia often trail those of other major universities.
The committee's report was matched, a few days later, by an eight-page letter signed by four members of the board of trustees. The letter took a strident tone, calling the faculty report a "misrepresentation of the Administration's conduct of the University's business."
The feud seemed to reach a peak on April 29, when the arts and sciences faculty held its last meeting of the year. Professors were expected to take a vote of no-confidence, a largely symbolic act but one that could have made it difficult for Mr. Sovern to govern effectively.
In the end, the showdown fizzled. No vote of confidence was ever taken, most likely because there was not sufficient faculty support for such a drastic measure. Instead, the professors unanimously approved a series of resolutions that more gently expressed their concerns.
Still, damage was done and resentment arose within the university, especially among those who felt that the arts and sciences faculty members did not adequately represent the feelings of Columbia's entire 5,700-member faculty.
Joan Konner, dean of the Graduate School of Journalism, was one who did not approve of the arts and sciences action.
"The way they chose of addressing serious issues is a method of last resort, not first resort," she said.
Lance Liebman, dean of the School of Law, said some of the faculty's actions were inappropriate. "There was definitely a feeling among the deans of a number of schools that the showdown scenario was not in the best interest of Columbia," he said.
 
Not President's Favorite Year
 The trustees watched the drama unfold.
"It's not unusual when there are problems to want to shoot the messenger," said Gertrude G. Michelson, chairwoman of the board of trustees, said of the faculty group's action.
As for Mr. Sovern and the challenge to his tenure, Mrs. Michelson said: "Without reservation, the trustees have great confidence in Mr. Sovern's leadership."
The coming year will be Mr. Sovern's 13th -- twice as long as the average tenure today for a university president. In a recent interview he said even he has heard talk on campus that with Columbia's $1.15 billion fund-raising campaign one-half met, and the last major campus construction project, the new engineering building, almost completed, he will step down before the end of the year to spend more time with his wife, Joan, who is battling cancer.
Mr. Sovern, a lanky 60-year-old lawyer who formerly had been dean of Columbia's law school, then provost, is known as a prodigious fund raiser, but not a scholar.
In his long term, Mr. Sovern has developed a reputation as a president capable of getting things done. Since 1980, Columbia has purchased the 6-millionth book in Butler Library, completed a new university-wide heating plant, and expanded its focus as an international center (16 per cent of its students come from other nations) and a center for the arts.
Mr. Sovern said the last year was "not my favorite," and he admitted that he was worn out by the budget haggling.
But as for retirement, which many of his opponents on the faculty have pushed for, he said, "I have no present intention to do that."
 
The Future
Intense Struggle To Decide
 As Columbia moves uneasily into the summer, Mr. Sovern and Mr. Cole are putting much weight on the deliberations of the strategic planning committee. The 45-member panel will meet in smaller groups to deal with next year's budget, the question of financial aid and a new budget system that will bring greater control to Columbia's accounting methods.
"They will sharpen the focus of the university as we move toward the 21st century," Mr. Cole said, "and they will define more clearly than we have in past what we can and should be doing with distinction and what areas of knowledge might be left to other universities to develop."
Not everyone shares Mr. Cole's optimism. Donald C. Hood, the departing chairman of the executive committee in the arts and sciences faculty, and the firebrand of the faculty uprising, said the planning committee was too big, too slow in starting and too connected to the administration to do the job it has been given.
For Columbia, and for many major universities, retrenchment is an almost unknown area.
No more. New York has always been the university's strength but increasingly the urban setting has brought problems. Recruiting can be difficult and the need to expand and build new buildings to accommodate new knowledge is a constant obstacle. Edward Botwinick, a trustee, said the new $65 million engineering building, which will open in September, was twice as expensive to build in New York as it would have been on a suburban campus like Princeton's.
Other issues remain. The Federal Government is likely to change the way Columbia and a handful of other universities pay for tuition remission for graduate research assistants, a change that would cost the university more than $5 million.
And there are academic issues, concerning the curriculum and new scholarship, an issue heightened recently by the resignation of Carolyn G. Heilbrun, a distinguished professor of English, who accused Columbia of failing to support feminist views.
Over all, say many at Columbia, the confrontations and setbacks of the last year have brought about a major change, one in which far more attention is being paid to the university as a whole, rather than to the many individual parts.
"Our problems are problems of will rather than problems of complexity," said Meyer Feldberg, dean of the School of Business, which has reversed many years of deficits by making the kinds of program cuts on a small scale that the university must make on a much larger one.
"The financial problems at Columbia are not intractable," he said. "We've got to be prepared to make a lot of tough decisions."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 5, 1992, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 25 about Columbia University misstated the extent of a cut in faculty positions next year. It is a 2 percent cut, completing an 8.6 percent reduction since 1985. The article also referred imprecisely to uncertainty about student financial aid. Changes in the financial aid policy would not affect enrolled students already receiving such aid.

HEADLINE: Wary Recruits: Immigrants Vie for Day Jobs

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
The men begin to gather on the squalid Brooklyn street corner shortly after dawn. Many wear the distinctive, shabby gray clothes of Eastern Europe, as drab as the landscape of battered cars, auto repair shops and parking lots. Quickly, their numbers swell to more than 100.
Miles away in Queens, the Korean-run fruit markets are just beginning to open, the first of the shops to pull up their shutters. But in a church parking lot, men in stained sweatshirts and baseball caps, mostly from El Salvador, are already assembled. 
 And on Long Island, along a shaded road that winds up to the North Shore past condominium developments and frame homes, knots of three and four men suddenly appear on the corners leading into Glen Cove. Farther on, a crowd of about 30 men has gathered in the parking lot of Carmen's Deli.
They are all waiting for work.
Across the New York metropolitan region, urban migrant workers -- most of them immigrants, nearly all of them desperate -- line up for hours each day, waiting for trucks or vans to pick them up for unskilled and bottom-dollar jobs in construction, demolition, moving, landscaping, anything.
No one is certain how many people are struggling to get by this way, earning some semblance of a living through occasional hard labor. Much of their cash pay goes for food and rent in squalid communal apartments with six people or more to a room, and they scrimp to send money to families left behind.
They are the most exploitable of laborers -- often undocumented and afraid of authority, unable to speak English and willing to work for less than the minimum wage -- members of a vast underground army seeking a foothold in a city where their glittering American dreams have been cut short by a faltering economy.
Most of the workers refuse to give their full names. They beg that the exact locations of their street corners be kept secret, some fearing a crackdown by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, others worried that more workers will show up and increase the competition.
Their employers change daily. Their names, too, are rarely learned.
"Sometimes they say, 'I'll pay you tomorrow,' and they never come," said a 32-year-old Honduran immigrant who waits every day at 6 A.M. on Cedar Swamp Road in Glen Cove. "Sometimes you work from 7 A.M. to 7 P.M., and they pay you $40. But we need it."
The street corner phenomenon sprang up on the West Coast, where laborers crossed the border from Mexico. But over the last two years at least six such sites have appeared in Brooklyn and Queens, and many more exist on Long Island and in New Jersey and Westchester and Rockland Counties.
 
Cities Try to Respond
 New York City officials and immigrant-rights groups attribute the Depression-style lineup for jobs partly to economic factors -- the recession and, more broadly, the loss of the manufacturing jobs that sustained earlier waves of immigrants -- and to the 1986 Federal immigration law, which imposed sanctions on employers who gave jobs to illegal immigrants. City officials say the law drove the undocumented underground, where they are less likely to face a check for working papers.
With the pickup points drawing growing crowds, municipalities have responded in varying ways.
In New York City, the Dinkins administration recently approached the International Ladies Garment Workers Union to see if the union would help organize the workers.
"It's definitely not going to go away," said Elizabeth Aivars, director of the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs. "It's a concern for this administration to help them organize so they have a sense of someone backing them, protecting their labor rights when they get abused."
 
The 'Pull' Factor
 In Glen Cove, the City Council attempted to shut down the local hiring site by passing an ordinance in 1990 banning people from seeking work in public. But the workers still gather outside Carmen's, and the city has gone into mediation with groups that sued to overturn the ordinance.
William S. Slattery, director of the New York district of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said he was uncertain whether the sanctions levied by his office under the 1986 law drove illegal immigrants onto the street corners. But if they did, he added, "I would salute that."
He said the law was intended to eliminate the work enticements that "pull" illegal immigrants to cities like New York. "We're hoping that word goes back home that there is no more 'pull' factor, that if you come up here you'll be standing on the street corner with us," he said.
But the 32-year-old Honduran immigrant who waits every day in Glen Cove has saved almost nothing in five years in the United States and says he cannot face returning home to Tegucigalpa empty-handed.
"I want to come back to my country, but you know, I want to take something," he said. "I came by myself, my family's in my country, and I'm supposed to support it. But like this, how can I do it? I need a permanent job."
 
Off the Books
 The work is virtually all off the books. The legal status of the laborers varies from those with full work authorization, those who have the right to remain in America temporarily, and those who are undocumented.
The workers gather informally by nationality, the sites spread by word of mouth. The Borough Park section of Brooklyn is the province of Eastern Europe, drawing workers from Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Czechoslovakia and Poland. In Flushing, Queens, Salvadorans have taken up a spot where Irish and Italian day laborers once stood during earlier waves of immigration. In Woodside, Queens, Central and South Americans gather near businesses that draw a steady stream of contractors.
Some immigrant-rights advocates put their numbers in New York City well into the thousands. They are people like Edgardo Nunez, 27, who tries to send money home for his daughter in El Salvador but has very little left after he buys food and pays rent. There is the 27-year-old man who thought he had outsmarted both the Russian and American immigration bureaucracies by getting to America on a visitor's visa. Only when he was here did he find out that one needs a Social Security number or a green card to work legally.
 
Underside of Capitalism
 Their languages vary from Spanish to Russian to Polish, but their stories are largely the same. They tell of employers who promise three days of work but don't appear on the last day, payday; they mention employers who promise $5 an hour, but then shortchange the workers.
"To an American, his word is nothing," said a bitter Russian who has seen the underside of capitalism at the Brooklyn street corner.
In the laborers' world of reduced expectations, a windfall is a three-month or four-month job. More often work comes only once or twice a week. In Brooklyn and Queens a good week can produce $120. In Glen Cove, where the competition is less intense, a worker may make $300 a week in the peak landscaping season.
The men know little about their employers, some of whom appear to be immigrants themselves who have managed to move further up the economic ladder. At the Flushing site, a van pulled up recently, the driver offering a job installing air-conditioning equipment. His English was no better than the laborers'.
"What you pay now?" a worker asked.
"What you want?" asked the driver.
The salary was set at $60 a day, the hours left unspecified.
 
Health and Safety Concerns
 Immigrant advocacy groups say they have heard of cases where the men are hauled off to remove asbestos without proper protection or training. "Cheap labor doesn't necessarily stop at wages," said Brian O'Dwyer, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in immigration cases. "Sometimes wages aren't at first blush very bad. What is very bad is of course that there are no benefits provided, health or welfare or pension, and more importantly, the safety standards on these buildings are just abysmal."
With about 50 percent of their members out of work, construction unions are ambivalent about helping the day laborers. They have pressured the city and state to make sure that prevailing wage laws are followed by all subcontractors on public work sites and have complained to the I.N.S. about the use of undocumented workers in construction.
The International Ladies Garment Workers Union has only begun considering the possibility of working with the laborers. Jeff Hermanson, director of organization, said he was unsure whether it was viable to organize labor that was constantly changing employers and job sites.
The workers have been met with relative indifference in Borough Park, but in Flushing, angry residents and merchants complained that they were a nuisance, causing traffic tie-ups and harassing passers-by.
In Flushing, the local community board, as well as representatives of the Queens Borough President, Claire Shulman, and the New York City Commission on Human Rights helped negotiate a compromise that moved the job hunters off a commercial strip of Northern Boulevard and into the parking lot of St. John Vianney Roman Catholic Church, where they are allowed to stay until 10 A.M.
The Flushing workers have taken their first tentative steps toward organization. They now mark down the license numbers of contractors to identify them if someone is cheated of his pay. They also refuse to work for less than $60 a day.
Still, they live barely a step above poverty. One 43-year-old man from El Salvador is a regular in the lot, arriving at dawn from the studio apartment he shares with five others. He says he has not had steady work since January, and he has not been able to send home money to support his wife and seven children.
He would like to go home, but he has no money to repay his brother what he borrowed to make the trek across the Mexican border. As he stands in the lot, he swears that someday he will warn others against the illusion of wealth in the United States.
"Don't be crazy," he will say. "It's a lie."

HEADLINE: Strongest U.S. Environment Law May Become Endangered Species

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, May 25

 BODY:
The American bald eagle sits on one side of the dollar bill and in tall trees of every state in the union but Hawaii. It was not always so, of course. A series of Government actions that gave legal protection to animals on the verge of extinction has been largely responsible for bringing the national symbol back to the skies of America.
By contrast, a rare California songbird that lives in the scrub brush around Los Angeles is virtually unknown outside of birdwatcher circles, but it has given fits to the faltering house-building industry. If anything, the bird, the gnat catcher, is a symbol of a law that protects birds at the expense of subdivisions. 
 The fate of the eagle and the gnat catcher may depend in large part on what happens to the Endangered Species Act, the nation's most powerful environmental law. Enacted in 1973 with the strong support of President Richard M. Nixon, the act faces a fight this year in Congress in which the law will either be renewed or be allowed to expire.
 
Compromise in Most Cases
 Though the vote may be delayed, the act has become the prime target for a major backlash against environmental protection.
But beyond the polarized words in Congress and headlines over spotted owls and lost logging jobs here in the Pacific Northwest, a close look at the record shows that the act has led to surprisingly few confrontations between man and nature. Most commercial or Government projects proposed for areas with rare species have in fact been allowed to go forward, to the benefit of both.
But critics of the act, led by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., say it is a gross impediment to economic progress and needs to be changed, or gutted altogether. An alliance of timber, ranching, mining and farming interests has lined up in Congress to push for dismantling the act.
On the other side, a powerful lobby of the nation's major environmental groups have made preservation of the Endangered Species Act an election-year rallying cry. They say the law, with its simple and direct mandate backed by a 1978 Supreme Court ruling upholding the act's constitutionality, is a tool to save vanishing wild places as well as the plants and animals that live there.
The idea behind the act was to maintain some of the nation's natural diversity and avoid a future glutted with little more than pigeons, beetles and rats. In 19 years, 727 species, nearly half of them plants, have been listed as threatened or endangered. Of the species that were on the list, 16 have been taken off: 7 of them have become extinct, and 9 have flourished to the point of full recovery. At least 3,000 species are candidates for the list.
The bald eagle was nearly extinct in the mid-1960's but has bounced back to number 6,000 in the contiguous United States. Discussions are under way to take the bird off the list in some states.
Once a species is listed, the law protects it against manmade encroachment, no matter what the cost. Thus, snail darters delayed construction of a $100 million dam in Tennessee, grizzly bears stopped construction of roads in Montana, sea turtles changed the shrimping industry in the Gulf states, owls curbed the extensive logging here in the Northwest and smelt took away water from farmers in California's Central Valley.
 
700 Species Saved
 But these are the exceptions. From 1987 to 1991, the Government calculated that 34,203 projects were proposed in areas where there was a potential to harm endangered species. In each case, the developer had to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service, and perhaps slightly modify the project, before going ahead. In only 367 cases did the Government say that the project would harm a species. And only 18 of those projects were actually canceled or stopped because of incompatibility with the act.
"You wouldn't know it by what we've been hearing lately, but the Endangered Species Act has been very successful," said John C. Sawhill, President of the Nature Conservancy, a private group that buys and protects land for wildlife. "In all but but a few cases, people have been able to work things out without a loss of jobs. And in that time, we have kept at least 700 plant and animal species from going under."
But in the cases that have led to economic sacrifice, the act has been vilified as an instrument of big government that sacrifices human interests to those of animals.
"If you listed all the species that are waiting to go on the list, you would shut down the natural resource industry in this country," said Charlie Jans, chairman of the Oregon Lands Coalition, a citizens group heavily financed by the timber industry. "The flaw in the act is it makes no provision for people or economics."
On average for the last decade, the Government has added about 50 new species to the list every year. To go beyond that pace would require the kind of financing that few political leaders have advocated. It would cost an average of about $460 million a year over 10 years to come up with recovery plans for all the species that are candidates for protection, one Government study has found. As it is, the Fish and Wildlife Service operates on an annual budget of about $60 million.
 
Forcing Tough Decisions
 In some more extreme cases, the heavy restrictions on development have come about because Federal courts, acting on lawsuits brought by environmentalists, have forced the Government's hand.
"The Endangered Species Act is the pit bull of environmental laws," said Donald Barry, a vice president of the World Wildlife Fund. "It's short, compact and has a hell of a set of teeth. Because of its teeth, the act can force people to make the kind of tough political decisions they wouldn't normally make."
As such, the law has been used as a surrogate by people who had other causes. The true intent of many people who want to save the northern spotted owl is to protect ancient forests and the dozens of other species that depend on them. Similarly, by saving salmon on the Columbia River or delta smelt in the Sacramento, the law is forcing a reversal of decades-old Federal water policy away from subsidies to farmers and toward protection of fish.
Referring to the billions in Federal subsidies given to Columbia River water users while one of the world's great salmon runs dwindled nearly to extinction, Mr. Barry said: "It reminds me of a drunk at the bar who runs up a 50-year tab, and then somebody comes along and says the tab is due. That tab is what we have done to the fish."
 
Protecting Popular Animals
 In a way, the Endangered Species Act represents the revenge of nature. But critics point out that the act was never intended to be a weapon to change the behavior of entire industries. What President Nixon and other early backers had in mind was the protection of big creatures like grizzly bears and grey whales.
The California gnat catcher, which has held up construction of housing projects because it nests in areas coveted by developers, or the Oregon silverspot butterfly, which likes the same coastal areas desired by golf course designers, are seldom evoked by the act's most passionate defenders.
Some biologists, saying it is impossible to save the thousands of species facing extinction, have urged that the Government set up a priority list of plants or animals to be saved. While this could lead to popularity contests, with cuddly and lovable creatures winning out over ugly and unknown animals, it would at least get rid of the random nature of the law.
Another approach would be to save entire ecosystems rather than focusing on the individual species that reside in them. By continuing to take a species-by-species approach to protecting plants and wildlife, the country faces years of political gridlock and court actions, some Goverment officials and members of Congress say. But if the entire ecology of a region -- including the human beings who work there -- are considered for preservation, there would be much less conflict, these leaders argue.
This approach is similar to that taken by the Nature Conservancy, which has bought large working ranches in the West and managed to allow commercial grazing to continue while protecting rare plants and animals. "What we need is a new approach, taking into account exactly what it is we are trying to save and the people who work there," said Representative Jolene Unsoeld, a Washington Democrat whose district includes some of the most heavily logged national forests in the country. "What we have had so far is solution by press release."
Both Democrats and Republicans are critical of the position taken by the Bush Administration, which once supported the Endangered Species Act but now appears intent on crippling it.
On May 14, Mr. Lujan disclosed a plan, largely designed by Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, that would allow the spotted owl to become extinct in areas of Washington State containing Olympic and North Cascades National Parks. Under the plan, owls would be captured and moved south to other Federal land so logging could continue around the parks.
The plan would need the approval of Congress, but the dean of Republican political leaders from the Northwest, Senator Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, dismissed the Administration's latest plan as "irrelevant" and gives it little chance of passing.
Mr. Lujan has repeatedly questioned the value of saving different endangered species -- even though he is charged by law with protecting them. He voted last week, with a Cabinet-level committee known informally as the God Squad, to allow logging to go ahead on 1,200 acres of Federal land in Oregon where it could lead to the demise of the spotted owl in that area.
"Of course, I'm the protector of endangered species, but by the same token, I must make resources available to the American public," he said in an interview.
In the political climate of a Presidential election year, the reauthorization fight over the Endangered Species Act will probably be put off until next year, leaders in Congress say. But even if the renewal battle is put off, the act requires financing from Congress this year, and a fight over its merits could develop in budget committees this summer.
Senator Hatfield, who was the original sponsor of the act in 1972, remains a staunch backer of the law, even though it has hit his state harder than any other. He said he would like to see some changes in the act, for example, having the Government pay for retraining and employment counseling for people who lose their jobs as a result of listing a species as endangered.
"If we don't put back some part of the human element, the act will be gutted," Mr. Hatfield said. "It does not need to be overhauled, it just needs to be fine-tuned."

HEADLINE: GENE-ALTERED FOOD HELD BY THE F.D.A. TO POSE LITTLE RISK

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
In a long-awaited policy statement, the Federal Government plans to announce that foods developed through biotechnology are not inherently dangerous and, except in rare cases, should not require extraordinary testing and regulation before going on the market.
Some critics of genetically engineered foods have argued that they pose new safety risks and any that contain new substances should go through the extensive testing required of new food additives. In addition, they say, any such food sold to the public should be labeled so that consumers can identify it. 
 By contrast, the new policy that is to be adopted by the Food and Drug Administration holds that genetically engineered foods should be regulated just like ordinary ones unless they contain ingredients not usual for the product.
 
Stiffer Rules for Allergens
 Under the new policy, which is to be announced Tuesday by Vice President Dan Quayle and officials of the Health and Human Services Department, which includes the F.D.A., special review would be required only when specific safety issues are raised. For example, a review would be necessary if the gene for peanut protein, to which some people are allergic, is inserted into other foods.
Government officials say scientific evidence does not indicate that special precautions are warranted in most cases of gene-altered foods, and the new policy outlines the special circumstances that would require testing and regulation before a product goes on the market.
Officials of the Federal agency said the core of the policy was based on science and the principle that industry should have to consult the agency only on decidedly novel components of food before marketing a product.
The new policy statement was requested by the budding biotechnology industry, which has several types of genetically engineered produce almost ready for market.
 
Protection From Lawsuits
 According to the industry, more than a dozen companies in the United States have developed a total of almost 70 different crops, including cucumbers, potatoes and cantaloupes, that contain new proteins, enzymes or other substances that enhance their quality. Genetic technology holds the promise of producing foods that are more nutritious, tastier and longer-lasting while requiring less fertilizer and pesticide.
One of the first of the new products consumers are likely to see is a tomato developed by Calgene Inc., of Davis, Calif., that is endowed with an extra gene that confers a longer shelf life by delaying excessive ripening. Last November, Calgene became the first company to ask voluntarily for the Federal agency to evaluate a genetically altered food.
"The industry has asked F.D.A. for a policy because it wants to say to the public that the F.D.A. knows these products and stands by their safety," said a senior agency official who spoke on condition that he not be identified. "Industry wants the policy to help with product acceptability and, to an extent, for liability protection. It helps to say you are in compliance with Government regulations."
The debate over genetically engineered foods has continued for more than a decade. But many of the initial concerns raised by critics now seem less formidable and, after extensive discussion, a consensus has developed in favor of moving ahead with the technology, although with appropriate precautions.
The Federal agency's policy, which would go into effect when published in The Federal Register, was spurred by the President's Council on Competitiveness, a group headed by Vice President Quayle that is charged with reducing regulations that it believes hamper American industry.
The policy is expected to serve as a model for similar statements being prepared by other agencies that regulate the biotechnology industry, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Agriculture Department, said a White House official who spoke on the condition that he not be identified.
 
Jurisdiction of Agencies
 Other genetically altered food products, like livestock, fish and poultry, will be regulated by the Agriculture Department, while the environmental agency will review items like genetically engineered pesticides and disease resistant plants.
Uncertainty over how the Government might regulate the products of genetic engineering is one of the last hurdles keeping the American biotechnology industry from releasing a flood of food and plant products and maintaining its lead over international rivals in the field, the White House official said.
The food policy closely follows the recommendations and rationale of a biotechnology policy report released by the competitiveness council in February and endorsed by President Bush soon afterward. The White House policy said genetically altered organisms and products should not be assumed to be dangerous because of the techniques used to produce them.
For generations, plant scientists have manipulated genes and produced desired traits through selective breeding, and new gene-splicing techniques are a different way of doing the same things, the statement said.
Genetically changed organisms and products that differ only slightly from normal ones, a category that includes the great majority of products proposed so far, need not be regulated more than conventional products, the White House policy said.
 
Instances of Tougher Regulation
 In cases where safety questions are raised, Food and Drug Administration officials said, changes in food caused by genetic modification may be regulated under food-additives rules, which require premarket testing and approval. Safety questions would arise if modifications produced substances that were not substantially similar to things commonly found in food, like fats, proteins and carbohydrates, or if the new substances had no history of safe use in food.
The agency's policy would not require special labeling of foods produced through genetic manipulation unless, as with other food additives, the result is a change in a characteristic of the food that is noticeably different from what the consumer would expect, an agency official said.
"You would be concerned about allergens, for example," the official said. "If you transfer peanut protein to a tomato, you must state this because some people are severely allergic to peanuts."
Critics of genetically engineered foods said they opposed any policy that did not require extensive, pre-market testing of each new food and labeling to tell consumers what they were getting. Dr. Rebecca Goldburg of the Environmental Defense Fund said the F.D.A. policy was virtually abandoning regulation of new and untested foods.
"Genetic engineers are taking genes from bacteria, viruses and insects and adding them to fruits, grains and vegetables," Dr. Goldburg said. "They are producing foods that have never before been eaten by human beings. Without clear and consistent labeling of genetically engineered foods, consumers will have no idea what they are buying."
Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, an organization critical of genetic research and its applications, said he filed a legal petition with the agency last week asking that it require tight regulation of genetically engineered food. Mr. Rifkin said he would challenge the new policy in court because "it is inadequate and does not protect the consumer."

HEADLINE: Key West Journal;
Defying U.S. in Spirit of Hemingway

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KEY WEST, Fla., May 25

 BODY:
Last week two dozen Americans steered their boats across the 90 miles of ocean between Key West and Havana to compete for prizes like "The Old Man and the Sea Trophy" in a fishing tournament named for Ernest Hemingway.
By doing so, they defied a United States embargo against Cuba, in the spirit of another Hemingway work, "To Have and Have Not." In that novel, a Key West man risks his life and livelihood to conduct illegal business between the two island neighbors. 
 The competition, the 42d Ernest Hemingway International Billfish Classic Tournament, had been touted by Key West fisherman as an opportunity for a "good-will flotilla" that some thought would attract up to 50 American fishing boats.
But after a United States Treasury official called a public meeting two weeks before the tournament to tell fishermen they risked seizure of their boats, fines and possible prison sentences if they attended, only four American boats made the trip.
And when they returned here on Sunday, they were met on the docks by a special agent from the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control and given a long search.
Under the embargo, Americans may travel to Cuba but are prohibited from spending money there. Last month, the Bush Administration tightened the embargo, barring vessels that bring passengers or goods to or from Cuba from entering American ports.
Key West and Havana have long shared a common history, as their fish markets and cigar factories grew together. In the 1890's, the Cuban poet Jose Marti used Key West as a base to help plot Cuba's independence from Spain. Hemingway kept homes in Key West and Cuba and lent his name to the fishing tournament.
"In all the world, he liked the fishing in Cuba the best," said Gregorio Fuentes, the 94-year-old former skipper of Hemingway's yacht, Pilar.
Mr. Fuentes presented the award for the biggest marlin of the tournament to Dr. David Bregman, a heart surgeon from Tenafly, N.J., who keeps his boat, Heartmender, in Key West half the year.
No legal action has yet been taken against the fishermen.
Dr. Bregman, who has taught cardiology in Cuba since 1989 and fished the tournament two years before this year, said his hosts in Cuba make it possible for him not to spend any money there. "There's nothing I'm doing that the U.S. Government doesn't know about," he said.
People exempted from the embargo include journalists and those with family members in Cuba.
On the other three Key West boats, most passengers said they were journalists, including two members of local government committees that are investigating the effect on the Keys of political change in Cuba.
Many consider Cuba, with its beach and cultural attractions, a potential risk to Key West's tourism-dependent economy.
"You have to see it to really know what's going on," said Harry Powell, a panel member and a former Key West city commissioner, who rented a jeep and ventured out of Havana.
If the special agent, R. Richard Newcomb, director of the Treasury's foreign assets office, had not visited Key West, said Bill Kieldsen of Key West, he would have been at the tournament. "The whole tournament circuit would have gone," he said. "I got scared off."
Penalties for violating the embargo include fines up to $250,000, imprisonment up to 10 years and possible forfeiture of the vessel involved.
"I don't want to add any money to their economy," Mr. Kieldsen said, "but I'd love to explore the fishing."

HEADLINE: Baker Visits Georgia to Help a Friend

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TBILISI, Georgia, May 25

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d kept a promise today and came to this troubled capital to give a boost to an embattled old friend, Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
In one of those moments that happen mostly in films -- in this case, a 1950's movie set at a decrepit Stalinesque airport -- a heavy shower ended just as the Secretary's plane taxied toward a waiting crowd in dark suits. 
 "I welcome Mr. Baker to my native land," Mr. Shevardnadze said under still-leaden skies.
The former Soviet Foreign Minister, who was at Mikhail S. Gorbachev's side through the remaking of East-West relations, is now chairman of the Georgian State Council, an ad hoc Government that is fighting to lead the new nation out of civil war and economic disaster to elections in October.
 
An Important Anniversary
 The arrival of Mr. Baker on the eve of Georgia's national day, May 26, was very important, Aleksandr Chikvaidze, Georgia's Foreign Minister, told reporters on the plane from Lisbon, where he and Mr. Baker had attended an international meeting on aid to the former Soviet republics.
On May 26, 1918, Georgia declared its independence from imperial Russia, only to see that first bid for freedom crushed by Stalin in 1921. Mr. Baker was spending the night in a hilltop guest house built for Stalin's head of secret police, Lavrenti P. Beria.
The city was tense and deserted as Mr. Baker arrived, a few hours before the nightly curfew, but spontaneous knots of shabbily dressed people gathered at the roadside to wave to his motorcade.
Independence Day celebrations are being postponed until after the Secretary of State is airborne on Tuesday because the authorities in Tbilisi fear the possibility of violence, not against the American visitors but against the Shevardnadze interim leadership.
"Georgia was in political isolation until a few months ago," Mr. Chikvaidze said, referring to the return of Mr. Shevardnadze in March to the new nation in crisis. "We have started to come out from that isolation."
 
'Out of Political Isolation'
 "In my opinion," the Foreign Minister said, "Mr. Baker's visit to Georgia is political, very political. After his coming, Georgia can say that Georgia has come out of political isolation. That's for sure."
Mr. Baker, who hailed Mr. Shevardnadze as a "courageous leader who is known and highly respected internationally," introduced to the airport welcoming party Gen. John Shalikashvili, the Bush Administration's candidate for Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. General Shalikashvili, whose father fled Stalinism in Georgia in 1921, was the United States Army commander for allied relief operations in the Persian Gulf war.
"I am especially pleased to be able to play a small role in John's return to his father's homeland -- a nation now on the road to full democracy and independence," Mr. Baker said.
Georgia has recently passed through a destructive civil war that has led to the ouster of President Zviad K. Gamsakhurdia, who had been elected in 1990 barely six months before a second declaration of independence was backed by 98 percent of the people on April 9, 1991.
Mr. Gamsakhurdia's followers have pledged to disrupt the election called for Oct. 11.
 
'Difficult Road' to Democracy
 Setting the tone for the Baker visit, Mr. Shevardnadze, who presides over a fragile council without electoral legitimacy, told the Secretary of State that Georgia had chosen "the difficult road" to parliamentary democracy.
"But we will never turn away from that road because we have such good friends as Mr. Baker and such strong friends as the United States," he said.
Mr. Shevardnadze said he is not sure that he will be a candidate in the election. There are still some suspicions of Mr. Shevardnadze in Georgia, where he once headed the Communist Party.
The election is considered very important to the building of civil and economic institutions that can take over the job of putting Georgian society back on track, aides to the council chairman say.
The city of Tbilisi is now threatened by roaming gangs, diplomats said. The State Council has limited power over the law enforcement agencies, some of whose members apparently freelance at night as thugs.
And the economy of Georgia is in a dizzying downward spiral, Foreign Minister Chikvaidze told reporters.
 
Economics Blamed for Unrest
 "When economics is not working, there is no doubt of unrest politically," he said in English. "If we do not have more butter, more bread, then I don't know what will be the answer. We have now only grain for 10 days.
"Our national income has fallen 25 percent in one year," he said.
On Mr. Baker's visit, which was scheduled to last less than 24 hours, the Secretary of State and Mr. Shevardnazde were to discuss ways in which the United States could help Georgia beyond immediate relief assistance.
"What's very important now for the previous Soviet republics, especially for Georgia, is not humanitarian help," the Foreign Minister said. "Humanitarian help will never solve any problems."
"It is necessary to help us create some kind of economic infrastructure," he said. "It means we have to build things that give us products, that give us goods, which we can use for ourselves and also sell to get some hard currency."

HEADLINE: Yugoslav Strife: Challenge for Europe

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 25

 BODY:
Aware of their dismal peacemaking record in Yugoslavia, European Community Governments have chosen to blush and remain silent after Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d lectured them this weekend for not acting more forcefully to stop the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Nudged by Mr. Baker's public admonition, they have also decided to do sooner what they were thinking of doing later -- to impose new economic sanctions against the Serbian dominated Government in Belgrade and to propose that similar measures be ordered by the United Nations Security Council. 
 Yet, while accepting the need to step up pressure on Belgrade, there was little confidence in major European capitals today that the new strategy would force Serbia to end its military intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
As a result, almost by default, the notion of sending an international military force to impose a cease-fire in the war-torn republic has for the first time become part of the debate. It has been raised, though, largely to be discounted as politically unacceptable.
At an international conference on aid to the former Soviet republics this weekend in Lisbon, Mr. Baker did not rule out some American involvement in a military force to insure delivery of humanitarian assistance to Sarajevo and other affected areas. But European governments worry about being sucked into a Vietnam-like quagmire.
"I think everyone is reluctant to get into peacemaking," one British Government official said today. "Peacemaking would be a rather dramatic step. We have often reminded our partners of our own experience in Northern Ireland -- it's much easier to get in than to get out."
While Mr. Baker grabbed the headlines this weekend by denouncing the "humanitarian nightmare" in Bosnia and Herzegovina and by criticizing those who were "looking for reasons not to act," there is still broad international support only for new economic sanctions against Belgrade.
Until now, European Community Governments have suspended the trade privileges of Serbia and Montenegro and withdrawn their Ambassadors from Belgrade. Senior officials from the community are also to meet in Brussels on Tuesday to discuss a list of further sanctions drawn up by its executive commission.
These include an embargo on exports from Serbia and Montenegro, a freeze on financial assets held abroad in the name of the former Yugoslav federation and a possible oil embargo. The Security Council is also expected to review the viability of similar sanctions this week.
But the European Commission's report noted that Belgrade had so far not proved "sensitive" to economic pressure, choosing to see its economy tumble into chaos rather than make political concessions. Instead the report suggested that the best approach was to seek Belgrade's total international isolation.
This could include refusal to recognize Serbia and Montenegro as the successor state to Yugoslavia, thus preventing it from taking Yugoslavia's seat at the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Washington's example of banning flights to the United States by Yugoslavia's airline may also be followed by community governments. Germany has already banned all commercial air, rail and road traffic with Serbia and Montenegro, although Greece, which is a community member, worries that a full trade embargo against Belgrade will hurt its exports.
 
Europe Lacks a Mandate
 European officials nonetheless recognize that if the new sanctions do not force Serbia to change its policy and public opinion continues to be inflamed by television images of women and children fleeing the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the debate about a multinational peace force will return.
With the community itself lacking both a mandate and the troops to act, the responsibility would again pass to the United Nations, which already has a 14,000-member peacekeeping force assigned to Serbian-populated areas of Croatia. In the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, though, the aim would be to put an end to the fighting.
The Secretary General of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has warned that a new Security Council resolution would be required if the existing force were to play a humanitarian role in Bosnia and Herzegovina. And there is no certainty that even European governments would back such a resolution.
"One has to remember that the U.N. role always has to be peacekeeping rather than peacemaking," Britain's Defense Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, said today. "One could not expect U.N. forces, involving British servicemen, to actually go into the middle of the war and try to sort that out."
 
A Role for NATO Troops?
 In theory, there also exists the possibility that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization might offer to send troops to Yugoslavia since the alliance has decided to make its peacekeeping services available to the 52-nation Conference of Security and Cooperation in Europe. But the necessary consensus for such a move seems unlikely to emerge.
Given the limited options available to the international community, then, some European governments have questioned Mr. Baker's motives in suddenly bidding for leadership on the Yugoslav crisis, above all since Washington has until now preferred to keep its distance from a problem that was resisting solution.
One French Government official suggested that, following televised images of Muslim women and children being held hostage by Serbian militias, Washington was simply anxious to be seen doing something. "The build-up of questions about Yugoslavia in the White House and State Department briefings last week almost obliged a response," the official said.
A British government official said he did not expect the United States to take over the responsibilities for a Yugoslav settlement assumed by the European Community 11 months ago. "I think Baker was just encouraging the Europeans to take the lead a bit more than they have been," he said.

HEADLINE: Winds of Yugoslavia's War Threaten To Engulf Muslim Region in Serbia

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRISTINA, Yugoslavia, May 25

 BODY:
For nearly 12 months, war has been moving inexorably southward across what was once Yugoslavia, becoming deadlier by turns as it has leapt from Slovenia to Croatia to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Now, as the United States prepares to lead a drive at the United Nations for mandatory economic sanctions against Serbia, which has been widely judged to be the main aggressor in the fighting, the fears of many in the Balkans are focusing on what could become the next battleground. It is called Kosovo, and what has happened here in the last 48 hours has offered little hope that the worst of the killing is past. 
 Kosovo is administered by Serbia, which cherishes these rolling hills as the heartland of Serbs' mythology about themselves as the Christian defenders of Europe against Islam. But the residents of the region have voted by a crushing majority to secede from Serbia and Yugoslavia as part of a long-term plan to become part of overwhelmingly Muslim Albania.
The vote took place on Sunday, in the face of widespread Serbian police harassment and a brooding Yugoslav Army presence. The balloting involved only ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of the 2.1 million residents of Kosovo, and was deemed illegal by the Belgrade Government and by the Serbian officials who, under state of emergency declared two years ago, control all aspects of Kosovo's government.
 
Serbia Threatens Force
 Vowing to keep Kosovo part of Serbia "forever" on behalf of Serbian legend and the fewer than 200,000 Serbs who live here, Serbia has pledged force to prevent any attempt at secession.
This morning, preliminary tallies indicated that close to a million voters had cast ballots for the so-far imaginary post of president of Kosovo, effectively approving the secession that was almost the only election issue. The reaction among local Serbs was the same explosive compound of anger, resentment and threats that burst forth when Croatia, Slovenia and then Bosnia and Herzegovina voted for independence.
"Serbia and Montenegro are ready to go to any lengths to defend their sovereignty, starting here," said Dragan Jovanovic, a burly, 28-year-old mechanic taking a lunch break in the "600 Restaurant" in Kosovo Polje, the site of the Serbs' defeat by the Turks in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389.
A few miles away, in cramped offices hidden away behind the soccer stadium in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, ethnic Albanian officials were completing the election tally. With an excitement and pride that had some of them on the verge of tears, they said that more than 90 percent of the registered voters had cast ballots and that 95 percent of them voted for Ibrahim Rugova, a 47-year-old, shaggy-haired lecturer on modern literature who became the sole presidential candidate when others judged the job to dangerous to seek.
This morning, rather than a triumphant motorcade and marching bands, Mr. Rugova stayed out of sight in his cramped seventh-floor apartment in the crumbling concrete outskirts of Pristina. He was apparently afraid that his appearance in the streets could touch off violence between his supporters and Serbian riot policemen patrolling the town's dusty streets in flak jackets, steel helmets and gas masks while carrying AK-47 rifles.
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, after sporadic incidents that Serbian officials branded as "terrorism" in the 1980's, have been stripped of most of their firearms. To deter the Serbs, the Albanians have only their numbers and the restive armed forces of Albania, across high mountains about 65 miles by road southwest of here. Albania, which recently rid itself of a Communist Government, is Europe's poorest country, so weakened that many live by emergency food aid, banditry and begging.
Nonetheless, few would rule out violence here that could spiral out of control. Fears of such a conflict, the sort of thing that only armchair Napoleons considered seriously a few months ago, are now being weighed in the chancelleries of Western Europe, where two Balkan wars 80 years ago, centering on what became southern Yugoslavia, were preliminaries to World War I.
If war came over Kosovo, it might involve Serbia and Albania directly, and possibly Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. They are regional powers that might take sides and scrap for territorial spoils, especially in Macedonia, another breakaway Yugoslav republic between Kosovo and Greece that has its own restive Albanian minority.
 
U.S. Seeks Wider Penalties
 The United States, moving rapidly in recent days to increase pressure on Serbia to halt the warfare in Bosnia and Herzegovina, has said that it will press in the United Nations Security Council this week for sanctions against Serbia, probably including a ban on civilian air links and an oil embargo. But there are doubts about how far Russia and France, permanent Security Council members that have historic links with Serbia, are prepared to go in isolating the Belgrade Government.
In any case, Slobodan Milosevic, the 50-year former Communist official who is Serbia's President, has consistently defied efforts to pressure him into abandoning what he has called his duty to "defend" Serbian minorities like the one whose heavily armed militias have seized two-thirds of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This pattern is still more likely to be the case with Kosovo, since Mr. Milosevic's political transformation -- from a gray holdover from Yugoslavia's Communist bureaucracy into a powerful nationalist figure -- began in Kosovo in 1987 with a speech in which he vowed that no force would ever again be allowed to "beat the Serbs."
 
Symbolism of Medieval War
 The reference was to the Battle of Kosovo, a medieval event that has a mystical signicance for many Serbs. The battle has come down in Serbian legend, reinforced in poetry and folk song, as the pivotal event in Serbian and Balkan history. It is one that opened the door to the 500-year Turkish occupation of Serbia and of what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to the domination of the Christian Orthodox Serbs by the Muslim Turks.
More than just a historical event, Kosovo has burned itself into the Serbian psyche as a symbol of Serbian vulnerability, and of a sacred trust, as many Serbs see it, to keep the Muslim faith, driven back with the defeat of the Turks by Serbian armies during the 19th- and early 20th-centuries, from again advancing into Europe.
Gordan Milosavljevic, a 45-year-old Serbian lawyer, put the matter squarely. "As always, Serbia is Europe's defensive wall, defending Europe against Islamic influence," he said.
What this means, for Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, most of them Muslims, is that Serbia apparently intends not only to deny them the right to secede, but to keep them subordinated politically, economically and culturally. This has been the case since Mr. Milosevic moved against them with tanks and riot squads in 1989 and 1990.
According to claims by the Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms, an ethnic Albanian group in Pristina, 110 Albanians have been killed, more than 600 wounded, more than 2,500 jailed for political offenses, 30,000 others arrested for trivial nationalist offenses like possessing flags, and 100,000 dismissed from their jobs under the state of emergency imposed by the Milosevic government.
The Serbs showed their determination anew in the weekend elections, sending police squads to force polling stations out of schools, seizing and destroying ballots, pulling down posters of Mr. Rugova, the presidential candidate, and driving off with the medieval Albanian flags, with a double-headed eagle on a flame-red background, that served as an election standard.
Election officials were reported to have been detained, and the only television channel permitted in Kosovo, a Serbian transmission from Belgrade, described the voting in its evening newscast on Sunday as "a farce."
Mr. Rugova, watching the newscast at his apartment with two unarmed "bodyguards," smiled.
"It's all a tragic absurdity," he said. "In fighting for Serbs in Croatia, and now in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slobodan Milosevic says that all Serbs have the right to live in a single Serbian state. But here in Kosovo, where Albanians would like to claim that right for themselves, we are told that we are not a nation, we are a minority. It's simply a matter of double standards."

HEADLINE: For Women, Varied Reasons for Single Motherhood

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, May 25

 BODY:
Vice President Dan Quayle issued a blunt reminder last week that after 25 years of cultural warfare over the American family, single mothers were likely to remain a divisive topic because their lives illuminate unresolved differences between the races and the sexes.
In a speech on Tuesday, Mr. Quayle argued that the riots in Los Angeles were "directly related to the breakdown of family structure, personal responsibility and social order in too many areas of our society." 
 But his remarks will be best remembered for the connection he drew between poor, unmarried black mothers and Murphy Brown, an affluent, white television character who he said mocked "the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another 'life style choice.' "
Census Bureau statistics and studies by social scientists suggest that there are few generalizations to be made about single mothers except that their numbers have been increasing for 20 years, although at a slower rate recently.
 
Varied Needs, Varied Choices
 Interviews conducted around the country with single mothers of varying races and economic conditions suggested that the decision to bear a child involves a mixture of practical, emotional and spiritual considerations and is usually not a straightforward moral choice.
For Jean Pollard it was not a matter of choice at all.
"He wasn't a planned child," Ms. Pollard, 34 years old, said of her 3-month-old son who lives with her in a shelter for homeless families in Houston. She was laid off from work, she said, and then the child's father reneged on a promise to marry her.
"I wanted kids, but I always figured when I had a child I would be married, the typical American dream," she said. "Sometimes it doesn't work out like that."
Like many single mothers, Ms. Pollard acknowledges the value of marriage. But she went on, "Marriage doesn't guarantee anything anymore because it's not like it used to be with our parents."
For Debbie Spain, staying married was not an option.
A 32-year-old medical secretary in Boston, Ms. Spain was beaten by the father of her first child and ended a brief marriage to her second child's father, who was an alcoholic. "Just because you have someone's last name doesn't mean that's going to solve any problems," she said.
Both of her children remain in close contact with their fathers, but Ms. Spain finds they are happier now that she is raising them alone. "I just decided I'm going to do it right as much as I can," she said.
For Patty Friedmann, having a child was more important than having a husband.
Ms. Friedmann, a 45-year-old writer in New Orleans, deliberately became pregnant when she was single and 28 because she wanted a child. In an autobiographical novel published last year by Viking, "The Exact Image of Mother," Ms. Friedmann, who is now married, described how women can assert their identities by making such choices.
Of her protagonist, Ms. Friedmann wrote, "She is unfocused in life and in conflict with her mother, and her decision to have a child brings her strength and her resources together and defines her."
The many different reasons that women give for being single mothers suggest that their lives reflect a variety of trends in American life.
"You can't isolate single parenting by women as a discrete phenomenon," said Barrie Thorne, a professor of sociology at the University of Southern California. "You have to see it in the context of an overall change in attitudes towards many sexual and family issues including the status of women, divorce and premarital sex."
Census Bureau statistics show a period of turmoil in the American family beginning in the mid-1960's, although the rate of change in family composition slowed markedly in the 1980's. Married couples with children, for instance, made up 40 percent of all households in 1970 but only 26 percent last year.
Single parenthood by unwed mothers rose quickly, and is still increasing. The number of families headed by mothers who have never married increased at annual rate of nearly 15 percent in the 1970's. Although the rate dropped to just under 10 percent from 1980 to 1991, this now constitutes the fastest growing category of family groupings.
Single mothers now head a quarter of all families with children, counting those have never married along with women who are divorced, widowed or are living apart from a spouse for any other reason. (There are single fathers, too, of course, but they head fewer than 4 percent of all families.)
Experts say that although economic circumstances have changed since the 50's, the "Father Knows Best" family -- two parents with only the husband working -- that typified that decade still exerts a powerful pull on American values and emotions. Large majorities in opinion polls consistently say they are committed to conservative views of the family like those articulated by Mr. Quayle, and the vast majority of children continue to live in households with two parents.
But, said Arlene Skolnick, a research psychologist at the University of California at Berkeley, "People often care deeply in opposing directions, such as believing in the 1950's family but also accepting the value or the necessity of women working outside the home."
Aside from this complex cultural context, Professor Thorne said, "there are structural and circumstantial problems that go beyond individual choices that help explain why families headed by single parent mothers are not only the most rapidly growing type of household but also the type most associated with poverty."
Felicia Bryant, 19, of Chicago spoke of the devastating impact an unwanted pregnancy can have on a poor woman.
On learning she was pregnant, Ms. Bryant said: "I was upset and shocked. I wanted to commit suicide. I felt that I was too young to have a child." Then 15 years old, she dropped out of school and went on welfare.
Although Mr. Quayle asserted that "marriage is probably the best anti-poverty program of all," Ms. Bryant did not see it as an antidote.
"Many of the homeless are whole families -- men, women and children -- and they are still in poverty," she said. "A man can lose a job anytime. A man is not always the best means of support. A woman can be just as independent as a man."
 
An Old Phenomenon
 The birth of children outside marriage, especially among the poor, is neither particularly new nor peculiarly American. Historians and social scientists note that industrialization and urban growth often coincide with changes in family structure.
These situations have often produced criticism similar to Mr. Quayle's. Social critics in 19th century Britain, for example, spoke of "the undeserving poor" and argued that out-of-wedlock births were a result of immorality.
In America the issue is complicated by race. While single parenting by mothers has increased quickly among both whites and blacks, it is far more prevalent among blacks. In 1991, women headed 58 percent of all black families with children, as against 19 percent among whites.
And there are major differences between blacks and whites in the reasons women head families.
Among white mothers, the major reasons are divorce and separation, although the number who have never married has increased rapidly, from less than 3 percent of one-parent families in 1970 to 19 percent last year.
Among black mothers, divorce and separation also used to be the major causes for single parenthood, but no more. Last year 54 percent of one-parent black families were headed by women who had never married. This was up from just 15 percent in 1970, according to the Census Bureau.
"Poverty, unemployment, welfare programs that penalize families: these things explain a major portion of the variance between blacks and whites in the number of female headed households, but not all of it," said Bonnie Thornton Dill, a professor of women's studies at the University of Maryland in College Park.
One explanation may lie with changes in the nature of urban poverty that have led to an increasing number of people cut off from the education or employment that might allow them to improve their status or give them the impetus to marry.
"Teen-age pregnancy among blacks has not increased so much, but the rate of marriage among teen-agers has dropped and the number of children born to married couples has dropped," Professor Dill said. "These things are related to perceptions of opportunity."
Perceptions of another sort also emerged as a major theme in interviews with single mothers, who argued that although their households may not be considered conventional they are nonetheless real families.
Grace Cox, a 35-year-old typographer in Houston, has one child from an early marriage that ended in divorce and another born to her as a single mother.
"When you have kids by yourself, you have to work harder at making sure they have what they need and at keeping the family together," she said, adding, "This is a family too."
Like several other women, Fran Ramer, a 42-year-old Chicago businesswoman who is a single mother, said she was deeply committed to the family as a social ideal and saw herself adapting that ideal to reality.
She said, "I don't disagree with Quayle about family values, but I think he is a little behind the times about what a family is."

HEADLINE: Departure Leaves Yale In Uncomfortable Spot

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, May 25

 BODY:
The surprising news from Benno C. Schmidt Jr. that he plans to leave the presidency of one of the oldest universities in the United States to become the president of an untested venture shocked the few people here who learned about it today. The action left Yale in the uncomfortable position of having three of its top officers step down just as the university undergoes some of the most drastic changes in the last 40 years.
Mr. Schmidt gave the news to the university's trustees this morning and scheduled a news conference for Tuesday to announce it publicly. 
 Mr. Schmidt's resignation, after six years as president of Yale, comes just one month after Donald Kagan, the dean of Yale College, announced his resignation, and two months after Frank M. Turner, provost of the university, said he would leave office at the end of this academic year.
During this morning's hourlong commencement ceremony, Mr. Schmidt did not mention his plan to leave Yale to head a Whittle Communications venture designed to create a national network of private schools. But in an interview later he said he believed that so many thorny issues had been resolved over the last few months that it was an ideal time for the university to begin the process of finding a successor and for him to accept an offer he had first declined a year ago.
 
Pointing Out Progress
 He pointed out that Yale had signed a new four-year contract with its clerical workers, entered a new agreement with the City of New Haven to make payments in lieu of taxes, raised almost 40 percent of the $1.5 billion goal of its new capital campaign, begun crucial repairs to many old buildings and made significant progress in dealing its budget deficit.
"With all that its seemed it was responsible for me to be able to contemplate the possibility of leaving," he said.
But students and faculty members, engaged in confrontations with Mr. Schmidt over the budget problems all year, might not agree that things have gone so smoothly. Just after a ceremony in which he received his Ph.D. in philosophy, Christopher A. Dustin, of Worcester, Mass., said that in the decade he had been at Yale, the university had "become a more economically driven place."
He added, "It's a lot less happy here, less humanistic, and I trace a great deal of that back to this administration."
In spite of what has been a bumpy year for Mr. Schmidt and for Yale, there had been little speculation that Mr. Schmidt would step down.
"At this point in our history, part of what a university president does is he gets criticized," said Calvin M. Trillin, the writer, who is a member of the Yale Corporation, Yale's version of a board of trustees.
Several other corporation members said they were shocked when, at a breakfast meeting at his campus home this morning, Mr. Schmidt stood up, clinked a glass with his knife and said he had an important announcement.
"There were a lot of open mouths around the room," said Sid R. Bass of Fort Worth, a trustee since 1982. Only one member of the corporation, Vernon R. Loucks, Jr., who acts as chairman of the group, knew of Mr. Schmidts plans; he was told 10 days ago.
Kurt L. Schmoke, the Mayor of Baltimore, who is also a member of the Yale Corporation, said that Mr. Schmidt had the support of all the trustees and that there had been no attempt to force him out because of the university's financial troubles.
"All I can tell you is how much we are going to miss this man and his leadership," Mr. Schmoke said.
While no formal plans were worked out at this morning's trustee meeting, Mr. Schmidt said he would stay on until Yale had selected an acting president, an appointment that is expected to be made before the new school year begins in September. The trustees will also have to form a search committee to find a permanent successor, who would probably take over some time before the 1993-1994 academic year.
Mr. Schmidt's years as president of Yale covered an unusually turbulent period in the university's long history, a time not of political turmoil but of coming to terms with the institution's financial limits.
As president for six years, he served a far shorter time than many Ivy League presidents, like Derek Bok, president of Harvard University for 20 years. But Mr. Schmidt said he should be judged not just by time but by the intensity of the issues he had to deal with in that time.
"They say to judge a hockey player not by his age but by his mileage," Mr. Schmidt said. "I've actually traveled more miles, dealt with more problems, raised more money and faced up to more difficulties than most presidents."
 
Embodying a New Ideal
 When he took over Yale in September, 1986 Mr. Schmidt seemed to embody the new ideal of an Ivy League president. He was a lawyer, the former dean of Columbia University's law school and an expert on the First Amendment. He was 44 years old and Yale trustees hoped he would stay in office for a long, stable period.
His tenure never went long without some controversy. Early on, he overhauled the School of Organization and Management, opposing members of its faculty and students who thought he had overstepped his authority.
Mr. Schmidt also was Yale's first commuter president, living part of the time in New York with his wife, Helen Whitney, whose career as a documentary film maker was based there. In his first few years, Yale rang with the mocking taunt, "Where's Benno?"
The most explosive conflicts came this past year, as overall budget problems overlapped with union negotiations and soul-searching about the university's limits.
To get more people involved in determining Yale's future, Mr. Schmidt established a committee to set budget priorities. But when the committee's recommendations included eliminating, merging or diminishing six academic departments and sharply cutting faculty, many were incensed.
 
Support From Alumni
 The response to Yale's belt-tightening efforts was not all negative. Alumni gave donations in record amounts, and despite the mistrust that arose on campus, Mr. Schmidt was held in high regard by his colleagues at other universities, who believed they would have to face the same issues.
"He showed the courage to come to grips with budget problems and deal with them forthrightly," said James O. Freedman, the president of Dartmouth College. Mr. Freedman, in New Haven because his daughter Deborah was graduating from Yale's Law School, said he was surprised to hear that Mr. Schmidt had resigned.
One of Mr. Schmidt's most daunting obstacles when he took over Yale was succeeding A. Bartlett Giamatti, a very popular president, who also left Yale for an unusual position, the presidency of baseball's National League.
Mr. Giamatti once joked that he would be known in history as "Bart the Refurbisher," because he had focused attention on Yale's deteriorating physical condition.
Rocking in a wicker-backed chair in his office today, Mr. Schmidt said that his own sobriquet could be "Benno the Builder," but then he recanted.
"One of the canards I had to try to live down around here is that I care more about buildings than people," he said. "That's not the case at all."

HEADLINE: Haitians Expected to Snub U.S. Rules

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, May 25

 BODY:
While the Administration and advocates for refugees wait to gauge the effectiveness of the latest American efforts to slow the exodus from Haiti, both groups agreed today that few Haitians would use asylum review offices being set up here to replace overcrowded offices at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.
For American diplomats and other officials, the Administration decision on Sunday to intercept refugees and return them to Haiti, where claims for asylum will be reviewed, amounts to calling the bluff of the Haitians who have been clambering aboard small boats in unprecedented numbers in recent weeks in the hope of reaching the United States. 
 The advocates for refugees, who have fought the Administration bitterly at almost every step of the crisis, say the new measures will have only a marginal effect on the number of Haitians who flee their country.
Would-be refugees will now have only one choice, presenting themselves to diplomats here in Haiti who both know the country and can verify their reasons for seeking refugee status. Until now, those who arrived at Guantanamo told their stories to immigration officers there who were unfamiliar with Haiti, officials said.
 
Claims Called Nonsensical
 "I am not convinced, based on the 2,300 returned boat people we've interviewed so far, that many people will be interested in applying for asylum here," an American diplomat said. "Among those interviews, we could not find a single serious claim for political asylum. The vast majority of these claims are nonsensical, and most of the Haitians themselves know this. That is why they are getting into boats instead of coming here to the embassy."
Since the violent overthrow of Haiti's first democratically elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, last September Haitians have fled for the United States, which recognizies only political, not economic, factors in granting refugee status.
American officials said that for several weeks they had been spreading word of an office recently established here to handle asylum requests, but had got little response from Haitians.
Asked how poor Haitians in outlying areas could be expected to contact such an office, one official said: "They don't have to actually come here. They can write."
For Haitian immigration advocates and human rights experts, arguments like these represent a travesty of what they say are the United States' moral obligations toward a people mired in a situation of recurring violence and increasingly harsh economic conditions, due in good measure to a hemisphere-wide embargo imposed on Haiti last fall to punish the authors of the military coup against Father Aristide.
 
A 'Very Narrow' Offer
 "What they are offering to do for people at the embassy is very narrow," said Jocelyn McCalla, director of the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees in New York. "They are basically saying they are open to giving asylum to members of political parties, officials in the Aristide Government and well-known intellectuals. I can't imagine a peasant in the central plateau whose house was burned down by a section chief writing to the embassy to ask for asylum, much less receiving it."
Section chiefs are members of a rural police force who exercise an almost feudal control over peasant life in many areas in Haiti. Human rights advocates accuse them of being behind many recent rural abuses.
William O'Neill, deputy director of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, who recently completed a fact-finding mission to Haiti, said that even those who show up at the embassy to apply for asylum risk being given short shrift.
"We talked to three people who seemed to have very solid claims who went through this process," Mr. O'Neill said. "All three said they were intimidated. They said it felt like an interrogation as they were being questioned by two teams of three agents, who they said they felt were trying to trip them up. Afterward, these people, two of whom were very close to Aristide, were rejected by form letter. They said they felt they had been used for their information."
A United States Embassy official said of such assertions, "We are not ogres, and I am not going to bother trying to defend ourselves against those claims."
Joining the chorus of criticism today was Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, who called the Administration's policy toward the refugees hypocritical after the long American practice of giving sanctuary to Vietnamese boat people.
"This is a presumptive violation of international law," said Mr. Solarz, who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. "We must be the shame of the entire world. I can't believe it."
United States officials expressed hope that the tide of Haitian boat people would now soon abate.
"You've got to hope it slows things down," said Larry Meisel, a Coast Guard official who oversaw the arrival of the 72d American cutter to come here with a shipload of returned Haitians since the emigration wave began last October. "With this new policy, we could start returning people every day, depending on what the traffic is."
An embassy official said of the expected Haitian response to the new policy, "If getting picked up gives you virtually no chance of getting into the United States, then they are eventually going to catch on and stop."
For weeks, United States officials have complained that the relatively large numbers of refugees who had been allowed into the United States from Guantanamo -- approximately one-third -- had begun acting as a powerful magnet tempting others to flee.
In a seeming confirmation of this view, Willy Celestin, a 20-year-old returned refugee, asked why he left his country, sheepishly told a reporter on the docks this morning: "Everybody is trying their luck. I thought I'd try my luck too."

HEADLINE: Tokyo Stocks Are Lower; Dollar Is Flat

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks closed lower in Tokyo today after sharp gains yesterday, when stocks elsewhere in Asia and in Europe rose and the dollar ended little changed in thin trading.
The Nikkei index of 225 Japanese issues ended down 350.36 points, or 1.89 percent, to 18,204.64. Yesterday, the index gained 334 points, or 1.83 percent. Volume came to about 180 million shares yesterday, the lowest since March 31. 
 Worldwide financial trading was generally thin yesterday, with financial markets closed in Britain because of a bank holiday and in the United States because of Memorial Day.
Gold ended yesterday at $338.35 an ounce in Zurich, up 30 cents from Friday.
The dollar in Europe finished at 1.6160 German marks, down from 1.6180 on Friday, and at 129.33 Japanese yen, down from 129.40.
Currency dealers said market activity was restricted to the adjustment of positions, with few European operators willing to make big moves before seeing what the trend in New York and London would be when trading resumes today.
Some dealers said dollar activity would probably be light for most of this week because trading would be interrupted again on Thursday because of the Ascension Day holiday in much of Europe.
In stock trading yesterday, the French CAC-40 share index was up 1.13 points, at 2,046.25.
In Germany, the 30-share DAX index, which ended at a 21-month high on Friday, added 8.61, to 1,811.57, its highest close since Aug. 3, 1990.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was aided by an unexpected interest rate cut on Friday and a flood of money from overseas, particularly from Thailand. The index jumped 133.43 points, or 2.28 percent, to close at a record 5,993.11.
In Manila, Philippine shares closed at a record high on surging confidence that Fidel Ramos, the former military chief, would win the presidential elections.
The Manila Stock Exchange composite index settled at 1,432.84, up 53.15 points, or 3.8 percent.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Recovery Oratory Is Recycled

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A year ago, as the nation returned to work from the Memorial Day weekend, officials in the Bush Administration and at the Federal Reserve, as well as a significant number of private economists, were trumpeting the end of recession and predicting steadily improving growth through the summer. Twelve months later, the oratory sounds remarkably the same.
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said last week, for instance, that the White House would soon raise the growth forecast of 2.2 percent it made in January. Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, predicted that growth into 1993 would be around 3 percent. And through a leak to The Wall Street Journal last week, the Fed informed credit market participants that it felt further easing of monetary policy was not necessary for a moderate recovery. 
 Not everyone, though, is so sanguine. "The talk and some of the data look a lot like they did at the beginning of last summer, and that is one thing that worries us," said David A. Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic forecasting and consulting company in Lexington, Mass.
 
No Relapse Is Seen
 Still, Mr. Wyss and other analysts who voiced doubts in the summer of 1991 about the rebound say conditions have changed enough in a year to make it unlikely that the economy will lapse back into a recession.
"Compared with a year ago, I feel pretty confident recovery is here," said Alan Sinai, president of the Boston Company Economic Advisers Inc. "But I don't think this will be anything more than a soft upturn."
A significant restructuring of corporate and household balance sheets, made possible by a steady slide in interest rates, is seen by analysts as the best insurance against another loss of momentum.
"Over the last year there has been a tremendous reduction of indebtedness -- on the order of $85 billion to $95 billion at an annual rate," said Roger M. Kubarych, a manager at Henry Kaufman & Company, a New York money management firm.
And Mr. Sinai observed: "Healthier financial positions of businesses and households are an absolutely essential part of any recovery. And they were absent last year."
 
'Banks Are in a Better Position'
 Debt reduction, in turn, has taken some pressure off the financial system.
"Banks are in a better position to withstand credit losses that are still coming at them," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation. "That is a plus. So, too, is the fact that there is more widespread recognition that balance-sheet and credit problems have been a bigger part" of the economy's malaise.
Despite some disturbing weakness in April housing data, and signs that consumer spending patterns are cooling a bit, analysts say the improvement in the economy is a bit more broad based now than it was a year ago.
Output in the second and third quarter last year "was heavily reliant on rising auto production," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. Currently, "production is taking place away from the auto sector."
"We are not talking about strength," Mr. Fine said. "We are talking about improvement. But signs of turning back down again are not there."
 
Consumers Not Very Confident
 After reciting the differences, the analysts noted that many characteristics that haunted the economy remained unchanged. Confidence has improved from earlier in the year, but is far from what is normally viewed as a healthy level.
Consumers continue to forgo spending much money on expensive items. Car sales, for example, have been stuck for 16 months in a narrow, low range of 5.6 million to 6.6 million units at an annual rate. Despite a rebound in housing, the construction industry remains in bad shape. Fiscal policy at the Federal and state levels remains restrictive. And employment, while slightly higher for a few months, is not showing the kind of growth normally associated with recovery.
 
Nettlesome Holdovers
 "Many, many corporations are still thinking of their roster of employees as a cost center rather than a productivity center," Mr. Soss said. "It seems to me that employment gains will be small."
Bond yields, which remain stubbornly high despite an improving inflation picture, are another nettlesome holdover from a year ago. If they stay relatively high, the recovery could be jeopardized.
"At this point there is no need for policy actions to lower short-term rates," said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. "But there is a need for market rates to reflect the fact that inflation is down. If we are to remain on a positive growth path, long-term rates have to continue to decline."

Three little words that television viewers watching the Democratic National Convention in July will not see behind Gov.

The backdrop behind the podium, which is perhaps the most valuable square footage inside Madison Square Garden for capturing television viewers' attention, is being changed.

HEADLINE: With the Income Tax Achieved, a Legislator Leaves Hartford

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
Even as Irving J. Stolberg prepares to return to private life at a time of intense anti-tax sentiment, the longtime income-tax advocate, one of Connecticut's most powerful politicians in the 1980's, remains an unabashed liberal and defender of public service.
"Others are packing it in because of the low pay and the aggravation," said Mr. Stolberg, referring to the rash of politicians in Connecticut and throughout the country who have opted not to seek re-election this year. But that is not his cause for announcing that he will not run for his 12th term as a state House member. 
 "In the last 22 years," he said, "I have accomplished most of my goals, especially now with an income tax in place for the 21st century in Connecticut."
Mr. Stolberg, 55, a New Haven Democrat and former geography professor, was state House Majority Leader for two two-year terms and ruled the 151-member General Assembly forcefully, leading some colleagues to call him "the emperor." Never one to shy from political battles or play down his accomplishments, he enhanced his reputation with flowery speeches and rulings.
In announcing his retirement, Mr. Stolberg pointedly differentiated himself from other legislators who are trying to avoid responsibility for last year's decision to enact Connecticut's first income tax.
 
Convincing His Constituents
 "The income tax has been my primary plank for 11 elections," he said. "When I came into office, most of my constituents were opposed to an income tax. But my polls show that I have convinced a majority that I was not using the income tax to increase taxes, but rather to raise revenues more equitably and efficiently than with sales or business taxes."
Arguing that sales taxes impose a disproportionate burden on low- and middle-income families and that business taxes hurt the state's economy, Mr. Stolberg's message has been that "a balanced tax structure should be an equal mix of sales tax, property tax and income tax."
Tom Scott, Connecticut's leading income-tax opponent, does not agree and has said that Mr. Stolberg was a principal target of his Connecticut Taxpayers' Victory Committee, which is raising money for 70 anti-tax candidates. Mr. Scott, who is running against Representative Rosa L. DeLauro for Congress, has taken credit for forcing Mr. Stolberg to bow out.
Mr. Stolberg is among several income-tax supporters in the Assembly -- including House Speaker Richard J. Balducci and the current Majority Leader, Robert F. Frankel -- who were the object of threats after the tax was approved last year, other legislators say. All three have announced that they will not seek re-election.
 
A Reduction in Debt Service
 But Mr. Stolberg emphatically denied that his retirement had been hastened by Mr. Scott. "Anyone with any sense in Connecticut knows that what Scott says about me is a joke," he said. "He's the only hatemonger I've encountered in Connecticut politics."
Mr. Stolberg said that he understood voters' frustrations and conceded, "There is legitimacy to the anti-tax sentiment because of legislators' pork-barrel projects."
Nonetheless, using his own career as a model, he challenged the notion that liberalism could automatically be equated with spendthrift big government.
"We reduced the state's debt service from 15 percent to 10.5 percent in four years," he said, referring to his tenure as chairman of the assembly's finance committee between 1979 and 1983. "I was more fiscally responsible than all these loud-mouthed conservatives who preach one thing and bring pork barrel back to their districts."
 
A 60's Recruit to Politics
 Mr. Stolberg, who was born in Philadelphia and grew up in Los Angeles, taught geography at Southern Connecticut State University and worked for several foreign-exchange programs before beginning his political career as a delegate for Eugene McCarthy in his bid for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1968. Two years later, Mr. Stolberg was elected in what is now Connecticut's 93d Assembly District by five votes.
During his years in office, Mr. Stolberg introduced or supported legislation to convert defense industries to nondefense production, to increase housing and welfare benefits and to bolster services for the elderly and Vietnam veterans.
In 1989, after his second term as House Speaker, Mr. Stolberg was ousted by a coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats in favor of Mr. Balducci.
"He led the Legislature forcefully, but that forcefulness also turned out to be his downfall," said Representative Jonathan Pelto of Mansfield, an assistant majority leader under Mr. Stolberg.
But Mr. Pelto added: "Stolberg set out to do two things -- to professionalize the Legislature, getting it on an equal footing with the executive branch, and get an income tax -- and he's done both."

HEADLINE: Newark Offers a Model For Saving the Cities

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 22

 BODY:
In the fresh surge of attention to the plight of inner-city businesses, Katie Selikoff may have clues to how the government can help.
It was here on the blocks surrounding Mrs. Selikoff's small furniture store that the Newark riots of 1967 and 1969 left an inner city in ruin. Her building was nearly destroyed by fire, and several merchants across the street were firebombed into extinction. 
 Now, as a survivor, she is also a beneficiary of the Urban Enterprise Zone Program, which the state set up to help businesses prosper in the most distressed neighborhoods. Since the program was created in 1985, Mrs. Selikoff has received a wish list of tax breaks and financial help.
"I am not walking away," said Mrs. Selikoff, a native of Budapest whose parents founded Clinton & Bergen Home Furnishings in 1958. Her sales staff still includes her mother, her daughter and her best friend from childhood.
 
Good for Customers, Too
 But some things have changed. There are the large yellow-and-red signs over her door, paid for by the state. A smaller sign in the window announces a bigger boost to business: Customers need pay only half of New Jersey's 7 percent sales tax.
"The zone program has made a difference in Newark," Mrs. Selikoff said.
It has also attracted a surge of interest from Washington: In the month since the Los Angeles riots, President Bush has said repeatedly that he would seek approval of a similar Federal program. Details have not been spelled out, but Mr. Bush said he favored creating zones in 50 cities or poor rural areas.
While any Federal program would contain different incentives than those offered here, there may be no better example of the costs and benefits than the zones in Newark and 10 other New Jersey cities.
 
Setting an Example
 "New Jersey is representative of the nation," said Marilyn Marks Rubins, a professor of public administration at the City University of New York. "Now, with national attention riveted on the problems of the inner city, Newark provides a model."
In a report last week, the state Department of Commerce and Economic Development said more than 20,000 jobs had been created in its enterprise zones since 1985. The Newark zone, it said, has attracted more than $800 million in private investment and created 3,000 jobs.
Still, experts say critical questions remain unanswered, questions that also apply to a Federal program.
One is whether government, by drawing lines on a map to define its incentives, puts businesses just outside the zones at a disadvantage, forcing them to close or move. And no one can be sure how many of the businesses in a zone really need help.
"The net result of some zone programs could simply be lost revenue that is given away in tax breaks," said James Hughes, professor of urban planning at Rutgers University.
 
How the Program Works
 In Newark, the enterprise zone covers seven square miles, about 30 percent of the city. State officials said 329 businesses are in the program, including retailers, small manufacturers and service companies.
To qualify, a business must be in an enterprise zone, and at least 25 percent of its employees must live in the zone or have been unemployed for a year before they were hired.
For businesses that qualify, the tax breaks include the elimination of the sales taxes they pay on goods and services. State corporate taxes are reduced for each new employee who lives in the zone. And in six of the New Jersey zones, including the one in Newark, retailers are allowed to charge their customers only half of the New Jersey sales tax, which the Legislature has recently voted to reduce to 6 percent, from 7 percent.
"In and of themselves, the incentives are not the solution to our problem," said Raphael Zabala, administrator of the Newark zone. Indeed, many businesses received other breaks, including the opportunity to buy abandoned city-owned land and preferential treatment in applying for grants and loans from the state.
This has produced incentives suitable for some business people but not all. In interviews here, several merchants and entrepreneurs said grants and low-interest loans had been the most valuable, enabling them to rehabilitate derelict property or expand despite the recession and tight bank lending policies.
At Clinton & Bergen Home Furnishings, Mrs. Selikoff said she had received $30,000 in grants to fix up her store, but only after filing detailed applications and agreeing to be monitored by state officials. Her money was spent on new signs and repairs to her store and an adjacent warehouse, which were damaged in the riots and fires of 1960's.
 
Not a Cure-All
 "The zone approach is correct," said Cornell L. Adams, a chemist and owner of Accurate Set Inc., a small manufacturer of resins, coating and other products used by dentists. He purchased an abandoned city-owned building in the Central Ward in 1980, before the area was an enterprise zone, but has received low-interest loans and tax credits as a participant since 1985. The company employs 14 people.
"When you help business, business creates jobs," said Mr. Adams.
Still, some of his problems are beyond the scope of the program. The recession has cut deeply into his sales, for example, forcing him to lay off five workers.
And after he had purchased an abandoned building on his block for expansion, taking advantage of tax breaks to renovate it, a potential partner backed out. The problem, Mr. Adams said, was that the partner's wife, fearing crime and urban blight, refused to move to Newark.
 
Programs in 37 States
 New Jersey is far from alone among states with enterprise zones. Since the mid-1980's, 37 states have initiated programs, but they vary widely in the incentives and in the kinds of zones they try to help.
While Michigan has only one zone, Louisiana has 750. Several states have designated entire counties; others have limited them to single streets or blocks.
Connecticut has 11 zones. New York has designated 19, in communities ranging from the East New York section of Brooklyn to upstate Elmira, in a program that began in 1986. A commission appointed by Gov.Mario M. Cuomo recommended in December that eight more zones be selected.
Proposals for a Federal program have been languishing for years, despite support from Jack Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. President Bush said as early as 1987 that he supported enterprise zones, but his endorsement this month was his strongest so far.
Any Federal incentives are likely to be in addition to state incentives, at least in some of the most troubled slums. One central element of the Federal proposal is the elimination of capital-gains taxes for businesses that invest in enterprise zones, effectively eliminating the taxes on properties sold at a profit.
But some business people in Newark say capital-gains taxes are the least of their worries. "The concern here is survival," said Mr. Adams, of Accurate Set. "We can talk about capital gains later, but for now that isn't going to help us one iota."

HEADLINE: The Burden of Debt -- A special report.;
Why Economists Fear the Deficit

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
Spending more than $4 for every $3 collected, the United States Government is hemorrhaging red ink at a record pace this year -- about $1 billion a day, or $11,574 a second. By late summer, Federal debt, the accumulation of every deficit the Government has incurred over two centuries, will surpass $4 trillion.
All the personal Federal income tax paid by people living west of the Mississippi fails to pay even the interest on this staggering sum, which has quadrupled in scarcely more than a decade. Interest payments on the debt are 15 percent of the Federal budget, compared with only 10 percent a decade ago. And for the first time, the Government has not even set a target for halting the debt's growth. 
 In the past the national debt was rationalized away as money "we owe ourselves" and regarded as a necessary tool in managing the money supply. Indeed, Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury Secretary, contended that the national debt was necessary to induce the rich to take an interest in the Government's policies because they would hold its securities. But the debt has grown to such size that most economists contend that it undermines American prosperity.
In the short term, they say, it has almost certainly contributed to the latest, not yet officially ended, recession. In the longer term, it puts at risk the nation's status as a top economic power.
By absorbing a huge share of the nation's savings, the Federal deficit has helped cripple the investment in new plants and machinery vital to economic growth. As the most creditworthy of all borrowers -- though some now find this designation a bit hollow -- the Government always gets what it needs, leaving others, if necessary, to be denied. The Government borrows by regularly putting Treasury securities up for auction.
"Because investment affects productivity growth and, hence, standards of living, the United States is inadvertently choosing a less competitive and less prosperous economy than it needs to," says Richard D. Rippe, a former economics professor who is chief economist for Prudential Securities Inc.
By increasing competition among borrowers, the debt also pushes up interest rates. And that feeds the apparent increase in the disparity of American incomes. Heavy borrowing "tends to benefit the holders of assets at the expense of other taxpayers," said William A. Cox, a senior specialist for the Congressional Research Service.
Few economists regard the debt buildup as having reached crisis proportions -- at least not the kind of crisis that might bring runaway inflation or economic collapse. Most describe it as termites eating slowly, not always invisibly, at the foundations of a house, or they liken it to a cancer that is not yet life threatening.
Yet the creeping pace of the erosion is itself a source of worry, because it can be difficult to persuade the electorate to support painful remedies in the absence of crisis.
"Sooner or later, the piper will have to be paid," said William Frenzel, a former Republican Congressman from Minnesota who served on the unproductive National Economic Commission, a bipartisan body created to study debt reduction during 1988.
There would be less of a problem, of course, if the Government's rising debt was matched by rising assets. But while some money the Government borrows is invested in physical or human capital, the bulk of it is not. It goes for a host of things, from military salaries to farm subsidies, that do nothing to make the economy more productive.
"We are clearly borrowing for consumption, and we can't keep on doing this," said Barry K. Rogstad, president of the American Business Conference, an association of rapidly growing midsized companies.
Until recently, flush foreign investors were eager buyers of Treasury securities. But with the collapse of the stock market in Japan, the rebuilding of eastern Germany and the relative paucity of surplus oil money in the war-torn Middle East, foreign investors can no longer be counted on to make up for the lack of domestic savings.
People who say the system may at last be receptive to changes point to stirrings on the campaign trail, in Congress and among business leaders.
"If you want to continue being leaders in the world, start by getting some of that debt off your backs," Lee Iacocca, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, told graduates of Johns Hopkins University last week. "Debtors can't be leaders. It's the guy holding the I.O.U.'s who calls the shots; the other guy is called a hostage."
And some analysts say the appeal of Ross Perot, who is considering an independent run for the Presidency, derives in part from concern he expresses about fiscal excesses and the spending of "our children's" money.
Meanwhile, a balanced-budget amendment is suddenly gaining widespread support in Congress -- although even its backers note that current lawmakers would get a cheap vote, permitting them to boast of their fiscal rectitude but leaving the hard task of cutting spending and raising taxes to the lawmakers who will be in office years from now.
 
The Effects
Diverting Savings, Stifling Growth
 The extent of the harm cannot be precisely determined, but most economists agree with Mr. Rippe that the economy is being damaged as some $200 billion a year is diverted from the nation's savings in order to pay interest to those who hold Treasury securities.
The savings rate in 1990 and 1991 was only one-third the rates of the 1960's and 1970's.
"We used to think the long-term growth rate was 3 percent," said William H. Branson, a professor of economics at Princeton University. "Now, an optimistic growth rate is 2 percent." The difference, he said, is the drag from debt.
The new Japanese Ambassador to Washington, Takakazu Kuriyama, said, "This is an issue that has to be dealt with somehow, if the American economy is to regain its strength."
For years, Japanese investors heavily underwrote United States debt. They now hold 2 to 3 percent of the total but are no longer able to afford to buy in such quantity. On balance, the Japanese actually sold Treasury securities in 1990 and bought relatively little last year.
To be sure, this year's record projected deficit is swollen by the recession and its aftermath, which has raised unemployment benefits and other outlays while curbing tax revenue. The deficit is also enlarged by the billions still being spent to discharge the Government's obligations to depositors of failed banks and savings and loans.
But most analysts who take the long view find little comfort in these special factors. They point instead to the ever-rising debt load -- the deficit is now 7 percent of national output after falling as low as 3 percent in the 1980's -- and to the grim budgetary demographics implicit in the eventual retirement of the baby-boom generation.
"It is a trend that is very serious, especially debt as a percentage of gross domestic product," said Carol Cox Wait, a former aide to the Senate Budget Committee who is now president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan body financed mainly by corporations. "Each year we have to cut programs or raise taxes just to pay interest on the debt."
Some economists are embarrassed that the world's richest country has racked up a deficit every year since 1969, a fact leading to a certain incredulity among German policy makers when the Bush Administration criticized them recently for excessive deficits. Indeed, the White House and Congress, in a budget deal in 1990, abandoned as excessively inconvenient the deficit ceilings imposed under the 1986 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law; the annual growth in the debt is once again theoretically limitless.
 
The Extent
By Any Measure, A Staggering Load
 Early this month the Government sold bonds due in the year 2021 that required coupons of 8 percent. A decade ago, when inflation and interest rates were at stratospheric levels, it had to pay as much as 15.75 percent to sell long-term bonds.
"God help us if interest rates turn around and go up again," Ms. Wait said.
As a share of gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and services on American territory -- the debt is indeed rising rapidly. After climbing above 100 percent at the end of World War II, the Government worked down publicly held debt to 50 percent by the late 1950's and to just under 25 percent by 1974.
Since then, however, this share has more than doubled to an estimated 52.5 percent this year. The Congressional Budget Office projects it to climb above 55 percent in 1994 and then to surge again around the turn of the century to reach 59.1 percent in 2002.
Some analysts, notably Alan C. Lerner, a senior economist for the Bankers Trust Company, assert that it is more relevant to compare the deficit with personal savings than with national output.
That calculation is even more sobering. Mr. Lerner found this ratio to have averaged 38 percent in the 1970's, 117 percent in the 1980's, 160 percent last year and likely to approach 200 percent in 1992. In other words, the Government needs each year to borrow more money than American households save.
In all, Federal debt is expected to total $4.1 trillion when the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. Publicly held debt is projected at $3.1 trillion. The trillion-dollar difference represents government securities held by Social Security and other Government accounts.
In many eyes, the situation is worse. Even these staggering figures do not count trillions of dollars of contingent, or latent, debt arising from Federal guarantees for activities like student loans, rural electrification and corporate pensions. In 1990, these guarantees amounted to $5.8 trillion, although claims for anything approaching this maximum are highly unlikely.
In addition, direct debts of Government-sponsored enterprises like the Federal National Mortgage Association exceed $1 trillion, having jumped at a compound annual rate of 19.6 percent since 1970, said James Grant, publisher of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a newsletter. These bodies are not formally backed by the Government but are thought to carry an implicit Federal guarantee against possible default.
Yet some analysts, including Robert Eisner, a Northwestern University economist, say the picture is not so bleak. They note that Federal accounting, unlike that of corporate America, makes no distinction between outlays for consumption and outlays that would more properly be considered investments, like highways and other infrastructure.
Others go still further in their attack on the conceptual underpinnings of deficit and debt -- and they do not see the silver lining that Professor Eisner has glimpsed. An emerging group, which reflects the fears of the baby-boom generation, regards all the traditional calculations as largely meaningless.
They say a more accurate guide would be to calculate how much tax, minus benefits, governments at all levels will take from each generation. Such generational accounting shows that when obligations to future beneficiaries are added to the money due current bondholders, the size of future claims on the Treasury is downright harrowing.
The use of the various deficit numbers has repeatedly led Washington astray, says Laurence J. Kotlikoff, a professor of economics at Boston University. "We have repeatedly misjudged the true stance of economic policy," he said, "and have chosen policies that compound, rather than solve, our critical economic problems."
 
The Remedies
Forcing the Public To Face Hard Facts
 There is little disagreement that the United States consumes so much and invests so little that it is jeopardizing its future. Even where current investment appears adequate, economists say, fresh capital is necessary to exploit the technological advances that raise productivity and insure competitiveness.
"To the extent you can't borrow abroad, it comes out of the real capital stock," said Rudolph G. Penner, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office who is now director of economic studies for the accounting firm KPMG/Peat Marwick. "The cumulative damage to the American economy," he said, "will compound and will become very serious indeed" by the late 1990's as investment needs go unmet.
In the short term, high deficits tend to rob the Government of flexibility in dealing with recession, denying it the stimulative spending tool that traditionally has been available to counteract cyclical downturns. In the longer term, some specialists worry, heavy indebtedness could tempt the Government to take an expedient course and inflate away the problem.
The concern is that the Government would simply increase the money supply to make paying interest and retiring principal as painless as politically necessary. Some analysts say the relatively high rates on long-term bonds, which dampen investment, already reflect the markets' anticipation of some degree of accelerated inflation.
The only sound way to reduce the debt's drag on the nation's living standards, many economists and budget analysts agree, is to find a way to arrest Federal spending, probably combining this with some tax increases. Many of them point first to the cost of medical care, which now takes almost 15 percent of the nation's output.
"Soaring health costs are gobbling up both the peace dividend and the demographic dividend," Mr. Penner said, foreseeing "a nightmare" in about 2010 when today's huge group of baby boomers begin to retire and switch from productive workers supporting the elderly to retirees requiring increased medical attention themselves.
As for taxes, economists generally tend to favor taxes placed on consumption, thereby reaching the heart of the nation's economic problem. Though such taxes may unduly burden the poor, it is possible to ameliorate this effect, proponents say.
Because of the huge commitments to future generations and the shifting of liabilities onto their shoulders, the nation will need political leaders who can persuade today's voters to stop asking Government for more than they are willing to pay for through current taxes. As the system now stands, Professor Kotlikoff says, today's 33-year-old male will during his life pay governments at all levels $194,500 more in taxes than he receives in benefits
Although there was much talk of spending cuts in the Reagan era, many of them were not in fact reductions but only the elimination of increases that would otherwise have taken effect. In cases where the cuts were real, even severe, they came in only a small segment of the budget and therefore produced political howls but little of fiscal consequence.
What is now needed, said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, is an adjustment of such magnitude "that it's going to have to include a very broad and balanced package of spending cuts and revenue increases."
Otherwise, he warned, "We can continue on the road we are on for a good deal of time -- and have an economy that slips out of world-class status."

HEADLINE: Not Just to Repair Houses, But to Rebuild Community

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
In the aftermath of the urban disorders of the 1960's, Franklin A. Thomas grappled with racial animosities and economic decay in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
And after watching television coverage of the recent violence in Los Angeles, Mr. Thomas, who is now president of the Ford Foundation, recalled in an interview the tension-filled days in the Brooklyn neighborhood where he had grown up. 
 He also recalled New York's two Senators, Robert F. Kennedy and Jacob K. Javits, leading a bipartisan drive in Congress and recruiting business leaders in a determined effort that led to the creation of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, the country's oldest community development organization.
Mr. Thomas, then the New York City Police Department's only black deputy commissioner, resigned to lead the experimental venture in urban renewal. He remained there for 10 years, until he joined the Ford Foundation. Ford was already deeply engaged in helping poor communities -- it has given $15.8 million to support the Brooklyn enterprise and millions more to help start other community organizations elsewhere.
 
The Federal Role
 "The weak partner in community revitalization in the last decade has been the Federal Government, which has retreated from participation," Mr. Thomas said. "The events in Los Angeles tell us we cannot continue to fail investing in our neighborhoods and our people. We are spending the capital we invested years ago, and that capital needs to be renewed."
As planners attack the needs of Los Angeles and other cities, Mr. Thomas urged that they listen to residents and involve them in the regeneration of their communities -- another lesson learned in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where he was raised the youngest of six children.
The 2,000 community development organizations that have sprung up across the nation since the Bedford-Stuyvesant effort have discovered local leadership, built or renovated housing, created social services for neighborhoods and encouraged local businesses, he said.
 
'Beyond Repairing Houses'
 "I would argue development goes beyond repairing houses," he said. "It should consider how sites are acquired and who does the acquisition and financing, or the rehabilitation and the design, who supplies the builders and how housing units are leased or sold, and who owns and supplies the local businesses.
"I would argue community development is emerging as a major revolution in the country, one that engages people in ways that affect their lives and their localities. It may not be glamorous, but it should stimulate an excitement in all of us regardless of our politics or background."
Mr. Thomas said he found startling parallels watching the riot scenes in Los Angeles and, minutes later, the televised violence of Serbs and Croatians shooting at each other.
"You cannot build walls high enough or strong enough to protect yourself and property in a society when a substantial number of people are led to believe they are not valued or not expected to participate," he said. "If, by some miracle, you could build walls to keep out such people, you would not like the life inside or outside."

HEADLINE: Business and Health;
Blue Cross Breaks Its Business Cycle

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
APPARENTLY breaking a longstanding insurance cycle of three good years followed by three bad years, the nation's 73 Blue Cross and Blue Shield associations reported a combined surplus of $357 million for the three months ended March 31. Blue Cross executives say the good news should continue at least long enough to make 1992 the fourth year in a row with a sizable surplus.
Health insurance experts say the surprising extension of the string of surpluses may reflect smarter moves by managers and a trend toward less risk taking. But they caution that the picture is complicated. "Even if the first-quarter numbers were good, it is just one quarter," said Harvey Sobel, an actuary and principal in New York with the William M. Mercer consulting firm. 
 In past cycles, the insurers thrived when they raised their rates fast enough to keep ahead of rising hospital and doctor fees. After a few good years, however, there would be a slowdown in rate increases as the commercial insurance companies and Blue Cross plans jockeyed for market share. Then, with costs still rising, losses would inevitably follow, until the insurers again raised their rates and the cycle turned.
Fred Cue, a senior vice president in Chicago with the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, said the combined surplus last year was $1.6 billion on $67 billion in sales. The gain peaked at $1.87 billion on $62.6 billion in sales in 1990, after a $1.16 billion 1989 gain on $56 billion in sales.
In the preceding years of the down cycle the loss had been $3 billion.
Mr. Cue said a shift to managed care -- health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.'s, and discount deals with hospitals and doctors -- might have slowed the increases in costs, making it easier to adjust rates in time. About 30 percent of the nation's 67 million Blue Cross enrollees are in managed-care plans, compared with only 10 percent a few years ago.
Moreover, all health insurers are taking fewer risks, as growing numbers of employers self-insure and hire insurance experts just to supervise and handle the paperwork. The slowdown in the economy and in inflation generally may also be making it easier for the insurers to deal with medical cost increases.
Many commercial insurers have retreated from health insurance, which may also have reduced the pressure to cut prices. Allstate sold its business to Metropolitan Life, and Equitable sold its Equicor joint venture to Cigna. Meanwhile, Aetna, John Hancock, Lincoln National, Provident and Kemper also have pulled back in varying degrees.
"Everybody agrees that the cycle is late" in turning, said John T. Porter, a vice president in New York with the Towers Perrin benefit-consulting firm. But he notes that there have been variations in the past and that the results are not the same for every state. "The cycle is not a myth," he added. "It is also not a fact of nature."
Indeed, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York, the country's largest Blue Cross plan, "never followed the national cycle," said Jerry Weissman, Empire's chief financial officer. "We started the down cycle in 1991," he said, with a $150 million loss on $6.7 billion of revenues last year.
This was followed by a $62 million loss in the first quarter of this year, reducing reserves to $83 million, barely above the state's requirement of 1 percent of revenues. The New York Insurance Commissioner, Salvatore R. Curiale, approved a 14.2 percent rate increase, starting April 1, which should ease Empire's losses over the rest of the year, Mr. Weissman said.
"A lot depends on the legislation that passed the Assembly on March 30," he added. The state Senate has not yet taken up the bill, vigorously opposed by commercial insurers. The measure would require commercial insurers to accept all applicants, as Empire does, and would bar the charging of higher rates to individuals and groups that are regarded as high risks.
The New Jersey Legislature is considering a similar proposal backed by Gov. Jim Florio and some state employers. New Jersey Blue Cross and Blue Shield came back from the brink of bankruptcy last year, reporting a $3 million gain on $2.45 billion of revenues. But it still must eliminate a $44 million deficit in reserves.
Fred Hillman, a Blue Cross spokesman in Newark, said enrollment had declined 46 percent since 1988, to 2.3 million, and the association has dismissed 450 employees. Nationally, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans have lost nine million members, a 12 percent decline since 1989; much of the membership loss was in the economically distressed Northeast.
Mr. Cue said there had been improvement in troubled Blue Cross plans in New England and Maryland. Empire Blue Cross, along with Blue Shield of Western New York, a small plan in Buffalo, are the main remaining trouble spots. "We've had some pleasant surprises," he added. But he said a downturn still seemed probable next year, which would eat into $10 billion in combined reserves accumulated during the good years.

HEADLINE: Physicists Step Up Exotic Search for the Universe's Missing Mass

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
THE strangeness of the universe obliges astrophysicists to heed the White Queen's words to Alice that she practiced believing six impossible things before breakfast. Without this kind of logical leap, they find they cannot begin to embark on answering one of the most challenging and fundamental questions in science today: what is most of the universe made of?
All the visible stars and galaxies, scientists now believe, account for less than 1 percent of the mass of the universe. The rest, then, must be some kind of invisible, or dark, matter that has so far eluded detection by the best instruments of astronomy or particle physics. 
 But the nature of this invisible mass has yet to be determined. Some of it may be very dim stars or those intense vortexes of gravity known as black holes. Most of it, though, is thought to be some form of exotic subatomic particles pervading the universe, such as fast, massive neutrinos or hypothesized slow-moving particles known as cold dark matter. All in all, it is a perplexing mystery, seemingly bordering on fantasy, that would tax even the White Queen's imagination.
Finding the stuff of this hidden mass could alter theories of particle physics and would be a major step in understanding the structure and evolution of the universe. It might also enable cosmologists to predict whether the universe is destined to continue expanding forever or eventually to collapse of its own gravity.
If dark matter does exist, and most of it turns out to be unlike the ordinary atoms of stars and people, the philosophical implications would be profound and humbling.
Pondering this prospect, Dr. Bernard Sadoulet, a physicist at the University of California at Berkeley and a leader of the search for dark matter, said: "It will be the ultimate Copernican revolution. Not only are we not at the center of the universe as we know it, but we aren't even made up of the same stuff as most of the universe. We are just this small excess, an insignificant phenomenon, and the universe is something completely different."
Scientists are redoubling their search for the hidden mass, inspired by the recent discovery by an American satellite, the Cosmic Background Explorer, or COBE. Its instruments detected slight fluctuations in the density of the residual radiation from the Big Bang, the explosive event thought to have been the start of everything.
These "ripples" in the otherwise smooth early universe are seen as regions with slightly greater mass and thus with a stronger than average gravitational field to draw in more and more matter. From these ripples eventually grew the stars and galaxies in today's universe.
Astrophysicists generally agree with Dr. George F. Smoot of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, leader of the COBE research team, that the findings help explain how an initially smooth universe evolved its present large-scale structure, and also lend strong support to the idea that most of the universe's mass consists of the invisible dark matter.
"COBE tells us, yes, we do see fluctuations that can make the large-scale structure we see today, provided we have something else, namely dark matter," Dr. Sadoulet said.
The reason is that ordinary matter, known collectively as baryons, would not have coalesced quickly enough around the embryonic fluctuations, said Dr. Alan H. Guth, an astrophysicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Ordinary matter would not have immediately been attracted to the weak gravity of the primordial ripples; certain kinds of dark matter could have been.
 
Earlier Hints of Invisible Matter
 "Even before COBE there were strong suggestions that it would be impossible to build a universe made only out of baryons," Dr. Guth said. "COBE helps nail down that conclusion."
The first intimation that there might be more to the universe than accounted for in previous theory came in the 1930's. Dr. Fritz Zwicky, an astrophysicist at the California Institute of Technology, observed some galaxies traveling at unexpectedly high speeds in a cluster of other galaxies. Since the observable mass in the cluster was not sufficient to provide the gravity needed to pull galaxies at such speeds, he decided there must be a great halo of invisible mass surrounding the cluster.
Nothing much came of Dr. Zwicky's idea until the last 15 years. More observations of the speeds, rotations and shapes of galaxies made it increasingly clear to astronomers that there must be some extra, unseen mass in the universe.
But what did the extra mass consist of? The first suspect was the neutrino. These light subatomic particles are known to exist in abundance, which is more than can be said for nearly all other dark-matter candidates. In theory, they should also have been created in great number at the beginning of the universe.
Recent experiments by American and Russian scientists suggest that one type of neutrino apparently does have some mass. Even if its mass is no more than one ten-thousandth of an electron, scientists say, it is possible to conceive of neutrinos accounting for nearly all the dark matter in the universe.
Although neutrinos still have their partisans, astrophysicists point out a problem. Neutrinos are "hot," meaning they travel at velocities close to the speed of light. Such light, swift particles would presumably have careered away from the dense ripples, instead of falling in to form clumps and the makings of galaxies.
So scientists turned to thoughts of cold, or slow-moving, dark matter. In the early 1980's, particle physicists had already hypothesized the existence of exotic slow-moving subatomic particles with such names as axions and WIMP's, for weakly interacting massive particles.
Astrophysicists elaborated concepts of how cold, dark matter explained the universe's large structure and also conformed with the new modification of the Big Bang theory, the inflation model postulating a brief, rapid expansion of the universe immediately after the explosive creation. This anomalous expansion could have exaggerated tiny variations in density, creating the imprint of ripples.
Dr. Joel Primack, an astrophysicist at the University of California at Santa Cruz who was an early proponent of this concept, said the combination of inflation theory and cold dark matter yielded "a beautiful theory of galaxy and galaxy cluster formation that correctly predicts many of these structure's properties and their masses."
In the months before the COBE results were announced in April, however, the cold dark matter theory was beset by growing skepticism. Astronomers were reporting "great walls" of galactic clusters too large, it seemed, to have been formed by cold dark matter in the allotted time. It took the discovery of the density ripples to revive the theory.
At the Center for Particle Astrophysics at the University of California in Berkeley, astronomers, physicists and theorists have embarked on a wide-ranging search for dark matter, cold, hot or whatever.
"Now, with COBE, our work is more urgent than ever," said Dr. Sadoulet, director of the center. "But it's always been urgent, I suppose, when you don't know what at least 90 percent of the universe is."
On one front, the center is in a race with half a dozen other institutions to confirm the COBE results and look for density ripples even smaller than the satellite could detect. Further examination of the fluctuations should show whether the dark matter is more likely to be hot or cold, or possibly something else.
A research team at the center plans to loft an especially sensitive telescope with a high-altitude balloon this fall, searching for more detailed evidence of density fluctuations in the early universe. Previous flights failed to detect anything, but Dr. Mark Devlin, a physicist, said, "I think we will see something this time."
Similar balloon surveys are being directed by M.I.T. scientists. Dr. Philip Lubin of the University of California at Santa Barbara has looked for small-scale ripples using radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the dry air makes for especially clear viewing. Astronomers at Jodrell Bank Radio Observatory in England are optimistic that their ground-based instruments with improved sensitivity will soon be able to provide new details of the early universe's texture.
The center is developing a new generation of instruments for the direct detection of the hypothesized WIMP's. Such particles, if they exist, are by their nature difficult to detect. They do not interact strongly with other particles and so emit no radiation of any kind. They are not subject to the strong nuclear force that governs the behavior of ordinary matter.
But WIMP's should be everywhere, billions of the feeble particles passing through a human body each day, though only a few interacting with atoms in the body. Scientists assume that these rare collisions, if registered in solid materials, should produce detectable reactions. Several experiments have been done with detectors placed deep underground, away from interference from most ordinary cosmic radiation, to record any electric charges or weak flashes of light released by cold dark matter colliding with atoms in semiconductors like silicon or germanium.
 
Search for WIMP's
 The approach being taken in designing new detectors is to capitalize on the fact that cold dark matter striking the nucleus of ordinary matter in a crystal lattice will produce a kick, enough to give off vibrations or phonons. These are detectable as slight temperature changes, if the instrument is chilled to temperatures close to absolute zero. The Berkeley center is testing such super-cold instruments for a WIMP hunt.
Another possible form of dark matter, the hypothetical axions, are still a contender. These particles are believed to be even lighter than WIMP's, perhaps only one-trillionth the mass of an electron. A team of scientists from Berkeley, Livermore, the University of Florida, M.I.T. and the Russian Academy of Sciences is developing an experiment to tune in on axions that presumably permeate the environment. In their laboratory, superconducting magnets would magnify the strength of axion signals as they are stimulated into microwave signals for analysis.
Like so many others trying to identify dark matter, Dr. Karl Van Bibber of Lawrence Livermore Laboratory and Dr. Chris Hagmann of Berkeley, leaders in the axion hunt, think they finally will have instruments sensitive enough to find what they are looking for, it it is there. "We're partisans, of course," Dr. Van Bibber said. "In this business of dark particles, you have to be. It requires your sustained obsession."
Two other researchers at the center, Dr. Kim Griest and Dr. Charles Alcock, are checking out the possibility that much of the dark matter may simply be small stars in the halos surrounding galaxies that are not massive enough to shine. Such dim stars, sometimes called brown dwarfs, are among the ordinary-matter candidates for dark matter. These are called Massive Compact Halos Objects, or Machos, the antithesis of WIMP's.
The scientists have developed ultra-sensitive electronic detectors for use in looking for such dark objects through an Australian telescope. They are counting on a technique called gravitational lensing to reveal the existence of such dark matter out between galaxies. As light from a distant astronomical object, like a quasar, travels toward Earth, that light should be deflected by any mass lying between here and there. The intervening mass, though not visible, can thus be detected. Analysis of such observations could betray the nature of the dark matter, or at least its quantity and arrangement through space.
Quantity is of paramount theoretical importance. If the average density of mass of the universe is at a certain critical level, it means there is an equilibrium between gravity and the energy of expansion and the universe will remain stable. If the density is much greater, the result could be a closed universe, in which gravity would allow it to expand only for a certain period before it collapsed. If the density is much less, the universe would keep expanding forever, stretching out into thinness and coldness.
Dr. Anthony Tyson, an astrophysicist at A.T.&T. Bell Laboratories, has already begun mapping the distribution of dark matter through gravitational lensing, confident that this will be a powerful exploratory tool.
While Machos may exist, astrophysicists say there are strong theoretical reasons to doubt that ordinary matter in the form of dim stars, undiscovered planets or black holes could constitute more than 10 percent of invisible dark matter.
 
Unhappiness With Theories
 Indeed, astrophysicists may have to think of a few more impossible things before their next breakfast, if they are to figure out what the universe is made of.
"All the theories are squirming," said Dr. Carl Fisher of the Berkeley center. "I was down at a meeting with all the gods of cosmology, and no one there felt really comfortable with any theory. Cold dark matter seems to work on the large scale. Hot dark matter works on the small scale. How do you combine the two?"
One more big discovery could change this. "One of us is going to find the dark matter," Dr. Alcock said. "That will be the great coup of the 90's in cosmology."

OBSERVATION:
 
The solar system conforms to Newton's law that planetary orbital speeds fall off steadily the farther the planet is from the Sun. But observations of distant galaxies showed no such change with distance, as well as other anomalies that scientists began to believe could only be explained if the galaxies were surrounded by vast but invisible matter. [Diagram]

THEORY:
 
Alan Guth's theory that a period of rapid inflation followed the Big Bang would solve some nagging cosmological problems. But it would also mean that there is almost 100 times more matter in the Universe than telescopes can see. [Diagram]

Chart: "Where Could the Dark Matter Be?" -- Scientists say that visible objects account for less than 1 percent of the mass of the universe, and there are a number of candidates for the missing matter, which does not emit or absorb light. Black holes are one candidate. Or the matter could consist of hitherto unknown particles.

Axions, WIMP'S, and other exotic particles
To overcome various problems raised if dark matter were made of ordinary matter, scientists have invoked the existence of exotic entities, named WIMP's or weakly interacting massive particles. Billions should pass through each human body every day. Axions, equally exotic, are another postulated candidate for the cold dark matter. Neither particle has yet been detected.

Ordinary matter and Machos
Instead of invoking unknown particles to solve the missing matter problem, other scientists prefer to look for ordinary matter in other places. The matter might be locked in stars in the halos of galaxies, the stars being too small to ignite nuclear reactions and emblazon their presence in the sky. These postulated small dark stars have been named Massive Compact Halos Objects, or Machos.

HEADLINE: Cost of High-Tech Fertility: Too Many Tiny Babies

SERIES: First of two articles on the boom in multiple births.

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
LATE last year doctors at Saddleback Memorial Hospital in Laguna Hills, Calif., held an emergency planning session to confront a happy problem: four sets of triplets, all due in one 10-day period.
"We had to have 12 respirators, extra nurses, extra lab techs, and we still had to accommodate the other high-risk births," said Dr. David Lagrew, the babies' obstetrician. 
 A decade ago, four sets of triplets due in a 200-bed hospital in such a short period might have qualified for the Guinness Book of World Records. But no longer. Thanks largely to the growing number of couples in fertility treatment, the number of twins, triplets and quadruplets is on the rise.
"Two decades ago an obstetrician might not have seen a set of triplets in his entire career," Dr. Lagrew said. "I delivered seven last year and have another three in progress." The Triplet Club of Cincinnati is adding 20 or 30 families a year.
For couples who have struggled with infertility, the arrival of these hard-won children is an occasion of joy. But since multiple-birth babies are almost always premature and frequently have medical problems, it is also a source of concern.
Health economists worry about the huge costs of caring for this recent increase of premature infants, who sometimes need months of intensive care, only to emerge with disabilities. And pediatricians say that the already difficult task of caring for more than one infant can become overwhelming if the infants are frail.
As a result, some doctors now feel that fertility specialists must be less aggressive in treating their patients, producing fewer successful pregnancies per try, but fewer multiple births as well.
"This is a public health problem because we are producing an incredible number of children who are at grave risk for prolonged stays in the neonatal intensive care unit and all of the complications of prematurity," said Dr. Louis Keith, professor of obstetrics at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago.
In a case that is all too typical, Barbara and Scott Cameron of Cincinnati had triplet girls, born 15 weeks premature last August, after numerous attempts at in vitro fertilization, or I.V.F. All of the girls weighed less than two pounds at birth and spent more than 10 weeks in intensive care, most of that time on ventilators. Although the three girls are now home, they all have vision problems. One, who has some degree of brain damage, must stay tethered to an oxygen tank.
"You go through eight years of I.V.F. and think, 'I'm finally over all this torture,' and then you have to deal with prematurity," Ms. Cameron, an engineer, said in a recent telephone interview. "It's been a really difficult time and I can't see an end in sight." But she added, "We wanted children so badly, and I'm thrilled to death to have them."
Dr. Emile Papiernik, who until recently worked at the hospital that produced the first French test tube baby in 1982, calls the rise in multiple births due to fertility-enhancing drugs a "worldwide epidemic." In France, where pregnancies assisted by fertility drugs or in vitro fertilization are carefully tracked, there has been a 10-fold increase in the number of triplets and a 30-fold increase in the number of quadruplets in the late 1980's, he said.
Obstetricians like Dr. Papiernik, now professor of gynecology at the University Renes Descartes in Paris, are urging fertility clinics to stem the stream of multiple births by offering less aggressive treatments to infertile couples.
He suggests that infertility experts should use low doses of fertility drugs and place two or three fertilized embryos in the uterus during each I.V.F. attempt, rather than the four or five embryos now typically used.
Critics also say that infertility specialists are probably jumping in too quickly to treat couples who are more impatient than infertile. "When I have a mother come in who has had two sets of twins on fertility drugs and is now pregnant with quads, you have to think that she may not have had a problem," said Dr. Michael Katz, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California at San Francisco.
 
'Second Epidemic' of Multiple Births
 Overall, the number of twins in the United States rose 33 percent from 1975 to 1988, Dr. Keith said, and the number of triplets by 101 percent; the number of single pregnancies rose by 17 percent over the same period. Women over 35 contributed disproportionately to the increase; they are naturally more likely to conceive fraternal twins and are also more likely to require the fertility treatments that tend to yield multiple babies.
What Dr. Papiernik calls the "first epidemic" of multiple births began in the late 1970's when Clomid, a drug to stimulate the ovaries, became widely available. Women using Clomid frequently ovulate more than one ripe egg per monthly cycle and, when they conceive, have about a 10 percent chance of multiple birth.
Dr. Papiernik's "second epidemic," which he says began in the mid-1980's, is attributable to in vitro fertilization. In this technique, women are given high doses of Perganol, a powerful drug that induces multiple eggs to develop. Doctors then harvest the eggs in a simple surgical procedure, and they are fertilized in a laboratory dish, yielding embryos that can be placed in the uterus.
On average worldwide, 20 to 30 percent of the pregnancies conceived through this technique result in multiple births and 3 to 5 percent are triplets or more, Dr. Papiernik said. But these statistics vary widely and correlate with the number of embryos transferred.
At the Laguna Hills Clinic, where fertility experts generally place four fertilized embryos in the uterus, the multiple gestation rate is 28 percent. At the Genetics and IVF Institute in Fairfax, Va., where doctors have been placing only three embryos since 1988, only about 15 percent of women become pregnant with twins and only 1 percent with triplets. Because Ms. Cameron had not conceived using smaller numbers of embryos, her doctors implanted nine. Some clinics suggest that women pregnant with triplets or more should "reduce" the pregnancy through selective abortion, but many infertile couples find that option unacceptable.
Because birth certificates in the United States do not list how a child was conceived, no one is sure exactly what fraction of the multiple births in this country is due to fertility treatment. But in Belgium, where such information is available, an estimated 80 percent of the nation's triplets were conceived after fertility drugs were taken. And researchers in several European countries have found a direct correlation between the number of prescriptions for these drugs and the number of multiple births.
 
A Boon, Not a Problem
 In the United States, "the phenomenon is exaggerated in the upper-middle class who have the wherewithal to do it," Dr. Keith said.
For infertility specialists and their patients, the urge to use higher doses and more embryos is only natural. "To a point if you use more embryos you are more likely to get pregnant, but the price you pay is a higher multiple gestation rate," said Dr. Joseph D. Schulman, director of the Genetics and IVF Institute in Fairfax. The pregnancy rate for two embryos is 15 percent, for three it is 20 percent and for four it is 23 to 25 percent.
Although doctors say they discuss the risks of multiple births, infertile couples do not always absorb the message. "I knew statistically there was a chance, but I didn't think it would happen to me," said Holly Simons, a psychotherapist in Wellesley, Mass., who had twins on Clomid eight years ago.
And to couples longing for a child, the possibility of more than one may seem like a boon rather than a problem. "We decided with our doctors to put back four embryos to increase the chance of having one," said Randeleigh Harris, who had two boys and a girl in January after 11 years of fertility treatments. "I had panic attacks when I heard it was triplets, but I would rather have my hands full than empty."
Great advances in caring for high-risk pregnancies and infants have made the increase of multiple births possible. "My grandmother had triplets but they didn't survive," said Janet Bleyl, the mother of 8-year-old triplets and president of a thriving support group called the Triplet Connection, based in Stockton, Calif.
Today, with intensive and expensive care, twins have survival rates nearly comparable to single births. And with even more intensive and expensive care, the outcome for triplets is almost as good as that of twins. The average triplets stay in intensive care for four to six weeks at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars.
In a study this year by Dr. J. Milton Hutson of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, the average delivery time of 19 monitored triplet pregnancies was 34 weeks and no one delivered after fewer than 32 weeks; all women spent months in bed rest, underwent daily monitoring and had a stitch placed in their cervix to prevent the weight of the fetuses from forcing it open prematurely.
But not all women receive this kind of attention, and technology cannot always overcome the forces of nature. "I followed all the doctor's orders," said Ms. Cameron, who delivered at 25 weeks. "Even though you do everything, they can be born early and you just have to accept that."
Babies born before 32 weeks are at high risk for lung problems, brain damage, blindness or even death.
In addition to the three pages of birth announcements in the latest Triplet Connection newsletter, there is a two-page "Tender Hearts" column mourning dozens of trios that did not make it.
Dr. Papiernik said that at the hospital where he practices, half the babies transferred from maternity to neonatal intensive care are from fertility-enhanced pregnancies. The cost of such care has led countries with national health care like England and France to restrict the number of embryos placed during in vitro fertilization to three, to prevent multiple births.
Once home, parents often struggle to care for two or more infants who may have special medical needs.
Ms. Harris, 35, says she is having "the time of her life" taking care of her three 4-month-olds, with 15 feedings a day, three car seats and a stroller that looks like a stretch limousine. All were born healthy only three weeks early. But she added, "I wouldn't have had the emotional discipline to deal with this at 25."
And when the babies are born prematurely, the stress rises exponentially. All of the Cameron girls have had eye surgery, two have needed to be rehospitalized, and one needed resuscitation after she stopped breathing. Ms. Cameron makes almost weekly visits to pediatricians, eye specialists and physical therapists.
To try to minimize the number of multiple births, particularly triplets and more, experts urge prudence and a few infertility programs are now softening their approach.
 
Daily Injections Given
 Women undergoing fertility treatment are given daily doses of either Clomid or Perganol to stimulate ovulation. Ultrasound pictures of the ovaries showing how many eggs are developing generally determine the next day's dose, but the doses have slowly crept up over the last decade. Now, some programs have returned to lower doses and women who are developing too many eggs are told to use contraception to avoid a pregnancy that cycle.
The goal should be "a baby, not three or four or five," Dr. Keith said.
But I.V.F. programs live by their success rates and at prices upwards of $10,000 per try, many couples want to maximize their chance of getting pregnant with each attempt. And many women over 35 do not wait the traditional year of unprotective intercourse before deciding they are infertile.
"There is a tremendous drive to use the technologies rather than waiting and seeing and maybe getting no baby," Dr. Keith said.

Chart/Diagrams: Making a Baby: When Help Is Needed
 
If women do not conceive, doctors can use drugs or surgery to help them achieve pregnancy. Now a growing number of experts say some treatments are too aggressive, resulting in too many high-risk multiple births.

The drug clomiphene (Clomid or Serophene) is believed to work by stimulating the pituitary gland in the brain to produce hormones needed for ovulation. Sometimes it provokes release of more than one egg; about 10 percent of women who become pregnant using it have multiple births.

A more powerful drug,
Pergonal stimulates development of egg-containing follicles in the ovaries. About 20 percent of pregnancies achieved with the drug are multiple births.

Sometimes doctors surgically remove eggs for fertilization in the laboratory. This in vitro fertilization can result in
multiple births because doctors generally implant four embryos, to improve the chances of achieving pregnancy. [Diagrams]

Chart: "The Risks of Being a Twin or Triplet" -- New research is outlining just how dangerous it is to come into the world in a multiple birth. Because multiples are usually born prematurely, they are at higher risk for many problems, including bleeding in the brain, breathing difficulties and impaired vision. According to calculations by Dr. Barbara Luke of Rush Medical College in Chicago, triplets are almost three times as likely to have a severe handicap as babies born alone.

HEADLINE: Forgotten Central America

 BODY:
Whatever happened to Central America? The region has all but vanished from popular consciousness, along with Ronald Reagan's dire vision of a great red tide inching inexorably to Harlingen, Tex. Yesterday's cold war battleground is today's backwater. And Washington, after a decade of interventionism, no longer seems interested in Central America's precarious passage from war to peace, from militarism to democracy.
Yet in Nicaragua, despair haunts an elected Government struggling to disarm contra rebels and tame a Sandinista-led army. In El Salvador, old belligerents stare across an abyss of distrust as the United Nations strives to carry out a peace accord. In Guatemala, a new civilian President seeks to end the region's oldest civil war. 
 Should Americans care? Absent the overblown Soviet threat, does it matter if these small neighbors succumb to wars and revolutions? It does. In the coldest reckoning, turbulence swells a northward tide of refugees. Solidarity among democracies is not just an empty principle. And Washington cannot in good conscience abandon the victims of wars it fueled.
The Reagan Administration initiated the covert war against Nicaragua's Sandinistas. Ignoring Congress, risking scandal and flouting laws, the White House did its best to make life hell for a country perceived as a Soviet pawn. More flexibly, President Bush adopted a regional peace plan and supported the elections that brought President Violeta Chamorro to power in 1990.
At Washington's urging, she then imposed tough measures to end inflation and restore a market economy. But the human cost has been brutal. Half the population is jobless, factories are idle and farmers dirt poor. Breaking with a winner-take-all tradition, Mrs. Chamorro has striven for reconciliation with the Sandinistas. Though Washington may not like all her policies, it cannot deny that war left her country impoverished and polarized.
Nonetheless a big cut is likely in the $741 million in U.S. aid earmarked for Nicaragua this year. Washington will surely cite the hard realities of competing claims for scarce dollars. Still, it does the White House little honor to contrast the determination that led to Nicaragua's devastation with the low priority given to repairing the ruins.
The same reproach applies in El Salvador. To prevent a victory by leftist guerrillas, the Reagan team spent $6 billion on wobbly civilian regimes too weak to control a ruthless army.
When it became clear that the war was unwinnable, Mr. Bush wisely changed course and supported a U.N. peace plan. If fully carried out, rebels will be disarmed, the armed forces will be purged and notorious security units replaced by a National Civilian Police. The plan would also guarantee human rights, land reform and truly free elections.
Yet Washington's support has been tepid. Though it still owes U.N. peacekeeping dues, the Administration perversely seeks $65 million in new military aid for El Salvador, where a cease-fire is in effect. This is hard to reconcile with Mr. Bush's plea to other countries to volunteer more than their share to peacekeeping in their own regions.
What happens in El Salvador will assuredly affect neighboring Guatemala, where a parallel effort is under way to end a guerrilla war. President Jorge Serrano Elias needs Washington's active help to end the army's traditional immunity on human rights abuses. Progress is tenuous, adversaries are implacable, yet cease-fires elsewhere have built a momentum for peace.
What a triumph it would be for U.S. diplomacy to maintain that momentum. But the pity is that so few in Washington seem to notice, or to care.

HEADLINE: Canada's No Medical Model

 BODY:
Infant mortality runs twice as high among the poor as the rich . . . rates of tuberculosis among tribe members run 40 times the national average . . . health care costs are rising faster than anywhere on the continent.
Snapshots of the failing U.S. health care system? No. These findings describe Canada's vaunted national health insurance system, findings that demand notice from Americans who glibly advocate adopting the Canadian approach. 
 The point is not to ridicule the Canadians. They are justifiably proud of a system that guarantees everyone quality medical care at no direct cost. It's a humane system, superior in some ways to that in the U.S. But as appears increasingly clear, the system's reputation exceeds its performance. The United States will not solve its health care crisis by looking north.
At first glance, Canadians would seem to have it all: universal coverage and quality care at a cost of $700 less per person than in the U.S. Canadians pick their doctors and hospitals; the Government sets fees and pays the bills.
By one measure, the system appears to be working spectacularly. In the early 1970's, Canada and the U.S. each devoted about 6 percent of total output to medical care. Since then, as Canada's share rose to about 10 percent, the U.S. share zoomed to 13 percent.
But data analyzed by Health Policy International, a nonprofit research group in Princeton, N.J., show that this seeming success occurred because Canada's economy grew rapidly, not because medical costs rose slowly. Indeed, after adjusting for inflation, health costs in the 1980's rose faster in Canada than in the U.S.
There are other reasons to be wary of comparison with Canada. Proportionately, fewer Canadians are poor or old, the costliest patients. Homicide rates are a third those in the U.S. And the system saves money in ways U.S. patients might find intolerable -- by restricting access to advanced technology and quick treatment.
No Canadians wait for emergency surgery, but they routinely wait weeks for urgent surgery, like heart bypass operations, and up to a year for non-urgent procedures like hip replacements. Even so, Canadian costs by far exceed those of any industrialized nation except the U.S.
Many U.S. proposals for controlling hospital costs call for adopting Canada's system of global budgets -- setting annual payments independent of actual admissions and outlays. But recent studies should temper enthusiasm. They show hospital stays 70 percent longer than in the U.S. -- presumably because the system encourages hospitals not to release recovering patients rather than admitting expensive-to-treat new patients.
Beyond all such details hovers the question of innovation. Like most of the world, Canada freeloads off U.S. research and innovation. If the U.S. adopted the Canadian model, to whom would the world look for progress?
The United States will have to devise its own health care cost reform, if only for reasons of politics. The Canadian system works well in Canada's disciplined parliamentary democracy. Compare that with Washington, where 535 members of Congress compete for the political spotlight. The Canadian health care system is good, but not good enough to meet America's needs.

HEADLINE: U.S. Haitian Policy Is Mindless and Heartless

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As lawyers and citizens concerned about the plight of Haitian refgugees, we were deeply disturbed by your stories of May 16, "Flight of Haitians Suddenly Resumes," and May 22, "U.S., in New Policy, Will Not Pick Up All Haiti Refugees." Although it is true that Haitians recently have been fleeing their country in larger numbers, the May 16 story reflected only the United States State Department's explanation of why Haitians are fleeing and the consequences they face if they are returned.
It is our Government's position that the fleeing Haitians are economic migrants who therefore have no right to come to the United States to seek political asylum. This claim does not reflect the character of the exodus from Haiti and is refuted by the overwhelming evidence of deteriorating human rights conditions there. With the rejection of the Washington agreement in April, politically active Haitians resorted to their only alternative: flight. 
 Repression in Haiti continues unabated. Political beatings and jailings continue, and the country has no functioning judicial system, independent political parties, independent unions, or free press. Human rights monitors recently returned from Haiti characterize the situation as the worst they have ever seen in that country.
Your May 16 story accepted without question a study invoked by the State Department to justify its policy of forcibly returning many Haitians who claim to have fled for political reasons. The State Department reports that it interviewed 2,000 repatriated Haitians, none of whom had suffered reprisals upon their return.
That finding is highly suspect, however, since many of the interviews were conducted in public or in the presence of political section chiefs or military officers -- conditions under which the refugee's mere participation in the interview could provoke severe subsequent reprisals. It also is unlikely that repatriated Haitians would speak freely to U.S. officials representing the very government that had just returned them to the hands of the Haitian military. Indeed, many of the over 10,000 repatriated Haitians could not possibly have been interviewed because they are in hiding.
The State Department's claim is also contradicted by a report we have received by a plaintiff in our lawsuit who was forcibly repatriated to Haiti by the U.S. Government. On April 30 he was forced off a boat with a firehose, met at his house by armed military men and severely beaten until his arm was fractured.
Your May 16 article attributes the recent influx of refugees to "lawsuits." In fact, our lawsuit has simply focused much-needed attention on U.S. Government misconduct. The disturbing truth is that our Government is determining whether Haitians are credible candidates for asylum based on political expediency, rather than the merits of their individual claims.
Nor did this article mention the conditions on the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where thousands of Haitians are held behind barbed wire in concentration camp-like conditions, without any means of communicating with their families or relatives in the United States or in Haiti. Some, including two or three hundred unaccompanied children, have been there for months.
Although these Haitians have requested lawyers to counsel them about their legal rights, our Government repeatedly has refused to give attorneys -- or human rights organizations -- access to the base. Our lawsuit is an attempt to force the Government to comply with the law and permit those Haitians imprisoned on Guantanamo to confer with the volunteer lawyers they have retained as counsel.
Finally, we cannot fathom the Administration's decision, reported in your story of May 22, to discourage refugees from fleeing political repression in Haiti by refusing to pick them up. When conditions in Haiti become so unbearable that Haitians must flee their homeland, why does our Government respond by "encouraging" Haitians either to risk drowning or to return to the place of their repression? Whether or not such a policy helps stem the Haitian exodus, it is a mindless and heartless one that disgraces our national tradition.
What is the urgency of returning these Haitians to conditions where they face persecution and death? And what is the harm in allowing those refugees in custody to talk to their lawyers?

HEADLINE: Large Deficits Do No Economic Damage

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Now that liberals and conservatives in Congress are poised to approve a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget as early as 1995 (front page, May 7), it is again time to examine the evidence.
* The Federal Government paid off a full one-third of the national debt during the 1920's, but this sound economic policy did not lead to sustained prosperity. 
 * The deficits of the Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt Administrations of the 1930's amounted to 3 percent to 5 percent of gross national product, but were too small to end the Great Depression.
* Federal deficits in World War II were 20 percent to 31 percent of G.N.P. but, contrary to economic principles, this emergency spending brought recovery and prosperity.
* Recent deficits, the same 3 to 5 percent of G.N.P. as in the 1930's, also have been too small to end the near-depression unemployment rates that have persisted since 1975.
* The new Federal spending to rebuild Los Angeles is also an emergency that takes precedence over the existing agreement of the President and Congress aimed at reducing deficits.
The economists who advise the President and Congress apparently believe that significant deficits are justified only by all-out war or warlike destruction within this country. The evidence of history suggests that large deficits do no economic damage, and that if the Federal Government greatly increased peacetime spending, wars and runaway civil disorders might well be averted. Why wait for disasters before acting?

HEADLINE: Rappers Say the Riots Were No Surprise To Their Listeners

BYLINE: By SHEILA RULE

 BODY:
Long before the verdict in the Rodney G. King beating and the fires that engulfed South-Central Los Angeles, some black rap artists had been illuminating America's racial tensions. "Police think they have the authority to kill a minority," railed the rapper Ice Cube on "Straight Outta Compton," the 1988 debut album of N.W.A. (Niggas With Attitude).
These rappers distilled blacks' anger and prophesied its eruption to anyone who would listen. Millions of young blacks did. 
 Now, as South-Central residents rebuild, rappers differ on where their message will go from here. Some say their expressions of uncensored rage and anti-authoritarianism will not change. Others say they will call on blacks and other minority groups more insistently to organize against what they consider to be tools of white oppression, like television. But they all seem to agree on at least one thing: they are not to blame for the violence in Los Angeles.
 
'I Can't Tell Them to Stop'
 M. C. Ren, a member of N.W.A., said the message, "if that's what you want to take it as," of the group from Compton, Calif., had not changed and would not change. Critics of the group's second album, "Niggaz4Life" (Priority) said it advocated gang rape, forced oral sex and killing uncooperative prostitutes. They also said it was a self-parodying betrayal of the band and the stories of death and life in poor black neighborhoods that it once told. Still, it reached No. 1 on the pop album chart in June 1991.
"People listen to our music and realize what we talking about is right outside their front door or around the corner," said M. C. Ren, whose real name is Lorenzo Patterson. "Stuff we say on records we been saying since 1987 and 1988, telling about police brutality, but nobody wanted to listen. If the riots hadn't jumped off, that would have let people know it's all right to destroy black males. Everybody looks at black people different now; they look at it like black people are no joke. When the riots jumped off, an old white lady said, 'You got to tell them to stop.' I said I can't tell them to stop. They are mad."
Sister Souljah, a young New York rapper who has been featured on records and videos of Public Enemy and whose debut solo album, "360 Degrees of Power" (Epic) deals with police brutality, genocide, rape, sisterhood and global politics, said, "I think it would be a good idea for members of Congress and the Senate and all people who consider themselves policy makers to listen to the call for help that is generated by rap artists."
Organizing black people should now increasingly be the message, she said. Sister Souljah, whose real name is Lisa Williamson, said she and the rap artist KRS-One, whose songs and life outside music are characterized by social activism, were putting together a "10-point program that can be used to empower African youth in terms of business development, fighting for African-centered education and in terms of understanding how not to support racism." She said she hoped that the agenda, details of which are to be announced next month, would be incorporated into the messages of other rappers.
"We're going to call a meeting of other artists to see how much unity we can get from the points we're bringing," she said. "The only thing I can say now about the 10-point program is that it addresses all areas of African life, economics, education, culture, spirituality, defense and everything. It's not a militant message, but one of truth and common sense. We have to be educated on our own ethnicity. We have to have finance because without it, you become enslaved to another group of people, and we have to have defense. We can't continue to allow people who don't value African life to come into our community and shoot our people."
 
TV as Propaganda Tool
 Kam, a Los Angeles rapper whose first album, "No Justice, No Peace," is to be released this year, said his views were incorporated in his song "No Television," which attacks television as a propaganda machine.
"Rappers need to combat the negative portrayal of black people on television," said Kam, whose real name is Craig Miller. "Every time we turn on television, we're bombarded with black gang members and black dope dealers instead of positive aspects. Television programs are called programs for a reason: because they program the public. Everybody's got a television in the ghetto, and America knows this; the man and the system know this. But it's like music to black people has greater magnetism than TV, so if we can attack TV through strong rap songs, we would be inoculating our people."
The rapper Yo-Yo describes herself as a "feminist to the heart," and her message is intended for women. Her debut album last year, "Make Way for the Motherlode" (East-West/Atlantic) co-produced by Ice Cube, unveiled the organization she has created, the Intelligent Black Women's Coalition. It is meant to promote self-esteem among women, whom most male rappers dismiss in their lyrics as teases or sluts. She said she had just participated with other rappers in recording a single that deals with concerns of people in South-Central Los Angeles. A project of Mercury Records, it also includes Ice Cube, Cypress Hill, Nefertiti, Comptons Most Wanted, Kam, D. J. Quik, King T, Threat and the Lench Mob. Proceeds are to go to a relief charity in Los Angeles, which has yet to be selected.
 
Blaming Hostility, Not Songs
 "My message will remain the same," said Yo-Yo, whose real name is Yolanda Whitaker. "I have a new cut called 'Home Girl Don't Play That' that talks about survival in South-Central L.A., where I'm from. It talks about how, as a woman, you can't take no wooden nickels, no short cuts, no fast guy in a Cadillac because you'll fall into the system of being on welfare, of using drugs or getting pregnant or being a member of a gang. It's so easy to fall into that system because we're trapped in a vicious cycle."
After leaving N.W.A. in 1989, Ice Cube, whose real name is O'Shea Jackson and who declined to be interviewed for this article, released the solo albums "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted" and "Death Certificate." The latter includes "Alive on Arrival," a song about a young black man who is shot, taken to a hospital emergency room and questioned by the police about gang activity before being treated; he subsequently dies. Another song, "Black Korea," Ice Cube's revenge against Asian shopkeepers who are suspicious of their black customers, suggests a nationwide boycott and arson.
"I know that because of 'Black Korea,' people are going to immediately pop off at Ice Cube," said B-Real (Louis Freese), a member of the Mexican-American rap group Cypress Hill from Los Angeles. "But it wasn't a song that influenced the burning of stores in South-Central. It was the hostility toward the verdicts."
D. J. Yella (Antoine Carraby) of N.W.A. said, "We just talk about what we live through in the streets."

HEADLINE: The Hope Business

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
From the doorway of his formal-wear shop on Fulton Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Mortimer Roett has seen a lot of change in 25 years.
The surrounding streets, once home to crumbling brownstones and empty lots, are lined with freshly painted doorways and small apartment buildings. The old milk-bottling plant across the street has been turned into a six-story commercial complex with a supermarket, banks and a theater. And though many merchants have come and gone from the bodegas and boutiques around him, Mr. Roett and his business have prospered. 
 He and others discussing the changes in Bedford-Stuyvesant talk about hard work and hurdles overcome. Then they use a word that has long sounded in this central Brooklyn community as a beacon of hope, a symbol of progress: "Restoration."
The Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, founded by Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Jacob K. Javits in 1967, was born in an era galvanized by the civil rights movement and the specter of riot-torn cities. Hailed as the model for grass-roots community renewal across America, it has provided jobs, housing and low-interest loans to this mostly black neighborhood, serving as an anchor in a sea of urban woe.
Today -- at a time when the rioting in Los Angeles has forced the crisis of America's inner cities back to the center of debate -- Restoration, the nation's oldest community development corporation, will celebrate its 25th anniversary with a ceremony at Restoration Plaza, the former bottling plant. Proceeds from a special commemorative book will be used to start a $10 million campaign to help pay for new programs.
"In a context where urban poverty is becoming more severe, where jobs that allow a family to live above the poverty line are increasingly hard to find and where drugs have mushroomed, stabilizing a neighborhood is a real accomplishment," said Avis Vidal, director of the Community Development Research Center at the New School for Social Research, describing Restoration's work.
 
Successes and Failures
 To some, the recent violence and deepening urban poverty offer evidence that the liberal social programs of the 1960's have failed. In fact, the first 25 years of Restoration have seen both boom and bust.
But the corporation and many others that it spawned have survived, though in less ambitious form. And now its leaders and supporters say the time has come for Restoration to re-establish itself as a force for inner-city change.
Since 1982, when cuts in Federal administration aid devastated its budget, Restoration has been forced to make some changes of its own. No longer the sprawling organization that became the model for more than 2,000 local revival efforts throughout the country, Restoration has trimmed its staff from more than 300 to 36. Self-contained legal, construction and housing advocacy operations are gone. The five community outreach centers were closed. Even youth sports programs have been cut.
"We don't even have the money to do the kind of research that we need to do," said Restoration's president, Rockford Mitchell, a businessman who took over three years ago.
In dozens of interviews, local residents, community and church leaders and urban analysts agreed that Restoration's fight for self-sufficiency -- and survival -- has taken a toll.
"Restoration today is not what it once was," said Ronald Shiffman, director of Pratt Institute's Center for Community and Environmental Development and a member of the New York City Planning Commission. Because of the Federal cuts and stiff competition for private money, he said, "there has been a significant cutback, particularly in organizing."
"Consequently, there has been a diminution of its reputation within the community," he said.
But Mr. Mitchell, whose deliberate diction matches his management style, insists that Restoration is on the verge of a renaissance.
Today, he said, the organization derives most of its income from private sources, real estate and commercial investments. Several contracts have been renegotiated to improve services and profits. And last year, after 15 years of budget deficits, Restoration finished the year with an $81,000 surplus.
Plans include construction next year of another Pathmark supermarket, which will provide 200 jobs. Restoration Safe Haven, an education and drug-prevention program, will serve children ages 6 to 14 and their families. If it can find the money, Restoration will also develop additional housing for low- and moderate-income families and the elderly.
 
Problems Multiply
 Historically, the churches helped hold Bedford-Stuyvesant together.
But by the 1960's, problems were mounting faster than solutions: the level of employment had never fully recovered from the ravages of the Depression; single-family homes were subdivided to accommodate an influx of new arrivals, most of them black; absentee landlords let housing fall into disrepair; and police and sanitation services dwindled as white residents departed for the suburbs.
Though many professional and working-class families still owned their homes in Bedford-Stuyvesant, the neighborhood acquired a reputation as a ghetto.
But in 1966, inspired by a walk through the neighborhood and the work of local community advocates, Senator Kennedy pledged to try to change things. And in 1967, he and Senator Javits successfully proposed a bipartisan amendment to the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 that would provide the initial public money for Restoration.
Senator Kennedy's backing and the promise of Federal financing soon made Restoration the darling of liberal politicians and business executives across the country.
 
Influential Leadership
 With a cast of influential directors and Franklin A. Thomas, a highly regarded former deputy police commissioner, as Restoration's president, success seemed almost inevitable.
In the years that followed, Restoration built or rehabilitated thousands of housing units using local labor. A Restoration-run mortgage pool provided local residents with more than $80 million in mortgages. After considerable coaxing, I.B.M. built a plant nearby that employs about 400 people. Supermarkets General entered a joint-venture with Restoration to open a Pathmark, the first supermarket in the neighborhood in 20 years.
The bottling plant was transformed into Restoration Plaza, a 300,000-square-foot commercial complex that houses Restoration's headquarters. And a family health center, a Restoration subsidiary, was opened across the street.
But then came the deep Federal cuts. Having relied on the public support for about 70 percent of its budget, Restoration found itself on the brink of bankruptcy, compromised by delinquent mortgage loans and several poorly managed deals.
So, over the protests of many residents and some staff members, Restoration began amputating. Over the next several years, it would close its community outreach centers, sell off several subsidiaries and over $4 million in real estate, and switch from providing mortgage loans to revolving loans for businesses -- all to keep from having to shut down.
 
Fewer on Public Assistance
 Despite such cutbacks, there are few people in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where an estimated 300,000 Caribbean newcomers and long-time residents intermingle, who can say they have not been touched in one way or another by Restoration.
One of Restoration's most enduring legacies may be the emergence of half a dozen other community development groups in the area. And some statistics suggest that Restoration's neighbors may have fared better in recent years than residents of some other poor areas.
According to the New York City Human Resources Administration, the percentage of people citywide living on public assistance rose from 11.6 to 12.8 percent between 1980 and 1990. In central Harlem, the percentage rose as well. In Bedford-Stuyvesant, it dropped from 32.5 to 27.6 percent.
Standing between rows of dresses in his formal-wear shop, Mr. Roett talks of attending free weekly business classes that Restoration offered local merchants in the mid-1970's. On his cluttered desk in the basement are plans to expand his business four-fold in a space rented from Restoration Plaza. "They have been very helpful," he said.
Mary Banks, 58, who owns a fabric store nearby, was not so pleased. She acknowledged that her business has been bolstered by shoppers drawn to Restoration Plaza and that a storefront improvement plan had helped her replace her display window.
But a few years ago, when she went looking for a loan from Restoration, she said she was told she did not have enough money to qualify. "They said I had to have $10,000 before I could get a loan," Ms. Bates said as she whisked through bolts of cotton and rayon prints. "No, they didn't help me at all."
Still, those who walk along Fulton Street, past the Burger King that Restoration helped bring to the area, past the sidewalks filled with local vendors, say that if nothing else, Restoration has brought a sense of permanence.
"They have done a lot for the area," said Queenie Lawrence, a 46-year-old school volunteer, who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant with her son, Lamont. "It's a nice, safe place. But people still feel oppressed here for the simple reason that they want things for their children and there are no jobs. We all know there is still a long way to go."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Announces Surplus Has Grown And Drops Tax Plan

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins said last night that the city would finish the current fiscal year with a surplus somewhat higher than it projected last month. The larger surplus, he said, would enable him to withdraw a proposal for $115 million in new taxes that he had been seeking from an obviously reluctant State Legislature.
In a letter to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and state legislative leaders that was released last night, the Mayor said that the city's surplus had grown to $515 million, because revenues from some business taxes were higher than estimated and because the city had spent less money than expected. 
 While Mr. Dinkins said the surplus had increased by $60 million from his previous estimate, City Council officials said he was still significantly underestimating the surplus, signaling a battle to determine how big the surplus is and then how to spend it.
Last month, in proposing his $29.5 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1, the Mayor said that the city had run up a $455 million surplus during the current fiscal year. Mr. Dinkins said the money would enable the city to avoid borrowing money to cover its spending next year and to offset Federal aid that the city was unlikely to receive.
The Mayor also said at the time that he would continue to press in Albany for the $115 million in new taxes, including additional levies on cigarettes, tobacco and alcohol, and the first increase in the commuter-earnings tax in 21 years.
But in his letter last night, Mr. Dinkins said that "modestly improved revenues from business-related taxes and modest underspending" would allow the city to balance its budget for the coming fiscal year without the new taxes. The taxes required the approval of the Legislature, whose leaders had indicated great reluctance to support the measures while the city was running a surplus.
Specifically, city budget officials said that of the $60 million increase in the surplus, $25 million would come from lower-than-expected spending and $35 million would come from higher-than-expected business and corporate taxes.
The rest of the $115 million in the withdrawn tax package will be made up during the coming fiscal year, again in money from increased tax revenues and extra constraints on city spending, said Philip R. Michael, the city's budget director.
 
Complex Politics
 Given the complex politics that surround the city's finances, the announcement of the larger surplus was both good and bad news for the Mayor, who has spent nearly all his 29 months in office fending off dismal budget developments. The extra money shows that the administration has worked aggressively to rein in expenses and that budget officials were cautious in their estimates of the city's tax revenues.
But while the Mayor will no doubt receive credit for cautious budgeting and solid management, the extra money will also subject him to additional pressure from labor, the Board of Education, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and many others seeking part of the city's surplus.
The City Council is also likely to get into the fight over how to spend the surplus. Council officials said last night that they believed the size of the surplus would ultimately increase to nearly $700 million, and they indicated that they would want to decide how some of the additional money would be spent.
Of the Council's larger estimate of the surplus, Mr. Michael said, "We certainly don't see it."
Labor leaders immediately demanded a share of the surplus for their members, most of whom are working under contracts that have expired. Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the largest municipal union, said last night that when he begins a new round of bargaining with the city next week, "We will want our share of the surplus."
 
Credibility Questions
 Mr. Hill also contended that the Mayor's aides had made him look bad by allowing him to go to Albany earlier in the month to lobby for the tax package and then changing their estimate of the size of the surplus. "We're very concerned about the credibility of the Mayor's people," Mr. Hill said.
After the administration issued its budget proposal last month and acknowledged that it had built up a large surplus in the current fiscal year, Mr. Hill and other labor leaders angrily denounced Mr. Dinkins. They accused him of having previously distorted the city's fiscal picture to obtain labor concessions.
Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, said that the expanded surplus would no doubt complicate the city's labor relations. "It's clearly more difficult for the city and labor leadership to ask for austerity from the rank and file if the city appears to be in a better financial picture than had been viewed before," Mr. Rohatyn said.
Mr. Rohatyn also called the Mayor's announcement "good news for the city's economy."
Late last week, many of those who monitor the city's finances said privately that they would not be surprised if the size of the surplus had grown.
But administration officials sought last week to downplay any possible growth in the surplus. David Smith, a deputy budget director, said in an interview on Thursday that some movement in the size of the surplus was inevitable.
"It is as likely to be down as up, but it is not likely to be very big," Mr. Smith said then.

HEADLINE: HAITIANS RETURNED UNDER NEW POLICY

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
The Coast Guard returned the first boatload of Haitians to Port-au-Prince today under President Bush's new policy of accepting no more refugees at the United States naval base at Guantanamo, Cuba, the White House announced.
The decision to return Haitians without giving them immigration hearings at Guantanamo has been bitterly denounced by human rights organizations. 
 The policy has been to grant refugee status only to those who can establish during interviews at Guantanamo that they are political, not economic, refugees. Human rights groups say the stricter policy is morally indefensible, runs counter to the identity of the United States as a nation of immigrants and will only encourage other countries to follow suit.
The change also drew criticism from Gov. Bill Clinton, who has all but locked up the Democratic Presidential nomination. Asked in Little Rock, Ark., today whether he approved of the Bush policy on Haiti, he said:
"If I were President, in the absence of clear and compelling evidence that they were not political refugees, I would give them temporary asylum here until we restored the elected Government of Haiti. I would turn up the heat and try to restore the elected Government and meanwhile let the refugees stay here."
Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, said he would introduce either a resolution or a bill to require the Administration to interview Haitian boat people on the high seas to determine whether they were entitled to refugee status.
Mr. Bush's new guidelines were announced Sunday in an effort to stem the outflow of refugees. Haitians have been taking to sea in flimsy boats by the hundreds in recent days.
Today, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, announced at a briefing that "a handful of Haitians were rescued at sea this morning and are being returned." There were 38 Haitians on the boat.
A State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said that the refugees were told they could apply for asylum at the United States Embassy in Port-au-Prince, and that 17 had agreed and were taken to the embassy to fill out forms.
 
'Most Rational Approach'
 Mr. Fitzwater said the Haiti issue was a "difficult" one but that President Bush's change in policy -- which seemed to take many State Department officials by surprise -- was necessary.
"We have thousands of people on the seas that are being threatened -- 18 died yesterday or the day before -- and people are dying every day on these little ships that they're trying to take out," he said. "The most rational approach in terms of safety and humanitarian concerns is to try to process these applications at the embassy, and those that are qualified are then granted asylum."
Nevertheless the new policy was roundly denounced by human rights organizations.
"I empathize with the Government," said the Rev. Richard Ryscavage, head of the Office of Migration and Refugee Services of the United States Catholic Conference. "They are in a difficult bind. But this policy is a national tragedy because it represents a turning of our backs on our very core tradition of receiving newcomers." Father Ryscavage's office is under contract from the Justice Department to provide social and legal services to Haitian immigrants.
 
'Short-Sighted Quick Fix'
 Father Ryscavage said the new policy was a "short-sighted quick fix that will ultimately backfire, because unless you deal with the core issues you will have continuing emigration, and the core issue is not migration -- the core issue is Haiti."
Lionel Rosenblatt, executive director of Refugees International, said the policy "only gives other countries license to turn back refugees from around the world without the right to assert political-refugee status."
Mr. Rosenblatt recalled that in 1980, tens of thousands of Cubans fled to Florida quickly by boat, and that President Jimmy Carter was was hurt politically because he was seen as having lost control of the situation.
"That was an election year and this is an election year," he said.
More United States officials are acknowledging that something needs to be done if Haiti is going to be stabilized, but they insist that they are caught between two fundamental problems.
On one side, they say, is the fact that the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the democratically elected President who was ousted Sept. 30, was an imperfect democrat at best. Father Aristide intimidated many opponents with threats to unleash his political supporters on them, and thus his return to Haiti is still looked upon with great ambivalence by many in the military, in business and in Parliament.
On the other side, officials say, is the fact that the coalition of army, business and parliamentary figures who ousted Father Aristide have not coalesced into a coherent political force that could run the country.
Power in Port-au-Prince today is so widely dispersed that many of the sanctions introduced by the Organization of American States have had little political impact but an enormously negative economic impact.
Therefore, some officials say that what is needed in Haiti is some sort of international apparatus or peacekeeping force. It could insure that Father Aristide's return would not unnerve the opposition or leave him feeling vulnerable to another coup. This could provide some time for the country to introduce the political and economic reforms needed for a long-term solution.

HEADLINE: Fake-Money Flood Is Aimed At Crippling Iraq's Economy

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, May 24

 BODY:
Iraq's economy is the target of an American-led destabilization campaign to pour vast amounts of counterfeit currency into the country, Arab and Western officials here say.
The fake dinar notes are being smuggled across the Jordanian, Saudi, Turkish and Iranian borders in an effort to undermine the Iraqi economy, said the officials here who closely monitor the situation inside Iraq. Those officials said counterfeit dollars are being smuggled into Iraq in smaller quantities to further confound the banking system. The officials, who insisted on not being identified, said the countries behind the separate counterfeiting operations included Western nations, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Israel. 
 The fake currency is openly discussed in the press and by the people in Iraq. The counterfeiting problem has become serious enough to be loudly denounced by the Government, which is taking measures to curb it, including instituting life sentences for cooperating in circulating counterfeit dollars or dinars and death sentences for those who smuggle them into the country.
 
Efforts in High Gear
 The fake currency has contributed to Iraq's severe inflation problem, which is aggravated by the fact that the Iraqi Government is printing money at uncontrolled speed to pay inflated salaries and cover the costs of reconstruction.
Over the last few months, the destabilization efforts seem to have shifted into high gear, officials here say, particularly after the United States was reported in February to have authorized full-fledged covert operations against Iraq.
[In Washington, Mark Mansfield, a spokesman for the Central Intelligence Agency, declined to discuss the dumping of fake currency in Iraq. "As a matter of policy we don't comment on such allegations," he said.]
 
Pressure on Saddam Hussein
 Along with international economic sanctions against Iraq, those measures have had mixed results since the Persian Gulf war ended in February 1991. They have clearly helped weaken the economy to the point where the local currency could become worthless, and they have loosened Mr. Hussein's grip on the people and forced his Government to respond with an intensified reconstruction program to curtail shortages and restore basic services.
On the other hand, the measures buttressed the assertion, shared by a rising number of Iraqi nationalists including Sunni Muslims and Christians, that the West and its allies will not be content with the removal of Saddam Hussein, but only with partitioning and destroying the country.
Further weakening the economy is the fact that legitimate Iraqi currency is not backed by any gold or hard currency because those are being used to import goods.
As a result, the dinar, which has a fixed rate of exchange equivalent to three United States dollars, has a real value of about 2 percent of that.
"You can get as much as 21 dinar to the dollar when things are really going badly but it does not get better than 16 dinars to the dollar," a diplomat said.
Some Iraqi travelers interviewed here, including businessmen, said they expected the currency value to plunge much farther soon.
Since Iraq stopped doing business with Brtiain during the gulf crisis and began printing its own money on lower-quality paper, counterfeiting has become much easier, various sources said.
 
Entry Points for Fake Money
 "People joke about it and some have become experts in telling which denominations are printed in Israel, the United States or in Saudi Arabia," said an Iraqi who insisted not being identified.
Iraq accused Washington of masterminding a campaign to smuggle counterfeit currency into Iraq "to sabotage the Iraqi economy in cooperation with Iran and Saudi Arabia," according to a May 6 letter to the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
Counterfeit money was dropped by United States helicopters in the southern marshland areas, in Mandali and in al-Tib in the Maysan governorate, said the letter from the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Ahmad Hussein.
The letter, reported by the Iraqi press agency and reprinted in Iraqi newspapers, said counterfeit money was entering the country through the Turkish and Jordanian borders as well.
 
Stiff Punishment Imposed
 A Saudi official, who insisted on not being identified, concurred with the reports, saying that "all borders are being used."
Similarly, a senior Jordanian official agreed with the report, saying Jordan "does not approve of it, but we can do little to stop it".
The Israeli Government has made no public acknowledgement of any participation in such an operation.
On May 10, the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council issued a decree withdrawing all 100 dinar bills. It said unless the larger bills were turned over to the banks in return for bills of different denominations, they would be worthless ""within 30 days".
On May 20, the Iraqi Ministry of Justice instructed the courts to hand down the stiff sentences for circulating the money.
Most stores in big Iraqi cities have acquired machines to detect fake currency, and many merchants have stopped accepting large-denomination bills.
 
Insuring Basic Supplies
 Despite wide-ranging efforts to undermine Mr. Hussein, Jordanian officials who are familiar with the power structure in Iraq say the Government is not about to fall, even though public discontent is widespread.
Western diplomats assigned here to keep watch on Iraq say Mr. Hussein has surrounded himself and the rest of the ruling establishment with some 45,000 men spread over four different security services and units of the Republican guards.
"He is looking like a big fish in small pond that keeps on getting smaller, but those who surround him are generously compensated and most of them know their fate is tied to his," a foreign diplomat who insisted on not being identified said.
Diplomats say Iraq has made sure that its reserve funds are used to insure the supply of basic foods to the population to avoid an outright revolt.
"It's not Somalia, where they haven't seen meat in ages," a Western diplomat said. "Government rations insure a minimum of 1,300 calories per person and in most cases, the subsistence level of 1,600 calories is available to most Iraqis."
 
Circumventing Sanctions
 "Basic goods are isolated from the market mechanism and remain available to most people under a rationing system regardless of the hyperinflation," said Fahd al-Fanek, a Jordanian economist who has visited Iraq recently.
Iraq's Minister of Education and Scientific Research, Abdelrazak al-Hashemi, said in a recent interview from Amman: "We are not going to stop living just because sanctions are maintained and we will not accept humiliating conditions to export oil. The Iraqi people realize that this campaign is aimed at our country, its purpose being to partition Iraq and destroy it as a nation, but these dreams will never happen."
Despite the stern sanctions imposed on the country's imports, the Iraqi Government appears able to obtain not only essential goods but forbidden imports of some spare parts for factories, using a vast cache of gold and hard currency.
The Iraqi Government has made great headway in its reconstruction program, reinstituting basic services that were destroyed or damaged by the gulf war in Baghdad and other major cities.
Iraqis and Jordanians say about 110 or 130 bridges destroyed during the war have been repaired. Electricity cutoffs have stopped in Baghdad and telephone service to the capital has largely resumed.
 
Iraqi Funds Unfrozen
 A Western diplomat said the crucial highway linking the Jordanian border to Baghdad, a vital connection with the outside world, has been resurfaced with abundant asphalt produced by Iraq's rejuvenated oil refineries and is "one of the best in the world."
Diplomats say Iraq finds some comfort also in dealing with countries on its borders within the limits of United Nations sanctions.
After Saudi Arabia cut oil supplies to Jordan during the gulf crisis, for example, Iraq began exporting 55,000 barrels of oil per day to Jordan, of which 33,000 barrels a day are free of charge, bringing much goodwill toward the Iraqis. The balance of the oil is sold at a fixed price of $16 a barrel in return for goods that Jordan exports that are permitted under the sanctions regime imposed on Iraq by the United Nations.
Elsewhere, as Iraqi funds are unfrozen slowly in various parts of the world, Iraq is able to continue to buy foods and permitted items, thus further alleviating shortages.
 
Clandestine Radio
 Furthermore, Jordanians and Iraqis say, Mr. Hussein is tolerating some discontent and petty corruption as measures to release some steam.
Iraqis who were not able to leave the country because they were blacklisted, for instance, have been able to obtain passports with bribes while the regime looks the other way.
But Mr. Fanek said that the policy of humiliating Iraq is backfiring as most Iraqis, and more Arabs, have come to look on the West not as a savior but as an oppressor.
On other fronts, the broad campaign to destabilize the Government of Mr. Hussein includes clandestine radio stations and dissident militias financed and organized by the United States, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Israel, Britain and France.
The stations broadcast in Arabic, Kurdish and Turkmen, inveighing the population to revolt, according to Western diplomats assigned to Amman, Iraqi travelers, and Jordanian officials, all of whom insisted that their names be withheld.
While part of the destabilization plan, like the counterfeit smuggling operations, is coordinated by Western allies separately with Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Israel, other efforts like Iran's and Saudi Arabia's arming and finanacing of dissidents reflect competition with Western allies rather than cooperation with their efforts.
Iran has steadily worked to bring down the Iraqi Government in favor of a Shiite Islamic republic fashioned on its own model, particularly in the oil-producing south around Basra.
Saudi Arabia, which does not want to see an Iranian-style government on its borders, is working on assembling and organizing exiled Iraqi dissidents who are former officers and officials of the ruling Baath party.

HEADLINE: Belgrade, Facing Curbs, Offers U.N. Role in Bosnia

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 26

 BODY:
In an eleventh-hour effort to head off mandatory Security Council sanctions, the leadership of the Serbian-led Yugoslav Government offered today to work with the United Nations to end the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to speed the flow of emergency relief supplies there.
It also asked the 15-nation Security Council to send a delegation to visit the region in order to assess the situation and avoid what it described as "judgments based on assumptions rather than established facts." 
 The offer to help put an end to the fighting came in a letter sent to the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, as Security Council members began drafting a new resolution imposing a series of sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro, the only remaining constituent republics of Yugoslavia, for encouraging the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is unclear what effect the Yugoslavian offer will have on the drive for sanctions. But officials from the United States and Britain said they saw it as a delaying tactic and predicted the Security Council would move ahead with punitive measures as planned, arguing that Belgrade still has not given the assurances they want on such matters as preserving the ethnic composition of Bosnia and Herzegovina and ending all outside interference in its affairs.
The United States, Britain and France are currently trying to draft such a resolution, but Russia and China, the other Security Council members with veto power, have been hesitant.
 
Europe Ponders Options
 In Brussels, experts from the 12 European Community countries were also reviewing options for the separate sanctions they are threatening to impose on Belgrade, with options ranging from an oil embargo that would involve blockading Adriatic ports to recommending that Yugoslavia be banned from this summer's Olympic Games.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, is currently on a visit to the region and some diplomats said they believe his assessment of Belgrade's apparent change of policy could have an influence on Council members' approach to sanctions.
Speaking on Bosnia and Herzegovina state television after talks in Sarajevo, its besieged capital, Mr. Kozyrev said that rival Serbian and Croatian-Muslim Slav forces have agreed to a new cease-fire and the reopening of Sarajevo airport on Wednesday so that emergency supplies of food and medicine can be flown in.
Council members have been discussing a series of graduated measures intended to slowly increase the pressure on Belgrade to cooperate with United Nations and other peace efforts.
The idea was to start with a civil air transport embargo, followed possibly by suspension of oil deliveries, the expulsion of Yugoslavia from all international organizations and the freezing of its foreign assets. The threat of a full-scale embargo would be held in reserve.
In Lisbon over the weekend, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d called for sanctions against the Belgrade Government, accusing it of not trying to stop the fighting. The United States has not broken diplomatic relations with the Belgrade Government, but has argued that it must reapply for United Nations membership.
This would allow Washington to veto Belgrade's readmission, thus denying it international legitimacy.
Yugoslav diplomats here described Belgrade's offer today as a new development that the Council must take into account in its deliberations and said they hoped the letter would slow the drive to impose sanctions.
 
Yugoslav Army Withdrawn
 In the letter, the Yugoslav Vice President, Branko Kostic, wrote that the Serbian-led Yugoslav Army has now been fully withdrawn from Bosnia and Herzegovina and called on the republic to resolve its internal problems through negotiation between its principal ethnic groups, as the European Community has proposed. Serbians within Bosnia and Herzegovina have been battling Croatian and Muslim Slav forces there since the republic declared its independence from the old Yugoslav federation.
Mr. Kostic wrote that Serbia and Montenegro "will wholeheartedly support any action conducive to a settlement to the crisis," but that sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, would create "very serious problems for the citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia without any reason or justification.
Belgrade promised to appeal "to all the embattled parties to immediately terminate the bombing of Sarajevo and Mostar and the destruction of other cities and historical monuments."
It also promised to "publicly disassociate itself from all unacceptable acts committed by paramilitary formations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including formations of the Serbian population, and appeal for a cease-fire to be observed in favor of patient search for a political solution."

HEADLINE: Whittle's School Unit Gains Prestige and Pressure

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

 BODY:
Christopher Whittle, the maverick media entrepreneur, gained instant credibility and considerable publicity when he landed Benno C. Schmidt Jr., the president of Yale University, to lead his ambitious effort to create a national private-school system.
But the hard questions begin now. Can they succeed when generations of equally ambitious school reformers have failed? And will the pressure to produce profits make it harder to run radically different schools at the same or lower costs than public schools? 
 Mr. Whittle spills over with provocative ideas, but cheerfully admits he and Mr. Schmidt are two years away from producing any concrete plans, so it will be some time before the public and their own investors have any idea how viable their venture, the Edison Project, really is.
Many educators said they welcomed the competition and the investment of $60 million that Mr. Whittle's backers have made to design new schools. But several also raised questions of elitism, the role of profitability in education and the project's political agenda in a time of fierce debate over the Bush Administration's proposals to use public money to pay private-school tuitions.
 
'A Dual Educational System'
 "I wish Whittle well, but this still leaves the problem of solving the condition of public education," said Christopher T. Cross, executive director of Education Intiative, a part of the Business Roundtable, an association of major corporations. "If we aren't careful as a society you could go back to creating a dual educational system, this time not based on race but on economic capability."
Mr. Whittle proposes a network of 1,000 private schools charging about $5,500 tuition, with about 20 percent of all students on scholarship. A few of these schools would be in inner cities, where scholarship help would have to be greater, subsidizied by tuitions paid in wealthier areas..
Mr. Whittle believes his private schools will, indeed, change public schools -- through the same kind of consumer pressure that underpins the Administration's education strategy. This is the idea of "choice," or voucher system, that allows dissatisfied parents to leave public schools and take their tax money with them.
Such voucher plans have already been met with stiff political opposition, and Congress has effectively killed President Bush's proposals for now. But vouchers or no vouchers, Mr. Whittle says his schools will be so good they will convince parents of the need for choice.
 
The Weapon of Choice
 At the heart of the Edison Project is an idea that also guides the strategy developed under Education Secretary Lamar Alexander, a former business associate of Mr. Whittle. It is hopeless to expect change from within this school system, this reasoning runs, so parents must be given the weapon of choice to force changes in public schools.
Indeed, the prime architect of the Bush strategy, Chester E. Finn Jr., is a longtime critic of public schools who is now a member of the Edison Project's design team.
Although Mr. Whittle's schools would be private, his Edison Project is remarkably similar to Mr. Alexander's New American Schools proposal to create 535 radically different public schools, one in each Congressional district and two in each state, which would then spur other schools to change. Later this summer the New American Schools Development Corporation will give out privately financed grants to design teams, many of whom have suggested proposals similar to Mr. Whittle's.
Secretary Alexander said that because of his past business dealings with Mr. Whittle, he has made it a practice not to comment on his former associate's ventures.
Although Mr. Whittle says his own ideas may bear no resemblance to the ones his design team eventually adopts, he now envisions a nationwide network of campuses combining day care and elementary and high schools, open 11 months a year and running at least eight hours a day. The $5,500 tuition is the average cost per child in a public school.
To make a profit he will have to keep actual costs far lower than that, and is betting he can do so by relying on more volunteers, fewer bureaucrats and teachers, the latest technology and students who perform a wide array of services, ranging from tutoring others to cleaning bathrooms.
Virtually all of these ideas are culled from existing schools or educators' proposals, but no single school or district combines them.
"It's easy to say these things but tough to put them into practice," said Theodore R. Sizer, an educator who has spent years working to overhaul the Coalition of Essential Schools, a network of about 200 public schools scattered around the country.
Mr. Whittle contends that he will succeed precisely because he is able to start from scratch, while reformers like Mr. Sizer must struggle with existing schools that often fight change. "Very few have had the luxury to say, 'Were we to start completely over, how would we do this?' " he said. "There is a luxury in being a new entry."
Almost half of all money spent in public schools is not spent directly in classrooms, but on such support services as guidance counselors, librarians, psychologists, food services, transportation and administration. And it is here that Mr. Whittle believes he can dramatically cut costs.
Mr. Sizer said he was skeptical that Mr. Whittle's cost-saving ideas would save as much money as he would need to offset the investments he promises to make in new technology, day care and other services.
Some other entrepreneurs have already started to test the waters Mr. Whittle wants to roil. Education Alternatives Inc., a Minneapolis-based company, is the first in the United States to run a public school under contract for profit -- an option Mr. Whittle is also considering. The company runs the South Pointe Elementary School in Miami Beach and is serving as the interim superintendent for public schools in Duluth, Minn.
 
A Dubious Marriage
 Other educators are uneasy about the marriage of profits and education. Would a bad year force a school to close abruptly, stranding students? Would a squeeze on profits mean compromising on quality?
"There's a public good in education that seems to me to be absolutely critical, and how that gets played out in a profit system is completely unclear to me," said Marshall Smith, dean of the Stanford School of Education. He and several other educators cited the example of "proprietary" or trade schools, some of which have been accused of exploiting working-class students who enroll and failing to teach them the promised skills.
Mr. Whittle dismisses such questions, saying that if he cut back on quality no one would enroll in his schools.
Many of his critics are suspicious about Mr. Whittle's grandest educational venture to date, Channel One, a news show for teen-agers now shown in 10,000 schools, which received free televisions and video equipment in return for showing the 12-minute show in its entirety, including 2 minutes of commercials.
A recent report commissioned by Whittle Communications on Channel One's first year found that it was popular among students and teachers but did little to increase students' knowledge of current events. Mr. Whittle says the researchers wrongly labeled insignificant a 3.3 percent difference in scores on a current-events test given to students who watched Channel One. The venture is by far his company's most profitable.
Despite questions, many educators say let Mr. Whittle try -- and they will gladly eat crow if he succeeds.
"It's easy to throw stones at Chris Whittle," Mr. Sizer said. "To make public schols that people don't want to leave -- that's the challenge."

The Wage Gap: Sins of Omission

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
EVERYBODY agrees that incomes were less equal by the end of the 1980's than at the beginning. There is hardly a consensus, though, on why.
The collapse of the two-parent family -- Dan Quayle's flavor of the month -- surely had something to do with harder times at the bottom end, as did Washington's squeeze on welfare and other direct assistance to the very poor. So, too, did the big cut in the top Federal income tax brackets: while high-end earners shouldered an increasing proportion of the total tax burden in the 1980's, flattened tax rates also allowed them to keep a larger proportion of total national income. 
 But the fuel that really supercharged the engine of inequality was changes in pay rates. While average wages hardly budged during the decade, the gap in earnings between college and high school graduates widened by a stunning 16 percent for men and 12 percent for women.
Like so many explanations in the politically charged debate over income inequality, this one raises yet another question. Why, after decades of narrowing, did wages shift so decisively in favor of the educated?
Economists have come up with more or less convincing theories ranging from the decline of unions to the wretched state of public education. But until the publication of a study by John Bound and George Johnson of the University of Michigan in the latest issue of The American Economic Review, there had been no comprehensive measure of the relative importance of the leading candidates. And while the Bound-Johnson analysis turns on some daunting econometrics, their conclusions are easily summarized in plain English.
One common-sense explanation for the widening wage gap is the decline of industries that for reasons of tradition, or unionization, or lack of competition, provided all those $12-an-hour jobs that vaulted blue-collar workers into the middle class. This effect is confirmed by number crunching. But the two Michigan economists found that the overall impact on the wage gap was modest: just one-fifth of the change for men and one-eighth for women from 1979 to 1988 seems to have been the consequence of socking it to unskilled labor.
Falling demand for products from industries that paid good blue-collar wages might explain more. It might, but does not. The composition of demand probably did do some damage to Rust Belt icons, notably steel, autos and rubber. But the effect was offset by growth in demand in a few high-wage industries -- health care, for example.
Then there is the question of labor supply. If additions to the labor force had reduced the proportion of workers with college degrees, one might have expected that the changes in relative wages would have favored the educated. Again, a nice try, but no cigar: during the 1980's, the work force became more educated, not less. In fact, the econometrics suggests that the trend toward greater education actually slowed the widening of the wage gap by half.
The real culprit, say the two economists, was technological change that made the skills of educated workers more valuable relative to the skills of the uneducated. Just why this happened is unclear. But one way or another, it seems that technology blessed those who already had a leg up in the job market.
Those toiling to re-elect George Bush might take comfort from the analysis. After all, it was apparently the anonymous forces of technical change -- not Republican union-busting or Japanese imports -- that sapped blue-collar wages.
But there is a less attractive interpretation. While it hardly would have made sense to slow technological change in order to narrow the wage gap, Washington might have responded by making it easier for the economic losers to get the education that leads to better-paying jobs. That would have increased social mobility at a critical moment. And by slowing the rate of growth of the unskilled labor force, it would even have helped those who never made it to college.
In fact, few analysts contend that increased Federal interest in public education in recent years has yet improved the quality of the product. And in the one area where money alone would have been most likely to make a tangible difference, the movement has been backward: higher-education aid was trimmed during a decade when tuition was rising and blue-collar parents were in no position to save for college.
The Michigan economists offer no reason to expect that what technology took from blue-collar workers in the 1980's will be given back in the 1990's. But there is some hope that Washington will pull up its socks and make sure that cash is not a barrier to college. Both Bill Clinton and George Bush now support tuition-loan programs that would allow anyone to borrow, repaying the money down the road with surcharges on their income taxes.

HEADLINE: Philip C. Habib, a Leading U.S. Diplomat, Dies at 72

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
Philip C. Habib, a Brooklyn-born Lebanese-American who was one of the United States policymakers in the Middle East and Asia for decades, died Monday while vacationing in France. He was 72 years old.
Mr. Habib died of a heart attack, the United States Embassy said. He lived in Belmont, Calif. 
 Mr. Habib served in the Foreign Service for nearly three decades, and many years in retirement as a trouble-shooter, crafting for himself a reputation as a tough and shrewd negotiator. He is credited with helping to arrange the cease-fire in Lebanon and the Palestine Liberation Organization's withdrawal from that country in 1982 following the Israeli invasion. He also played an important role in persuading President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines to go into exile in 1986.
 
Advisor to 3 Administrations
 A former Ambassador to South Korea, he helped craft foreign policy across the region both in that capacity and later as a top advisor to three Administrations. Although he officially retired from the Foreign Service in 1978, citing health problems, he was recalled just a year later to work as a special adviser to Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance.
He became known as a tough trouble-shooter on behalf of the United States. His final assignment came in 1987, when he was called upon by President Reagan to be a special envoy in Central America. He resigned that post, and severed his ties with Government in August of that year.
Just before his death, Mr. Habib had travelled to Evian, France to give a speech at the Bilderberg Conference, an annual meeting of European and United States scholars and intellectuals. Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, who also spoke at that conference, yesterday recalled Mr. Habib as "every Secretary of State's idea of a great foreign service officer."
Dr. Kissinger first met Mr. Habib in Vietnam in the mid 1960's and recalled having been immediately impressed with his acumen and irreverence.
"I was taken to meet him by Ambassador Lodge," Dr. Kissinger said in a telephone interview, referring to Henry Cabot Lodge, who was then United States Ambassador to Saigon. "And when I met him, he said, 'I bet you are one of those Harvard smart alecs who knows everything.' Then he told me to go to the provinces and 'see what was really going on.' "
In his speech at the Bilderberg Conference, Mr. Habib spoke about the need to maintain the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the importance of America's ties with Europe. Then, according to those who attended, in a departure from his usual preoccupations with foreign affairs, he spoke at length about United States domestic issues, stressing the need for America to stand by its moral principles.
Friends said his involvement in that conference was typical of the elder statesman who, despite near fatal heart attacks dating to the late 1970's and two open-heart surgeries, never abandoned his interest in world affairs.
"He had no business going to these things," said Leslie H. Gelb, a former Pentagon and State Department official who worked with Mr. Habib in the 1960's at the height of the Vietnam conflict. "But he wanted to live, not just stay alive." Mr. Gelb is now a columnist with The New York Times.
Mr. Habib was remembered yesterday by friends as a man of zest, creativity and relentless earnestness in the face of great odds.
"He was the guy everybody knew," said Morton Abramowitz, the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and a veteran of 30 years in the State Department. "Phil's career runs the gamut of all U.S. foreign policy. But he was particularly involved in the transformation of Asia. He contributed fundamentally to the shaping of foreign policy in that area."
Although Mr. Habib's expertise in the Foreign Service was mostly in Asia, particularly in Vietnam in the 1960's, where he was involved in the behind-the-scenes politics in Washington that eventually led President Johnson in 1968 to press for a negotiated end to the war, he was perhaps best remembered in later years for his work in the Middle East.
 
Lebanese From Bensonhurst
 A Lebanese Maronite Christian who grew up in a predominantly Jewish section of Bensonhurst, Mr. Habib became Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs in 1976. He remained in that post in the new Carter Administration and continued until he suffered the first of his heart attacks in December 1977.
In retirement, he became a popular trouble-shooter for President Reagan. He was called upon to help hammer out a peace settlement in Lebanon, which later collapsed. For that work, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1982.
In fact, his diplomatic career started almost on a whim. According to his daughter, Phyllis, Mr. Habib had planned a career as a forest ranger. A graduate of the College of Forestry and Wildlife and Range Sciences at the University of Idaho, Mr. Habib was studying for his Ph.D. in agricultural economics at the University of California at Berkley when spotted a notice for a test to enter the State Department. "He decided to take the test," said Ms. Habib. "And he passed it." His first assignments took him to postings Canada and New Zealand.
The Vietnam War changed his life, however, and established his career as a diplomat.
"He was one of my heroes," Mr. Kissinger said. "The great thing about him was that he was a terrific soldier." Inside the State Department he won a reputation as a man who would fight over issues about which he cared deeply. Yet he was known, too, as a professional who followed orders.
During his tenure as Secretary of State, Mr. Kissinger said he relied heavily on Mr. Habib's advice. "I might not do what he said," he recalled. "But I wouldn't make a move without finding out what he thought."
Mr. Habib, a gourmet and connoisseur of fine wines, was on a vacation with friends in Puligny-Montrachet, in the Cote d'Or region, when he collapsed, his daughter, said. Agence France-Presse, the French news agency, reported that he suffered a heart attack at his hotel and could not be revived by a medical team.
Mr. Habib was living in retirement in the family's home of 17 years in Belmont, California. He was a Senior Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, and was on the Board of Directors of the American University in Beirut. He also served on the Board of Directors of the Audi Bank of California, according to his daughter.
After his retirement, Mr. Habib remained an active alumnus of the University of Idaho where he set up the Philip Habib Endowment for the Study of Environmental Issues and World Peace.
Among other honors, Mr. Habib was decorated commander of France's Legion of Honor in 1988.
He is survived by his wife, Marjorie W. Habib; two daughters, Phyllis, and Susan W. Michaels of Vestal, N.Y. and a granddaughter, Maren K. Michaels.

HEADLINE: High Court Upholds Naming Of 22 Theaters as Landmarks

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
A four-year effort by Broadway's theater owners to overturn the landmark designation of 22 playhouses in mid-Manhattan ended yesterday when the United States Supreme Court refused to hear their case.
In turning back the owners' challenge without comment, the High Court effectively let stand a 1991 ruling by a New York State appeals court that upheld the designations. 
 Gerald Schoenfeld, the chairman of the Shubert Organization, which controls 15 of the 22 theaters at stake, said yesterday that the refusal by the Supreme Court to hear the case "ends the legal proceedings."
"We're a very disappointed appellant," he said.
The Supreme Court itself did not take up such critical questions as whether there had been an unconstitutional taking of property or whether, as the owners asserted, an entire industry had been landmarked.
Nevertheless, preservationists were pleased that the long case had finally drawn to a close and that the designations by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission had survived judicial scrutiny.
"It's a victory," said Tracie Rozhon, the spokeswoman for the landmarks panel. "Once again, the commission's actions have been more than sustained by the record and the law.."
Jack Goldstein, executive director of Save the Theaters, a preservation group, said, "We welcome the decision and we now look forward to being able to confront some of the serious problems that face legitimate theater at all levels in New York."
However, Mr. Schoenfeld warned that the theaters "are at risk and will continue to remain so" -- no matter their landmark status -- until New York City officials have come up with economic and zoning benefits involving the transfer of development rights from theaters to other sites, the taxation of theatrical real estate and the rules under which towers can be constructed over existing theaters.
Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns three of the affected houses, said that city officials were not likely to focus on the problem "until they see the crisis right in front of them."
Ethan Geto, a spokesman for the Nederlander Organization, which controls three of the affected theaters, said: "The core of the policies that theater owners have propounded has been, 'Let's get a policy that focuses on the marginal theaters.' "
The theater owners filed their lawsuit in June 1988, after numerous designations had been voted by the landmarks commission. The city was upheld in both State Supreme Court and the Appellate Division in Manhattan. The New York State Court of Appeals would not hear the case.
The owners argued that the commission used a "cookie cutter" approach in giving landmark status to so many properties at once, effectively binding an entire industry by the constraints of landmark regulation.
These are the protected theaters:
On 44th Street, the Broadhurst, the Belasco, the Majestic, the St. James and the Shubert.
On 45th Street, the Booth, the Golden, the Imperial, the Lyceum, the Martin Beck, the Music Box, the Plymouth and the Royale.
On 46th Street, the 46th Street and the Lunt-Fontanne.
On 47th Street the Barrymore and the Brooks Atkinson.
On 48th Street, the Court and the Longacre.
On 49th Street, the Eugene O'Neill.
On 51st Street, the Mark Hellinger.
On Broadway, the Winter Garden.

HEADLINE: The Road To Rio: Setting an Agenda for the Earth;
The Wetlands Home of Many Species Is Threatened by Spain's Great Thirst

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DONANA, Spain

 BODY:
Before dusk, the visitors come hopping from the bushes, shrieking and whistling, ferreting out worms and nibbling on crabs and seeds. It is dinner time in the wetlands of Donana, a kind of European Everglades, one of this continent's most important wildlife reserves.
Among Donana's guests are storks, flamingos and imperial eagles and the humbler teals, curlews and coots. As they migrate from Africa to Europe, over the shortest sea crossing at Gibraltar, hundreds of thousands of birds stop at this national park in southern Spain. In its swamps and woodlands, they nest, breed and compete for food. But all around Donana, another kind of competition rages. 
 Developers want to build more hotels, marinas and golf courses, including a luxury resort with 32,000 beds, along the park's periphery. And farmers nearby want more water to irrigate their thirsty rice and strawberry fields.
 
A Matter of Survival?
 Fighting against these projects are biologists and environmentalists, who say that human pressures on Donana have grown so fast and siphoned off so much of the water table that they threaten the park's survival. They warn that new projects, pumping even more water, will suck the marshes dry.
The need to protect fragile habitats like these is a major item on the agenda of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro next month. The biologists see this as a crucial issue all around the Mediterranean coast, where since ancient times people have drained swamps to halt malaria, to reclaim land, to build, to grow food.
But as people have gained hundreds of thousands of acres of usable land in the region, wildlife has lost rich nurseries where uncounted plants, mammals, birds and fish can thrive.
The loss of wetlands has quickened in the last three decades as the Mediterranean coasts have become more coveted than ever and large stretches of coastline have been covered with concrete in the name of sun worship, comfort and profits. United Nations studies cite major losses in Italy, Egypt, Turkey and Greece.
There are still many soggy wildlands left in the world, places that can show civilization how parts of the earth may have looked before people tried to control nature. But human needs impinge on these spaces on every continent.
The Everglades in Florida have lost much of their surface and continue to suffer the pressures of developers and farmers. What may be the mightiest seasonal wetlands in the world, the Pantanal in western Brazil, has come under near-siege in the last decade.
Spain, with its long coastline, has paved over more of its shores than any other Mediterranean nation of Europe. In its rush to grow and prosper, Spain has long brushed aside conservationists' protests.
 
A 'Save Donana' Movement
 Yet now, environmentalists, politicians and citizens groups have engaged in an impassioned campaign and formed a "Save Donana" movement. They argue that at Donana, commercial interests must be sacrificed to nature because close to a million birds are estimated to use these lands as a home, a stopover or a seasonal site.
Among the part-time inhabitants are 150 species of migrant birds, including the majority of the continent's geese. Permanent residents include 125 indigenous bird species, among them 30 protected species, and large mammals like deer, boar and the very rare lynx.
The park, founded in 1965 and classified as a United Nations Biosphere Reserve, has drawn the attention of the European Commission in Brussels, which has filed a complaint against Spain for failing to protect it.
"The outcome in Donana will be a vital test for European conservation," said Jaime Vozmediano, a lawyer and a member of the park board. "What is going on here is an example of what already happened on the rest of the Spanish coast."
The public fight over Donana, accompanied by demonstrations and wide attention in the European press, has been embarrassing for the Spanish Government, which has been lobbying hard for Madrid to become the site for Europe's future Environment Agency. At issue is not the 125,000-acre park itself, which by law is protected against invaders, but the surrounding 130,000 acres that form a vital buffer zone.
"Any more growth here will be the death sentence for Donana," said Miguel Delibes, director of the park's research station. He spoke of the fertile region west of the Guadalquivir River, a long-neglected hinterland of low rolling hills that has become more popular in the last two decades.
A recent study said that hotels, villas and Government-sponsored farm projects already existing in this zone have pumped so much water that in the last 15 years the water table has dropped 6 to 30 feet, and several lagoons have dried up. The farms produce rice, strawberries and other crops that demand much water.
But in the nearby towns of Almonte and Matalascanas the burst of development has brought a measure of prosperity to an impoverished region. Local people say they care more about jobs than lynxes and birds.
On the surface, the park prospers. "This teems with life," said Javier Zapata, a biologist, pulling his vehicle through coastal sand. Overhead, birds wheeled in the sun. Among the stunted pines, juniper and cork trees, he said, there were stags and snakes.
The great spring turnover had already begun, the time when Donana becomes like a great international airport, when some 300,000 ducks and 60,000 greylag geese and uncounted others leave to travel north, some as far as the tip of Scandinavia. And great flocks of white stork, joined by ibis and cinnamon duck, are arriving to breed after wintering in West Africa.
Francisco Fernandez, a park ornithologist, said that this is "a kind of paradise." But seen through a microscope, the images can be disturbing. Pesticides and fertilizer, runoff from the farms, are on the rise in the ground water and lagoons.
"Last year we found 20 dead flamingos with lead in their stomach," Mr. Fernandez said, a result of hunters in the buffer zone using lead ammunition. He added that this practice is forbidden in many countries because the lead stays in the soil and ends up poisoning the animals.
In April, the park defenders received a vote of confidence in a 150-page report by international experts commissioned by the Andalusian government.
The report warned against further urban development because the region's ecology had been "stretched to its limits." The local people, the report suggested, should grow less thirsty crops and start attracting a different kind of tourists: nature lovers willing to stay in village inns and farmhouses.
As for the planned Costa Donana resort, with its hotels, villas and golf courses, the regional government has since said that the building permits remain on hold.

GRAPHIC: Photo: Adding its name to the growing list of fragile eco-systems threatened by human pressures, the Donana wetlands have been a source of contention between developers and environmentalists in Spain. Because habitats like this are vital to the breeding and survival of many species of wildlife worldwide, plans for their future will be of major concern at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro next month.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Media;
Senate Races Marked by Vivid Images

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 26

 BODY:
The beating of a white truck driver in the Los Angeles riots. A black woman denouncing mob rule. Rivers running pink with toxic chemicals. An aborted fetus.
It takes a tough advertisement to fight its way through the television clutter here these days, so it is not surprising that aspirants in California's upcoming Senate primary have resorted to some pretty high-voltage images to promote their candidacies. But in one of the paradoxes of the modern media campaign, the more graphic images the candidates use to distinguish themselves, experts say, the more they risk seeming routine. 
 "They look like candidates who meet the usual stereotypes; they'll do anything for votes," said Shanto Iyengar, a professor of political science and communications at the University of California in Los Angeles. "They'll even capitalize on riots."
Perhaps because there are so many candidates to cover -- there are a dozen major candidates just for the United States Senate -- or perhaps because there has been so much other news in California recently, candidates running in the June 2 primary cannot count on getting much exposure except through their own paid advertising. This has added to the already substantial significance of 30-second spots and has placed a premium on commercials that somehow manage to rise above the din.
 
Message of Law and Order
 To this end, some candidates have recently added scenes from the riots to their campaign visuals. In the Senate primaries -- there are two open Senate seats -- one candidate, State Controller Gray Davis, is using footage from the beating of Reginald Denny to illustrate his message of law and order. Another Democratic candidate, Representative Mel Levine, has enlisted the help of a black official, former Representative Yvonne Burke, to articulate the same theme.
"A few thousand criminals terrorized Los Angeles and poor people were the worst victims," Ms. Burke says in an advertisement for Mr. Levine. "I want strong law enforcement. That's why I'm for Mel Levine."
The commercials for Mr. Davis and Mr. Levine, Democrats who are running for different Senate seats, were produced by the same media firm, BAD Campaigns, and have a similar tone and even similar lines.
Their insistent theme of law and order is one that has worked for many Californians in the past, including Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan. But it is not at all clear that it is working now, even at a time when the state might be expected to be particularly enamored of safe streets. Mr. Davis, who is running against former Mayor Dianne Feinstein of San Francisco, is still lagging far behind in the polls, while Mr. Levine is fighting a tough three-way race against Representative Barbara Boxer and Lieut. Gov. Leo McCarthy.
"Both of them are trying to capitalize on what they believe is a an insecurity," Mr. Iyengar said of Mr. Davis and Mr. Levine. "But they may have miscalculated. The riots are an old story. The new story is jobs and the economy."
In contrast to Mr. Davis and Mr. Levine, the other Senate candidates are treating the riots like an embarrassing secret that cannot be discussed in the open. But these candidates, too, are searching for strong images, or at least strong insults, to make their commercials stand out. One of Ms. Boxer's advertisements, for example, begin with distinctly unappetizing footage of a river fouled by toxic chemicals. Mr. McCarthy's commercials, all in black and white, feature the headline, "Deport Illegal Alien Felons."
 
Trading Taunts
 On the Republican side, one Senate candidate, William Barclay Allen, has unveiled a commercial that graphically shows an abortion in progress, while the candidates battling for the chance to run for the second Senate seat have spent the last few weeks trading televised taunts.
"My opponent is a real liberal," Bruce Herschensohn, a conservative television commentator, says in one commercial. "Tom Campell had an A.C.L.U. rating of 85 percent, advocated higher taxes 17 times and voted himself a pay raise."
Mr. Campbell has resorted to 10- and 15-second commercials to respond to all of Mr. Herschensohn's charges. In one of these he says bluntly, "Bruce Herschensohn is lying."
Despite all the high-pitched commentary and distasteful images, though, any candidate who thinks that he or she has made an impression -- any impression -- on the voters had perhaps better think again. In interviews with more than a score of Los Angeles residents, only a few people could remember a line or scene from a political commercial, and fewer still could connect candidates with their advertisements.
"I watch a lot of TV, and I have seriously seen all of them," said Neal Matarazzo, an actor. "And not one of them has said anything that has even stuck in my head."

HEADLINE: Newspaper Drivers' Union To Vote on New Contract

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
In another attempt to resolve the 20-day-old newspaper delivery dispute, the drivers' union is set to vote tomorrow on new contracts with The New York Times and a newspaper distributor, the union announced yesterday.
The way for the ratification vote was cleared over the weekend by an accord on the volatile issue of amnesty for drivers who the distributor said had violated company rules in blocking news delivery trucks. The amnesty issue had unexpectedly derailed balloting that had been scheduled for last Thursday. 
 Douglas LaChance, the president of the drivers union, said last night that the union executive board had overwhelming approved the contracts, which had been turned down in an earlier form by the members May 6.
But more than 100 dissident drivers shouted their opposition to the contracts outside The Times offices on West 43d Street last night. "Shut them down! Shut them down!" many of the protesters chanted.
A spokeswoman for The Times, Nancy Nielsen, said there were no disruptions in trucks leaving the building, but added that between 10 P.M. and 10:30, about the time the first edition begins to leave The Times, five bomb scares were reported at the paper. Four were called into the press room, she said, and one to the Police Department. All proved unfounded, she said.
Asked about the demonstration, Mr. LaChance said: "This is a democratic union. What am I supposed to do? Ask them not to holler?"
The union, the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers' Union of New York and Vicinity, called a pre-vote membership meeting for today at the Ramada Inn near La Guardia Airport to hear from a panel of union-chosen intermediaries who helped bring the parties together and to discuss the contract terms.
At a similar session planned for last Wednesday, the union's leadership abruptly insisted that the distributor, Imperial Delivery Service, drop disciplinary charges and offer amnesty to a core group of nine drivers, among others whom the company has said it would not rehire. The demand, pressed by union dissidents, was rejected by Imperial, and the vote was canceled.
 
Normal Arbitration Planned
 Under the informal agreement reached this weekend and intended to smooth the way to a vote, Imperial would classify this group of workers as employees for the purposes of arbitration but would not put them back to work. Whether they could return to work would be decided by arbitration under the contract.
Jerold E. Glassman, a lawyer for Imperial's owner, Arthur E. Imperatore, said an unspecified number of drivers facing the most serious complaints would not be rehired and no one would be promised blanket amnesty. One who would not be considered for rehiring, he said, is Robert Boyle, a driver who was arrested on Friday and charged with throwing a rock through the window of a bus carrying drivers to Imperial's distribution center in New Rochelle, N.Y. One worker was critically injured.
In another pact that seemed to ease the rancor in the labor dispute, lawyers for the drivers' union, Imperial and the City of New Rochelle signed an agreement last night in State Supreme Court in Riverhead, L.I., that disposed of some issues raised in a contempt lawsuit filed by Imperial, said a court spokesman, Samuel Markowitz.
 
Plans for the Police
 The New Rochelle Police Department, which had been accused by Imperial of failing to enforce an earlier court order against union interference with company operations, agreed to post three police officers at the distribution center during the day and a patrol car at other hours and to view company videotapes of disruptions and to make arrests if warranted. Imperial's action to press contempt citations against the union was stayed until Tuesday.
At issue in the labor dispute is a hotly debated contract involving about 1,000 of the union's 2,900 members -- drivers who work for The Times, two suburban wholesale newspaper distributorships whose assets were recently acquired by Mr. Imperatore and two others whose assets The Times has contracted to acquire.
 
Contract Changes Sought
 The wholesalers are Imperial's Westfair Newspaper Distributors in New Rochelle and Newspaper Distributors Company in East Farmingdale, L.I.; and the two sought by The Times, Metropolitan News Company of Manhattan and Newark Newsdealers Supply Company. They receive newspapers and magazines from publishers and deliver them to dealers and home delivery services.
Because purchasers in such sales are not bound by existing labor contracts, Mr. Imperatore and The Times took the opportunity to seek sweeping new contracts that would trade sharp overtime cuts and other economies and a stronger management hand in exchange for job security for permanent union drivers and some wage and benefit increases.
The Times said it saw the contracts as clearing the way to opening its new $450 million color-capable printing plant in Edison, N.J., and -- folding in its driver contract expiring next year -- of guaranteeing labor peace at the paper to at least the year 2000.
But many union members condemned the asset sale as a union-busting tactic by a distributor in league with The Times. And many drivers have reacted furiously to the expansion of management prerogatives and other provisions such as a no-strike pledge and introduction of the first part-time workers. On May 6, an earlier version of the contracts was decisively defeated in a vote by 1,600 of the union members. Mr. Imperatore then began hiring new drivers, setting off sometimes violent confrontations.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
I.B.M. Executive Is Named President of Western Digital

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
The Western Digital Corporation, a maker of chips and disk drives, said yesterday that it had chosen Charles A. Haggerty, who had been with I.B.M. for 28 years, as its president and chief operating officer.
Until he resigned from I.B.M. last week, Mr. Haggerty had served in a wide range of jobs, including plant manager for the company's Boca Raton, Fla., operation in the years it was developing the first I.B.M. PC. From 1983 to 1985 he was site general manager of I.B.M's Rochester, Minn., facility and he was also vice president, worldwide operations, for the AS/400, I.B.M.'s successful minicomputer family, during its development from 1987 to 1989. 
 Most recently, Mr. Haggerty, who is 50 years old, served as vice president for the company's effort to sell disk-drive products to other computer makers.
 
 
'Opportunity Written All Over'
 Mr. Haggerty said that he thought Western Digital was in the midst of a turnaround and that this was an excellent time to join the company.
"This is a company that has opportunity written all over it," he said. "They've had financial difficulties in the last 18 to 24 months, but I think they're pulling out of it and it may be back to profitability this quarter."
The company makes 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch disks for personal computers and is working on a new line of 1.8-inch drives for portable systems. It also sells semiconductor chip sets for I.B.M.-compatible computers as well as graphics chips for PC's.
Mr. Haggerty will report to the company's chairman and chief executive, Roger W. Johnson, and will be responsible for the company's manufacturing, marketing, engineering and sales activities.
Mr. Johnson said yesterday that he had begun his search more than a year ago for a president to share some responsibility for managing the business, but that he abandoned his efforts because of the recession and business difficulties the company faced.
 
 
A Loss in Last Quarter
 Revenues for the company, which is based in Irvine, Calif., rose to more than $1 billion in 1991, but last quarter the company reported an $18.6 million loss. It had also lost money in three of the four quarters of 1991.
"I've had too many jobs for too long," Mr. Johnson said. "Chuck brings to us a good knowledge of large operations, and he may also bring to us knowledge of some of the things you don't want to do in a large operation."
Mr. Haggerty, a native of Rochester, Minn., is a graduate of St. Thomas College in St. Paul, where he studied business. He has a wife and two children.

HEADLINE: JURORS PROCLAIM DEADLOCK IN TRIAL

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., May 26

 BODY:
Four days after jury deliberations began, the trial of a black supremacist is at a virtual standstill. Jurors said today they were not only deadlocked but also confused about the nature of the charges they are being asked to decide.
In the latest of more than half a dozen notes sent to Judge Norman C. Roettger Jr. since they began deliberating Saturday in the racketeering case of the black supremacist, Yahweh ben Yahweh, jurors today asked the judge to give them a clearer definition of what constitutes a racketeering conspiracy. 
 Judge Roettger responded with a streamlined version of the instructions he had read earlier and with an order not to give up. He also told defense lawyers that four days of deadlock were not enough to justify throwing away the effort represented by a five-month trial.
Yahweh ben Yahweh and 15 of his followers went on trial in January, charged with racketeering and with conspiracy in 14 murders of white vagrants and disobedient black disciples, the attempted murder of two others, and the burning of an entire block in Delray Beach, about 50 miles north of Miami. Yahweh ben Yahweh faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted.
Judge Roettger has told the jurors that to find the separatist guilty they must agree with the prosecutors' contention that Yahweh ben Yahweh used murder and arson from 1981 to 1986 as part of a continuing criminal racketeering enterprise.
 
'Devil' Whites
 As head of an organization called the Temple of Love, Yahweh ben Yahweh, whose name in Hebrew means "God the Son of God," preached that God is black and that all whites are "the devil, Satan, serpent and beast." He also taught that blacks are the only true Jews and that any nonblacks who claim the heritage of Israel are "false imposter Jews" who worship in "the synagogue of Satan."
Through aggressive proselytizing, donations and municipal subcontracts, the Temple of Love became a force in Miami in the 1980's. At the group's peak, its business holdings in South Florida consisted of hotels, grocery stores, restaurants and warehouses worth an estimated $8 million.
Along the way, Yahweh ben Yahweh won praise from public officials, including Mayor Xavier Suarez of Miami, as a promoter of black self-respect who transformed some of the worst sections of Miami into a flourishing private enterprise zone. Supporters described Yahweh ben Yahweh as a charismatic and benevolent religious leader intent on saving black youths from drugs and "mental slavery," the phrase he used to describe blacks who try to live in mainstream society.
Born in Oklahoma in 1936 as Hulon Mitchell Jr., Yahweh ben Yahweh founded the Temple of Love in 1979 and once claimed to have more than 20,000 followers in 45 cities around the United States, including New York.
 
Complicated by Violence
 The racial aspects of the case that were always present have grown even more complicated since the acquittal of four white police officers in Los Angeles in the severe beating of a black motorist and the subsequent spasm of violence there last month. In his final instructions on Saturday, Judge Roettger told the jury of nine whites and three blacks to "put aside any biases you might have" and "deliberate in this case truly objectively."
But in his closing arguments on Friday, Alcee L. Hastings, an impeached former Federal judge who is Yahweh ben Yahweh's lawyer, sought to evoke racial and religious guilt. He described his client as a "Gandhi-esque" figure who had been targeted by the Government only because he preaches he is the son of God and the only person able to guide blacks to economic and intellectual independence.
"Is he being persecuted because his teachings cause the blind black men of America to see that white people caused at least some of their trouble?" asked Mr. Hastings, who last week announced that he would run for Congress from a new predominantly black district that encompasses parts of Broward County, whose largest city is Fort Lauderdale, and Palm Beach County.
Jurors were not sequestered during the trial, and became aware of the verdict in the beating of the Los Angeles motorist, Rodney G. King, and the wrenching national debate on race and justice that followed. But at Judge Roettger's order, they have been sequestered since the weekend and will remain so until their deliberations are over.
There has been no suggestion that a guilty verdict against Yahweh ben Yahweh and his followers could set off widespread racial violence in South Florida, which has experienced five major racial disturbances since 1980. Despite the praise lavished upon him by public officials, Yahweh ben Yahweh is regarded as a marginal figure in most black neighborhoods here, and there has been widespread revulsion among blacks at testimony that he ordered the murder of some of his own disciples because they were "blasphemers."
Since deliberations began, Judge Roettger has received several notes from the jury complaining that the panel is "hopelessly hung" because "some of the jury feels that the Government did not prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt." In each case, the judge instructed jurors to bear down and scoffed at the defense's contention that a mistrial should be declared.
"All that means is we start over with another jury and do this thing over again," he told lawyers on Monday. Judge Roettger said he was convinced the jury could still reach a decision.
But defense lawyers have criticized the judge's instructions to carry on.
"We think that's coercive," said Paul McKenna, a lawyer in the case.

HEADLINE: Cornucopia of New Foods Is Seen As Policy on Engineering Is Eased

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
A new Government policy for streamlining regulation of food produced through genetic engineering should result in an abundance of new, varied and more wholesome products, while revitalizing the biotechnology industry, Federal officials said today.
Industry leaders said that the first of these new foods, probably tomatoes that stay flavorful longer than normal ones, should reach consumers next year, and that dozens of other plant products would follow quickly. 
 Vice President Dan Quayle, along with officials of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration, today announced details of a policy that would regulate genetically engineered foods in much the same way as foods developed through more conventional techniques.
Mr. Quayle, who told a briefing of industry executives that the policy was part of the Bush Administration's "regulatory relief" program, said the United States was the world leader in biotechnology "and we want to keep it that way." But he said, "We will not compromise safety one bit."
 
Tasty, Varied, Wholesome
 The Health and Human Services Secretary, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, said the new policy for regulating foods produced through genetic manipulation "will insure the safety of these foods while facilitating their availability as quickly as possible." The new technology promises consumers "foods that are tastier, more varied, more wholesome" that can be produced more efficiently with less cost and spoilage, he said.
Dr. David A. Kessler, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, said agricultural scientists have used methods of crossbreeding and genetic manipulation for centuries to produce new foods, like hydrid corn or tangelos. Genetic engineering techniques, he said, are a more precise way of doing the same thing. Properly monitored, he said, the new foods pose no special risk, and most should not require advance Government approval before being sold.
"New products come to our kitchens and tables every day," Dr. Kessler said. "I see no reason right now to do anything special because of these foods" altered by genetic engineering.
 
Some Are Not Convinced
 But some consumer groups and others skeptical of genetic engineering said the new foods were different enough to require special testing and approval before marketing, and consumer labels to identify them once they are on store shelves.
Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, which wants tighter regulations, said the safety of these foods would be an important consumer issue of the 1990's. Promising legal action, Mr. Rifkin said, "We will do our utmost to insure that genetically engineered food is labeled and that the American people understand the potential health hazard of these food products."
Many food and biotechnology groups, including the Industrial Biotechnology Association, the Grocery Manufacturers of America and the National Food Processors Association, endorsed the F.D.A. policy. "A clear F.D.A. policy position will assure that biotechnology produced foods are considered by the agency in an orderly, expeditious way that also assures consumers of their continued safety," said Manly Molpus, president of the grocery group.
Biotechnology was a $4 billion industry in 1991 and is expected to grow to at least $50 billion by the year 2000, says the Industrial Biotechnology Association, a trade group that represents more than 80 percent of the industry. About 10 percent of the industry is devoted to agriculture, and the rest to developing drugs and diagnostic tests, producing supplies for the industry and assorted other projects.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 22.56 on Saudi Report; Oil Issues Surge

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stock prices declined broadly yesterday after a report that Saudi Arabia, long a proponent of moderate oil pricing, had shifted its stance toward higher prices. Oil stocks jumped.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 22.56 points, to 3,364.21, as declining issues nearly doubled advancing ones, 1,120 to 618, on the New York Stock Exchange. The exchange's composite index finished 1.34 lower at 226.86. 
 The volume on the Big Board totaled 197.7 million shares, versus 146.7 million on Friday. The markets were closed on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday.
Broader gauges were also lower. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 2.61, to 411.41, while the American Stock Exchange market-value index lost 0.57 point, to 391.89. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter trading fell 4.65, to 575.65.
 
Oil Gains; Airlines Plunge
 The market tumbled after a report in The Wall Street Journal yesterday that Saudia Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and exporter, was ready to see the price of crude oil rise by as much as $3 a barrel, which could have inflationary effects throughout the world. Light sweet crude oil for delivery in July settled yesterday at $22 a barrel, up $1.06, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Energy stocks surged. Exxon rose 3 1/2, to 64; ARCO gained 6 1/8, to 117 3/4; Royal Dutch Petroleum was up 4 3/8, to 89; Mobil jumped 3 5/8, to 67, and British Petroleum's American depository receipts advanced 2 5/8, to 60 5/8.
But airline issues did the opposite. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, declined 1 3/8, to 64 3/8; Delta Air Lines lost 1 1/2, to 57 7/8, and UAL, which owns United Airlines, tumbled 3 1/4, to 118 3/4. Fuel is an airline's second-biggest cost, after labor.
Fears of inflation also sent down prices, Tom Luker, the head of equity trading at the Nikko Securities Company, said.
These concerns make it less likely the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates soon to stimulate the economy, a move traders had awaited and one which could help stock prices.
Higher inflation could also have a negative effect on consumer buying power, which might hamper the economic recovery, said Michael Metz, an investment strategist with Oppenheimer & Company.
Sluggish home sales were reported but had little effect on the market, traders said. A real estate trade group said sales of previously owned homes slipped by three-tenths of a percent in April, the first decline in three months.
 
Data Have No Effect
 The market also ignored two solid economic reports. One showed consumer confidence jumped by 6.5 points in May, to 71.6. A second showed sales of American-made vehicles up by 9.3 percent in mid-May over the corresponding period a year ago.
The Big Board's most-active list was headed by mostly leaders in the oil and oil-service sectors. The most actively traded issue was Halliburton, an oil-service company based in Dallas, which was up 5/8, to 29 7/8, on a volume of 3.8 million shares. Other such active issues included Baker Hughes, which rose 1 1/8 to 23 3/4, and Schlumberger, which finished 4 higher, to 68 1/2.
But many blue-chip issues fell. Merck declined 1 1/4, to 49 5/8; Coca-Cola lost 7/8, to 43 3/8; A.T.& T.tumbled 1 1/4, to 41 5/8, and Walt Disney was off 1/2, to 37 3/8.
In over-the-counter trading, Greenwich Pharmaceuticals plunged 30.3 percent, or by 3 3/8, to 7 3/4, on 2.8 million shares, after the biotechnology concern said the Food and Drug Administration wanted further studies of its new arthritis drug.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Begins Campaign To Counter Anti-Business Image

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIDDLETOWN, Conn., May 26

 BODY:
Connecticut officials today unveiled a $6 million marketing campaign intended to counter an anti-business image, acknowledging that the state has not helped business in the past and promising to be "user friendly" in the future.
The humble-pie appeal will be evident in a full-page advertisement to be published on Wednesday in every Connecticut newspaper, as the campaign opens by addressing businesses already in the state. The headline reads: "You're Worried. You're Angry. You're Frustrated. You're Right." 
 In the advertisement, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. declares that Connecticut has addressed its budget problems and is now ready to help businesses battered by the recession by offering tax incentives, job training, $1 billion in loans and loan guarantees and other services.
After a series of print, television and radio advertisements aimed at reassuring Connecticut businesses, the Department of Economic Development plans to begin advertising nationally in September, striking back at dozens of states that have sent raiding parties to Connecticut since its budget problems and income-tax battle in 1991.
 
Campaign Against 9 States
 In one television ad that will be broadcast in Connecticut immediately, Mr. Weicker holds a handful of promotional brochures from other states, with those of Illinois and Texas in the foreground. "Every day, other states are trying to lure Connecticut companies away," he says. "And when our companies go, jobs go, too. That has to stop."
Joseph McGee, the commissioner of economic development, said Connecticut planned to give nine states, in particular, a taste of their own medicine. He would not identify them beyond saying, "Certainly Georgia is going to get a letter from us."
The campaign was announced today at a news conference at the Middletown plant of Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, the state's largest manufacturing employer.
On hand were several state commissioners, legislators who had guided through the General Assembly a package of laws benefiting employers, and executives of electric, gas and water utilities, which are providing $5 million for the campaign.
Most of that $5 million, however, ultimately will come from residents -- through rate increases costing utility customers 12 cents a month on their bills, Mr. McGee said.
Facing a budget deficit of nearly $2 billion last year, Mr. Weicker insisted on cutting the surcharge on the state's corporate profits tax even as he forced a new personal income tax through the General Assembly.
 
160,000 Jobs Lost
 Now, he said today, the state has the financial strength to assist businesses and try to regain the 160,000 jobs it has lost in the last three years.
The campaign, in promising not only more aid but also better service from state agencies, will address a negative image of Connecticut found in a survey of business leaders.
Inside the state, said Michael Leahy, a consultant, executives said Connecticut was a difficult place to do business and had high costs for workers' compensation and health care, a regulatory system that was difficult and expensive, and a government that was not businesslike.
Out-of-state executives, he said, had an image of Connecticut as a place with strong anti-business attitudes and a high cost of living.
Mr. McGee said the campaign's first goal would be to keep companies in Connecticut and help them expand. In trying to attract new businesses, they would concentrate on industries like pharmaceuticals and computer applications that need highly skilled employees and pay high wages.

HEADLINE: Jersey Shore: Booming but Hurt by Redistricting

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEASIDE HEIGHTS, N.J., May 25

 BODY:
Long Island has its shores, North and South, but "the Shore" is New Jersey's coastline, a 127-mile state of mind that happens to have some of the America's finest sandy beaches, wide inland bays, fecund tidal estuaries and waterfowl flyways.
The Shore now also refers to the broad communities reaching inland that have been filling up with people, houses and shopping centers -- especially in Monmouth and Ocean Counties -- at a rate faster than anywhere else in the nation's most densely populated state. 
 Ocean, with the second-largest area of New Jersey counties, saw its year-round population mushroom from under 50,000 in 1950 to over 433,000 today, while Monmouth's population shot from 225,327 to 553,124.
Despite unchecked growth and issues of common concern to those who live along the ocean -- the environment, transportation and tourism -- the Shore is losing the Congressional district that until now encompassed most of Monmouth and Ocean Counties. Redistricting this spring carved the present Third District into pieces joined to three others.
 
A Cynical Move?
 Representative Frank J. Pallone Jr., a Democrat who has represented the Third District for two terms, now faces three party opponents in next week's primary in the reshaped Sixth District, which covers coastal communities in northern Monmouth.
"We'd be much better off having one Congressman in Washington looking out after the Shore's interests all the time than be split among three Congressmen whose interests spread across the state," said Ken Hershey, the Republican Mayor of Seaside Heights. The beachfront amusement resort, in Ocean County, is now part of a revamped Third District.
Robert Bennett, who owns Casino Pier -- a boardwalk complex here of 32 amusement rides, 10 food concessions and gaudy booths offering "games of chance" to 100,000 mostly blue-collar fun seekers on a typical sunny summer weekend -- added, "Pallone was on top of everything and was particularly good on the environment of the Shore."
The Atlantic has hacked away at the coastline, shifting sandbars and running the surf hard against bulkheads where condominiums have pushed past grass-topped dunes. Northeasters in October and January pushed tides into several communities, causing further erosion.
 
Signs of Change
 But if Rip Van Winkle had fallen asleep on the Seaside Heights beach on a summer afternoon in 1952 and awakened this week, it is questionable if he would immediately notice how much the world had changed during his 40-year slumber.
In that time the boardwalk was extended northward to the resort's full nine-tenths of a mile. Expensive electronic and pinball games with flashing lights and ringing bells filled the old catchpenny arcades. As for string bikinis, who knows what Rip might think?
But the salty air, the flat crump of waves on the beach and the rustle of shells washed by the foaming surf are eternal. A visitor can still play Skee-Ball and other games of chance in the warren of booths and canopied stands on the boardwalk, buy Sno Cones, sticky cotton candy and pizza by the slice and wolf down steaming Italian sausage-and-peppers sandwiches.
What would stagger the old fellow are the changes that transformed the land mass across Barnegat Bay, where sprawling subdivisions stand on spaces that were unmolested until well into the second half of this century, and marinas for fleets of recreational boats are dredged out of wetlands. Pastel-colored malls and strip shopping centers cramp tracts that until the 1980's were oak, persimmon and sweet gum groves, and cineplexes and fast-food shops squat on ponds and red cedar sloughs that have been filled and paved.
People with the means to take summer vacations have traveled to the Shore throughout this century from northern New Jersey, Trenton, Philadelphia and everywhere in between. But from Labor Day to Memorial Day, the area was left to the locals -- descendants of Tory refugees, ship wreckers, watermen and subsistence farmers -- who picked a living from bay bottoms, cranberry bogs and egg farms or worked in such local military installations as the Navy's engineering center at Lakehurst and the Army's Fort Monmouth.
 
Sudden Access
 The catalyst of change was the extension of the Garden State Parkway to the Shore area in 1954. Toms River, the seat of Ocean County, 75 miles south of New York and still a sleepy village four decades ago, was suddenly just a 90-minute ride from the Lincoln Tunnel. Cars streamed out of North Jersey to the beaches on day trips, commuter bedroom towns sprung up along parkway exit ramps, and when word got out that the Shore's winters were as mild as its summers were cool, older people poured into retirement villages. Now there are 65 age-restricted communities in Ocean County alone, housing the largest concentration of senior citizens in the Northeast.
There is still a lot of open space in Ocean County. Two-thirds of it is in public ownership and covered by the forests of the Pine Barrens. But most of the development has been on the waterfront or within easy reach of it.
A state development plan envisions 100,000 new housing units in Ocean and Monmouth Counties by 2010 and looks favorably upon continued development in areas that are already built up. It seeks to minimize the need for tax-supported infrastructure elsewhere and to avoid the erratic development that has scarred gentle landscapes here and in Florida and other Sun Belt states.
The old-timers complain about declining air quality and traffic congestion on the parkway and the main streets of dozens of communities like Toms River, Freehold and Bricktown. But much of the push on environmental issues has come from relative newcomers who escaped from decaying urban areas to the north.
 
'Not Much Left to Save'
 Pearl Schwartz, who moved to Toms River from Queens 20 years ago and now heads the Ocean County League of Women Voters, is one of those voicing concerns. "The barrier beaches have almost all been built up, and there's not much left to save," she said. "There is a clamor for millions in Federal and state funds 'to restore the beaches' after the winter storms, which would be okay if the money really went to protect the beaches. But it really will go to protect private property that never should have been built along the beach."
The state's coastal management plan is up for review, and conservationists hope to plug a major loophole in it that placed restrictions on new housing of 25 units or more, allowing a proliferation of 24-unit structures up and down the Shore.
"Only now are some people in this area asking what kind of community do they want to live in, and the dialogue is starting after a lot of damage has already been done," said Steven Pollock, the chief Ocean County planner. "The decisions made on development have been made by those people who directly benefited from it, which just wasn't the power structure but everyone who lived here, from the guy who put up Sheetrock to the fellow who pumped gas."
Elizabeth Morgan, a native of Ocean County and a staunch preservationist, agreed. "We've done a lot of things wrong," she said, "and the natural values that drew people here are quickly eroding. It's enough to make a preacher swear."

HEADLINE: Seattle Finds Good Intentions Cannot Defeat Economics

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
When they talk about green cities, American environmentalists quickly turn their misty eyes in this direction.
Seattle has become "ecotopia" to many, a city where there are bicycle racks at nearly every street corner, where littering is considered worse than espionage and where recycling has reached its fullest flower. 
 No American city has been more vigilant -- some call it maniacal -- about recycling its trash than Seattle, which this year recycled more than 45 percent of its residential garbage. So why is everybody talking as if the program has been strangled by its own success?
"Recycling feels good," said Jan M. Glick, executive director of the Washington Citizens for Recycling Foundation. "We love it. But the whole American system has been designed for disposal and convenience. It's great what we do here, but if we have nowhere to put the materials, and business has no incentives to use them, it's also a little fruitless."
 
Fighting Economics
 Mr. Glick sounds an increasingly frequent alarm: Recycling has not solved Seattle's garbage problem, and, by itself, it never will. It cannot possibly solve the problem in New York City, the New York metropolitan region or the United States. Policy experts say that only forcing businesses to use recyclable instead of virgin resources can do that.
"We can recycle almost all our garbage," said Margaret Norton-Arnold, a consultant at O'Neill & Company here, who works with major corporations to develop markets for recycled waste. "But if the economics are not there, the stuff is just going to sit in a landfill somewhere."
And as Seattle has got better at sorting bottles, paper, newsprint, compost, plastics and many other commodities into ecologically perfect assortments, the economic advantages have been increasingly difficult to find.
 
Unloading Unwanted Trash
 Glass prices have dropped from more than $40 to less than $10 a ton in the last year, for example. Waste Management Inc., one of two companies hired to collect Seattle's recycled trash, has been unable to unload tons of the stuff.
The city, which used to earn $10 a ton selling mixed waste paper, now pays $5 a ton to get rid of it, largely because economic problems in East Asia, its biggest market, have shut down several mills that are usually eager to buy it. Used newsprint, a much bigger commodity, has begun to do well again after a glut, largely because California recently passed a law requiring newspapers to use at least 23 percent recycled paper. By the end of the decade that figure will rise to 50 percent, guaranteeing a large market in the region.
Environmentalists say that without laws requiring companies to use recycled goods and laws banning substances like Styrofoam, the program will be limited.
"If a business can pay less for a new fiber than for used print, you are just going to have a wicked time talking them into using the used goods," said David Dougherty, director of the Clean Washington Center, an economic development group trying to develop markets for recycled material. "We need to find good ways for companies to use what we can find, and we need to make sure it's not a waste of their money to do it."

HEADLINE: Giving New Futures to Refrigerators With a Past

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 26

 BODY:
Greg Slade worked in construction before the recession blew his small carpentry company off the map. Now he's into deconstruction. Old refrigerators to be exact.
He's seen them all: Clunky white Kelvinators with interiors of pure porcelain, geriatric General Electrics with round compressors on top that look like Navy Sonar, Philcos that saw action when TV dinners were a novelty and Tang was the drink of the astronauts. All once-gleaming symbols of the American century of affluence, they now glide by on steel rollers to be gutted for what Mr. Slade's company can reuse. What he cannot is shredded for scrap. 
Mr. Slade, Manny Sanchez, Terry Lee Mitchell and the 37 other people at Appliance Recycling Centers of America's Hartford plant -- the largest appliance disassembly line in the Northeast, company officials say -- work with the mundane kitchen artifacts of culture.
 
Out With the Old . . .
 At 40 minutes per appliance on average, they breathe post-industrial life into refrigerators and freezers that may have hidden silently in people's basements and garages for decades. Coolants are siphoned off; glass is crushed; metal is shipped out for melting; toxic chemicals that cannot go into landfills are sent to Texas for incineration.
The effort is conducted under contract with utility companies that are trying to reduce energy demand by taking old refrigerators out of the power grid. It is no mere grunt-and-crush chop-shop business.
From easing an old clunker out of its dusty corner, to coaxing from the owner some guess about the appliance's age, employees here find that they touch lives, or at least bear witness to objects that once touched lives in commonplace ways.
They have seen mass-produced refrigerators -- white goods in the parlance of the appliance industry -- arrive personalized with peace symbols, or papered over entirely with bumper stickers, or roofing shingles, or turned into art -- one was painted with a loving hand to resemble a giant beer can.
And occasionally there are small mysteries. One ancient General Electric model had only a single clue as to its age. On a small cap near the compressor, they found a handwritten note saying the machine had been "purged by Bill from Hartford" on Feb. 29, 1936. Workers could only guess what was purged, perhaps air trapped in the system. At any rate, the refrigerator still worked.
 
Remembering the Cool Times
 "We get all kinds of wild stuff in here," Mr. Slade said.
The undeniable truth, Mr. Slade and other workers here say, is that people mark their lives in small ways by the purchase of a refrigerator, as odd as that might sound. They say that while most people don't remember in vivid detail the sterling day that the old Coldspot was wheeled in the door, memories can be jogged, and in fact have to be because different eras and brands used vastly different refrigeration coolants -- some toxic, or even potentially explosive. Workers must know what they're facing on each machine.
The trick is to use memory association, based on the assumption that most people buy major appliances at turning points in their lives: a marriage, a move to a new house, the birth of a child. And most of the time, the associations, gleaned when people call up to offer an appliance, are positive, sending refrigerator-owners on small nostalgia trips about moments and kitchens past.
"It can turn into a fun call, no doubt," said Angie Amato, the company's customer service manager.
 
The List of Names
 The list of long-forgotten brands alone would be grist for an industrial history project. In the 19 months since this plant opened, workers have catalogued 99 brand names, saving the strangest nameplates for a shop floor shrine. Refrigerators made by Anheuser-Busch have ended up here, alongside old Supermalls, QuicFrezs, Supremacys, Chryslers, Marquettes, Crosley Shelvadors (complete with a radio in the door), and Ben-Hur Freezers that would appear to predate Charlton Heston. When a pristine General Electric from the 1930's with the owner's manual still inside turned up, it was spared and sent to the Hartford Stage Company as a prop.
There is clearly money to be made out of all this, or at least saved. Northeast Utilities, for example, which serves most of Connecticut and Western Massachusetts, wants to put off building another power plant because of the huge costs and uncertainties, and has collected more than 24,000 machines that were on and plugged in but not really needed. A running refrigerator, on average, adds about $100 a year to a home electricity bill, company officials say.
The other avenue of profit in marching a refrigerator back in time, industry experts say, is that eventually the manufacture of chlorofluorocarbon coolants, or CFC's, which have been used in most refrigerators since the 1940's, will be illegal under legislation intended to protect the earth's ozone later.
That will create demand for the old coolants collected here, said John H. Pence, an executive vice president of Appliance Recycling Centers, which operates five other plants like this in the United States and Canada.
Three other major utilities, United Illuminating here in Connecticut, and Con Edison and New York State Electric and Gas, serving Westchester, Duchess and Putnam Counties in New York, have also agreed to ship appliances here. In their service areas, customers with a functioning but unneeded refrigerator can simply call their electric company, and a crew from Appliance Recycling comes with a truck, at no charge to the customer. Most refrigerators are destroyed; those in the best condition are given to charities.
Some utility customers have been more than a little confused about the program.
United Illuminating advertises its refrigerator pick-up drive, for example, with a campaign called "The Beast in the Basement." One person called to accuse the company of frightening small children. Another man said he had a raccoon living in his attic. Could they come and get it?

HEADLINE: Consumer Bank Rates Are Down

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit were down in the week ended today, The Bank Rate Monitor reported in its most recent survey.
On average, the decline was sharper for banks outside the New York market, which some analysts said might indicate lingering expectations of an easing by the Federal Reserve Board. 
 While rates at many New York commercial banks were little changed, some savings banks were cutting yields on their products in order to stretch the profit margin between their cost of money and what they charge on loans.
 
Treasury Yields Up
 At yesterday's closely watched auction of new three- and six-month Treasury bills, interest rates jumped to two-month highs. But as Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, noted, these higher rates might be only temporary. He said that while consecutive increases might indicate a pattern of higher rates, he did not believe that yesterday's Treasury auction would lead to such a trend.
The auction, held at the beginning of each week, is considered by many interest rate watchers as a good barometer of what many banks may be paying their depositors in the weeks ahead.
The average rate on a three-month Treasury bill rose 14 basis points, to 3.75 percent, and a six-month bill rose 19 basis points, to 3.90 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
New York Rates
 Yields at New York area banks were down somewhat, with the average money market account off 4 basis points, to 3.44 percent. Three- and six-month certificates of deposit were unchanged at 3.54 percent and 3.70 percent.
Commercial banks left most rates intact, with a money market account yielding 3.21 percent, and rates on three and six-month certificates at 3.37 percent and 3.45 percent.
Savings banks, meanwhile, cut the yield on money market accounts by 7 basis points, to 3.67 percent, and on three-month C.D.'s by a basis point, to 3.71 percent. Six-month C.D.'s were up by a basis point, to 3.95 percent.
The sharpest yield changes among the New York banks occurred at the Dime Savings Bank, where the money market yield was down 54 basis points, to 3.06 percent. Carteret Savings in New Jersey, reduced the yield on its three-month certificate by 10 basis points, to 4.10 percent, while Crossland Savings raised its six-month C.D. 25 basis points, to 4.25 percent.
For the 20 largest banks outside the New York market, yields were also down, with a money market account off by 3 basis points, to 3.29 percent, and a six-month C.D. off the same amount, to 3.64 percent.

Sales of Domestic Vehicles Increased by 9.3% in Mid-May

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

 BODY:
Sales of North American-built vehicles rose 9.3 percent in mid-May, car makers reported yesterday. Automotive analysts said the gain was an encouraging sign that the market might finally be perking up, but they hastened to add that a single 10-day period was not enough to conclusively call a turn in the market.
Still, the period was sweet for Detroit's Big Three, which continued to gain back a bit of the ground they had lost to Japanese competitors. 
 Sales of cars made in North America -- which are considered domestically built -- totaled 195,836 for the May 11-20 period, up 4.3 percent. Sales of light trucks, which include mini-vans, utility vehicles and pickups, rose 17.3 percent, to 138,230. Over all, vehicle sales were 334,066, compared with 271,616 a year earlier.
 
 
Annual Rate of 6.7 Million
 The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate was 6.7 million, compared with 5.7 million in early May and 5.9 million a year earlier.
The latest period had nine selling days, compared with eight days in the mid-May period last year. Percentage changes are based on average sales recorded for the selling days.
Tom Webb, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association, called the report "some good news, even if long overdue." He said the group's surveys showed "that dealer optimism is at its highest level in eight years."
Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York, said, "If the rate were to stay like this for a few periods we could definitely say it was a turning point." But Mr. Heinbach said he suspected that the rate was abnormally high because of large fleet sales to rental and leasing companies. Such sales do not normally reflect retail demand.
"I want to see a few more periods before declaring victory," said Mr. Heinbach, who noted that surveys of consumer confidence suggested that retail demand should be getting stronger.
 Dealers reported signs of retail strength, but little sustained momentum. "We had three good months in a row, and May started out fine, but it fizzled out," said Arne Anderson, sales manager of Highland Park Ford in Highland Park, Ill. He said showroom traffic consisted of "a lot of lookers, not serious buyers."
Jeff Clark, general sales manager of Koons Chevrolet, Geo, Chrysler in Tysons Corner, Va., said he was encouraged that the market for customized vans was picking up. "For people to spend on that type of luxury item means the marketplace is starting to come back a bit," he said.
At Pacifico Ford in Philadelphia, Bernard Henderson, the sales manager, said, "Sales are good, but they should be great, because we are in our season."
 
 
Ford Gains 11% in Cars
 The General Motors Corporation posted a 1.9 percent increase in car sales, to 94,323, and a 6.5 percent increase in light-truck sales, to 51,790. The Ford Motor Company posted an 11 percent increase in car sales, to 54,044, and a 16 percent increase in light-truck sales, to 45,739.
The Chrysler Corporation, which announces sales only once a month, sold an estimated 5.7 percent more cars, or 17,175, and 40.1 percent more light trucks, or 34,275, according to Ward's Automotive Reports.
The Big Three sold 297,346 domestically made vehicles, or 89 percent, compared with an 88.4 percent share in the 1991 period. The Japanese companies with North American plants sold 11 percent of all North American-made vehicles, down from 11.6 percent a year earlier.
 
 
Big Gain for Toyoto
 Honda Motor Company suffered a 20.1 percent decline in sales of domestically built cars, to 12,732. The Toyota Motor Corporation raised its car sales 41.7 percent, to 9,897, on the strength of its redesigned Camry. The Nissan Motor Company's car sales fell 10 percent, to 3,327.
Among the smaller Japanese car makers, the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation posted a 29.4 percent increase, to 1,694; the Mazda Motor Corporation gained 33.4 percent, to 1,357, and Subaru posted sales of 1,287, an increase of 8.8 percent.
Among Japanese auto makers that make light trucks in the United States, Nissan sold 3,220, down 14.9 percent. Toyota, in its first year of production, sold 1,257 for the period.

HEADLINE: Consumers More Bullish About Future

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Consumers are becoming decidedly more bullish about the next six months and a bit less gloomy about the present, the Conference Board reported yesterday.
The board's index rose to 71.6 in May from 65.1 in April and has jumped from 47.3 in February. 
 "People are grudgingly accepting that we're pulling out of the recession," said David Kelly, who forecasts consumer spending at DRI/McGraw-Hill, the Lexington, Mass., economic consulting firm.
Consumers' brighter mood, in turn, is cheering forecasters, who see the latest reading as another sign that the economic recovery is likely to last past Labor Day.
 
The 'Real McCoy'
 "I feel quite confident that this is the real McCoy," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the consumer research center at the Conference Board, a business research group based in New York. "An improvement of this magnitude over such a short time closely parallels past recovery experiences."
Mr. Linden, incidentally, was one of those most skeptical of last year's post-Persian Gulf war rebound in consumer spirits. That revival eventually died when the job market failed to improve significantly.
This time, economists said, consumers have also been spending handily. Retail sales have been rising for several months. Car sales perked up to a yearly rate of 6.7 million units in mid-May, the strongest pace this year, according to auto companies.
One confidence-inspiring aspect of the May Conference Board report is that the proportion of respondents who say that jobs are "hard to find," 40 percent, is down from 49 percent in February. What's more, the number who expect jobs to become more abundant now outnumbers, if barely, those who fear fewer jobs ahead.
"That's particularly encouraging," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence. "Historically, responses to the Conference Board's questions about jobs are highly correlated with the unemployment rate."
Together with recent declines in new claims for jobless benefits, he added, "the Conference Board report suggests that unemployment is easing somewhat." The Government's employment report for May is scheduled to be issued at the end of next week.
To be sure, the May consumer confidence reading, 71.6, is still in the so-so zone. Typically, Mr. Linden points out, very good times bring readings over 100. The board's consumer survey is a mail survey of 5,000 families.
The gain registered for May by the preliminary University of Michigan consumer sentiment poll was less robust than the Conference Board's. The weekly ABC/Money magazine survey has actually edged down a tad in the last couple of weeks.
"My impression is that the Conference Board index is playing a little bit of catch up with the University of Michigan index," Mr. Kelly said.
Still, the rebound in confidence has all the marks of a classic pattern.
"Historically, you get a strong burst of enthusiasm about the future while perceptions of current conditions remain uninspiring," Mr. Linden of the Conference Board said. "In each of the last three or four recessions, there's been a marked improvement in expectations long before the rest came to life."
 
Last Recovery's Performance
 In the last recovery, in 1982-83, for example, expectations rocketed over the 100 mark within three months of the recession's trough while assessments of current conditions continued to deteriorate.
Now, expectations are at 95.5, up 32 points in three months and almost back to where they were last summer. Meanwhile, the current conditions index is 35, up 13 points but nowhere near its level a year ago, much less its normal reading in the low 100's
"At any given moment, the consumer is slightly schizoid," Mr. Linden said. "Why there's so much enthusiasm about the future and such a shrug about the present is hard to explain."

Rising Consumer Confidence: Signal for Stocks?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Consumer confidence is rising, and while it may not be going up fast enough to assure President Bush's re-election, it nonetheless is providing a comforting indication for stock buyers.
In the more than two decades that the Conference Board, a business research group in New York, has been reporting on consumer confidence, the figure that has proved to be the most indicative of stock market behavior is the relative levels of consumer confidence: whether the 5,000 people interviewed think the future is likely to be better than they believe the present to be. Right now, the future looks much better than the present. 
 Those who buy stock do so, presumably, because they expect share prices to rise in the future, and it stands to reason that they would expect that to happen when they think things are likely to get better. But when they fear that things are likely to be significantly worse than the present, share prices may be vulnerable.
Sure enough, while no market indicator is perfect, that one has, over time, a good record as a forecaster. Moreover, because consumers' relative opinions of the future compared with the present show relatively little volatility, the indicator has given few buy and sell signals.
Yesterday the Conference Board, which has been measuring consumer opinion since 1967, reported that the overall level of consumer confidence rose to 71.6 in May, up from 65.1 in April and a low of 47.3 in February. That overall figure includes figures on consumers' evaluation of present conditions, which rose to 35, from 28 a month earlier, and a low of 22.5 in December, and on future expectations, which rose to 95.9 in May from 89.7 in April. [Page D7..]
Consumers' expectations of the future bottomed in January 1991, at 55.6, just before it became clear that the Persian Gulf war would end in a relatively quick allied victory. But after rising through last summer, expectations of the future began to fall again, reaching a recent low of 62.2 in February.
All the figures are indexes, based on the average of monthly readings in 1985 equaling 100.
Looking at the history, and applying a criterion stating that stocks should be bought when the index of future expectations rises to at least nine points above the index of current conditions, and sold when it falls to at least nine points below the current index, produces only a handful of buy and sell signals. But they have not been bad ones.
When the study was first conducted, in February 1969, it showed that consumers were positive about both the present and future, but more so about the present. By August 1970, when that had turned around, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 16 percent from where it had been when the first measure was taken. Over the succeeding years, the indicator would have called for selling at the end of February 1973, buying in December 1974, selling in May 1978, buying in June 1980 and selling in June 1987, shortly before the 1987 crash.
That crash shook consumer views of the future, and it was not until February 1991, well after the stock market had made up the losses from the crash, that it provided a new buy signal.
Still, from the time the Conference Board released its first consumer confidence poll through yesterday, the Dow has risen 272 percent. By contrast, a portfolio that was invested in the Dow stocks only when the view of the future was more rosy than the current view would be up 454 percent. The figures ignore transaction costs, dividend income and the money that could be earned on alternative investments when not invested in stocks.
Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center, noted yesterday that it was common for future expectations to rise sharply in the early months of an economic recovery, but he said the Conference Board had never studied the correlation between its study and stock prices.
For President Bush, the rising tide of consumer confidence is probably good news, but it may not be good enough. In the five previous Presidential elections for which the data are available, the incumbent party won three elections, and the challenger two, in 1976 and 1980. In both years, the overall consumer confidence rating was under 90 in the month before the election. In the years when the incumbent party was re-elected, the rating was always 99 or above. Now, it is 71.6.
In both years when the incumbents lost, the public thought the future would be significantly better than the present, as it does now. In the other three elections, the public either thought the future and present were about the same, or believed the present was better.

GRAPHIC: Graph: The Conference Board index of consumer expectations about future conditions, minus the Conference Board index of consumer attitudes about present conditions. The resulting figure shows when consumers think the future will be significantly better than the present, yielding the buy signals, and when the opposite condition prevails, creating the sell signals. The graph begins in 1969 and runs through the present.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Lower Despite Signs Of a Recovery in the Offing

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mostly lower in lackluster trading yesterday after the holiday weekend.
Gold prices rose. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $338.20 a troy ounce, up 30 cents from Friday, the last trading day before the Memorial Day weekend. The Republic National Bank said gold had risen 10 cents an ounce to a late bid price of $337.85. 
 Traders said the dollar had seen little movement despite a positive economic report that should have helped it. The Conference Board, a business research group, said its consumer confidence index had jumped sharply in May.
 
Contrary to Expectations
 "We have the hard economic data to support a higher dollar," John Nelson, a vice president and trader at Algemene Bank Nederland in New York, said of the Conference Board survey and other recent reports. "What we need is a subtle change in perception" by the market that the economy is in fact gaining strength.
The dollar tends to rise when the economy is strong, because of the increased likelihood of stable or higher interest rates.
In Tokyo the dollar closed at 129.15 yen, up 0.05 yen from Monday's close. Later in London the dollar was quoted at 129.30 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 129.45 yen, up from 129.20 late Friday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8280, from $1.8193 late Monday. In New York sterling cost $1.8250, up from $1.8160 late Friday.
In Europe, one dollar bought 1.6080 German marks, down from 1.6145 late Monday. In New York the dollar traded at 1.6120 marks, down from 1.6160 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.4820 Swiss francs, down from 1.4860; 5.4190 French francs, down from 5.4265; 1,214.00 Italian lire, down from 1,216.75, and 1.20235 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1966.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday, included: 1.4785 Swiss francs, down from 1.4860; 5.4030 French francs, down from 5.4345; 1.8103 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8175; 1,212.25 Italian lire, down from 1,216.55, and 1.2021 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1988.

HEADLINE: Dominican Restaurants: A New Beat in Nueva York

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE

 BODY:
TEMPTATION, not rice and beans, is the specialty of New York City's flourishing new Dominican restaurants. At El Lina in Inwood, seductive aromas billow from the door, making the unassuming diner a cinch to find. Step down from the No. 1 train at the 207th Street station, then drift in the direction of the cloud of garlic, coriander and green pepper. El Lina, one block west, is the storefront with the percolating jukebox and Versailles hall of mirrors.
Inside, a Caribbean Lollobrigida sashays over with the menu in merengue rhythm, beaming a smile. Second-time diners rate a smile and a wink. Regulars, the lucky ones anyway, get the works: an exuberant "Hola, mi amor" and a big hug. 
 "Dominican waitresses are flirtatious, and the best ones can pack the lunch counter three rows deep with admirers," said Bruno Aguancha, a Lina regular, as he drizzled a mojito sauce of raw garlic, lime and olive oil over his platter of sizzling fried plantains. "But, of course, what keeps you faithful is the food."
With a shot of Caribbean verve, and some first-rate cooking, enterprising immigrants from the Dominican Republic have invigorated Latin cuisine in New York, upgrading familiar rice-and-beans joints in neighborhoods from Park Slope in Brooklyn to the Upper West Side in Manhattan. As they did with New York's bodegas and neighborhood supermarkets, Dominican entrepreneurs have been buying up sluggish local diners and lunch counters, then transforming them into shiny, successful establishments.
More than 500,000 Dominicans live in the New York region, making them the second-largest Hispanic group, after Puerto Ricans. The majority of these Dominicans arrived in the 1970's and 80's. Yvonne Ortiz, a chef and founding member of the Association of Hispanics in Food Service, said that many of these first-generation Dominicans were entering labor-intensive businesses that other more established Hispanic groups have outgrown.
"Most Puerto Ricans here are second-, third- or fourth-generation," she said. "The Puerto Rican who struggled in the food business for 20 years is now retired, and his sons and daughters are lawyers."
Dominican diners and lunch counters -- they're called fondas in Spanish -- are booming in all boroughs, and especially in Washington Heights, where Broadway seems to have become a glittery extension of Santo Domingo's main drag, the Malecon. But elsewhere, the Dominican takeover of the fondas has been a quiet one. Indeed, many of the customers, Hispanic and non-Hispanic, who crowd popular eateries like El Lina, or Casilda's or Las Marcias, both on Amsterdam Avenue in Manhattan, have no idea that their creamy sancocho soups, breaded pan-fried steaks and peppery deep-fried chicken are Dominican, not Cuban or Puerto Rican.
"We don't call ourselves a Dominican restaurant because we want to appeal to all nationalities," said Humberto Pichardo, who with his wife, Marcia, owns Las Marcias at 588 Amsterdam Avenue (88th Street). Both Las Marcias' menu and its storefront sign bear the legend favored by most Dominican restaurateurs: Spanish and American food.
But there's no mistaking the Dominican touch. "You can almost feel the flavors of my country," said Andres Hernandez, a chef and owner of La Sarten at 564 Amsterdam Avenue (87th Street), rubbing his fingertips together as if to conjure them from thin air. "Ahh! the garlic, the onions, oregano . . ."
The Dominican repertory of savory stews, lightly sauteed steaks and fried and grilled seafoods, accompanied by rice, plantains and red beans, is similar to the cuisine found all over the Latin Caribbean, especially in Cuba, Mr. Hernandez said. But there is an important difference. "Cuban food is closer to Spain," he said. "Dominican cooking, like our people, is closer to Africa."
The Dominican Republic's African heritage can be savored in every hearty spoonful of sancocho, the rich yellow-orange soup made from chicken, beef, goat or pork (sometimes all of the above). Earthy, fragrant chunks of West African yams, along with several other related varieties of root vegetables (called viveres in Dominican Spanish) thicken this meal in a bowl. A serving of sancocho, garnished with white rice and fresh slices of avocado, is a Sunday afternoon ritual in Santo Domingo, and the custom is moving north.
Pablo Rosado, the head chef at Sugar Reef, the popular Caribbean restaurant in the East Village, has been teaching non-Dominicans to appreciate sancocho's exotic ingredients. "The yams, the names, the yuca and the yautia are strange to Americans, but delicious once you try them," he said. "So, for downtown, I cut the viveres into smaller pieces, so they're not so intimidating."
The 32-year-old Mr. Rosado, who prefers a baseball cap to the traditional chef's toque, is an example of another important Dominican culinary coup. Ten years ago, many of the Dominicans who immigrated to the United States found jobs in New York's restaurant industry. Like Mr. Rosado, a graduate of a Santo Domingo cooking school who began working in New York as a busboy, they started at the bottom and worked their way up. Today, many of these talented Dominican cooks have become key players in New York restaurants.
"Just about all New York restaurants have a Dominican in the kitchen," Mr. Rosado said, adding that the influence of his country's cooking has spread beyond the Latin community. Dominicans, he asserted, have a natural talent with food, no matter what the style of the cuisine. "I have never seen a bad Dominican cook," he said. "We're creative, we like to try new things. Give a Dominican chef a recipe, and he'll immediately begin to play with it, figure out how he can make it taste better."
Culinary inventiveness and skill shine forth even in modest Dominican restaurants. Some of these places, little more than coffee shops, produce astonishingly good meals, with original dishes that would not be out of place on the menu of a trend-setting Manhattan restaurant. And all at unbelievably low prices ($20 to $25 for dinner for two, with beer).
At El Lina, the basics, a sure test of any kitchen, fare well. White rice arrives in little plump-grained mountains that glisten with a light coating of olive oil. Beans, whether red, black or white, are garlicky and comforting. Pescado Lina -- broiled kingfish -- was fresh and moist, simply seasoned in a sauce of lime, butter, garlic and paprika.
El Lina's specialties, adventures in Creole cross-pollination, hold further surprises. The house chicken, for example, is lightly sauteed in an Oriental oyster sauce. And El Lina's special appetizer, a zesty fried ball of ground meat and flour called quipe, is a Dominicanized version of the Arabic kibbee. In El Lina's adaptation, New World Indian cornmeal replaces the traditional cracked wheat, and Iberian green olives provide an unorthodox stuffing. Eating a quipe at El Lina, diners ingest the polyglot colonial history of the Spanish Caribbean in a single bite.
As it turns out, El Lina is a Cinderella hiding behind a glass storefront and a Formica counter. The owner and chef, Santiago Quezada, and his brother Onesimo, the headwaiter, belong to the family that for 20 years ran the Pez Dorado, a well-known restaurant in Santiago, the Dominican Republic's second-largest city. Before they came to New York five years ago and opened El Lina, the Quezada brothers were schooled by their father, the chef at Pez Dorado, in the intricacies of Dominican cooking, which in Santiago maintains a strong Chinese and Syrian influence, thanks to immigration from those countries in the early part of the 20th century.
Though they've settled into 207th Street, far from the four-star precincts of New York, the Quezadas maintain their standards. "Our rice is never dry because we prepare it in a bano de Marie," Onesimo Quezada said proudly, referring to the double-boiler technique usually used for elegant Spanish custards. Mr. Quezada excused himself for a moment to replenish the water in the half-empty goblets of a nearby table, a move he executed with a matador's flourish.
Mr. Hernandez of La Sarten said it was hard for Dominican newcomers to obtain the capital necessary to open the kind of restaurants that would really provide a showcase for Dominican cooking.
"This is a rough business," he said. "Our food has the potential to be in midtown. I want it to be. It's just a matter of working our way down."
In the meantime, by keeping their eateries small-scale and informal and their overhead low, Dominican restaurateurs are prospering in New York's Latin dining market. And some, like El Lina, are already becoming legendary.
At El Lina's counter, Bruno Aguancha tells this story: "The other day, I was in a cab, and the driver suddenly turned around and said to me: 'Listen man, do you know what makes a woman happy? You take her out for Pescado Lina!' "
He laughed, and pointed out that in Spanish, the word for happy can also mean content, fulfilled or satisfied, an economy of language that begins to make perfect sense over the last sweet cup of espresso at the end of a Dominican meal.
 
Sampling The Fare
 THESE are among the most interesting Dominican restaurants in New York City, arranged here by neighborhood:
LA SARTEN 564 Amsterdam Avenue (87th Street), Manhattan; (212) 787-6448. With its pink table linen and tranquil brick walls, La Sarten is the most upscale and mainstream of the new Dominican spots. The food -- the owners call it "Spanish-Caribbean Cuisine" -- is a lighter take on the traditional Dominican fare, sometimes with a twist, like red snapper in a Caribbean-Oriental ginger sauce.
LAS MARCIAS 588 Amsterdam Avenue (88th Street), Manhattan; (212) 595-8121. Too shiny and elegant to be a coffee shop (a flower vase adorns each spotless, plastic-covered table, and there's a full bar), yet too informal to be a restaurant (there's a counter), Las Marcias typifies the new breed of Dominican restaurants. The rotating list of daily specials includes hard-to-find dishes like habichuelas blancas, white beans in a sauce thickened with pumpkin. The flan con queso, a velvety cube halfway between a custard and a cheesecake, is a typical Dominican dessert.
CASILDA'S 764 Amsterdam Avenue (97th Street), Manhattan; (212) 864-5648. On a Friday night, merengue and salsa stream from the sound system, while enormous platters of chivo guisado (goat stewed with tomato, green pepper and spices), rice, beans and plantains sail forth from the kitchen. The quality of the entrees varies from night to night, but Casilda's loyal, vociferous clientele doesn't seem to mind. Funky and bustling, Casilda's is not just a place to eat, it's a scene: the quintessential Latin diner.
EL LINA RESTAURANT 500 West 207th Street, Manhattan; (212) 567-5031. Only a trip to the Dominican Republic would provide a better introduction to that nation's cuisine. A plate of El Lina's boiled white rice, coriander-fragrant red beans and light, practically greaseless golden tostones (fried plantains) are an essay in Caribbean esthetics.
TU CASA RESTAURANT 4405 Broadway (188th Street), Manhattan; (212) 740-3245. A huge, disco-sized palace that has mirrors even on the ceiling, Tu Casa is the newest and most ambitious Dominican restaurant in Washington Heights. Nightlife, not food, is why Tu Casa is the talk of uptown; there's a full bar, a dance floor and live music. The kitchen and service, still a bit shaky, have to catch up with the ambience.
LA TERRAZA 82 Sixth Avenue (Flatbush Avenue), Park Slope, Brooklyn; (718) 783-5368. In recent years, several cheap and very good Dominican lunch counters have sprouted in this neighborhood, but La Terraza, a narrow room with a counter and five tables, is a standout. Among the top dishes is sopa de camarones, a generous serving of shrimp in a coriander-laced fish broth.

HEADLINE: Oversight at, and of, the Port Authority

 BODY:
During the booming 1980's, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey made investments that turned sour when the economy soured. Now Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York says he wants to make the agency more accountable. But reining in an agency that needs independence misses the point. The Governors of both states have enough oversight already. Indeed, they approved the very project that has earned so much criticism.
"JFK 2000" was a $3.2 billion plan to make Kennedy Airport more competitive, with a new central terminal, new roads, automated baggage systems and a control tower. A weak economy, combined with airline deregulation, doomed most of JFK 2000. Unfortunately, as New York Newsday documented, the project cost the Authority about $100 million in wasted construction. 
 Could the Authority have better protected the public? The current director, Stanley Brezenoff, says the agency was too optimistic. It got caught up in the building boom and failed to get written approval from five of the seven major airlines.
The airlines were supposed to finance the bulk of the project; going ahead without them was a blunder. But the airlines ran into such financial trouble that JFK 2000 might have collapsed anyway. And the Port Authority did cap spending at $150 million, pending approval from the holdouts.
Mr. Brezenoff concluded that the project was "a product of its time" -- ambitious, if well intentioned. Even so, Mr. Cuomo's first instinct -- to create an oversight panel -- could be destructive. The Port Authority has functioned effectively as the region's economic engine. Without some freedom from political bureaucracies, it would fall victim to governmental gridlock.
It's not as if the agency functions with total freedom, anyway. Mr. Cuomo and Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey each appoint 6 of the Authority's 12 directors. Each receives $200,000 a year to pay for a liaison staff. And each can veto any agency plans. Indeed, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Florio's predecessor, Thomas Kean, supported JFK 2000.
Mr. Brezenoff and the Authority's chairman, Richard Leone, plan to improve the way the agency reports to each Governor and how it assesses risks. Properly informed, the two Governors should be able to keep adequate watch. In any case, the goal is to strike a balance between the Authority's willingness to take risks and its accountability -- not to weaken one of the region's few effective development agencies.

HEADLINE: Backward Priorities on Haiti

 BODY:
President Bush's cruel decision to have the U.S. Coast Guard turn back Haitian refugees on the high seas marks the low point of a failing American policy. The American-supported trade embargo has failed to dislodge Haiti's repressive coup leaders and only harmed the Haitian poor. And now the order to rebuff refugees at sea without a hearing trashes American commitments to humanitarian treatment of political refugees.
Mr. Bush insists that he's acting out of concern for people who are risking their lives in makeshift boats. Besides, he says, the Haitians are fleeing poverty, not political repression. 
 But repression is fierce, and until the U.S. finds more effective ways to restore democracy, Mr. Bush's stated concerns ring hollow.
Haiti was economically desperate long before last September's coup overthrowing the country's infant democracy. Since then, its poor have been politically terrorized as well. And haphazard enforcement of a trade embargo, sanctioned by the Organization of American States and supported by the U.S., has only worsened their plight.
The leaders of Haiti's coup have capitalized on gaping loopholes in the embargo that allow oil to be imported from Europe. That has left them with little incentive to complete negotiations to restore the overthrown Government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
With violence and repression widespread, thousands of Haitians have tried to flee. Since the fall, the Coast Guard has picked up 34,000 Haitians. Of those, roughly 14,000 have been returned to Haiti after screening and 8,000 permitted to seek political asylum; 12,000 remain at the Guantanamo Bay naval base pending screening.
Now that the base has reached capacity, Mr. Bush orders the Coast Guard to halt all refugee boats and send them back. The Administration insists that anyone wishing to flee Haiti must apply at the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince. But that would expose applicants to reprisals and exclude those who can't get to the capital.
The Administration's new policy has its priorities upside down. The U.S. turns its back on desperate Haitians but fails to do all it can to address the reasons for their flight. Instead of ordering the Coast Guard to intercept helpless boat people, the Administration needs to enlist European support for oil sanctions. A tight oil embargo could make the coup leaders compromise quickly. But if not, the O.A.S. and the Administration ought to consider a naval blockade. The best way to help the refugees is to oust their oppressors at home.

HEADLINE: For Young Black Men, the Trouble Starts Early

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I commend you for spotlighting the plight of young black men in urban centers across our country in "Young Black Men" (editorial, May 7).
"Cause for Alarm," a recent study commissioned by our organization and written by Walter Stafford of the Urban Research Center in New York University's Wagner School of Public Service, concludes that the economic and social problems of black and Latino men are deeply rooted in our institutions. 
 The study found that our systems start failing children, especially young black and Latino males, at an early age. Black and Latino boys are often separated within classrooms and labeled as special problems or suspended at an early age.
On the college level, the undergraduate enrollment of black males in New York metropolitan area colleges has declined in recent years despite an increase in the college-age population. In 1988-89, those colleges and universities awarded only 5 percent of their bachelor degrees to black males and 4 percent to Latino males.
Marginalization of black and Latino men continues in the labor market, with higher unemployment and wages inadequate to support families. Most important, the problems of black and Latino men seem directly attributable to a historical and current underrepresentation in good jobs. More than 4 of every 10 black and Latino men in 1990 were employed in low-wage industries.
Sadly, one can easily surmise that the only institution that welcomes young black and Latino males is the criminal justice system. And then, when it is time for them to re-enter the community, resources to help black and Latino males are grossly inadequate. The dearth of resources has often been cited as a failure of policy and service delivery.
Even before the current budget crisis, few resources were available to meet the specific needs of black and Latino males. Culturally relevant programs designed to channel creative energy and develop leadership talents in black and Latino boys are experiments of a visionary few, and even when demonstrated as successful, are not embraced and actively promoted.

Meditation on Death
 The subject of Lou Reed's recent album, "Magic and Loss" (RCA), a meditation on death and its ramifications, seems like tough going for a concert. Pop music, with its addiction to good news or at its most dismal, broken hearts, is meant to be a celebratory experience in concert. But Mr. Reed, who is performing the suite tonight at Radio City Music Hall, is onto something more complicated. Commentators, taken aback by the subject, forgot that the suite of songs has a light feel to it; death is examined in all sorts of ways.
"Look, this piece isn't called 'Loss,' it's called 'Magic and Loss,' " Mr. Reed said. "I think the record is a perfect example of transforming a difficult situation into something more positive. I wasn't making a dirge. Death is one of the great themes. Within a short period, two of the most important people in my life died from cancer, so the piece is about friendship and how does it transform things." 
 Mr. Reed will be performing with the three-piece band that played on the record and some of the instruments, keyboards for example, will come from the guitarist, Mike Rathke, through a synthesizer. The backup singer, Little Jimmy Scott, will perform in the concerts as well. The music, spare and precisely put together, will be reproduced in concert. And Mr. Reed, who is finishing a short tour doing the material, plans not to use it on a tour of Europe next month.
"This is something I just had to do," Mr. Reed said. "It is very elegant and I had to hear it live, to try and interpret it to see how it worked. When I made the album, I didn't want to have one extra note -- it's a cliche that silence is a note, but in fact it is. So I was restrained and didn't feel like I had to fill a void."
Though Mr. Reed has avoided the funereal, the suite still covers a topic rarely touched on seriously by pop culture. It is still music that requires attentive listening. Who will pay attention?
"People who like to listen to music where the lyric and music engage them intellectually, emotionally and spiritually will get something from the music," Mr. Reed said. "It's not a cheap thrill. It's for people who want to be able to relate to the music from their own experience. The more life experiences you have the more you can relate to it. I'm surprised that more people haven't done something like this, taking advantage of the length of a CD. With 74 minutes on CD, people could be doing musical biography: a musical version of the life of Malcolm X is an obvious example. Music, because it is so powerful, is an easy way to get across to other people your experience. And it hasn't been fully explored."
 
Radio Auctions
 For the next four days, WFMU-FM (91.1), the radio station at Upsala College in East Orange, N.J., will have auctions and performances in New York to benefit its legal fund. WFMU, which programs perhaps the widest variety of contemporary music in the New York area, is being threatened by adjacent radio stations that plan to increase their signal strength. WFMU is expecting enormous legal fees to defend its territory. Well-known artists and musicians have rallied to the station's cause.
Over 300 items, including artwork by Cindy Sherman, Red Grooms, Jenny Holzer, Sue Coe, Gary Panter and William Wegman, will be up for auction. Musical items ranging from a smashed guitar used by Sonic Youth to rock posters and lithographs by Robert Mapplethorpe and David Bowie will also be auctioned.
"We've always noticed that a large percentage of artists and actors and other unemployed people were listening," said the station's program director, David Newgarden. "We do surveys, and we'd get fantastic drawings on the response sheets, and after a while we started to ask for drawings. When we realized we had to raise so much money, we knew we had a huge art audience and we thought it would be a great idea to ask for donations that would support the legal defense fund and make a great show."
The performances and auctions, at Germans van Eck Gallery at 420 West Broadway, will include performances by the Soldier String Quartet, the accordionist Guy Klucevsek and the singer and instrumentalist David Garland. Morris Katz, who the Guinness Book of World Records says is the most prolific painter alive, will paint. For information, call (201) 266-7911.

HEADLINE: New York, Amid Doubts, Broadens Recycling Plan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

 BODY:
Faced with a welter of new Federal and state regulations, New York City will soon embark on a recycling program that could quickly become one of the most costly and ambitious in the nation.
But after three years of the city's halting, anemic attempts to begin recycling, even the new program's most committed supporters question whether New York can make it work. 
 On paper the goals seem simple. The plan would rapidly accelerate recycling here from its current rate of less than 6 percent of the city's trash to at least 40 percent by the end of the decade.
By September, all residents of Manhattan will be required to bundle newsprint, plastics, glass, and metal separately from other garbage. Next year, the program will expand to every section of the Bronx and all other boroughs will be added gradually until the fall of 1994, when each New Yorker will have to participate.
In addition, the city will be required to purchase hundreds of expensive new trucks and build major new centers to process the materials they collect. The Sanitation Department will begin a vigorous new effort to target extra refuse for recycling -- like mixed waste paper and food scraps now dumped in with regular garbage.
But both advocates and skeptics wonder if New York can overcome the seemingly intractable financial, political and technical problems that have kept recycling out of a majority of city neighborhoods and have turned it into a confusing mystery in most others. The annual costs alone would more than double within the next three years and rise to at least $100 million by the year 2000.
"It will be a huge, gargantuan task," said Emily Lloyd, the city's new sanitation commissioner, who assumed office this year amid an increasingly bitter debate over the relative merits of burning garbage in major new incinerators and recycling far more than the city ever has. "There are going to be some real difficulties, but I don't think the obstacles are insurmountable."
Here and across the nation, polls repeatedly show that recycling has been embraced with a religious fervor. Its fans insist that a city like New York -- which generates more trash than any place on earth -- has a singular opportunity to mine an unending river of waste for vast and valuable troves of newsprint, plastics, metal, glass and food scraps that can be turned into compost.
 
Nervous Community Leaders
 But increasingly, as city officials debate the first waste management plan in a generation, nervous community leaders and cautious planners wonder how. After watching recycling budgets cut and almost eliminated in the past two years, they see the city falling further behind its modest goals of recycling 10 to 12 percent of its trash each year, and without new labor agreements, a fleet of sophisticated trucks, more efficient collection practices, the kinds of incentives that have worked elsewhere, the ability to sort the trash properly and above all, a budget to finance it, nobody expects recycling to succeed.
"Until now it has failed about as badly as a program can fail," said John Schall, a waste management expert who teaches at Yale University and who, as a consultant for the Tellus Institute in Boston, wrote much of the city's new comprehensive solid waste proposal required by the state. "It began as a horrible half-hearted creation. Every district collects different material on different days. It is impossible to understand. The Sanitation Department wouldn't be able to explain it if they put the instructions on a billboard. And, of course, they don't."
But a series of recent and pending laws has already begun to compel New York City to act more forcefully. The Federal Government has banned the routine practice of dumping the city's sewage at sea. A city law will require 25 percent of the New York's garbage to be recycled by 1994, more than four times the current rate. And by the end of the decade, the state will up the ante to 40 percent. Legislation likely to pass Congress this year will for the first time permit states to ban the import of garbage, which would instantly increase the pressure on New York to find less expensive new ways to dispose of its waste.
Recycling means more than separating garbage and hauling it away. The material must be uncontaminated by other refuse -- difficult at best in apartment houses that rely on chutes to funnel tons of trash each week. New York will need factories to process recycled waste and places to sell the products. Right now, for the most part, the city has neither. Its one tiny processing plant in East Harlem is squeezed onto a site of less than an acre and is continually clogged by the 80 tons of glass, metal and plastics that churn every day through its lumbering conveyers.
Markets will have to emerge for the products, because no major manufacturer is going to spend twice as much on recycled paper as it would on North America's plentiful stocks of virgin timber, or purchase plastics that do not meet its standards.
"New York keeps putting its toe in the water then taking it out," said Arthur Veverka, an engineering consultant who is trying to help bring a paper mill to New York City that would process recycled newsprint. "Business doesn't work that way, neither do people. If you make an investment in recycling, it will pay off. But it won't pay off tomorrow, and it won't pay of next year. We should be able to see further than that."
So far, however, city leaders clearly have not. Despite its enormous size and the obvious difficulties of recycling in a city that is so hard to manage, advocates say that a true political commitment could solve the problem almost overnight. Uniformity in the program would permit concise and specific public education. Markets can only develop after materials have been collected, so if the city waits for demand before it generates a decent supply the program will be doomed.
Most policy experts believe it will take a complex system of incentives, fines and legislation as wells as political commitment to catapult New York into the front ranks of recycling. The costs of garbage disposal has been masked here for 40 years by the unusual economics of the Fresh Kills Landfill. Other cities must pay to bury their garbage. New York owns Fresh Kills so the costs of using it are harder to divine. As a result, city officials have never had the urgent need to find a cheaper alternative.
 
Economic Questions
 But with available space at Fresh Kills vanishing every day, all that will have to change soon. Recycling proponents worry whether doing it on a scale never before attempted in the United States makes economic sense in this densely packed, financially hobbled and ethnically diverse world of towering apartment houses and giant dumpsters. But they worry even more about what will happen if the city is forced to rely solely on the rapidly depleting landfill or the politically detested alternative of incineration.
Budget analysts and environmental leaders often disagree, but not in this case: They all acknowledge that as long as recycling remains solely a nice idea that costs New York far more than burning or burying its garbage, the program and the expansive vision of its most ardent supporters have little chance of success.
Not surprisingly for a program with uneven financing and little consistency, participation has been paltry. New Yorkers recycle less than 6 percent of the 28,000 tons of trash they produce each day -- 13 percent if commercial waste is included. Cities rarely do well, but others do better. By comparison, Philadelphia recycles 14 percent of its residential waste each year, Newark more than 35 percent and last year Seattle, which has the nation's most aggressive residential recycling program surpassed 40 percent.
"The city has had a garbage crisis for 300 years," said John F. Ruston, a senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund, a research and advocacy group. "But the costs are finally going to make people start to pay attention. When we are paying three times as much to ship our garbage to Pennsylvania -- and we can't afford enough teachers for nurses -- people will start to notice."
Mr. Ruston and his colleagues hope the debate over the waste plan will force the city to devote a far larger percentage of its budget to recycling than to burning or burying waste.
At hearings on the city's solid waste plan in every borough over the past week, community advocates embraced recycling as they never have before. Huge signs, painted boldly on stark fields of smoke stacks, coughing stick figures and symbolic gravestones read simply, "Recycle or Die." Worried residents presented a message that could not have been louder or plainer: Recycle first, burn later -- much later.
"Accept the fact that the Navy Yard incinerator will never be built," said Borough President Howard Golden of Brooklyn, before a wildly approving audience in Borough Hall. "The people of Brooklyn can, must and will recycle."
Even if several incinerators are constructed in New York City in the coming decades -- a policy option that many consider inevitable but others regard as a political impossibility -- recycling will have to struggle to succeed here. Currently, there is no uniform education, largely because there is no uniform recycling program. This infuriates environmentalists, but they acknowledge that it does no good to teach a child what to recycle in school if he or she can rarely put his education to use.
 
Recycling Zone
 Recycling at some level clearly can succeed in New York. Supporters frequently point to one neighborhood, Park Slope in Brooklyn, where recycling works as well as anywhere in the country. Under the direction of Barry Commoner, director of the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College, the city has established a recycling zone where bottles, newsprint, mixed waste paper, plastic and glass are recycled. Last year, the 13,000 residents in the neighborhood became the first in the country to begin regular separation of food scraps for compost.
The results have been impressive, with the overall recycling rate reaching 36 percent in less than a year.
"It works like a dream," said Alicia Culver, the gregarious recycling missionary whose job it is to monitor compliance in the neighborhood and help its residents increase participation. "We have found that when you give people some help they really want to do it."
But such help -- spread throughout the city -- will cost money, and though Ms. Lloyd, the sanitation commissioner, regards the Park Slope program as a model, she acknowledges that the neighborhood is more politically active and affluent than many other communities.
"Ideally, I would love to see a volunteer army of Alicias ready to decipher the program and help neighbors," she said. "But can we rely on that alone. I just don't know."

HEADLINE: Our Friend, Japan

BYLINE: By Jonathan Rauch; Jonathan Rauch is author of "The Outnation: A Search for the Soul of Japan."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the conventional wisdom of popular economics, commerce is like warfare. That's a core belief of economic nationalism: if they are winning, then we must be losing.
If you believe this, then you probably believe that foreigners generally, and the Japanese particularly, are attacking and laying waste to America's industrial base. In fact, the truth is just the opposite. Foreign competition and investment, notably Japanese competition and investment, are revitalizing the U.S. industrial base. 
 In steel, American companies are competitive again after decades of disinvestment and obsolescence. In their 1991 study of the industry, Richard Florida, a professor of public policy at Carnegie-Mellon University, and Martin Kenney, a sociologist at the University of California at Davis, found that $7 billion in Japanese investment played a key role in bringing cutting edge technology to the U.S. "Without Japanese investment, technology and manufacturing organization," they wrote, "we would likely find ourselves with a much smaller domestic steel industry, if any at all."
In the automobile industry, relentless competitive pressure has made the Big Three miserable, but it has also taught them to build a better car. In Danville, Ill., Toyota sent a team of engineers to teach lean-manufacturing techniques to Bumper Works Inc., a company that makes bumpers for trucks. With Toyota's help, productivity rose 60 percent while defects fell 80 percent. "I don't think we knew how bad we were," the owner told The Wall Street Journal. In addition, Japanese automakers have invested $9 billion in American plants, and are demonstrating how to get higher productivity from U.S. workers.
What's true for steel and automobiles has also been true for electronics. In St. Louis, an executive of MEMC Electronics Materials told me how processes that his company learned in Japan have made the company's U.S. plants 20 percent more efficient. And Japan's quality revolution has forced companies like Motorola to reduce defects from 6,000 per million to 40 per million.
The pattern holds even for convenience stores. Japanese 7-Eleven stores are half the size yet sell twice as much as their U.S. counterparts. Now Seven-Eleven Japan Company is teaching some of its techniques to American 7-Elevens, whose parent company the Japanese bought in 1991.
International commerce, unlike war, is a positive-sum game: in the long run, everyone wins. We shouldn't be surprised, then, that figures on manufacturing output and productivity counter the idea that the U.S. industrial base being eviscerated by foreigners.
Between 1982 and 1990, U.S. manufacturing output rose 47 percent -- close to Japan's 54 percent and far ahead of output increases of 30 percent in Britain, 22 percent in Germany and 11 percent in France. The U.S. figures are not numbers you would associate with a deindustrializing country.
As for manufacturing productivity, it rose by 37 percent, beaten only by Japan's 38 percent and well ahead of Germany's 26 percent. Lagging productivity in the relatively sheltered service sector, not in manufacturing, is what drags down U.S. living standards.
Japan's economic vitality is a font of industrial innovation and vigor. Only once or twice in a century is the world blessed with such a wellspring, the last example being Henry Ford's America. Unquestionably, Japan has particular trade policies and practices that are harmful and ought to be changed (as does Europe, and America). There are plenty of issues to complain to the Japanese about. But destroying the U.S. industrial base is certainly not one of them.

European Community governments imposed a partial trade embargo on Serbia and Montenegro today and called on the United Nations to go further and ban oil sales in its own economic sanctions in the hope of forcing an end to Serbian intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Their move came just three days after they were publicly admonished by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d for moving slowly to tackle what he called the "humanitarian nightmare" gripping the former Yugoslav republic since it declared its independence from Belgrade three months ago. 
 Embarrassed by American criticism of its failure to broker a political settlement in Yugoslavia, the community was evidently eager to act before the United Nations Security Council. The Council is expected to impose a trade embargo on Serbia and Montenegro later this week.
 
Oil Is Not Included
 The community nonetheless decided against including an oil boycott in its trade embargo on the ground that the two members that send oil to Serbia and Montenegro, Greece and Britain, account for only 11 percent of the republics' oil imports.
Community officials argued that only a global oil boycott ordered by the Security Council could cut Serbia and Montenegro off from their main suppliers: Russia and China, which each provide 22 percent of their oil, Romania, which supplies 15 percent, and Iran, which supplies 13 percent. The community decision today to seek such a boycott was backed by Britain, France and Belgium, which are also Council members.
At the United Nations, diplomats said that Council members had until now been leaning toward a two-stage trade embargo, with an oil boycott left for later resolution, in part to satisfy Russia and China. But they said the community's move would strengthen the hand of governments, notably the United States, that favored including an immediate oil ban.
 
Trade Both Ways Banned
 The community decision, reached after a daylong meeting of ambassadors at its Brussels headquarters, has still to be endorsed by foreign ministers, but this is considered a formality. European diplomats said the embargo should go into force on Monday.
The community sanctions cover two-way trade with Serbia and Montenegro, which at present send over half their exports to community countries and import 45 percent of their goods from them. A community study said a trade embargo would have an "important impact" on the two republics, costing them as much as $140 million a month.
Community governments also plan to freeze export credits and to suspend scientific and technological cooperation accords, and they urged the Security Council to freeze financial assets held abroad in the name of the former Yugoslav federation. Officials said the community did not order such a freeze because these assets have reportedly already been removed from Europe.
The community's sanctions against Belgrade did not include cancellation of food, medicines and other humanitarian aid, a ban on sporting contacts or revocation of air landing rights. Germany and Italy, however, have already canceled landing rights for the Yugoslav airline, JAT, and Germany has also banned commercial road and rail traffic with Serbia and Montenegro. The United States and Canada have banned JAT from landing in their countries.
"Together, all these measures are taken in the hope of convincing Serbia and Montenegro to fully participate in the search for a lasting and peaceful solution in the peace conference," the community statement said, referring to the community's suspended mediation effort in Yugoslavia.
Before reaching their consensus today, the community ambassadors reportedly faced resistance to the idea of a trade embargo from Greece and France. Greece will lose sales to Serbia and Montenegro and France argued in favor of awaiting a decision at the United Nations Security Council.
 
France Denies Stalling
 But a French Government spokesman denied today that Paris was stalling. "France has constantly repeated that it is not opposed to sanctions being imposed on Serbia as long as they are part of a policy aimed at achieving a negotiated solution within the framework of ex-Yugoslavia," he said.
The community's efforts to broker a political settlement between the former Yugoslavia republics have been paralyzed by the upsurge of fighting of recent weeks, with the community's chief mediator, Lord Carrington of Britain, arguing that he can do little until there is a permanent cease-fire.
A separate community-backed effort to negotiate a settlement between the warring Serbs, Croats and Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina broke down in Lisbon today after Muslim leaders blamed Serbian militia for a mortar attack on a market in Sarajevo in which scores of people were killed or wounded.
Frustration over the international community's failure to end the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina even brought a flurry of speculation last weekend about the possibility of dispatching a multinational military force to guarantee the delivery of humanitarian aid to the growing army of refugees and displaced people in the region.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is now a member of the United Nations, has also appealed for the protection of such a force, but the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros Ghalil, has said that the 14,000-man peace-keeping force assigned to Serbian-populated areas of Croatia has no mandate to operate in Bosnia.
 
No U.S. Troops Plans
 After a two-day meeting North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting, the American Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney, also said today that there were no plans "at present" for American troops to become involved in Yugoslavia. While willing to contribute troops to United Nations peace-keeping forces, key community governments are opposed to the notion of trying to "make peace" in Yugoslavia.
The Yugoslav crisis nonetheless served as a backdrop for the NATO meeting in Brussels because defense ministers endorsed the proposal that the Atlantic alliance offer its troops for possible peace-keeping operations to the 52-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
This offer, which will probably be formalized when NATO foreign ministers meet in Oslo next week, appears intended to strengthen the European Security Conference's ability to tackle just the sort of complicated ethnic, minority and nationality dispute that exists in Yugoslavia.
Asked whether the 16-nation alliance was ready to send peace-keeping forces to Yugoslavia, NATO's Secretary General, Manfred Worner, replied, "I won't speculate on a possible scenario." But he stressed that NATO had no intention of becoming "the defense arm" of the European Security Conference.

HEADLINE: Russia Braces for Storm Of Mass Unemployment

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 27

 BODY:
Four months into Russia's economic reforms, as prices go up and production declines, unemployment, the most dreaded of capitalism's consequences, remains the shoe that has yet to drop.
Compared with Europe and the United States, the level of joblessness here is still negligible: 118,000 people, or less than two-tenths of 1 percent of the nation's 74 million workers, according to Russia's Government. 
 But these statistics are not much use to Anatoly, a 52-year-old Russian diplomat who will be without a job as of June 1. He is leaving the Russian Foreign Ministry on a new wave of staff reductions, and has embarked on a lonely search for work in a land where unemployment offices are ill prepared, and head-hunters unknown.
 
Idleness Is 'the End'
 "I have had offers but I am looking for something reliable, something firm," said the career diplomat, who asked that his last name not be published. "I have to find something because for me, to stay idle is the end."
Being jobless is unthinkable for most Russians, all of whom grew up with the notion of guaranteed employment, one of the few promises that Communism was able to keep. But now, as a market economy makes its debut, some are already getting their first taste of a free labor market.
Small-scale layoffs have begun, mostly among white-collar workers. The Russian Foreign Ministry, for instance, has already cut its staff by at least 40 percent, and has drawn up plans for further reductions. At the Moscow Excursion Bureau, 110 of 250 tour guides were laid off this spring, a trying experience for Yevgeny S. Likhenko, the agency's director.
"It was very difficult," Mr. Likhenko said. "These people are not being laid off because they worked badly, but because we do not have enough work to give them. Some understood that, but for others, it was very painful. They just don't want to look at reality."
 
Millions of Jobless to Come?
 Fyodor Prokopov, chairman of the Committee on Employment, a Government agency, predicts that by year's end 2.5 million to 3.5 million people will be out of work, as Russia's gigantic factories finally show the effects of their own insolvency.
As it is, an estimated 14 percent of factories and enterprises have virtually run out of money for everything but salaries, according to Mr. Prokopov, and with the country in a cash crunch, many salaries are not being paid. What is most surprising, at this stage of the reforms, is that unemployment is not more significant.
"It is in the Russian tradition that firings are very rarely practiced and only as a last step," he said. "Many factory managers are using their last tricks -- long holidays, internal transfers from the central part of the factory to its branch operations, delayed paychecks. But many of these tricks are already used up."
In big industrial centers, women are being encouraged to use up their three-year maternity leaves or to retire on maternity benefits, workers are offered long vacations at half-pay, or shorter work weeks -- all forms of what experts here call "hidden unemployment."
Layoffs are also procedurally difficult, requiring approval from the local labor unions. And as ranking members of the local establishments, factory directors are held responsible for civic order, making them reluctant to put people out on the street.
Hardest hit will be regions where the only jobs belong to a now-dying military-industrial complex. In these places, Mr. Prokopov said, unemployment could soar into the double digits, whereas in big cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg, enough of a private sector has emerged to absorb some of the loss of state jobs.
In one underground passageway under Pushkin Square, a private employment agency named Triza has laid out a table under a sign asking "What is your profession?" It matches professionals with vacancies at clients' institutes and enterprises. So far, in most professions, there are still more jobs chasing qualified people than the other way around, said a Triza representative.
 
Shift to Private Sector
 The decline in the state sector, once a monopoly, began even before the upheavals of the last year when Communism collapsed and President Boris N. Yeltsin undertook his move toward a market economy. Between 1988 and 1990, as joint ventures with foreign investors and cooperative enterprises increased, the number of people working in the state sector dropped by 3 million. In 1991, the decline was 8 percent, or 4.9 million people. By the end of 1991, 17 million people -- 23 percent of the work force -- were already working outside the state sector.
In many cases, people have simply walked out from their dead-end, low-paying Government jobs, long before the final notices were issued. Engineers have become taxi drivers, geologists work as nannies, veterans of the state supply system turn up on the bustling commodity exchanges and computer operators have taken to selling goods on the street.
This new world of business and commerce, still tenuous and sometimes shady, partly explains the relatively painless collapse of the Soviet Government last fall, when giant ministries with vast apparatuses simply disappeared overnight. Another explanation is the growth of the bureaucracy in local governments, which have become havens for displaced Communist apparatchiks and former Soviet bureaucrats.
 
Preparing for Mass Layoffs

But neither the Government nor the private sector are in a position to absorb the shock of mass layoffs, which some expect this fall. The Committee on Employment is now scrambling to put its network in place, but it admits that not all 2,300 local offices are ready. In Pskov, a medium-sized city, the local unemployment office is a room in a college dormitory.
Efforts are now being made to amend Russia's laws on unemployment, and to pass a law on bankruptcy which for the first time will lay out procedures for the actual closing of bankrupt industries.
Under the current law, an employer must pay a laid-off worker a full salary for the first three months of unemployment. The Government then picks up the benefits for a year, starting at 75 percent of the former salary, and ending at 45 percent. Unemployment benefits do not extend beyond a year -- something that proposed legislation would change, along with a flat benefit that would be simpler to distribute and administer.

HEADLINE: Model-School Plan Gets More Ideas Than Money

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
The Bush Administration's private-sector effort to inspire innovative models for the nation's schools, the New American Schools Development Corporation, has attracted a flood of proposals but less than a quarter of the $200 million needed to finance them.
Officials at the corporation said today that the nonprofit group would have enough money to finance the first round of 20 to 30 projects in July at $1.5 million apiece. But they also announced the election of Ann D. McLaughlin, a former Secretary of Labor in the Reagan Administration, as president and chief executive officer, with a mandate to improve the fund-raising effort. She will take over July 1. 
 The corporation was created last July at the behest of President Bush to persuade American businesses to donate money to create 535 experimental schools over a five-year period.
Although many business leaders saw the idea as an opportunity to encourage corporate donations to education, they also expressed concern about the venture's prospects given the depressed economy. Others worried that political pressure to contribute to the corporation would cause their existing philanthropic programs to suffer.
The corporation now has less than $45 million in commitments, raising the issue of just how many, if any, innovative projects can be financed. Some observers find it a bad omen that the deadline for financing the projects has been moved from May to July.
Paige Cassidy, a spokeswoman for the corporation, said the delay was to give the board more time to assess proposals.
 
Potentially Embarrassing
 "The Administration has really put a lot of marbles on this," said Gordon Ambach, executive director of the Chief State School Officers, a group of the top school officials from each state. "If this doesn't fly with a lot of powerful grants, I think this is going to be a tremendous embarrassment."
Ms. McLaughlin was named Secretary of Labor in December 1987 and served a little more than a year, during which she established the Workforce Quality Commission, charged with analyzing the global competitiveness of America's work force.
Ms. McLaughlin, a visiting fellow and board member at the Urban Institute, a private, nonprofit policy research organization in Washington, was traveling today and could not be reached for comment.
In a statement released by the corporation, she said: I am deeply concerned that our students are increasingly ill-prepared for the world that awaits them, and the gap between us and our competitor nations is widening every year."
The group has been without a president since February, when W. Frank Blount, a former AT&T executive, resigned as head of the corporation to run the new Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation.
Some business leaders said they thought that an improving economy and Ms. McLaughlin's ties to corporate America would boost donations.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Clinton Is Knocked Off Course by Tide for Perot

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EDISON, N.J., May 27

 BODY:
There comes a time in many campaigns when a candidate seems trapped in a script of someone else's making. So it goes for Bill Clinton, looking stoically into a local television camera and answering, perhaps for the ninth or 10th time of the day, questions about his lagging poll ratings and the growing threat of Ross Perot.
Mr. Clinton told reporters in Cleveland on Tuesday night that he was going "to stop answering foolish questions about polls," but the vow was short-lived. Within hours he was giving a series of live local television interviews, which began with a question about why it took him so long to get a local endorsement and moved quickly on to a new Ohio poll that showed the Arkansas Governor in third place in a three-way race. 
 The Democratic primary season is winding down, but Mr. Clinton seemed to be on anything but a victory tour as he traveled through Arkansas, Ohio and New Jersey this week. What should have been a grace period for the likely Democratic nominee, a time to polish his image and consolidate his support, has instead become a struggle to simply be heard over the roar of Perotism.
The Clinton entourage is acutely aware of its plight; there is a sense of grievance just below the surface, much of it directed toward the press. "I think this process in a lot of ways betrayed him," said one Clinton aide. Clinton allies talk of the unfairness of their candidate's emerging from the primary season so little known -- and known in large part for a series of "character issues" like accusations of infidelity.
But there is also a strange fatalism among some in the Clinton camp, a sense that there is little they can or should do about Mr. Perot at this stage of the campaign. Mr. Clinton himself, perhaps unwittingly, reflected that view this week, when he was asked whether it was a good idea to spend four days in his native Arkansas, given the growing threat from Mr. Perot. The Governor itemized the business that kept him home, including Tuesday's primary there. Then, referring to Mr. Perot, he added edgily: "There's nothing I can do about that now. I'm not out there running against him."
There are strategic reasons for this caution: Mr. Perot is focusing his fire on Mr. Bush, not Mr. Clinton, and in a three-way race, it could make sense for Mr. Clinton to refrain from attacks on Mr. Perot and try to remain an appealing alternative for the billionaire's supporters. But some Democrats argue that Mr. Clinton needs to take some risks with his message and his campaign style simply to get the public's attention again. He sometimes seems frozen, adrift -- an image that his Arkansas-centered schedule earlier this week only underscored.
One Democratic consultant, who like several others spoke only on condition that he not be identified, suggested that Mr. Clinton may not be keeping pace with an outraged electorate hungry for action. Mr. Clinton's candidacy is steeped in the careful centrism of the Democratic Leadership Council, and largely revolves around trying to rebuild the consensus for a new, better-managed, domestic agenda. For example, he calls for expanded college loan programs and training opportunities, welfare policies to encourage work and a new focus on economic competitiveness.
 
Leadership and Policy
 In a three-way race with Mr. Perot, who blithely asserts that the voters are interested in leadership, not detailed policy positions, Mr. Clinton's fine-tuned positioning might not be enough. Others argue that Mr. Clinton, with his calibrated responses, often comes across as too political, in a year when that is not considered a good thing to be.
He talks often about his commitment to fighting for change; he even flatly appropriated former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s slogan Monday night, "Take it Back." But he also slips easily into the language and approach of a man who has spent his career in government, a man who in a competition for outsider status seems unlikely to beat Mr. Perot, at least stylistically.
Moreover, the Clinton campaign still puts him in events that make him look like a traditional, establishment candidate; for example, the picture on Cleveland television Tuesday night showed him surrounded by two dozen Ohio mayors, who were endorsing him that day.
His aides say they are planning some bold moves in the days to come. They say that, just as they did when Mr. Clinton ran into trouble in New Hampshire and New York, they will find ways to go over the heads of the news media and put Mr. Clinton directly before the voters. He taped an interview with David Frost today, and Paul Begala, a Clinton strategist, said the campaign plans similar appearances in the future.
 
May Buy TV Time
 Mr. Begala bristled at the notion that Mr. Clinton was appropriating a page from Mr. Perot's book, asserting, "This is a Clinton strategy." The campaign is also considering such measures as buying 30 minutes of television time for a national appeal before the convention.
Beneath the strategizing, though, remains a sense of bewilderment, not unlike that found in the Bush campaign, which is also struggling to adjust to Mr. Perot. And there is a weariness to Mr. Clinton these days. He wandered back to the reporters' section of his darkened plane on Tuesday night, trying to direct the talk to safe subjects, like "The Prince of Tides" or "One Hundred Years of Solitude," two of his favorite books.
But the talk inevitably turned to Mr. Perot, and a popular Perot scenario: How a Democratic House would vote if the election where thrown to the representatives? Mr. Clinton demurred. "All of this is fascinating to talk about, but it's never going to happen," he said, quiet and guarded, dodging one last Perot question for the day.

HEADLINE: Olympia Files Bankruptcy Plan For Huge London Office Project

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, May 27

 BODY:
Olympia & York Developments Ltd., in a sign that its desperate efforts to keep its global real estate empire intact are falling apart, tonight sought British court protection from creditors for Canary Wharf, its crown jewel and the largest office-development project in Europe.
The decision by the Canadian company to ask a British court to appoint an administrator to take control of the project in East London came after 11 banks with about 550 million ($990 million) in construction loans to the project could not agree among themselves on a plan to provide additional funds, bankers and company officials said. 
 This failure by Olympia increased the chances that it would no longer be able to hold banks and other creditors at bay in New York, where Olympia is one of the city's largest landlords. If that proves to be the case, Olympia could have to seek bankruptcy protection for its New York properties.
On May 14, Olympia and a group of its Canadian subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada. While the company then took similar action in the United States, the purpose was to support the Canadian filing. Its operations in the United States are not in bankruptcy proceedings. Canary Wharf was an enormous cash drain and played a big part in bringing the Olympia empire to its knees.
 
Olympia Issues Statement
 In a statement, Olympia said it had decided to file for court protection for Canary Wharf to give it more time to try to work out a plan with its 100 or so bankers to reorganize the whole company and to protect Canary Wharf from anyone trying to seize its assets.
Olympia officials said earlier this month that Canary Wharf had about 1.15 billion ($2.07 billion) in debts.
The flagship of what is one of the world's most ambitious urban regeneration programs, Canary Wharf is less than half-finished. It currently includes about 4.6 million square feet of office space -- the vast majority of which is completed or in an advance stage of construction. The completed buildings include an 812-foot tower, Britain's tallest building.
Canary Wharf represents the dream of Olympia's owners, the Reichmann family, to build a third business district in London -- one that would rival the West End and the venerable City. The Reichmanns' decision to go ahead was a coup for Margaret Thatcher, who was then Britain's Prime Minister. She was the champion of the effort to rejuvenate the derelict docks on the Thames, where Canary Wharf is situated, and enticed developers with generous tax breaks and the promise of vast Government expenditures on the area.
But Canary Wharf fell victim to the longest recession to hit Britain since the 1930's, which has caused London's vacancy rate to soar and office rents to plunge. Today, only 60 percent of the development's 4.6 million square feet is occupied or committed.
Olympia has had particular difficulty in persuading British companies to take a chance on the development, which is reflected by the American companies that dominate its list of tenants.
Tenants include Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns, Ogilvy & Mather, the International Wheat Council, the International Sugar Organization, State Street Bank, KPMG Peat Marwick, CNA Reinsurance and Telegraph, the publisher of Britain's largest broadsheet daily newspaper.
Canary Wharf also has commitments from American Express, Texaco, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, Lehman Brothers International and Credit Suisse First Boston.
 
Possible Unraveling
 There is the possibility that the project will further unravel if some of its major tenants decide to abandon it now that its owner is insolvent. By filing for court protection, Olympia & York will have defaulted on virtually all the major leases of the project, and that will give tenants the right to jump ship. American Express, which has leased about 300,000 square feet at Canary Wharf, has indicated that if the project was put into administration the company would move to another site.
The project has been living hand to mouth for several months. On May 8, the 11 banks agreed to provide it with 21 million ($37.8 million), most of which was needed to complete work so tenants with leases could move in. But without additional funds, construction would have stopped at the end of the month.
The Canary Wharf debts include construction loans, which are backed by Canary Wharf buildings; 100 million ($180 million) from the European Investment Bank, a European Community institution, and 500 million ($900 million) covered by the Canadian bankruptcy filing. The latter, which come from a small group of banks including Canadian Imperial, Royal Bank of Canada and the Bank of Nova Scotia, are backed only by guarantees from Olympia itself.
Olympia missed a 40 million ($72 million) payment to the British Government that was due at the end of March. It was supposed to be the first installment in the 400 million ($720 million) that Olympia had agreed to contribute to the 1.7 billion ($3.06 billion) cost of building a subway line that would go through Canary Wharf.
Olympia officials had said earlier that they were seeking 300 million ($540 million) for Canary Wharf from bankers as part of the long-term plan that they had presented to their 100 or so bankers to bring their empire out of its financial crisis. In return, Olympia had offered the 11 banks up to a 30 percent equity stake in the existing phase of the project, an offer that got a chilly response from several banks.
The Financial Times reported today that Olympia had raised the request to the banks to 500 million ($900 million). It could not be confirmed tonight whether that report was accurate.
Whatever the case, a substantial number of the 11 banks -- six or seven, according to one banker -- said they were against continuing to finance the project. The 11 include Barclays, Lloyds Bank, Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover, several Canadian banks, Credit Suisse, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking and Credit Lyonnais.
In the end, the banks decided unanimously to recommend that the project be put into administration. This is a form of bankruptcy that gives the project much more chance of it emerging from bankruptcy under Olympia's control than receivership, which the banks could have demanded.
One banker who insisted on anonymity stressed that "it's not the end of the line" because the situation would give the banks more time to try to agree on a plan for the project. "It does provide a breathing space to try to find a way forward for the company as a going concern," the banker said.
 
Added Funds Approved
 A spokeswoman for Lloyds Bank P.L.C., said tonight that the banks had agreed to provide the court-appointed administrators with additional funds for Canary Wharf, but did not know the amount. Lloyds and Barclays Bank P.L.C., another large British bank, have been co-heads of the bank committee negotiating with Olympia over Canary Wharf. The administrators will be two partners of Ernst & Young, the accounting firm.
One banker who insisted on anonymity stressed that "it's not the end of the line" because the situation would give the banks more time to try to agree on a plan for the project. "It does provide a breathing space to try to find a way forward for the company as a going concern," the banker said.
Bankers are eagerly waiting to find out if the British Government picks Canary Wharf for office space for several thousand civil servants. The Government is looking for up to 500,000 square feet of office space but has vowed that it would not bail out Canary Wharf and would agree only to competitive rents.
An executive involved in the Canary Wharf negotiations said one factor that precipitated the decision to seek court protection was that the Government refused to assure the banks that it would move several thousand employees into Canary Wharf.
In a statement issued tonight, Olympia officials insisted that they still hoped that the vast majority of the company's real estate operations in North America and Britain, including Canary Wharf, would emerge from bankruptcy intact. They said of today's filing: "The application has been made to provide a mechanism for further consideration to allow for the possibility of the reorganization of the group and to protect the assets of Olympia & York/Canary Wharf Group."

HEADLINE: Racetracks Search Out New Group Of Bettors

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., May 26

 BODY:
The horse players are back on stage in the Broadway revival of "Guys and Dolls," singing of a "horse right here -- the name is Paul Revere," waving their racing forms and touting their picks. But unless current trends are reversed, the scene may mean almost nothing to audiences at future revivals.
That's because the generation of bettors who regularly visit tracks, who follow the progress of horses the way others do batting averages and who would not be caught dead in an Off-Track Betting parlor is aging, and track operators say too few young horse players are showing up to take their places along the rail. 
 Leonard M. Cohen of Scotch Plains, N.J., a 71-year-old retired engineer who has been visiting New York tracks for 45 years, said the number of familiar faces was decreasing. "The old people are dying out, and they aren't attracting enough young people," he said. "The track operators haven't found the right combination."
Increased competition for the gambling dollar and a generation weaned on the instant thrills of video games is proving a tough market for a sport that offers a minute-long race every half hour.
Despite an increase in the number of racing days over the last two decades, attendance and the amount of money placed on bets have been slipping in the metropolitan area and across the nation.
Figures from the New Jersey Racing Commission show that 5.6 million people went to the state tracks for 852 racing dates in 1989, compared to 7.2 million people for 733 racing dates in 1985. Nationally, the average amount of money bet on racing each day fell by 48 percent between 1970 and 1988, said Richard K. Thalheimer, an associate professor at the University of Louisville's School of Business and the president of an economic research company.
 
Luring Young People
 At the American Horse Council's annual convention in Washington last June, Robert E. Mulcahy, president of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, said that the industry was being hurt by its failure to compete successfully with the proliferation of other gambling and entertainment opportunities.
"Without a concerted national campaign, in my opinion, horse racing, save for a handful of events of national interest, may cease to exist as an American entertainment form," he said.
Tracks have been sinking more money into purses to attract better horses and knowledgeable horse players, while adding giveaways, free rock concerts and family-day promotions to bring the uninitiated through the turnstiles.
The Meadowlands track here, in an effort to attract what marketing analysts call the "unlaunched generation," young people who are working but who still live with their parents because of an expensive housing market, has added a sports bar and, through a direct-mail campaign that has met with some success, offers free tickets to concerts and sporting events.
"I have this theory that some people have an innate gambling gene, and if we can give them an excuse to come out and see what a wonderful entertainment experience horse racing is, they'll come back," said Allen Gutterman, vice president for marketing of the New York Racing Association.
Jim Settembre of Lake Worth, Fla., said, "The tracks are trying to attract families by putting in such things as playgrounds, but that's like putting a Band-Aid on a heart attack."
He recalls his parents' taking him against his will to Monmouth Park in Oceanport, N.J., on a rainy Memorial Day more than 20 years ago, an event that began his lifelong love affair with racing. Now, Mr. Settembre says, "I'm 41, and when I go to the track I feel like a kid when I look around at the other patrons."
His analysis of the problem is one shared by Mr. Gutterman and other experts: There is too much competition, including casinos and lotteries, for the amount of money to be wagered.
"You can't throw a rock down here without hitting some gambling establishment," Mr. Settembre said, "and jai alai frontons and dog tracks have recently started taking bets on horse races, which generates some dollars for racing but doesn't bring people to the tracks."
Professor Thalheimer of the University of Louisville studied the impact of intertrack wagering -- betting at a host track on races being staged at another New Jersey track -- and other forms of gambling on horse racing in New Jersey between 1960 and 1988. Professor Thalheimer decided to follow trends in New Jersey because it is the only state that allows gambling at the tracks, in the casinos and on the lottery.
He concluded that when New Jersey became the first state to offer intertrack wagering in 1983, that helped offset some of the adverse impact on racing from casinos and the lottery. In 1988, he found, the "handle," the amount wagered, dropped 29 percent for thoroughbred racing and 35 percent for harness racing. Without intertrack wagering, the Thalheimer report said, the handle for both types of racing would have dropped 51 percent.
Harold G. Handel, executive vice president of the New Jersey sports authority and manager of its racing programs at the Meadowlands and Monmouth Park, said that if people were reluctant to go to the track, then the races and the ability to place a bet will have to be made available to them wherever they are -- through television.
The Meadowlands track now offers televised races from other tracks on large and small screens and will spend $2 million on a new 500-seat television theater that will be able to offer the full card of races at tracks such as Belmont in New York and Laurel in Maryland.
The most dramatic change coming for bettors, according to both Mr. Gutterman and Mr. Handel, will be a system that will allow people to place bets from their living rooms as they watch races on a cable channel, with bets and winnings channeled through an account with an authorized bank.
Philadelphia Park is already using a precursor of the system that Mr. Handel said reportedly generates about $200,000 daily.

HEADLINE: American Airlines Cuts Some Fares in Half

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
American Airlines raised the stakes in the fare wars yesterday by announcing a 50 percent cut in its lowest fares less than 24 hours after Northwest Airlines offered a two-for-one summer fare. Within minutes of American's surprise announcement, most other big carriers, which matched Northwest earlier in the day, said they would also cut fares by 50 percent.
Last night, Northwest also decided to match American. "We started something others seemed to like," said Mark E. Abels, Northwest's vice president for corporate communications. 
 The two-for-one offer requires an adult and a child to fly on the same flight for the price of one ticket. In announcing American's plan, Michael W. Gunn, American's senior vice president for marketing, said anyone could fly for half price to any American or American Eagle destination in the 48 contiguous states. He added, "They are more than welcome to bring the children, but it is not required."
While most industry officials had expected American to match Northwest, its unexpected response amounted to a warning to rival carriers not to tinker with the simplified fare structure American introduced on April 9.
Through June 5, passengers can buy tickets for travel in the 48 states through Sept. 13 at 50 percent off the airlines' lowest advance purchase fare. While the current lowest fare requires a 14-day advance purchase, the new one requires only a seven-day advance. All the advance-purchase fares require a Saturday night stayover and are nonrefundable, though flights can be rescheduled for a $25 fee.
Thus, the lowest advance purchase round trip fare between New York and Los Angeles is now $200, compared with $400 -- on a 14-day advance purchase -- yesterday. Between Miami and Chicago, the lowest round trip fare drops to $145 from $290. Between Boston and San Francisco, it drops to $165 from $330.
While the new fares were not put into reservations computers before last evening, there were already indications the public may respond: After Northwest's two-for-one fare, airline ticket offices and telephone lines were far busier yesterday than at any time in recent weeks.
United Airlines, which matched Northwest's two-for-one fare on Tuesday night, reported that business was strong most of yesterday. At midafternoon, Northwest said it was so busy with telephone calls that despite its having added extra reservations agents, as many as 400 calls were on hold much of the day.
That surge of interest appears to bear out the belief of Northwest officials that something needed to be done to stimulate leisure travel, which has lagged behind industry expectations.
A big reason, apparently, is that leisure travelers considered fares too high in a sluggish economy. Full- coach fares were lowered an average of 38 percent under last month's restructuring, and first-class fares were lowered 20 to 50 percent, but advance-purchase fares were cut less than 10 percent on average and were even raised on some routes.

Treasury Issues Edge Upward

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities inched higher in slow trading yesterday, as dealers and investors cautiously began to buy securities following sharp declines in the previous two sessions.
A Government report showing a 1.4 percent increase in new orders for durable goods during April was stronger than anticipated, and traders sold notes and bonds immediately after the report was released. 
 On closer inspection, however, the data showed that excluding big gains in defense and transportation, the gains were quite modest. Moreover, unfilled orders, a leading indicator of business activity, fell for the eighth straight month, to the lowest level since August 1989.
"The level of shipments continues to exceed the level of new orders, so the manufacturing sector continues to run down its order backlog," said Charles Lieberman, a managing director at Chemical Securities Inc.
"As long as that happens, there will not be big gains in production. This report reinforces what has been the case: the manufacturing sector is not primed for a rebound."
Traders said the market was showing a somewhat firmer tone, and noted that an absence of new Treasury note and bond issues should favor higher prices over the next month.
"We are not going to see any new Treasury supply until June 23," one government bond trader said. "The absence of new paper should do the market some good, even though the economy looks like it has improved somewhat."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 101 5/32 , up 6/32 , to yield 7.89 percent, compared with 7.91 percent late Tuesday.

 Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year securities were offered at 100 18/32 , up 5/32 , to yield 7.41 percent. And the 5 1/8 percent two-year notes auctioned last week were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 5.25 percent, compared with 5.32 percent late Tuesday.
Short-term Treasury bill rates moved lower.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 3.69 percent, down four basis points, or four one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by seven basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.81 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by five basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.02 percent.
At a Treasury auction of 15-day cash management bills, the securities were sold at an average discount rate of 3.77 percent.
States and municipalities issued new tax-exempt securities at a rapid rate, as more than $1.7 billion worth of new issues were priced.
The largest competitive offering was a $256 million issue from the District of Columbia.
A bid from a group led by J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. won the bonds.
The securities were reoffered to investors with yields on serial bonds from 3.25 percent in 1993 to 6.55 percent in 2010.
A term bond maturing in 2012 was priced to yield 6.60 percent.
The issue is insured by the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation, and is rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
New-issue activity in the corporate bond market was very light.
Late Tuesday Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company acted as the sole underwriter of a $550 million three-part issue of first-mortgage bonds for Old Dominion Electric Cooperative.
The bulk of the issue consisted of $350 million worth of 30-year bonds. These 8.76 percent securities were priced at $100, or par. They are non-callable for 10 years.
The issue is rated A-3 by Moody's and A+ by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely quoted securities slipped by about 1/8 point.
Meanwhile, prices of outstanding investment-grade corporate bonds were mostly unchanged, according to market participants.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 15-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: In Hudson, 2 Democrats In Spotlight

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNION CITY, N.J., May 27

 BODY:
In an area where winning the Democratic primary has been tantamount to winning the general election, next week's primary in the 13th Congressional District has attracted one candidate bidding to become New Jersey's first Hispanic Representative and another bent on dismantling a Hudson County political machine that once had national prominence.
The Democratic incumbent, 67-year-old Frank J. Guarini, is retiring after 14 years in office, and his would-be Democratic successors are Robert Menendez, a lawyer, state Senator and the Mayor of Union City, and Robert Haney of Jersey City, a 35-year-old corporate lawyer with a Manhattan law firm. 
 The Republican candidate, Fred J. Theemling Jr. of Weehawken, is running unopposed. Mr. Theemling, also a lawyer, lost to Mr. Guarini in 1988 and 1990 and is given little chance of succeeding this year.
The emergence of Mr. Menendez and Mr. Haney as leading political contenders says as much about changes in the area as it does about redistricting, which divided the old 14th District Mr. Guarini had represented.
 
Career in Office
 At 38, Mr. Menendez has spent nearly half his life in elective offices. His public career has been nourished by the ascendancy of the Hispanic community in the political and economic life of Hudson County.
At age 20, two years after he finished high school, Mr. Menendez was elected to the Union City school board. He was elected Mayor in 1986, voted into the State Assembly the following year and in 1991 became the New Jersey Senate's only Hispanic member.
"What we are offering is the proven track record," Mr. Menendez said today after taping a debate with Mr. Haney at the studios of Riverview Cable in Union City. The debate is to be broadcast on Saturday night. "Bob Haney would take what is something positive in all our lives, experience, and try to make that a negative."
Mr. Haney has never held elective office and lost to Mr. Guarini in the 1988 Democratic primary. With a background in community service, he has campaigned almost exclusively by attacking the remnants of the Hudson County political machine and trying to link Mr. Menendez with the ham-fisted style it embodied.
 
Fight for Control
 "Mr. Menendez is basically a person who worked his way through the machine and then took it over," said Mr. Haney. "There's an undue awe for the machine. People think it can't be beat."
The patchwork of communities that make up the new 13th District is 43 percent Hispanic, and that has made Mr. Menendez, a son of Cuban immigrants, the favorite.
Behind the Democratic primary race is an even hotter fight over control of local politics.
Mr. Menendez has the backing of scores of the district's most influential politicians, including Mayor Sharpe James of Newark and the state Democratic Party chairman, Senator Raymond J. Lesniak of Elizabeth.
Mr. Haney has emerged as a favorite-son candidate among Jersey City politicians, picking up the backing of the acting Mayor, Marilyn Roman; City Councilman Jaime Vazquez; the city's Democratic chairman, Allen Manzo, and the Essex County Democratic chairman, Raymond Durkin.
The last time this area sent a Republican to Congress was on the coattails of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952, and after taking office, the new Representative promptly announced that he was switching to the Democratic Party.
The district is still heavily Democratic, though the once-vaunted Hudson County Democratic machine has been wrecked by the criminal convictions of some of its major power brokers, infighting over dwindling political spoils and now new boundaries that divide the political fiefdom.
 
Loss of a District
 The new lines were necessary because of a population shift in which New Jersey lost one of its 14 Congressional Districts.
Mr. Guarini's old 14th District was confined to Hudson County. With Jersey City, the state's second-largest city, as its base, the Hudson County Democratic Party was a juggernaut. It produced such storied politicians as Frank Hague, who during a mayoral tenure that ran from 1917 to 1949 once proclaimed, "I am the law."
The new 13th District includes only part of Jersey City and extends into Newark, in Essex County, and sections of Union and Middlesex counties.

HEADLINE: Stocks Strengthen, With Dow Up by 6.23

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The stock market staged a small upswing yesterday, as traders reappraised the outlook for oil prices. Fear of inflation's being unleashed by higher oil prices caused stocks to tumble on Tuesday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.23 points yesterday, to 3,370.44, after falling 22.56 points on Tuesday. 
 Advancing issues held a narrow edge on declines at the New York Stock Exchange.
Volume on the Big Board came to an estimated 182.2 million shares as of 4 P.M., against 197.7 million at the same point Tuesday.
The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks rose 1.70, to 577.35. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was down o.04 at 391.85.
Analysts said investors seemed to be taking a less emphatic view yesterday of the oil situation. A report that Saudi Arabia, a pivotal force in world energy markets, had shifted its oil strategy to encourage higher prices, which, in turn, could impede the nascent economic recovery, led to Tuesday's market slide.
 
Retreat in Energy Stocks
 Energy stocks, however, surged on Tuesday, only to give up some of those gains yesterday. Among the international oils, Exxon fell 2 1/4, to 61 3/4; Amoco 1 5/8, to 49 7/8; Chevron 1 5/8, to 71; Texaco 2 1/8, to 64 5/8, and Mobil 1 5/8, to 65 3/8.
In the oilfield service and drilling group, Schlumberger slipped 1 1/4, to 67 1/4; Baker Hughes 1/4, to 23 1/2, and Halliburton 7/8, to 29.
As components of the Dow Jones industrial average, Chevron, Exxon and Texaco limited the average's gain yesterday after having significantly reduced the size of its loss the day before.
In the economic news, the Commerce Department reported that new factory orders for durable goods took a bigger-than-expected 1.4 percent jump in April.
Interest rates rode out that sign of economic strength to post moderate declines. Yields on long-term Treasury bonds stood late in the day at about 7.90 percent.
Syntex led the active list, down 3 1/2 at 37 5/8 on turnover of more than 5.7 million shares. Late Tuesday the company posted flat operating earnings for its latest fiscal quarter.
Philip Morris gained 1, to 75 3/8. The company announced a new $3 billion round of stock repurchases.
Control Data rose 1 5/8, to 13 3/8. The company said it planned to divide itself into two separate entities embracing its computer products business and the remainder of its operations, which will come under the name Ceridian Corporation.

HEADLINE: Orders for Durable Goods Rise 1.4%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
New orders for long-lasting factory goods rose 1.4 percent in April, the fourth straight monthly advance, the Commerce Department reported today.
The continued climb helped allay lingering fears that the sluggish economic recovery will abort. But analysts found little to encourage a belief that the pace of the recovery will be picking up substantially. Indeed, the backlog of unfilled orders for durable goods -- a component of the department's forecasting index -- declined for the eighth straight month. 
 "I don't think they are as good as they look on the surface," Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist for the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said of today's figures. "They look much weaker," he added, citing in particular the decline, albeit a modest two-tenths of 1 percent, in the level of unfilled orders to its lowest point since August 1989.
Another widely watched item, orders for capital goods, fell 6.8 percent with military equipment excluded and 2.6 percent with military equipment and commercial aircraft excluded.
The quarterly survey of members by the National Association of Business Economists, meanwhile, showed somewhat more optimism about the economy in late April and early May than the previous survey taken in late January and early February. The 44-member panel predicted that national output would rise at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the second quarter, up from 2.1 percent projected in the late-winter poll.
And while the probability of another recession setting in by the end of the year was put at less than 1 in 5, the association said the recovery's pace would "remain subdued."
The report on durable goods, items ranging from air-conditioners to jetliners and designed to last at least three years, registered a $1.9 billion increase for transportation equipment alone. This was slightly more than the $1.8 billion increase in overall orders for durable goods, to $125.4 billion.
"The prognosis must remain guarded for the time being, due to the weakness in the nondefense capital goods sector," said Gordon Richards, economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. "This suggests that business is waiting for more decisive signs of recovery before undertaking significant new increases in equipment investment."
Orders for transportation equipment rose 6.1 percent, to $34.1 billion, while orders in primary metals rose 2.8 percent, to $10.7 billion, the report showed. But these were largely offset by declines of 2 percent, to $40.3 billion, for capital goods; 1.9 percent, to $21 billion, for industrial machinery and equipment, and three-tenths of 1 percent, to $17.3 billion, for electronic and other electrical equipment.
The military component of capital goods jumped 21.6 percent, to $8.5 billion, a level 11.3 percent more that of April 1991.
The overall 1.4 percent rise in durable goods followed increases of 2.3 percent in March, two-tenths of 1 percent in February and 2.4 percent in January. The March gain was initially reported as 1.6 percent.
Michael P. Daly, economist for the Cigna Corporation, noted that durable-goods figures tend to swing widely from month to month and said today's report did not alter his expectation for sustained but lackluster recovery.
"A pickup in capital spending is still lacking," he said.
Among unfilled orders, or backlogs, a small increase for transportation was more than offset by declines for all other major groups, the biggest being a 1 percent decline for industrial machinery and equipment. Primary metals group, the Commerce Department noted, has now fallen for seven of the last eight months.

HEADLINE: Rhode Island Plans Payout In Deposit Insurance Crisis

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
It has been a long time in coming, but with yesterday's sale of $306 million of bonds by Rhode Island, nearly 40,000 victims of the state's banking debacle should soon recover most, but not all, of their deposits.
The deposits were frozen on New Year's Day 1991 after the collapse of the private insurance company covering deposits at 45 credit unions and bank-like loan companies in the state. 
 The collapse of the Rhode Island insurer, which touched off a deposit run and the collapse a week later of the Bank of New England in neighboring Massachusetts, affected about 250,000 accounts with $1.7 billion.
In a state of two million people, the freeze was a serious blow to the economy and a major challenge to state officials, who felt a need to protect depositors but were required by law to keep the budget in balance.
Although the state did not own or back the failed deposit insurance company -- the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation -- "it was decided that the state had a moral obligation to protect depositors," said Barbara Cottom, a spokeswoman for Gov. Bruce Sundlun.
She noted that the name of the insurance company and the advertising of local institutions created an appearance of state backing.
Unlike the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which generally pays insured deposits within days of closing a failed bank, Rhode Island's financial limitations have required it to move more slowly in paying depositors.
Treatment of Rhode Island depositors has varied widely, with some regaining full access to their funds within a few weeks or months because their credit union or loan company was solvent and was eligible for Federal deposit insurance. Others have had to wait for a merger, or are still waiting.
The delay in payments was needed for the state to create a special corporation called the Rhode Island Depositors Economic Protection Corporation, or Depco, which could raise money for depositors by selling bonds. To provide Depco with money to repay the bonds, the state raised the sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent, with six-tenths of 1 percent, or $31.8 million in 1992, earmarked for Depco.
A year ago, depositors with less than $4,000 were repaid in full with money from a $150 million bond sale. But even after those payments and the shift of solvent institutions to credit unions, there are 38,600 customers at seven institutions who still do not have access to their funds and have not been earning interest since their institutions were closed. Although the state has allowed some deposit withdrawals in hardship cases, there is still $535 million frozen and unavailable.
 
Payments on June 30
 According to the state's plan, 90 percent of every deposit over $4,000 will be paid with checks to be issued on June 30. The money will come from a $306 million bond sale arranged by Depco yesterday, and a smaller sale of different bonds totaling about $150 million to be arranged next month. The remaining 10 percent will be paid in 15 annual installments beginning in 1998.
Michael V. Frazier, deputy director of Depco, said yesterday that while they were waiting for their remaining 10 percent, depositors would earn 5 percent annual interest, a better rate than is available on short-term bank certificates of deposit or money market accounts.
 
Money From Other Sources
 The money for the last 10 percent of depositors' funds will come from assets of failed institutions that Depco is selling, money collected from insurance companies or lawsuits, and Depco's share of sales tax receipts that exceed what it needs to pay interest and principal on bonds it issued.
Yesterday's bonds were offered through securities firms led by the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation. The bonds have yields as high as 6.75 percent for triple-A rated bonds due in 2019 and insured by Financial Surety Assurance, and 6.95 percent for uninsured bonds rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Although Depco's bonds are not guaranteed by the state, they are backed by the Legislature's promise to appropriate to Depco each year its share of the sales tax revenues.
 
Unusual Sale Ahead
 The next bond sale by Depco promises to be more unusual than yesterday's.
Under one scenario, the corporation could take advantage of an amendment to last year's Federal banking bill that would allow for the sale of up to $180 million of bonds whose interest would be taxable, but which would be guaranteed by the Treasury.
The amendment, which was sponsored by Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, would require Depco to pledge various assets, and any surplus from its share of the sales tax, and pay a fee of up to one-half percent of the loan.
Alternatively, Depco could sell bonds backed by assets it holds from failed credit unions and others.
Depco has hired Kidder, Peabody & Company to devise the best structure for the coming bond sale. It is paying Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm, $1.8 million to evaluate the 6,000 individual loans or pieces of real estate that were valued on the books of the failed institutions at $500 million, but are worth much less.

Control Data to Separate Into Two Companies

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 27

 BODY:
The Control Data Corporation, which has not turned a profit since 1988, said today that it would split into two independent companies and take charges of some $400 million in the second quarter as a result of the split and other restructuring costs.
After the split, Control Data's computer business will be called Control Data Systems Inc., while the company's various information service businesses will be known as the Ceridian Corporation. The information services include the Arbitron Company audience-measurement business, payroll management services, computer network services and computer systems management for government clients worldwide. 
 In a related move, Silicon Graphics Inc. said it intended to make a 10 percent investment in Control Data, which primarily resells work stations and servers manufactured by Silicon Graphics. The NEC Corporation, which sells its supercomputers in the United States through Control Data, said it was considering taking a 5 percent stake in Control Data Systems.
Control Data shares closed today at $13.375, up $1.625, on the New York Stock Exchange. Company executives said they hoped the split would make it easier for securities analysts to understand each independent company, and in turn help the companies raise capital.
 
A Slow Decline
 The split comes after Control Data's sale or closing of nearly 20 businesses in recent years, including supercomputers, disk drives and lottery management. The move marks Control Data's latest effort to restructure the company. For 1991, it reported a loss of $9.8 million on revenues of $1.52 billion.
Founded in 1957 by William C. Norris, Control Data helped make Minneapolis a center of high technology, and led to the spinoff or creation of more than 100 other companies, including Cray Research Inc., the Zytec Corporation and Northern Telecom. The company was also a leader in its support of innovative social programs, like leasing automobiles to ex-convicts. But Control Data foundered in the mid-1980's because of uncompetitive products and unfocused management.
 
Growth Opportunity Is Seen
 Unlike previous sales and restructurings, which were aimed at merely surviving, the split offers Control Data an opportunity to grow for the first time in 10 years, said Lawrence Perlman, who has been Control Data's president and chief executive since 1990. Mr. Perlman will hold those same positions for Ceridian, which he said comprised operations that had 1991 revenues of $900 million and would have been profitable as a stand-alone company.
"Everything else we've done has been to raise cash or get rid of losing operations," Mr. Perlman said in a telephone interview.
"Here, we're able to do something which will strengthen the entity," he said. "We expect the separation to provide each company with increased flexibility and the ability to pursue cooperative ventures, business combinations and other actions to grow and improve their competitive positions."
Spinning off the computer business returns Control Data to its roots, said James E. Ousley, who has headed that business for three years and will be president and chief executive of Control Data Systems.
He noted that Control Data would be the last of the so-called BUNCH companies -- Burroughs, Univac, National Cash Register, Control Data and Honeywell -- to remain an independent computer manufacturer.
Before the split, "there wasn't enough energy or financial wherewithal to really focus on the computer business," Mr. Ousley said in a telephone interview. "We are spinning out as a healthy company, with a very clean balance sheet," including $95 million in capital from Control Data, and no debt, he said.
The computer business had 1991 revenues of about $570 million, or 35 percent of the corporate total, he said, but did not have operating profits last year.
 
Attracting Investors
 Mr. Ousley said that the investments from Silicon Graphics and NEC validated the decision to split the company. As part of a conglomerate, Control Data's computer business was unable to attract such investments, he said.
Silicon Graphics has served as a supplier to Control Data since 1986, providing the company with work stations and file servers for resale. Control Data has had a similar arrangement with MIPS since 1989; Silicon Graphics is in the process of acquiring MIPS.
"Control Data and Silicon Graphics have had a very strong relationship for five or six years now," said John Kohler, vice president and general manager of Silicon Graphics' business systems division.
"Unlike a traditional buy-sell arrangement, this is an opportunity for us to get involved and help them out," he said, noting that Control Data was an investor in Silicon Graphics in its fledgling days.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Broad Gains; Gold Slips in U.S. Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose broadly in active trading on world currency markets yesterday.
Gold prices settled marginally lower after rising overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $338 a troy ounce, off 20 cents from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold slipped 30 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $337.55. 
 The dollar firmed in technical trading overseas and continued to advance when activity shifted to domestic markets. A Government report showing a larger-than-expected increase in new orders for durable goods propelled the dollar higher.
The Commerce Department said orders for "big ticket" manufactured goods rose 1.4 percent in April, far larger than the two-tenths of 1 percent increase many economists had been expecting.
"The psychology has changed now," said Randolph Donney, research director at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. "People are thinking that the Fed won't ease, that maybe the economy really does have the legs to get going."
The dollar had been forced lower by expectations that the Federal Reserve would trim interest rates to stimulate the economic recovery. Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable to investors, thereby decreasing demand for dollars.
Trading was active throughout the session. In Europe, many traders were squaring up their positions ahead of today's Ascension Day holiday. Analysts said they expected many dealers to be absent tomorrow as well.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 129.78 Japanese yen, from 129.15 yen on Tuesday. Later in London, it rose to 129.90 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 130.20 yen, up from 129.45 yen on Tuesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.8010, from $1.8280 late Tuesday. In New York, it cost $1.7950 to buy one pound, less expensive than Tuesday's $1.8250.

Money Market Fund Yields Down in the Latest Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were down in the latest week.
In the period ended Monday, yields on tax-exempt money funds were down for the third time in a month. Analysts at Donoghue's said the reasons for the decline were still tied to supply. As the yield spread between taxable and tax-exempt funds continues to narrow, the tax-free funds become relatively more attractive and demand increases, driving prices higher and yields lower. 
 "In fact," said Walter E. Frank, chief economist for Donoghue's, "all short-term yields have been coming down since the Fed easing in April. But I suspect money fund yields are bottoming, with yields moving in a narrow range through the summer at least."
The seven-day compounded average yield for a tax-exempt fund fell 5 basis points, to 3.03 percent, while the simple yield dropped 4 basis points, to 2.99 percent -- less than 3 percent for the second time this year. In the same period, the lagging 30-day compounded average yield and simple yield both dropped by a basis point, to 3.13 percent and 3.08 percent, respectively. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
Analysts at Donoghue's said the average number of days left to maturity of securities held in fund portfolios remained unchanged at 52.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day compounded yield is 4.20 percent, while the equivalent for those in the 31 percent tax bracket is 4.39 percent.
In its weekly survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, Donoghue's said the Fidelity Spartan Municipal Money Fund offered the best return, 3.86 percent, for the second consecutive week, though it was down 11 basis points. The fund's distributor is the Fidelity Distributors Corporation.
 
Taxable Funds
 In tracking the taxable funds for the week, Donoghue's reported assets declined $625 million, to $492.8 billion. Institutional assets grew $170 million, to $166 billion, while retail assets declined $795 million, to $326.8 billion.
The average seven-day taxable compounded and simple yields both fell 4 basis points, to 3.53 percent and 3.47 percent, respectively. For the 30-day compounded average, the yield was 3.58 percent, down 3 basis points, with the simple yield down 2 basis points, to 3.52 percent.
The Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series maintained its hold as the best performer with a return of 4.31 percent, 10 basis points off its pace a week ago. The fund is distributed by the Olde Discount Corporation of Detroit.
By comparison, the average bank money market account, a prime competitor of the money funds, is at 3.42 percent.

HEADLINE: With Films Scarce, New York Still Feels Impact of Boycott

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
The idea was a winner: a romantic New York comedy, starring Michael J. Fox, that would recall gems like "Breakfast at Tiffany's," "The Apartment" and "Barefoot in the Park." In the eyes of Universal Pictures, there could be only one location to make such a latter-day New York comedy. Toronto.
"In my first meeting with Universal, I was told it's impossible to shoot in New York," said Barry Sonnenfeld, director of the film, which is as yet untitled. "I said, 'I've worked on lots of films in New York.' They said, 'Well, you haven't been there in a few years. It's changed.' " 
 For film makers, the message is clear: if you want New York, you're going to have to fight for it.
A year and a half after a boycott by the Hollywood studios shut down major filming in New York, the city is struggling to recover its luster as a location for feature films, even as it experiences a continuing decline as a production center for television series and commercials.
Mr. Sonnenfeld won his battle. His comedy is now being made on the streets of Manhattan, but only because the director, fresh from the hugely successful "Addams Family," threatened to pull out of the project and the film's budget was pared to a near-Toronto level.
 
Search for a New Director
 In this uncertain climate, the search for a new director of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, a post left vacant last month when Jaynne C. Keyes left to take a job at the William Morris agency, has taken on special urgency. The city's battered film industry, valued in the billions, is looking at the appointment as a test of the city government's commitment to New York as an entertainment capital.
Anxiety is high. "This is starting to matter," said Alan S. Gordon, eastern executive secretary of the Directors Guild of America. "We're seeing rank-and-file members not being able to make a living."
As of mid-May, the Mayor's film office had issued shooting permits for 23 feature films, three of them with big budgets, compared with 48 features for the same period last year. (A more telling figure is the actual number of shooting days, since many films shoot exteriors in New York for a few days and move elsewhere to complete the film, but the film office does not compile those totals until the end of the year.) This year's figures, which do not include several big-budget films that began in late 1991 and carried over into the early months of 1992, may improve. Nina Streich, the acting director of the film office, said there were "rumblings of significant activity later this summer."
But others are not so sure. "The real state of the industry is that we've lost more than half of it, if not more, to other cities," said Martin Bregman, the producer of "Serpico" and "Sea of Love." "And once they go to other cities, they don't come back."
 
Just One TV Series Left
 The signs of malaise extend well beyond feature films. The city has experienced a long-term decline as a production center for television series. With "The Cosby Show" now off the air, NBC's "Law and Order" is the sole remaining network television series filmed in New York.
The city's hopes for a substantial new television project were dashed last month when Universal Pictures and the city's unions failed to reach agreement on a contract that would bring a potential new series, "Crime and Punishment," to New York.
Opinion in the industry is divided on whether the negotiations should be interpreted as a test case of the climate for television filming in New York, but there is no question that they were closely watched by Hollywood.
"I think it's a setback for New York, a terrible thing," said Jeffrey Hayes, a co-producer of "Law and Order." "I hire 150 people 10 months of the year for 'Law and Order.' That's a lot of work, and it's year after year."
The unions and Universal are close to a final agreement on a new, less expensive contract for "Law and Order," but the series could still leave the city. "The show has been picked up for 22 weeks," said Mr. Hayes. "The fear is that if it's renewed for 44 weeks, they'll do it anywhere."
The least glamorous segment of the business, television commercials, once provided steady work for the union rank and file in New York. But the business and the directors have drifted west to California over the last five years. In 1989, for the first time more than 50 percent of all commercials were filmed in Califonia. Last year the figure was 65 percent.
 
Sales, Not Production
 "New York has become a sales base rather than a production base," said Morton Dubin, the president of Iris Films, which produces television commercials. "There are lots of companies, but they're sales offices. I have done one shoot in New York in six months. I would love to shoot here, but I have not got a single director living in New York."
The decline in filming has begun to take a toll on the dozens of ancillary businesses that depend on filming for all or part of their livelihood. TVC Precision, one of the city's three largest film-processing laboratories, recently ceased operations, and Camera Mart, an equipment rental business, sold off part of its operations to keep afloat.
"We probably work on more major motion pictures than any other rental facility in New York, and we're off the mark by 30 to 40 percent," said Mary LeStrange, vice president for sales and marketing of General Camera. "The commercial business is painfully slow. Anyone who says their business isn't hurting is lying."
The city's film producers, union leaders and industry groups are are therefore watching developments at the film office closely. A search subcommittee drawn from the Mayor's Advisory Committee on Film and Television, a volunteer group, is now reviewing applications for the job, although it can only advise. It is looking at about 16 candidates, said Ms. Keyes, a member of the subcommittee, and will pare that number to four this week. A press spokesman for Mr. Sullivan's office said a final decision on the appointment would be made in about a month.
 
Politicking Feared
 Many film-industry representatives say they worry that the job will be treated as a political plum for what Mr. Gordon called "an administrative or public relations type." Although Mr. Gordon declined to name specific people, several others in the industry have mentioned Jeanne P. Nathan, director of public affairs for the city's Housing Authority, whose name has come up often as a potential candidate for the film office.
There is strong sentiment in the industry for both Nancy Littlefield, who served as director of the film office from 1979 to 1983, and Grace Blake, a producer and the president of New York Women in Film, who has said she does not want the job.
Ms. Streich, the acting director, has her resume on the table, and Ms. Keyes, who as a former director of the film office has powerful allies in the city government, has put forward the names of Caitlin Buchman, the head of Film Strategies, a Los Angeles consulting company, and Belinda Breese, the vice president of East Coast publicity Universal.
What the film industry appears to want is a double or even triple threat. The ideal candidate should have enough experience to wheel and deal with the studios: "Not just somebody who can beat a tomtom, but somebody who can make a deal," said Frank Stiefel, president of the East Coast chapter of the Association of Independent Commercial Producers. The art of the deal might mean delivering a block of Manhattan hotel rooms at cut rates, or sitting down with the head of Columbia Pictures to steer "Lost in Yonkers" to Yonkers. At present, the film is scheduled to be made in Cincinnati and Los Angeles.
At the same time, the ideal candidate must be wise in the ways of city politics, able not only to work the city's agencies for maximum cooperation with the film industry, but also to head off political crises of the kind that threatened to shut down production of "Bonfire of the Vanities," when the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, took exception to the way his borough was being portrayed.
 
Combating a Perception
 The new head of the film office also needs to start countering the widespread perception of New York as a hellishly difficult place to make a film.
That perception, many in the local film industry say, is unfair. The city's unions may have been a major obstacle in the past, but they now have delivered concessions on salaries and overtime that make New York more competitive with other cities. The East Coast Council, created by the unions during the boycott, now negotiates bargain-rate contracts for low-budget feature films. So far, 20 films have been made in New York under this arrangement, one for as little as $350,000.
But that's not how New York is viewed from the outside "and the city is the only entity big enough to change it," said Mr. Gordon, who has mounted a campaign to persuade the city to see the local film industry, and the film office, as an economic development opportunity. "No one thinks it's foolish to go to a bank that wants to move and offer incentives," he said. "Well, the city has a lot more to offer the movie business than it does, say, the shoe business."
The city film office has a marketing budget of about $30,000, compared with $140,000 for the California Film Commission, and $100,000 for the film office of Orlando, Fla.
"To bring the business back, you have to start from scratch and woo California," said Ms. Littlefield. "A lot of cities and states are offering a great deal. The city has to recognize this and offer something."
"The Los Angeles office knows it's a business," Mr. Gordon said. "They spend what they have to, but New York doesn't have the money to tell people that it doesn't cost 20 percent more to film here."
 
Quick Response to Rioting
 As evidence of Los Angeles's sharp reflexes, a number of film industry representatives noted that after the recent riots, Mayor Tom Bradley immediately sent out a letter to 1,100 film, television and advertising executives seeking to assure them that the city remained open for business.
In the long term, New York could rebound strongly because of its natural advantages of location, talent and culture, said Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Institute at New York University.
"I see hope in the globalization of the advertising business," Mr. Moss said. "New York is still a good, symbolic site for world media, and it's a center where we produce and groom talent. New York is still a mecca for learning how to act and make films." The boom in television programs that treat news as entertainment should also favor New York, he said.
Mr. Moss also pointed out that New York's film-training programs are turning out young directors and producers, like Spike Lee, who are committed to New York, and who generate images of the city that are enormously persuasive to foreign audiences.
Persuading Hollywood is the immediate problem, however, and ingrained attitudes die hard. "The studios view New York as if it's Tokyo, a foreign city," said Mr. Sonnenfeld. "They're afraid of it, of losing control of their projects."
"I think we will bring this film in on time and on budget," he said, referring to the Michael J. Fox film, "but it will make no difference to Universal."
Mr. Sonnenfeld laughed and shook his head as he recalled the comments of one disgruntled Hollywood producer, who vowed never to return to New York: "He said his feet ached all the time because the sidewalks in New York are harder than the ones in Los Angeles."

Where Have New York's Fans Gone?

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
FOUND my longies and went to the ball park the other day. No traffic backing onto the highway. No lines at the parking lot. The attendants all asked, "How are you today, sir?" They seemed lonely. Inside Shea Stadium, a cold, damp wind reminded me of how Richard Todd's passes often fluttered on dank December afternoons. The Jet fans, such as they were, huddled together for warmth.
It is all well and good to lay blame for the bad weather on Saddam Hussein for setting the oil wells on fire in Kuwait, on the Brazilians for burning their forests, on modern technology for producing acid rain. But is weather the main culprit for the Mets' attendance being down from last year by an average of 8,921 and the Yankees' attendance being down by 1,142? 
 Around the country, major league attendance is up by 0.7 percent, mainly because of the new stadium in Baltimore and the enthusiasm in Atlanta -- "the tyranny of statistics," said Commissioner Fay Vincent, noting that attendance for 15 of 26 teams is down, and that tickets unsold in April and May can never be recovered.
The fans will cite the poor national economy, and many will say they are turned off by high salaries and rising ticket prices, but I'm not sure they are making any overt statement by their absence. In the meantime, is something unattractive happening with New York baseball?
"I think it's a whole group of things," said Al Harazin, the general manager of the Mets, observing the turnstile average drop from 30,652 a year ago to 21,731 going into last night.
"First, it's the general economy of the New York area," Harazin said. "Normally, when you bring in superstars like Bobby Bonilla, Bret Saberhagen and Eddie Murray, you think ticket sales will jump. But despite all that, our season sales were off a little."
Harazin said that longtime customers were "consolidating" their plans from eight tickets to four, or dropping out because of financial problems. Don't cry for the Mets just yet. Harazin said the average tickets sold in the glory years was 3.3-3.5 million, and he fully expects to sell 3 million this year.
National League policy is to announce only the fans in attendance. From a Mets record of 3,047,724 in 1988, attendance dropped to 2,284,484 last year. Since the Mets make approximately $3 per person on concessions, they do prefer the paying fans to actually attend the games.
Why haven't the fans been coming out this year? Harazin said: "This has been the lousiest spring I remember. We haven't had one warm night yet, although we had a few warm days. Plus, our games are on television, and the Knicks and Rangers advanced and it was easy for the fans to say: 'Hey, it's a crummy night. Let's stay home and watch the Knicks.' "
Harazin is convinced the fans are not staging any kind of protest over prices, which now reach $15 for a box seat and $12 for most decent seats. Some other force is at work in Flushing, and it may be as simple as a generation-long period of mourning. "It may be that in the mid-80's we had a unique set of personalities," Harazin said. "We had somebody like Keith Hernandez. We had a young Doc Gooden. We had Strawberry, Carter, Mookie Wilson, Lenny Dykstra. As good as we might be, we may not be entitled to that kind of team again."
The same may be true in the Bronx, where the monuments behind the outfield fence and the retired numbers in the scorecard produce a maudlin sense of nostalgia. The Yankees' attendance dropped to 1,863,731 last year, the lowest since 1984, and their dip is more moderate than the Mets' because American League policy is to announce actual tickets sold, and because the Yankees had less far to fall.
Some people believe fans shy away from the south Bronx, but Vincent said that "is more of a perception problem than a reality problem."
"Yankee Stadium," he added, "is still a magical atmosphere, and the Yankees do a pretty good job there."
My own guess is that the fans have not been drawn back by the discreet charms of Andy Stankiewicz, Melido Perez and Buck Showalter.
Attendance is one thing, but the real economic crunch is going to come after next season when the networks start lopping off zeros from the current $1.46 billion, four-year contract with CBS and ESPN, and the owners realize how foolish they were with long-term player contracts. As somebody lucky enough to have a good job, I would not minimize the economic problems in the nation, but there is money kicking around for witless third-sequel $7 movies, expensive sneakers, designer haircuts, nail salons. My own guess is that if the Mets and Yankees were fashionable, the fans might be wearing long johns or they might be wearing short shorts, but they would be surging to the ball parks.

HEADLINE: The House Ducks on Energy

 BODY:
A sound energy strategy would have two key components: stiff energy taxes, to discourage unnecessary use, and large buffer stocks to protect the economy against catastrophic supply interruptions. Congress hasn't even thought about the former and, after yesterday's vote in the House to approve an energy bill, won't pay for the latter. So much for a sound policy.
Succumbing to pressure from oil companies and potential voter backlash, the House rejected by a vote of 263 to 135 an original provision of the bill to bring the Strategic Petroleum Reserve -- 600 million barrels of oil stored in caverns along the Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Texas -- up to its targeted capacity of one billion barrels. 
 The provision would have required oil importers and refiners to turn over about 1 percent of their sales, or the cash equivalent, to the reserve.
The need for a larger reserve was demonstrated after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Oil prices doubled, pushing the economy into recession. Yet the Administration refused to squelch the price hike by releasing oil from the reserve. It said the reserve was too small. And the law permitted use of the oil only to offset shortages, not price increases. So after spending tens of billions to create the reserve, the oil lay unused as the economy shriveled.
The solution is straightforward. First, Congress needs to amend the law so that the reserve could be tapped to offset severe price increases due to supply interruptions. Second, Congress needs to come up with money to make the reserve bigger.
Proponents of the reserve devised a plan more clever and complex than it had to be. Under one option, producers could have turned over oil directly. The companies would surely have passed along the cost to consumers -- a tax hike in all but name. And this camouflage would have invited layers of wasteful regulation and bureaucrats; there are numerous grades of oil, each of which would have to be separately regulated.
Given the onerous nature of the likely regulations, most companies would probably have elected the second option -- a straight cash payment to the Government instead. The Government would then use the cash to buy oil for the reserve. But this, too, would be little more than a disguised gasoline tax -- a fine idea, but deceptively packaged and needlessly expensive.
The honest and cheaper solution would be to fill the reserve with a visible tax hike. But the defeated provision was a next-best solution. By defeating it, the House decided to protect its electoral hide by leaving America prey to the next Saddam Hussein.

HEADLINE: 'Hello, 911? This Is Bosnia'

 BODY:
When there's an emergency and you call 911, says Haris Silajdzic, Foreign Minister of helpless little Bosnia, "someone must respond. Otherwise there can be no new world order." Every day brings ever grimmer evidence of the need for forceful help. Just yesterday, Serbian troops lobbed mortar shells into a bread line in Sarajevo, killing at least 16 civilians and wounding more than 100.
Thankfully, Secretary of State Baker appears ready at long last to answer Bosnia's call for help. Moved by its "humanitarian nightmare" and the test that poses for global security after the cold war, he urges the United Nations to impose mandatory economic sanctions on Slobodan Milosevic's outlaw Serbian regime. And commendably, Mr. Baker does not rule out more forceful steps if sanctions fail to stop the Serbian aggression and atrocities. 
 That begins to get at the causes of this nightmare. Mr. Baker also needs to deal urgently with its effects -- the 700,000 people already displaced by the Serbian carnage. The first way to do that is to encourage an armed U.N. escort for international relief efforts to ease their suffering.
Mr. Milosevic, a Communist parading as a Serbian nationalist, brazenly flouts U.N. calls to cease his aggression in Bosnia. Belgrade's behavior is so bloodthirsty, so criminal that it surely warrants mandatory step-by-step sanctions under Chapter 7 of the U.N. charter.
Chapter 7 is especially well chosen because it permits U.N. members to use force, as they did against Saddam Hussein, if the economic screw does not squeeze the Milosevic gang hard enough.
The U.S., after a period of odd dissembling, now has recalled its Ambassador and suspended all flights by the Yugoslav national airline. Washington needs to go beyond symbolic gestures. A U.N. arms embargo is already in effect; the U.S. could help tighten it by putting pressure on neighboring states that now wink at gun-running.
The European Community has imposed partial sanctions; but no real leverage is possible without an international cutoff of oil. That would require Greece, Romania and all of Serbia's neighbors to go along. The U.S. and others could offer to buy the oil bound for Serbia, and threaten sanctions against those who violate the embargo.
Meanwhile, an urgent short-term responsibility falls on the U.N., one it has so far failed to shoulder: to deal with the plight of desperate people driven from their homes by Serbia's appalling "ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia.
What did the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees do last week after a dozen U.N. trucks loaded with food and medicine were hijacked at gunpoint? Did he send in armed guards? No. He suspended the aid convoys, despite the Bosnians' urgent needs. The Red Cross also suspended operations after one of its relief workers was killed.
The U.S. can respond to the emergency by urging that these relief convoys be resumed under armed escort. Forceful U.N. action is needed to show that now, when small countries frantically call the police, the world will answer.

HEADLINE: Get Behind Child Health Summit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The promises, presages and imprudences of the political candidates are well presented by the media. In comparison, relatively little is available on the candidates' willingness to support the health of our children in the United States and worldwide. All support the health of children; one cannot do otherwise emotionally or politically. But what constitutes "support"?
The World Summit for Children resulted last year in the promises of President Bush and 70 other world leaders to enact programs to reduce disease and malnutrition among children worldwide. Congress responded by approving an increase in funds for child survival and immunization programs as contained in the World Summit for Children Implementations Act. The act received the support of more than 165 representatives and 36 senators, including the majority of our New York Congressional delegation. But the final form was severely crippled, with $101 million in aid amputated. 
 Forty thousand children die daily from causes that are preventable. Effective vaccines against six childhood infections allow an estimated four million children to survive each year. Measles, whooping cough and tetanus still result in 1.7 million children dying yearly. Yet vaccines against these and three other childhood diseases are available at a cost of about $10 per child.
This is not only a problem of other countries. Despite our greater resources and technology, the United States falls behind other countries in rates of immunization of young children. In many urban areas, the majority of preschoolers are poorly or incompletely immunized.
This year the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control have recommended a new and important initiative for universal immunization of infants against hepatitis B virus infection. Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine for 10 years, the incidence of hepatitis B has increased, causing an astounding burden in health care and human costs
An estimated 300,000 acute hepatitis B infections occur each year in this country, and more than a million individuals are chronically infected. Although many of these infections are mild and unrecognized, their sequelae result in chronic liver disease, cancer and more than 5,000 deaths every year. This annual toll is as great or greater than that caused in pre-vaccine years by diseases for which we currently vaccinate.
The devastation of this disease can be eliminated by universal immunization of our children. For this we have the vaccine and ability, but currently not the will or funds. Although the additional cost of this vaccine for infants seems like an economic burden to parents, physicians and law makers, the benefit in future dollars and health far outweighs the current cost. But promises are easily obscured by current constraints. The financing proposed for 1993 childhood immunizations does not include an increase adequate to cover the cost of this new immunization program.
Each of us should write our Congressional representatives and candidates to ask for their full support of the World Summit for Children Implementation Act for 1993 and domestic financing for immunizations.

HEADLINE: Give Homeowners A Tax Break

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The recession we are emerging from has had many causes, but one key reason it lingers can be found by looking carefully at what has happened to home values since the Comprehensive Tax Reform Act of 1986.
The reform ended many of the tax code's wildest abuses. The ability to write off against taxes $3 or $4 for every $1 invested in certain kinds of real estate partnerships made syndications boom, bidding up prices for every kind of real estate.
Unfortunately, in this climate most of us bought our homes. When tax reform let the air out of the market for abusers, it let the air out for average homeowners, too. 
 Because a primary residence is the largest single asset most people have, any big rise or fall in property values has a dramatic effect on consumer confidence. Nationwide, there has been a net drop in the average value of most people's primary asset of something like 25 percent. It's very little wonder consumers feel poorer and hesitant to spend us out of the recession. Moreover, no drop in interest rates will fix this problem.
Rather than just provide breaks to business, Congress should help average Americans regain the value of their most important asset: their homes. This could be accomplished by enacting the following programs:
* Restore the favorable capital gains treatment for primary home transactions.
* Provide an investment tax credit for first-time home purchasers.
* Grant limited tax credits for capital losses incurred in the sale of a primary residence.
* Create investment tax credits for primary home capital improvements.
It came as no surprise to me, as one who has participated in the residential real estate market for more than 20 years, that the stock market crashed and consumer confidence went south less than a year after home values were legislated away. It's time Congress helped homeowners rather than penalize them for the sins of others.

HEADLINE: U.N. Official Rebukes U.S. on Haitians

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva sharply criticized the Bush Administration today for returning Haitian refugees to Haiti without giving them the chance to appeal for protection and asylum.
United Nations officials said they believe that the United States is in violation of international agreements prohibiting the forced return of refugees rescued on the high seas. 
 The High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata of Japan, said in a letter to Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger that she was "deeply disturbed" by President Bush's executive order Sunday ending the process by which Haitians rescued at sea were taken to the detention center set up at the United States Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for questioning by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Mrs. Ogata said the order "denies those Haitians genuinely in need of international protection the opportunity to present their claims, thus exposing them to risk upon their return to Haiti."
President Bush, asked today on a campaign trip in Georgia to explain his policy, acknowledged that he worried about the "appearance" of the new measures. But he reiterated his Administration's beliefs that Haitians were not persecuted when returned forcibly, and that "the vast majority of refugees are economic."
Mr. Bush, visiting the Mount Paran Christian School in Marietta, Ga., had been challenged by a man in the audience who asked whether this new policy didn't seem "to stand counter to what America has stood for over the last couple of hundred years."
 
'Still Open Our Arms'
 The President responded: "I would not want on my conscience that that person having fled oppression would be -- anyone that was fleeing oppression -- would be victimized upon return."
"Yes, the Statue of Liberty still stands, and we still open our arms under our law to people that are politically oppressed," Mr. Bush said. But he added: "I will not, because I've sworn to uphold the Constitution, open the doors to economic refugees all over the world. We can't do that."
The crowd applauded.
At the State Department today, Richard Boucher, the deputy spokesman, said that the Administration was preparing to put into effect an Organization of American States resolution of May 17 banning from American ports all ships that do business with Haiti.
The United States has barred American ships from commercial trading with Haiti since an embargo went into effect last fall. The Administration, which has not been able to persuade European nations to join the embargo, will now have to decide whether to track and challenge European ships, which have been bringing petroleum products and a wide range of other essential supplies to Port-au-Prince.
At the same time the Administration is tightening rules on ships trading with Haiti, it is apparently continuing to relax controls on goods going to Port-au-Prince from the United States.
This week, said an aide to Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, the State Department and National Security Council approved a change allowing seeds, fertilizers and pesticides to be imported from the United States. Senator Wallop has been critical of the embargo, saying it hurts people more than governments.

Industry Views Environment

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
As next week's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro nears, the advertising industry is concentrating on a variety of environmental issues.
Still, interest in the environment among consumers, as expressed in surveys conducted by the Leo Burnett Company, has dropped to its lowest level since the agency began the nationwide studies in September 1989. 
 The Chicago-based shop said that only 40 percent of respondents in the most recent of its seven surveys, conducted in February, called the environment their leading concern, compared with the more than 70 percent who cited unemployment.
Other findings that support a declining interest in the environment included a response that 46 percent strongly agree there should be mandatory recycling laws, compared with 57 percent 18 months ago, and a tapering-off of participation in environmental activities like recycling aluminum.
Separately, an international code on the self-regulation of environmental marketing claims was endorsed yesterday by the board of the Association of National Advertisers in New York. The code, created by the World Federation of Advertisers and the International Chamber of Commerce, is intended to eliminate the need for Federal or state legislation.
The code is composed of 10 rules, including one mandating that only "serious scientific work" should support ads using technical demonstrations.

HEADLINE: To Gauge the Film Industry, Start With a Magic Number

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Filming in New York is often called a $3 billion-a-year industry, but that figure is more guesswork than fact.
 The magic number comes from the the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting and represents an estimate of the value of all location filming in 1990, New York's best year, in the 10 categories for which the office issues shooting permits. 
The number has a history. The formula that generated it was arrived at in 1982, when the office carried out a study of the economic impact of film and television production in New York. Working with M. Claire Roussy, an economist for the state's Office of Financial Analysis, the film office looked at a sample of filming budgets and arrived at an average daily expenditure on salaries, goods and services for different types of filming and still photography.
 The current dollar figure, which has not been adjusted for inflation since 1982, ranges downward from feature films -- an estimated average of $100,000 per day, or about what a $3.5 million film shooting for 35 days would spend -- to music videos ($15,000) to student films ($2,500). Multiplying the total number of shooting days in a year by average daily expenditures yields a "primary impact" figure, which is multiplied by 2.3 to obtain a "total economic impact" figure.
 
Allowing for Ripple Effect
 The 2.3 multiplier, which was calculated using models developed by the Regional Science Research Institute of Teace Dale, R.I., expresses the ripple effect that occurs when persons and companies that have received film dollars then turn around and make purchases.
 The film office says that its 2.3 multiplier is one of the lowest in use among the country's more than 200 film offices, which tend to prefer high multipliers, perhaps as a way of accentuating the importance of the film industry, and their offices.
 In 1990, the New York office issued 2,612 daily permits for feature films, making a primary impact total of $261.2 million in that category. Permits were issued for 31,746 shooting days in all categories that year, which translates into a primary impact of $1.26 billion. When multiplied by 2.3, that amount produces a total economic impact of about $3 billion.
 The figure is at best a rough estimate. First, the multiplier is by definition an educated guess. Second, because the film office keeps data only on location filming, the $3 billion does not include such New York products as network news programs, "Late Night With David Letterman," "Donahue" or the hundreds of television commercials that are shot in studios. In fact, there are only two rock-solid statistics that serve as an index to filming in New York: the daily permits issued by the film office, and the number of days worked by union members, which some unions make available and some do not, for reasons of policy or difficulty.
 Two economic portraits of the city's film industry are in the works, however. The Directors Guild of America has just announced that it will prepare an economic policy analysis of the industry, and at the Urban Research Center of New York University, Mitchell Moss, the center's director, is overseeing a study on the economic impact of the entertainment industry in New York that is scheduled to be finished by the end of the summer.

HEADLINE: U.S. SEEKS U.N. BAN ON YUGOSLAV TRADE OVER BOSNIA STRIFE

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 28

 BODY:
The United States pressed the United Nations Security Council today to impose an immediate and virtually total economic embargo, including a ban on all oil sales, on the rump Yugoslav Government in Belgrade to force it to end Serbian intervention in neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Britain, France and Belgium, the Council's three European Community members, accepted the American position in consultations at the Security Council today after favoring a weaker plan for imposing sanctions in stages. But Russia and China, two permanent Council members with veto power, which are also Serbia's principal oil suppliers, have appeared reluctant about sanctions. It was not certain that they would accept the embargo plan being pushed by Washington.
 
Medicine and Food Are Exempt
 The sanctions the United States now wants are as comprehensive as those imposed on Iraq before the Persian Gulf war. They include a ban on trade, with the exception of medicine and approved supplies of food. An embargo on arms deliveries is already in effect. 
 The sanctions would require the severing of all air links with Serbia, the freezing of its external bank accounts and other financial assets, an end to cultural, scientific and sporting contacts and "significant" cuts in the size of its diplomatic missions abroad.
The United States, with the support of Britain and Belgium, also wants the Council to rule that the Belgrade Government cannot automatically take over the old Yugoslav seat in the United Nations, but instead must apply for membership. This would give the United States veto power over Belgrade's eventual readmission. However, France has not yet agreed to this.
 
Islamic Nations Add Pressure
 Islamic nations, which have been angered by Serbian attacks on Bosnia and Herzegovina's Muslim population, were reported today to be urging Russia and China to support the sanctions. The United States is expected to have a majority of the 15-nation Council in support of the sanctions, so passage only awaits a decision by Moscow and Beijing to go along with the resolution, abstain or cast a veto that would block it. The two nations went along with a series of tough Council resolutions on Iraq in the past two years.
The American move followed a mortar attack on Wednesday that killed 16 civilians in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina,. The Bush Administration had earlier seemed ready to support the European plan for a two-stage sanctions package with an oil embargo delayed until the second stage. In Brussels on Wednesday, the 12-nation European Community imposed a limited economic embargo on the Belgrade Government, but left a decision on a ban on oil sales to the Security Council.
The new American pressure came just a week after Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d seized the lead in organizing resistance to the violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina from the European Community, accusing it of moving too slowly, calling for punitive measures against Belgrade and warning that military intervention might prove necessary.
Appearing on the NBC News program "Today" this morning, the United States Ambassador to Belgrade, Warren Zimmermann, accused Slobodan Milosevic, who as President of Serbia is the dominant figure in the new Yugoslavia, of "waging a war of aggression" against Bosnia and Herzegovina. Recently withdrawn from Belgrade as a sign of protest, Mr. Zimmermann said the Serbs, who constitute one third of the population in Bosnia and Herzegovina, were now "trying to take over two-thirds of the country" by driving other ethnic groups from their homes.
He said the mortar bombs that struck a civilian bread line in Sarajevo probably came from Serbian attackers in the hills outside the city. And he warned that if conditions worsened further, the international community would have to consider "some kind of multilateral use of force.
 
Disgust Over Attack
 American officials said the Administration was toughening its stance partly out of disgust with the Sarajevo attack, whose aftermath was shown on television around the world.
They accused the Belgrade Government of double-crossing the world by seeking to carve a Greater Serbia out of the wreckage of the defunct Yugoslav federation by force, while outwardly professing to want peace. The old federation has been broken up into independent states: Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the rump Yugoslavia, which includes Serbia and Montenegro. Another former member of the federation, Macedonia, has also declared independence but has not yet received worldwide recognition.
Many foreign diplomats here speculated that political factors entered into the the Bush Administration's sudden decision to take the lead against Belgrade.
These include a desire for President Bush to appear decisive, with six primary elections scheduled for next Tuesday. In addition, the Bush Administration, unhappy over the decision of France and Germany to create the nucleus of their own joint force outside of NATO, may also be seeking to take the lead among the Western powers, in effect showing the Europeans that only Washington has the will to be decisive. The sanctions favored by the United States are intended to force the Belgrade Government to carry out the peace proposals for Bosnia and Herzegovina that the Security Council adopted this month.
The draft sanctions resolution begins by condemning Serbia and the Yugoslav National Army for failing to cease their interference in Bosnia and Herzegovina and demands that all elements of the Croatian Army also withdraw from that republic.
Acting under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, the resolution would then impose a list of sanctions until the Security Council decided that Serbia had fully complied with the earlier peace terms.
The resolution would require Belgrade to promote an immediate cease-fire in Bosnia and Herzegovina, disband and disarm former elements of the Yugoslav Army there, end the forced displacement of ethnic groups, disarm all irregular forces and grant free access for United Nations and other humanitarian agencies.
Finally, the Security Council has demanded that all communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina take part in talks on a new constitution for the independent republic that the European Community mediators want to organize.
The 21-paragraph resolution also forbids all trade and financial dealings with Serbia except for sales of medicine and approved supplies of humanitarian foodstuffs. It freezes Belgrade's outside financial assets, but allows Greece and other countries that transship goods through Serbia to continue to do so.
Besides banning all air traffic other than approved humanitarian flights, the resolution also forbids the servicing of Serbian aircraft as well as provision of spare parts and the insurance of planes. It also calls for a security zone around Sarajevo and its airport that would allow it to be reopened for flying in humanitarian supplies.
In a new report to the Security Council today, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali stressed the growing humanitarian crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a result of the fighting and the campaign for "ethnic purification."
He reported that more than 520,000 people had been been driven from their homes and that the displacement of the civilian population "is proceeding on a scale not seen in Europe since the Second World War."

HEADLINE: Newspaper Drivers Ratify Pacts With The Times and a Distributor

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
Newspaper delivery drivers approved far-reaching labor contracts last night that ended a bitter three-week labor dispute with The New York Times and a newspaper distributor and carried the prospect of labor peace in the industry to at least the year 2000.
The new contracts promise to change the way the industry operates, giving management sweeping new powers to decide how papers will be delivered, in what size trucks, by how many drivers and along what routes. And the contracts set the stage for similar reordering, as well as other long-range agreements, with other unions.
 
A Bad Bargain to Many
 In the case of The Times, the ratification appears to clear the way for the long-delayed opening of its $450 million color printing plant in Edison, N.J.
Last night's vote resulted from the dissolution of existing contracts when distribution companies changed hands. After rejecting an earlier version of substitute contracts, union drivers at two distributors were replaced, setting off scattered violence and delivery disruptions. 
 Yesterday, after the proposed contracts were amended, 1,428 of the union's 2,900 drivers voted by substantial margins to accept what many said they still believed was a bad but unavoidable bargain.
Nevertheless, cheers greeted the results, announced at 10:30 P.M. outside the Long Island City, Queens, headquarters of the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers' Union of New York and Vicinity.
"Let's go back to work!" shouted the union president, Douglas LaChance, who steered the four contracts to ratification over often vociferous opposition.
The Times contract, which passed by the narrowest margain, was approved 754 to 655.
The votes on two other contracts with wholesale distributors to be acquired by The Times was 782 to 600 for the contract with the Metropolitan News Company and 834 to 543 for the contract with the Newark Newsdealers Supply Company.
A contract between the union and two wholesale distributors owned by Arthur E. Imperatore of Imperial Delivery Service was approved 932 to 457. The two Imperial wholesalers are Westfair Newspaper Distributors in New Rochelle, N.Y., and Newspaper Distributors Company in East Farmingdale, L.I.
The results drew praise from the publisher of The Times, Arthur Sulzberger Jr. "I couldn't be more pleased by the ratification of the contracts," he said last night. "This has been a long and painful process for everyone." He credited the efforts of Mr. LaChance and three union-appointed intermediaries who helped bring the parties together two weeks ago.
In his own statement, Mr. Imperatore, a New Jersey trucking entrepreneur, said he was pleased that the union "voted to join our family of operating companies."
But some of the drivers were clearly dismayed. Inside the Metropolitan News Company in Long Island City, which along with the Newark distributor delivers more than half the Times's daily 900,000 copies, Patrick Rizzotti, 36 years old, said it was only economic hardship after three weeks of joblessness that "put it over the top."
 
Holding Nose and Voting
 Throughout the day, drivers streamed into union headquarters a block off traffic-choked Queens Plaza under the Queensboro Bridge. Many of them left saying that they had voted yes holding their noses.
"It's designed to destroy the union," said Gary Konigsberg, 52 years old, a driver for 23 years who has been shut out of work at Mr. Imperatore's East Farmingdale distribution center.
"After they finish with us," he said, his mouth quivering, "they're going to move on other unions."
The exuberant Mr. LaChance, who has campaigned for passage of the contracts, back-slapped his way to the head of a line of drivers waiting to vote at 3 P.M.
 
'Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.'
 "Watch me vote!" he cried, handing his union card to a member of the Honest Ballot Association, which was overseeing the voting. Then, lunging into one of the two voting machines, he shut the curtain and announced: "I'm in favor of all of them." He snapped down four levers, shouting, "Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes."
What was most difficult for his members to swallow, Mr. LaChance said, was the realization that the takeover of one company by another can abrogate the hardest-won labor contracts. By law, new contracts can be negotiated after so-called asset sales, the sale of parts of a company rather than its entire stock -- a matter of right or fairness, perhaps, to a buyer but anathema to workers suddenly forced to renegotiate or be replaced.
This fear of the unknown, more than any single provision, Mr. LaChance said, fueled a burning resentment throughout the membership. But at the same time, Mr. LaChance campaigned for ratification because, as he said he asked the union board on Tuesday, "Somebody want to tell me what the alternative is?"
The same blunt message was carried to the membership at the meeting on Wednesday by three union-picked intermediaries who got the parties together after the union's earlier rejection of a previous version of the contracts on May 6.
 
Brother Against Brother
 The three -- Barry Feinstein, president of Joint Council 16 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; John P. Kennedy, president of the New York Newspaper Printing Pressmen's Union No. 2, and Michael E. Connery, a lawyer with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom who represents unions in the The Daily News sale talks -- told the members that they could not expect a better offer and warned that the alternative was a war pitting union brother against brother, perhaps killing off two other precarious newspapers, The Daily News and The New York Post, in the process.
But many members said that the principles at stake overrode even the self-interest of retaining their jobs in a grim economy.
The contracts will reduce the number of union members through the use of attrition and severance bonuses, as well as cut overtime and strengthen management's hand in delivery operations ranging from staffing to route structure. At the same time, they will guarantee the jobs and advancement of regular full-time drivers, and provide for company contributions to union benefit funds and modest wage increases.
The elimination of most of the drivers' overtime would cut in half the $80,000 in annual wages many drivers make. But the contracts provide increases of $124 a week over three years, with further increases possible after that.
 
A No-Strike Provision
 Galling to many drivers is a no-strike provision that they say would force them to cross picket lines of brother union members during strikes elsewhere in the industry.
The vote followed a tangled sequence of events that go back to November 1990 when The Times and the union began talks about staffing at the Edison plant. After the union rejected two Times offers, the company won a favorable arbitration ruling, spurring the union to agree to yet another proposed settlement.
As an inducement to work-rule changes and a reduced labor force, the Times had offered severance bonuses, job guarantees and a longer-than-usual contract extending to the year 2000. This was rejected several times but became the core of the contracts ratified last night.
In February, The Times announced that to gain a firmer grip on the distribution of its papers, it planned to acquire two wholesalers, Metropolitan News and Newark Newsdealers. The wholesalers deliver the paper to stores, newsstands and home-delivery services. With the purchase of the wholesalers' assets, the existing contracts would lapse and the proposed new contract would be substituted.
Mr. Imperatore's Imperial Delivery made a similar bid for the Westfair and Newspaper Distributors operations. And that set the stage for negotiation of new contracts.
At the Newark distribution center, sighs of relief greeted news of the contracts' passage. "Hey babe, we got a job," Kim Connell, a 36-year-old driver from Lake Hiawatha, N.J., told his wife on the phone. "Yes, I'm serious. It's like winning the Super Bowl. Maybe now we'll all go to Disneyland."

HEADLINE: What About Oil?;
The Gulf War Put the Focus on Supplies, But a New Energy Bill Skips That Issue

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Sixteen months after the nation went to war over oil in the Persian Gulf, an energy bill is taking final shape in Washington, yet the focus is everywhere but on oil.
Two similar versions, one passed by the House Wednesday and the other by the Senate in February, do, however, include a variety of significant measures, most importantly affecting electric utilities. Those changes would increase efficiency in lights, appliances and motors, improve the natural gas supply for utilities and other customers, and, possibly, remove one of many stumbling blocks to building nuclear plants. 
 "I would call it a positive first step on the way to something we don't ever seem to achieve, which is a comprehensive national energy policy," said Wilfrid L. Kohl, director of the international energy program at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. That, he said, would require a stiff gasoline tax.
Such a tax was not seriously discussed in Washington, but with the United States now importing about half its crude oil and destined to import more in the future, and with the economy resonating with every big oil-price movement, there was no shortage of proposals to cut the nation's consumption or increase its supply.
Congress seriously considered drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, requiring more fuel efficiency in cars and rapidly filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But in the end, the House or Senate rejected all three.
This was probably essential to the energy bill's survival, because opponents of either Arctic drilling or stricter gas-mileage requirements could probably have sunk the package; certainly they could have done so together.
 
A Lack of Will
 "The most potentially valuable provisions were the most controversial, and there wasn't the will to tackle them," said Eli Bergman, director of Americans for Energy Independence, a Washington-based interest group.
"Senators and Congressmen will whisper that the thing that would do the most would be a $1 hike in the gasoline tax," he said. "They'll whisper it, but they won't do anything about it." In fact, last fall Congress choked on adding a nickel.
The result is an energy bill pushed into the public eye by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, but which, paradoxically, is hardly relevant to the oil-related aspects of the war. The notable exception -- extending for 10 years some bans on offshore drilling -- is a negative for the industry.
"At least," mused Lawrence J. Goldstein, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, "they were smart enough to realize they've done nothing to deal with U.S. security."
 
A Two-Year History
 The bill, now the National Energy Strategy, began life two years ago as the National Energy Security Act, intended to reduce the impact of oil shocks, Mr. Goldstein pointed out. But reaching political consensus on oil in a nation so divided between the interests of producers and consumers will evidently require a bigger oil crisis or a bloodier war.
The bill's most important provision is, for the public, obscure and barely comprehensible: revising a 50-year-old law on electric company monopolies. The change might cut electricity bills in the future, but the case is far from clear-cut. It will probably create a bigger cast of characters in the business of building generating stations, but much will depend on the outcome of the House-Senate conference on the bill, because the two houses set different terms for those generators to have access to utility-owned transmission lines.
The House bill's second-most important provision will aid in raising the efficiency of electric lights, motors and appliances. But in this role the Federal Government is merely helping along what the states and utilities are doing already.
The bill may not really deserve the title "strategy," but there are a wide variety of provisions. One would provide $927 million between now and 1996 for conservation and development of renewable energy sources.
But more than half of that "expenditure" is a Federal agreement not to jeopardize existing state conservation programs. At the urging of the states, utilities are making cash grants to electricity consumers to buy more efficient equipment, and Washington has been threatening to tax those grants, in effect putting a brake on the states' conservation programs. The House bill makes utility grants to residential customers tax-free, along with two-thirds of the grants to industries and businesses.
 
Billions for Renewables
 The rest of the money would be used to encourage production of electricity from the sun, the wind, crop wastes and the heat of the earth's core. In contrast, more than $800 million was given to independent oil producers, in the form of tax exemptions from the Alternative Minimum Tax provisions of the Federal tax code.
The bill authorizes billions of dollars for research and development, into coal, nuclear power and renewable fuels. The slice for renewables is larger than approved in recent years, but environmentalists say they are waiting to see how much is appropriated.
"It's O.K. as far as it goes," Mr. Bergman said. "It's almost incredible that we even get an energy bill this year, when the price of gasoline is at historic lows and the country has a hell of a lot of other problems."
Mr. Bergman's group was perhaps the only one to favor both drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and an increase in automobile fuel efficiency, alternatives that were initially put forward as tacitly balanced, with at least a third of the Congress vehemently opposed to one or the other.
At the Sierra Club, which feels good about the outcome in the Arctic and bereft over the failure to require higher-mileage cars, Daniel F. Becker, a lobbyist, said, "We're calling it half a good energy package."
"It's marginally better than nothing," said Mr. Goldstein of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
Representative Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, said that while oil companies should have been forced to pay for the expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, he supported the bill for its many other provisions.
"Any way you slice it, this bill helps our nation reduce its dependence on foreign oil," he said, pointing specifically to the sections on conservation and electric utilities.
But the United States is not without an energy policy. The leading Federal component, according to oil experts and environmentalists, is disguised as the Clean Air Act of 1990, which encourages the use of methanol, natural gas and electricity to run cars.
 
Influence of California
 Perhaps more significant is the California Air Resources Board, whose regulations on cars appear likely to be adopted in several large Northeastern states, perhaps almost all of them. Those regulations appear to require huge numbers of electric vehicles, along with others running on methanol and natural gas.
There are other components of the energy bill that appear likely to have a long-term impact, although not on oil. Almost no one is happy with the present system for deciding whether natural gas pipelines should be built, and the energy bill would make it easier to win approval. The electric efficiency provisions will also probably increase the average efficiency of refrigerators, lights and similar devices in years to come.
There is also a wild card: a change in the rules for licensing nuclear power plants. The change has no immediate importance, but reduces one of the many obstacles to a revival of that industry.

HEADLINE: Bush Ordered Iraqis Plied With Aid

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
A secret policy directive on the Persian Gulf region signed by President Bush in October 1989 said the United States should offer economic and political incentives to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq as a way of moderating his behavior and increasing American influence in his country.
The directive, part of which was made available to The New York Times today, also stated that Iraq should be told that the United States would impose economic and political sanctions and urge its allies to do so if Baghdad resumed its use of chemical weapons, used biological weapons or tried to develop a nuclear weapon in violation of international accords. 
 The Presidential order stipulated that Washington remained committed to defend its vital interests in the region, with military force if necessary, if they were threatened by the Soviet Union or another regional power.
The directive served as the operative guide for American policy until Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. It has become the focus of a strenuous debate over whether the United States ignored increasing signs in the late 1980's after the Iran-Iraq war that Iraq was preparing to use its military might to intimidate its neighbors.
 
Policy Clear, Order Secret
 A part of the directive was recently declassified by the White House after a request by Representative Sam Gejdenson, the Connecticut Democrat, who said today he would present it to a Congressional hearing on United States policy toward Iraq on Friday. In light of Mr. Gejdenson's plan, a Government official today made the declassified section available to The New York Times.
The section on Iran and other countries in the Persian Gulf remains classified, and it is not known whether additional material on Iraq also remains classified.
The general direction of American policy before the invasion of Kuwait has been clear for some time, but the directive has remained secret.
According to the excerpts of the document, known as National Security Decision Directive 26, Mr. Bush also stated that the United States should consider selling forms of assistance like training courses and medical exchanges on a case-by-case basis as a "means of developing access to and influence with" the Iraqi military.
 
Iraq as Regional Threat
 "Normal relations between the U.S. and Iraq would serve our longer-term interests and promote stability in both the gulf and the Middle East," said the document. "The U.S. Government should propose economic and political incentives for Iraq to moderate its behavior and to increase our influence with Iraq."
At the time, Iraq had emerged from the Iran-Iraq war as the clear victor with the most formidable military power in the Persian Gulf, while Iran was devastated and seemed intent on reconstructing its economy. Although some analysts inside and outside of Government were warning at the time that the new Administration should craft a more balanced policy that recognized Iraq, not Iran, as the primary regional threat, the directive seemed to assume that Mr. Hussein would respond favorably to rewards by Washington.
Administration officials have said that the policy was also based on the assumption that Iran and Iraq were so exhausted by their eight-year war that neither would seek outside adventures in the short term.
That assessment was also articulated in an estimate by the Central Intelligence Agency and its sister intelligence agencies in October 1989 that stated that Iraq was not expected to turn aggressive toward its neighbors for two to three years, according to recent Congressional testimony by Robert M. Gates, Director of Central Intelligence.
 
Wider Economic Ties
 The document, at least in its unclassified version, does not describe Iraq's nuclear-weapons program or its use of chemical weapons against Iran and against Kurdish civilians in Iraq.
But the directive said that Iraq would be punished if it used chemical or biological weapons or sought to develop a nucler weapon. The Reagan and Bush Administrations had strongly opposed every initiative in the Congress to impose economic sanctions against Iraq for its use of chemical weapons against its Kurdish population in August 1988.
The policy, as articulated in the directive, was also based on an expansion of economic ties between the two counties. It also said that "normal relations between the U.S. and Iraq would serve our longer term interests and promote stability in both the gulf and the Middle East."
The directive also stated the long-held policy that "access to Persian Gulf oil and the security of key friendly states in the area are vital to us national security."
It continued, "The U.S. remains committed to defend its vital interests in the region, if necessary, and appropriate, through the use of us military force, against the Soviet Union or any other regional power with interests inimical to our own."

Treasury Securities Move Higher

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher and interest rates dipped again yesterday, as traders chose to focus on news suggesting economic weakness and to largely ignore a report that may herald an improvement in labor markets.
Developments traders seemed to find important included a sizable drop in the Commodity Research Bureau's index of spot commodity prices, and declines in weekly money supply figures that were bigger than expected. 
 Mostly overlooked was a report from the Labor Department showing that the number of Americans filing for initial unemployment benefits fell by 4,000 in the week ended May 16, to 403,000, the lowest level in more than seven months.
Analysts had been expecting a small increase.
Market participants registered only mild disappointment after the report was released early yesterday, as prices showed only a modest and temporary decline.
Demand for securities quickly reappeared, particularly for issues with maturities of up to five years.
"The claims numbers weren't extraordinary, but they were on the strong side," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J. "Right now the market's mentality is to buy on price dips."
The drop in the C.R.B. index seemed to reassure those market participants who earlier in the week were worried about reports that oil prices might be moving higher.
 
Declines in Monetary Aggregates
 And the reported declines in the monetary aggregates may have rekindled hopes that the Federal Reserve Board may yet decide to lower short-term interest rates, even though many analysts said yesterday the money numbers would not be the ultimate determinant of Fed policy.
The Fed reported that all three of the money supply measures it tracks most closely fell during the week ended May 18.
M-2, the aggregate most closely monitored by the Fed, declined by $7.4 billion. The drop pushed M-2 growth back below the bottom of the 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent range the Fed has chosen for M-2 this year.
The Fed cited weak money growth as the primary reason it last eased policy in April. But analysts said that reports of the substance of recent Fed policy meetings made it unlikely weak money growth alone would cause another Fed move.
"M-2 will continue to crisscross the bottom of its target range through June," analysts at MMS International, an economic information and service company, said in their daily market commentary. "But until the economy shows definite signs of declining again, M-2 data will not draw the Fed off the sidelines."
 
Yield Down on Long Bond
 By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 101 5/8, up 15/32 , to yield 7.85 percent, compared with 7.89 percent late Wednesday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 1/32 , up 15/32 , to yield 7.35 percent. The 6 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 13/32 , up 9/32 , to yield 6.65 percent. And the 5 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 27/32 , up 3/32 , to yield 5.20 percent.
Demand was said to be fairly strong at an auction of one-year Treasury bills.
The bills were sold at an average discount rate of 4.07 percent, down from 4.20 percent at the last one-year bill sale on April 30.
In the secondary market for Treasury bills, three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 3.66 percent, down three basis points, or three one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates were unchanged on the day at a late offered rate of 3.81 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year Treasury bills:

 	 	Average Price	95.885	Discounted Rate	4.07%	Coupon Yield	4.26%	High Price	95.885	Discounted Rate	4.07%	Coupon Yield	4.26%	Low Price	95.875	Discounted Rate	4.08%	Coupon Yield	4.27%	Accepted at low price	21%	Total applied for	$40,252,080	Accepted	$13,814,890	N.Y. applied for	$37,863,835	N.Y. accepted	$13,142,890	Noncompetitive	$582,755

HEADLINE: Police Charge 2 Janitors With Gun Sales in School

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
Two school janitors were charged yesterday with running a gun-selling operation for at least a year out of two Brooklyn public schools, one across the street from a police station house, the police said.
The janitors and two other people operated the ring mostly at night from Prospect Heights High School in Prospect Heights and Intermediate School 61 in Crown Heights but were not believed to have sold any guns to students, the police said. Instead, the four used the schools as a base, with the sales, mainly to drug dealers, occurring elsewhere, said Lieut. Kenneth McCann, the commanding officer of the Police Department's joint task force with the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
 "We have nothing to substantiate that they sold these guns to students," said Lieutenant McCann, who added that the task force had worked closely with the Board of Education to evaluate whether children were involved. They "were using the schools as a location to sell the guns or meet prospective customers."
 
An Anonymous Tip
 The police received an anonymous tip about the operation last June, the lieutenant said. Several undercover officers then worked to infiltrate the network, ultimately buying 15 semiautomatic weapons from the ring in 10 separate purchases between March 10 and yesterday, Lieutenant McCann said.
The four, who were arrested by the police yesterday afternoon, were Joseph Stiff, 35 years old, a custodial assistant at Prospect Heights High School; Travis Walker, 24, a part-time custodial assistant at I.S. 61; Sophie Sealy, 24, who was described as Mr. Walker's girlfriend, and Orlando Pourchiau, 29, who was described as an unemployed friend of the other three.
All four were charged with criminal sales of firearms and criminal possession of a firearm, said a police spokeswoman, Sgt. Edelle James. Mr. Stiff and Mr. Walker were mainly involved in arranging the purchases, while Mr. Pourchiau was primarily a supplier, the police said.
Ms. Sealy's role was believed limited to a sale that she and Mr. Walker made yesterday, with their 6-month-old baby in tow, to an undercover officer outside a White Castle restaurant in Brooklyn, Lieutenant McCann said.
Although it had not been determined yesterday how long the ring had been in operation, Lieutenant McCann said, it existed undetected for a time because Mr. Stiff and Mr. Walker worked at night, when the schools are deserted. The lieutenant also said the police could not estimate how many guns the ring had sold.
Ed Stancik, the special commissioner of investigation for the public schools, attributed the existence of the gun ring in part to the custodial system, which he said is largely out of the control of the Board of Education. For years, the Board has been campaigning to change the system. Currently the head custodians work for the board, but they hire their cleaners, boiler-room workers and repair personnel without any assessment by board officials.
Mr. Stancik said there was no evidence that the head custodians at the schools were aware that their assistants were selling guns.
Several students playing basketball last night outside the high school said they were surprised to hear that one of their janitors had been arrested. "Janitors are the quiet ones," said Tyrone Johnson, 15. "You never hear anything funny about them."
 
Difficult to Trace
 The 15 guns that the police bought, at a total cost of $7,800, had their serial numbers removed, making them difficult to trace, Lieutenant McCann said.
Of the 10 purchases made by the undercover officers, one took place inside a first-floor office of the high school, at 883 Classon Avenue, another was in front of the intermediate school and the rest were at the corner of East 92d Street and Rutland Road in Brownsville, which the lieutenant described as busy with drug dealers.
The intermediate school, at the corner of East New York Avenue and Empire Boulevard, is across the street from the 71st Precinct house.
"I was surprised they would sell guns so close to a police station," Lieutenant McCann said.

HEADLINE: Empire in Trouble;
3 Named to Administer Olympia London Project

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, May 28

 BODY:
A British bankruptcy court today appointed three administrators to take charge of the vast Canary Wharf office development here, marking the first time that the financially crippled Olympia & York Developments Ltd. has lost control of part of its global real estate empire.
On Wednesday night, Olympia sought bankruptcy protection from Canary Wharf's creditors, after 11 banks with about 550 million, or $992.2 million, in loans to the project, refused to provide new funds to keep construction going beyond the end of this month. 
 At a news conference today, Michael Dennis, an Olympia executive who was until today Canary Wharf's chief executive, and Robert S. Miller Jr., a financial adviser to Olympia, conceded that the bankruptcy was a grim development for Olympia as a whole, as well as for Canary Wharf, which is less than half finished.
The bankruptcy greatly reduces Olympia's chances of being able to persuade its 100 or so banks to accept its plan for emerging from its financial crisis with most of its core real estate operations in North America and Canada, they said. "This is a serious setback for the overall debt restructuring negotiations," Mr. Miller said.
Olympia asked banks to provide easier payment terms for about $12 billion of its debts and new funds in return for nonvoting equity stakes of up to 20 percent in the parent company and 30 percent in Canary Wharf.
But the 11 banks rejected the idea of taking a stake in Canary Wharf, so Mr. Miller and Mr. Dennis said Olympia was now trying to find investors to inject equity capital into the development. They said they had held preliminary talks with some potential investors whom they did not identify, but indicated there were not yet any bites.
They said they hoped that rather than being deterred by the severely depressed state of the London real estate market, investors would see it as an opportunity to buy a stake in Canary Wharf at a bargain price.
Some bankers today were dubious about Olympia's prospects for finding such investors. "If you had 500 million to spend, where would you spend it?" one said sardonically.
Mr. Dennis and Mr. Miller conceded that the fate of Canary Wharf, Europe's largest office-development project, was now in the hands of the administrators -- Stephen Adamson, Nigel Hamilton and Alan Bloom, who are partners in Ernst & Young, the accounting firm.
"We will work with them to see if the company can be reorganized and brought back to life," said Mr. Dennis, whose drawn face showed the strain of what for him had to be a personal defeat. He repeatedly said he still believed Canary Wharf could become London's third major business district, after the West End and the City.
But he added, "We don't know ultimately who the owners will be."
Under British law, administrators run a bankrupt company and submit to the court the plan that decides the company's ultimate fate. Creditors typically wield much more influence with the administrators than the company's directors and executives.
In contrast, the directors and executives of an American company that has sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code typically remain in control and draw up a reorganization proposal.
 
Reviewing the Options
 The administrators, who were appointed only at 9:30 A.M., were predictably noncommittal about what might happen to Canary Wharf or Olympia's other holdings in London. "Our job at the moment is to review all the options," Mr. Adamson said. The administrators said these included selling some or all of the properties or, if investors could be found, bringing the development out of bankruptcy intact.
The administrators have three months to propose a plan to creditors. But they will have to decide soon whether to ask the banks to provide more funds so construction can continue beyond this month so that the buildings can be finished and tenants can move in. Construction slowed to a crawl today, Mr. Dennis said.
Canary Wharf now consists of about 4.6 million square feet of commercial space -- the vast majority of which is completed or in an advanced stage. Tenants occupy or have signed leases for about 57 percent of the completed space, the administrators said.
Olympia also owns or holds leases for an estimated 500,000 to a million square feet of London office space, which it took over from companies to entice them to relocate to Canary Wharf. If the administrators tried to dump this space quickly, it could put pressure on London's already badly depressed real estate market, analysts said.
Bankers said Wednesday night and today that the 11 banks had unanimously agreed to recommend that the company file for bankruptcy administration because it would give it a better chance to survive as a going concern.
One banker who insisted on anonymity stressed that "it's not the end of the line" for Canary Wharf.
Banks have every reason to try to avoid a liquidation. With London property prices severely depressed and Canary Wharf unfinished, they would undoubtedly suffer large losses on their loans if the 71-acre development were liquidated piecemeal. The administrators said the development, if liquidated, could also lose valuable tax benefits.
Mr. Hamilton said that "high on the agenda" was a talk with British Government officials about the possibility of their choosing Canary Wharf as offices for more than 2,000 civil servants. The Government is looking for up to 500,000 square feet of office space.
Canary Wharf was the flagship in an ambitious initiative to rejuvenate the derelict docks in East London that was championed by Margaret Thatcher, when she was Prime Minister.
But the current Conservative Government led by Mrs. Thatcher's handpicked successor, John Major, repeated today that it would not bail out Canary Wharf by agreeing to above-market rates or by bearing the entire 1.7 billion ($3.07 billion) cost of a planned subway line through Canary Wharf. Olympia had pledged to contribute 400 million, or $721.6 million. "There's no change at all in the Government position," a spokesman for Mr. Major said today.
Canary Wharf also faces the grim possibility that companies that have signed contracts but have not yet moved in will now change their minds. These include American Express, Texaco, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, Lehman Brothers International and Credit Suisse First Boston.
Apparently, many have clauses in their contracts that could give them ways out. The American Express Company, which is scheduled to move into 300,000 square feet at Canary Wharf between July and September, had reportedly threatened to move to another site if the project went into administration. Interviewed today, Jeanne Segal, an American Express spokeswoman, would say only: "The bankruptcy filing has created uncertainty. The implications are unclear. We are continuing to monitor the situation closely."
New details emerged today about the events that led the banks to force Canary Wharf into bankruptcy. Olympia had told the 11 banks the project would need 300 million ($540 million) to see it through the next five years or so.
But the banks brought in their own adviser, who told them that under the worst-case scenario, the project would need much more -- Mr. Miller said 500 million, or $902 million, but a banker said it was closer to 600 million, or $1.08 billion.
Two British banks, Barclays and Lloyds, and four Canadian banks, Canadian Imperial, the Bank of Commerce, the Royal Bank of Canada and the Bank of Nova Scotia, voted against providing more money. Others, including Citibank, Credit Suisse of Switzerland and Credit Lyonnais of France, wanted to provide more. At an impasse, the banks unanimously agreed to recommend that Canary Wharf be put into bankruptcy administration.

HEADLINE: Tax Quixote Shakes Town Hall

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST HAMPTON, L.I.

 BODY:
It was with an unmistakable air of satisfaction that George Hammer Jr., the son of a Manhattan real-estate appraiser and grandson of a Bronx developer, plunked a cardboard box with 97 property-tax complaints on the counter in the town assessor's office and demanded to be heard.
For three years, until an appellate court ruling last month, Mr. Hammer, a realtor and owner of a Montauk hotel, had been something of a nonperson in East Hampton, ignored by officials as he battled for justice for overtaxed homeowners -- and a 50 percent contingency fee. 
 A blustery gray-haired 60-year-old who favors a green blazer over a business suit, Mr. Hammer had gone into business as a tax-reduction consultant, a member of a new recession-driven profession that is riding a wave of populist rebellion against rising local property-tax bills.
To the consternation of local assessors, mayors, supervisors and council members, an increasing number of tax consultants like Mr. Hammer have filed tens of thousands of property-tax grievances, winning tax cuts and exposing flaws in an often inequitable tax system.
 
Words Ignored, Appeals Denied
 But when Mr. Hammer appeared before the town on behalf of his clients, his words were ignored and his appeals denied. When he challenged the rulings in Small Claims Court and won -- an average of a $1,000 tax refund per house, he says -- the town refused to pay.
"Maybe the town was a litle too zealous in defending itself," said Tony Bullock, the East Hampton Town Supervisor, after a town lawsuit challenging Mr. Hammer's right to appear at hearings was thrown out by the State Appellate Division last month.
"But the town board didn't go after George Hammer; George Hammer went after us." Mr. Bullock said. "Mr. Hammer did not make our job any easier by coming in and dropping this huge load of tax appeals on us."
Now, after East Hampton spent more than $30,000 fighting against Mr. Hammer's right to do business, the town has given up and joined other governments in recognizing the right of consultants -- disparaged in Town Hall as "mass filers" -- to represent clients, even though the consultants are not lawyers.
Soaring property taxes have ignited a powerful anti-tax movement on Long Island and across New York State. Property taxes are going up at the rate of $1 billion a year, and now exceed $20 billion annually, according to the State Division of Equalization and Assessment.
 
Taxes Increasingly Unfair
 At the same time, the property-tax system -- taxes, in theory, are based on the value of property -- has grown increasingly unfair in many places, as identical houses with identical market values have vastly different tax burdens.
While other states, like Connecticut, mandate a reassessment every 10 years, New York State does not, and some towns like East Hampton have not reassessed older properties for a generation.
So newer properties, especially those built during the real-estate boom in the 1980's, have higher taxes than older ones. And older properties that were sold and then reassessed (a practice known as "Welcome, stranger," barred by the United States Supreme Court in 1989) have higher taxes than unsold ones.
Enter the tax-reduction consultants, usually appraisers like Mr. Hammer or computer experts, like Paul Henry of Greenport on the north fork of Long Island, who for a percentage of the first year's tax savings help homeowners work their way through complicated tax appeals. Mr. Hammer requires a $100 initial payment, Mr. Henry $45.
The emergence of tax consultants who are not lawyers and who solicit business from regular homeowners is new. It follows a change made by the Legislature in 1983 to simplify tax appeals by homeowners, through informal hearings in Small Claims Court for a $25 filing fee. At first nearly all these complaints were filed by individual homeowners.
But beginning in the late 1980's, a few consultants began helping homeowners out. Now there are dozens scattered across the metropolitan area, and even seminars intended to teach people how to set up their own consulting businesses.
 
Huge Backlog of Appeals
 Suddenly these consultants began to make up an increasing share of all tax appeals, contributing to a huge backlog of appeals filed through Small Claims Court, especially when the court system ran out of money ($75 per case) to pay hearing officers.
In Nassau County more than 35,000 tax protests were filed this year, an increase from 28,000 the year before, and 20,000 in 1990, according to Abe Seldin, the chairman of the County Board of Assessors.
"I would say that the majority of these came from these filers," he said. "There are quite a number of them and many new ones and a great deal of solicitation. A number of them are using fear tactics on the public."
For Mr. Hammer, the tax-appeal business was more than something to do during the slow season at his 70-room hotel, the Shepherd's Neck Inn in Montauk. It was in his blood.
His grandfather developed apartments and private homes in and around Pelham Parkway in the Bronx in the 1920's and 1930's. His father, George Hammer Sr., was an appraiser of commercial real estate in Manhattan, and eventually specialized in tax reduction cases.
"My first exposure to tax reduction was when I was 12 years old, working on files in my father's office," Mr. Hammer said. "He eventually appraised all the most notable buildings in Manhattan."
After Mr. Hammer's father died in 1955, he moved out to Montauk to run the family-owned hotel, and continued to dabble in real estate and appraisal work. After working briefly as a Small Claims Court hearing officer in 1988, he got the idea of going into business for himself, and righting some wrongs in the process.
"The tax system is unfair, and they have made an effort to be unfair, to maintain the unfairness and the inequity," he said.
In a typical tax appeal, Mr. Hammer compiles data on recent sales showing that the house was assessed at a higher value than other homes of comparable size and location.
But East Hampton did not make it easy. It went to court, and accused him of practicing law without a license. Several similar suits were filed against other consultants by the City of White Plains.
Not only did the East Hampton suit challenge his right to appear in Small Claims Court, it challeged the validity of all the court decisions awarding refunds on behalf of his clients.
When he appeared in Small Claims Court, the town sent its real-estate lawyer, Roger Ramme, at a cost of about $150 an hour to sit in on each case. And when he appeared before the town's tax review board, the Board of Assessment Review, it informed him that it would simply ignore what he had to say.
"He was told he could talk all he wanted; the board didn't look at his oral argument as being credible," said Jeanne Nielsen, chief assessor.
Town officials saw him as someone abusing the system for personal gain, a system that had provoked few complaints over the years and produced revenue to keep the town in business.
"We are a small town," said Mr. Bullock, the Supervisor. "People can come down here and talk to the assessors that they elected, and the assessors have been very responsive, accessible and fair."
But Mr. Hammer wryly observed that he had appeared on behalf of a dozen property owners who happened to be lawyers, including one who was an appellate judge, and that none had objected to his lay status. In April the court threw out the lawsuits in both East Hampton and White Plains. Dozens of clients who won appeals are now due refunds, with 12 percent interest, according to Mr. Hammer.
 
Pressure on Local Officials
 Mr. Hammer and Mr. Henry, who got into the tax consulting business after he filed an appeal on his own home, say their efforts will eventually lead to a fairer tax system.
By providing relief to more and more individual taxpayers, they put pressure on local governments to undertake the politically perilous path of updating assessment rolls.
In East Hampton, where even Ms. Nielsen, a neighbor and family friend of Mr. Hammer, acknowledged that fully a third of all taxpayers were paying significantly too much taxes, the town board has consistently sidestepped the reassessment question.
"The history books tell us that when reassessment occurs, elected officials lose their jobs," Mr. Henry said.
So last week, Mr. Hammer nervously made his first appearance before the Assessment Review Board at a tiny meeting room in the town office complex. A hand-lettered sign on the door warned homeowners: "Plan to spend the day."
"It has been a costly and unneeded battle you have waged against your own citizenry," Mr. Hammer said in a written statement he submitted to the board, before agreeing to adjourn most of the cases for later hearings. "And I am glad, for the taxpayers, that it is finally over and that we can get on with business."
Jerry Katz, a developer, was glad, too. He had come to the hearing to complain that a house in East Hampton he had been unable to sell at a loss for $190,000 was assessed as if it were worth more than $370,000. He hired Mr. Hammer on the spot. The taxes are $5,600, he said.
"This is not a real-estate recession; it is a depression," he said. When a buyer who had offered $190,000 backed out, he cited the high taxes on the property, Mr. Katz said.
Jeannette Molloy and Ed Butler came to appeal the $4,500 in taxes in the house they built a few years back for $109,000 in Springs. It was assessed as if it were worth about $300,000.
It took them a while to realize they were overassessed, they said. "If we had come from Oklahoma we would have thought that $4,000 in taxes was ridiculous," said Ms. Molloy. "But we came from Huntington and taxes there were high too."
What if the board denies their appeal, they were asked. "Maybe we will go with Hammer," Ms. Molloy said.

HEADLINE: Applications For Jobless Claims Fall

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing initial claims for unemployment benefits fell to a seven-month low in mid-May, the Government said today in a report that suggests the labor market is regaining vigor.
First-time claims fell to 403,000 in the week ended May 16 from 407,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said. 
 The four-week average for initial claims, considered a more accurate barometer of job trends, also continued its gradual decline of recent weeks. It fell to 412,500 from 412,750 in the previous four weeks.
The figures were better than had been expected by Wall Street economists, who had predicted a rise to 408,000 claims. It was the lowest level since the week of Oct. 5, when claims reached 401,000.
"The worst of the job layoffs is behind us, and we should have some pickup in hiring in the second half of the year," said Lynn Reaser, senior vice president at the First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles.
The steady improvement in claims data bodes well for the May employment report, due on June 5, said Nicholas Perna, chief economist at the Shawmut National Corporation. Mr. Perna predicted that about 126,000 new jobs were added to the economy this month, the same as in April. The April unemployment rate was 7.2 percent, down from 7.3 percent in March.
The drop in new claims for unemployment insurance benefits was widespread, with 36 jurisdictions reporting declines and only 17 reporting increases, the Labor Department said.
California saw the strongest improvement, with a 4,992 decline in new claims from the previous week, partly because of a pickup in agricultural hiring. After California came Ohio, with 4,563 fewer claims, and New York, with 3,010 fewer claims.
The states reporting the largest gains were Missouri, 1,505; North Carolina, 1,364, and Virginia, 1,256.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 27.99 to Hit 3,398.43 Peak

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A late rally in the stock market lifted the Dow Jones industrial average to a new closing high yesterday as investors focused their attention on falling interest rates.
The Dow rose 27.99 points to close at 3,398.43, just managing to surpass the previous 3,397.99 record set on May 19. 
 Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones, 999 to 683, on the New York Stock Exchange, where the composite rose 2.09, to 229.24.
Volume on the Big Board totaled 195.3 million shares, versus 182.2 million on Wednesday.
 
Broader Market Up
 Broader gauges were also higher. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 4.57, to 416.74, while the American Stock Exchange's composite index gained 0.45 point, to 392.30. In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index finished 3.14 higher at 580.49.
Interest rates declined in the credit markets yesterday, extending their drop. Yields on long-term Treasury bonds fell to 7.85 percent from 7.89 percent late yesterday.
Analysts said investors were still recovering from an inflation scare touched off earlier in the week by a report that Saudi Arabia was seeking to encourage a rise in oil prices.
Meanwhile, the economic news offered some new encouragement for recovery hopes on Wall Street.
The Labor Department reported that initial claims for state unemployment insurance dropped by 4,000 in the week that ended on May 16, in contrast to analysts' estimates of a small increase.
 
Little Enthusiasm Seen
 But with all the positives, traders said the Dow's new high yesterday failed to produce some important signs of broad enthusiasm among investors. For example, just 51 of the 2,000 or so issues listed on the Big Board set individual new highs for at least the last 52 weeks.
In addition, yesterday was a rocky day for investors in telephone and airline stocks.
Centel tumbled 10 1/2, to 32, and Sprint fell 1 3/8, to 23 1/8, as the Big Board's two most active issues. On Wednesday, Sprint agreed to acquire Centel in a stock exchange that values Centel shares at well below their recent market price.
Centel's volume totaled 6.4 million shares, while 5.2 million Sprint shares changed hands.
The Centel-Sprint news depressed the stocks of other cellular-telephone issues, including McCaw Cellular, down 1 1/2 at 27 1/2, and Vanguard Cellular, down 2 3/4 at 25 1/4, both of which were among the volume leaders in over-the-counter trading.
 
AMR Falls $2
 AMR, which was also heavily traded, dropped 2, to 61 5/8, following a fare cut on Wednesday by the company's American Airlines subsidiary that appeared to intensify a price war among passenger carriers.
Other airline issues fell yesterday, as recent worries of rising fuel prices have put pressure on the sector. UAL, which owns United Airlines, dropped 4, to 113 3/4; Delta Air Lines was off 3/4, to 57 7/8; USAir Group fell 3/4, to 12 1/8, and British Air's American depository receipts were down 1/2, to 52 7/8.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar and Gold Decline In a Day of Listless Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended lower against most currencies yesterday in trading thinned by a holiday in Europe.
Gold prices also fell. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $337 a troy ounce, off $1.20 from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank said gold had slipped 65 cents an ounce, to $336.90. 
 The dollar traded in narrow ranges.
Markets in much of Europe were closed for Ascension Day, and analysts said they expect many dealers to be absent today as well. Interest in the dollar was slight, traders said.
In addition, there was not much news to move the market, said Kevin Logan, chief economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation. New unemployment figures indicating a small drop in first-time claims were taken as a positive but not significant sign, he said.
The Labor Department said initial jobless claims had declined by 4,000, to 403,000, during the week that ended on May 16. "The data didn't lead anyone to change their views on what's going on in the economy," Mr. Logan said.
But the weekly United States money supply figures, released after the New York close yesterday, may move markets in Asia, said Kevin Lawrie, the Bank of Boston's director of foreign exchange.
The data showed that M-2 growth had contracted by $7.4 billion in the week that ended on May 18 -- higher than the $4.5 billion economists expected. The data could push the Federal Reserve to make more money available and ease interest rates, traders said. Speculation about the Fed's monetary policy has driven the dollar lower in recent weeks.
In Tokyo the dollar rose to 129.92 Japanese yen, from 129.78 yen late Wednesday. Later, in London, it fell to 129.60 yen. In New York the dollar closed at 129.50 yen, down from 130.20 late Wednesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8060, from $1.8010 late Wednesday. In New York the pound finished at $1.8050, up from $1.7950 Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
An Anti-Plonker Bids a Farewell

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
STEPHEN POTTER, creator of "Gamesmanship," the art of being one-up on competitors, called economics "the plonking science." And what is plonking? Mr. Potter instructed those who would learn to plonk in this way: "If you have nothing to say, or, rather something stupid and obvious, say it, but in a 'plonking' tone of voice -- i.e., roundly, but hollowly and dogmatically."
As an economic journalist, I have sought to rid economics of its plonking tone, and, more important, to demonstrate that behind the tone, economics has nonstupid and nonobvious things to say. 
 For instance, there is Slutsky's Proposition, maintaining that the moving average of a random series of numbers oscillates through time; or Keynes's Paradox of Thrift, postulating that an individual can save more by spending less but an entire society may wind up saving less if it cuts spending; or Pareto-optimality, the concept of an ideal economic state at which nobody can be made better off without making somebody else worse off.
These concepts and doctrines are relevant to such issues as how to get the economy to expand more vigorously and how to solve America's social ills. But none is an eternal verity; each is a tool, useful if applied appropriately to an economy in a particular state and to serve a particular objective, and destructive if misapplied.
A government or central bank can be led into a policy of do-nothing if Slutsky's Proposition is interpreted to mean that randomness is all and any deliberate effort to stabilize the economy will destabilize it further. Keynes's paradox of thrift may be useful for helping to cure unemployment but not inflation or stagflation; it offers short-term stimulus but may worsen debt, reduce savings and investment, and curb long-term growth. Pareto-optimality may be employed to support a right-wing social policy by implying that an effort to help the poor will worsen the state of society, if it makes the rich worse off, even temporarily.
The relative simplicities of economics are essential as a means of making sense of an incredibly complex world. The danger comes when economists fall in love with particular abstractions and confer upon them a kind of Platonic truth, as though they were more real than reality itself. From that conceit, it is a short jump to the kind of dogmatism and plonking against which Stephen Potter inveighed. One serious problem is that the dogmatic plonkers do not agree on their dogmas, and the profession of economics becomes a mud-slinging match against rivals.
The real world that we inhabit and try to understand and, if possible, improve is one of people, smart and dumb, ambitious and lazy, good and bad and in between, and institutions, rigid and flexible, free and enslaving, decadent and progressive, as well as the natural environment. Economics cannot restrict itself to studying a very limited domain, to which it assertedly holds a magic key.
As an economic journalist, I felt that what I had to explain was not eternity but particular events, developments, stories or, to be fancier, history. This meant trying to understand Presidents, Treasury secretaries, Federal Reserve chairmen, and other decision makers or evaders.
And it meant dealing with the question of whether those "heroes," to use Thomas Carlyle's term, mattered all that much or whether institutions -- the White House, the political party and its ideology, the Fed and its traditions, including an addiction to secrecy, the Pentagon and its own obsession with secrecy (an instrument everywhere of power and autonomy), the corporation, the media, the courts, the laws of the land, property rights, civil rights, etc. -- were the real shapers of history, including economic history.
Soviet Communism was brought down by its institutions, and the inefficiency and corruption and inhumanity they bred into the system -- and into its leaders, secret police and bureaucrats. And the most difficult job of the transition to a market economy is building new institutions.
I see economics as a branch of philosophy -- moral philosophy, as it was called in the days of Adam Smith. Its mission was and still is to improve the lot of humanity, especially for the poor.
It has been a privilege to pursue this career on the staff of a great newspaper dedicated to truth in all its complexity. It is never easy to be sure one has gotten the whole truth, and there are many sides to an important question. Nevertheless, my conviction is that there always is such a thing as the truth and one must pursue it with all one's heart and mind -- and with the deepest respect for the facts. And, if possible, with humility and a sense of humor.
I have been fortunate to have had, these many years, the sensitive help of the artist Nicolae Asciu, who always knew what I was trying to say, and said it shorter. I have also had the benefit of voluminous letters from people who liked what I had written and people who hated it. To friends and foes alike, I bid an appreciative farewell.

New Home for 'Guernica'
The board of directors of the Prado in Madrid voted last week to allow Pablo Picasso's "Guernica," now displayed within a huge bulletproof case in an annex of the museum, to move several blocks away to the Reina Sofia Art Center, Spain's national museum of contemporary art. The Reina Sofia is also getting other works from the Prado, including Picasso's drawings for "Guernica," several Cubist works by both Picasso and Juan Gris (the bequest of the collector Douglas Cooper) and two Joan Miro paintings from the artist's family.
"It's a reorganization of the collection," said Maria de Corral, the director of the Reina Sofia. "As the national museum of contemporary art, we are getting 20th-century works from the Prado, and in exchange the Prado will be getting some 19th-century art from us." 
 The "Guernica" announcement did not come as a surprise in Spanish art circles, since the plan has been under discussion for more than four years. Still, the final move caused somewhat of an uproar among critics who contend that the 1937 work, about the bombing of the ancient Basque town of Guernica by German planes, should remain in the Prado. Moving it, they say, betrays Picasso's wishes that it be displayed there permanently. Picasso specified that the painting, which had been on loan for decades to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, should go to Spain once Generalissimo Francisco Franco left power and democracy was established in the country.
When "Guernica" arrived at the Prado in 1981, in time for the centennial celebration of Picasso's birth, it was placed behind bulletproof glass because the Spanish Government feared that the painting, a symbol of anti-fascism and a rallying cry for Spanish republicans, might be vandalized. In 1974, while displayed at the Museum of Modern Art, the painting was splashed with red paint as a political protest by an Iranian artist, Tony Shafrazi, who is now an art dealer in New York City. The work was subsequently restored. There have been no further attacks.
"It's a key work," said Mrs. de Corral. "And it belongs in the Reina Sofia. The painting is owned by the Spanish Government and was bought by the Republic."
When it arrives at the Reina Sofia next month, it will be displayed in a room by itself, again behind a wall of bulletproof glass. "But in a simpler way than it was at the Prado," said Mrs. de Corral. "It will be less isolated than it has been." Plans to reorganize the Reina Sofia's collection include displaying works chronologically and by movements. "Guernica," while in a room by itself, will be shown along with its preparatory sketches and drawings, as it was in the Prado, but it will not be as isolated.
Although no exact date has been set, Mrs. Corral said the work should be on display in about six weeks.
 
Sotheby's Cellar
 The one-stop shopping-center mentality that the chairman of Sotheby's, Alfred Taubman, introduced in New York 10 years ago is being copied in the company's London headquarters. Sotheby's 72d Street galleries offer customers pricey artworks upstairs and lower-end items in what they call the Arcade, or basement. This week Sotheby's, London has opened an Arcade of its own. With the art market even shakier in London than it is in New York, Sotheby's move is an attempt to broaden its client base by offering a greater variety of art and objects under one roof.
In New York, Arcade items range in price from about $500 to $2,000. London's Arcade, which is in a new gallery on the main floor of its sprawling Bond Street building, has priced its offerings from $700 to about $2,100. The first sale, Oriental Works of Art from the Neolithic Period Onward, took place Wednesday and yesterday.
The sale did far worse than Sotheby's expected. The total for the two days was $524,000, well under its low estimate of $919,000. "It didn't dishearten us at all," said Roger Faxon, managing director of Sotheby's, Europe. "We had only modest expectations for the sale. In the future we plan to do more aggressive marketing."
"Certainly it's true that a healthy part of our business has been with goods under 1,500 pounds," said Mr. Faxon. (In dollars, the figure is about $2,550.) Previously, Sotheby's held auctions of cheaper items in two country house sales rooms, one in Sussex and another in Chester. Eighteen months ago it closed its Chester branch. Sussex will stay open, however, offering general sales of items like the contents of country houses as well as garden statuary, sporting guns, and oak and country furniture.
"The Arcade sales in London will be scheduled in close proximity to the major sales in the same area," said Mr. Faxon. "We conducted a survey of what kind of service our clients wanted, and this is what came out of it."
 
Arts Magazine at the Brink
 Like most other publications, art magazines are having trouble getting advertising these days, but if help doesn't come fast, it looks as though Arts Magazine will be another victim of the recession. A little more than a year ago, Contemporanea failed. Artscribe, the British magazine, closed this year. Now, Arts Magazine, a 66-year-old New York publication that covers the contemporary art scene and has a circulation of 16,000, has not been able to afford to print its May issue. (It had problems getting out in April, too. It made it to the newsstands, but subscribers are only receiving copies this week.)
"Our pockets aren't as deep as the other guys'," said Paul Shanley, the magazine's publisher. "But we intend to keep the magazine going. We are in the middle of negotiations with a potential buyer." Mr. Shanley declined to discuss who the buyer was or how realistic the offer seems. He did say he was hoping to have news of a deal next week.

HEADLINE: Cultural Groups Plead With City For More Funds

 BODY:
In an effort to have the $19.7 million recently cut from New York city's culture budget restored, representatives of the 31 cultural institutions that occupy city-owned buildings presented a slide show to members of the City Council yesterday.
The presentation included a "Recovery Plan" that showed how the money would be used by cultural groups if the city's financial support were restored to the 1991 level. 
 For example, library hours and programs for children and teen-age mothers would be resumed at the Brooklyn Children's Museum; the fire and safety system at the Studio Museum in Harlem would be repaired and brought into compliance with city codes, and the American Museum of Natural History would rehire 25 "vitally needed" guards and maintenance people.
"With this support, we can insure that New York's cultural institutions will continue to stimulate the city's economic revival and to educate and enlighten its citizens," said Harvey Lichtenstein, chairman of the Cultural Institutions Group and president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
The City Council is scheduled to vote on the 1993 budget next month.

Folk Tunes That Address Real Folks

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
"I really feel that working people are at a disadvantage when it comes to surviving in this world," the folk singer and songwriter Hazel Dickens declared recently. "The big corporations have just taken over, and there's not much room now for the little person. The last two Administrations have really been tough on the working class."
Ms. Dickens, who was speaking by telephone from her home in Washington, has been writing and singing songs about the lives of working people for more than 40 years. Tonight she is appearing at Weill Recital Hall in the second concert of the second annual Carnegie Hall Folk Festival, which continues through June 12. Joining her in an evening titled "Workin' in a Coal Mine" will be the Rabbit Ridge Pea Pickers and Nomonde Ngubo, all of them, like Ms. Dickens, with bitter experience of the hardships of the coal-mining life. 
 Ms. Dickens, who was born in Mercer County in West Virginia, is one of the 11 children of a Baptist preacher who hauled timber for the mines. A song she expects to perform is "The Mannington Mine Disaster," which tells the true story of a mine explosion that left 78 miners sealed in the earth. Another, "Black Lung," she wrote for her oldest brother, who contracted the ailment from breathing coal dust. She has lost three brothers to the disease.
The Rabbit Ridge Pea Pickers -- a quintet composed of three brothers, Billy Rhea (on fiddle), Burl Rhea (on banjo) and Denver Rhea (on mandolin), a nephew, Gary Bailey (on guitar), and a friend, Lonnie Hobson (on bass) -- are all coal miners from Russell County in Virginia. They have been performing together since 1970. Four years ago, they changed their name from the Buffalo Mountain Boys after entertaining their fellow workers on a picket line for the United Mine Workers in Rabbit Ridge, Va.
 
Teaching With Song
 And Ms. Ngubo, the third act on the bill, is a union organizer from South Africa who was associated with the Federation of Black Trade Unions and the National Union of Mine Workers in her homeland. In 1983, she moved to the United States and spent two years studying industrial relations. Six years ago, she worked with the United Mine Workers during a boycott of the Shell Oil Company. In 1991 she joined the Institute of Policy Studies, a research group in Washington. She lectures at leadership training programs in high schools, colleges and churches, using songs to teach people.
Ms. Dickens, who is the host of this evening's show, left West Virginia at 16 to follow her older sister to Baltimore, where she took jobs in factories and worked as a waitress and sales clerk, all the while remaining connected with union work. Through one of her brothers, she met the folk singer Mike Seeger, who introduced her to Alice Gerard, a college-educated singer with a passion for bluegrass music. The two became a vocal duo and developed a repertory by studying sheet music in the Library of Congress and by attending folk festivals and taping the performances of old-time musicians.
In 1965, they recorded the first of four albums together and gained a feminist following performing such original Dickens songs as "Working Girl Blues." The duo recorded three albums for Rounder Records, after which Ms. Dickens went solo. Rounder has put out five solo albums by Ms. Dickens, whose hard Appalachian twang is driven by a fierce sense of commitment to friends and causes.
The turning point in her career, Ms. Dickens said, was Barbara Koppel's acclaimed 1974 documentary of the coal-mining struggle, "Harlan County U.S.A," on whose soundtrack she sang four songs. One number from the film, "They'll Never Keep Us Down," was later used by the United Mine Workers as the title song for a video on organizing. In 1987, she appeared as well as sang in John Sayles's film "Matewan."
 
The Music Won
 It wasn't until 1979 that Ms. Dickens decided to make music a full-time career.
"I decided if I was going to starve, I was going to starve doing something I liked," she said. "I had been promoted to being the manager of a small retail store, but it seemed like I never had a day off to myself. I decided I had to do one or the other, and the music won out. It was the best decision I ever made, because although I don't make much money, I can at least go visit people when I want to."
"I still write whenever the urge hits me," she continued. "I'm a homemade-type personality who doesn't do anything on schedule. Right now I'm trying to write a song about the way the economy is and unemployment running so high among workers. What bothers me is the way that people who have spent their entire lives working in factories, mills and mines are getting laid off without any benefits."
This evening's show is at 8 o'clock. Tickets are $20 and are on sale at the Carnegie Hall box office or through Carnegie Charge, (212) 247-7800.

HEADLINE: Portrait of America;
3 States That Set a Pace For the 'Average' America

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In the nation's self-portrait by numbers, New Jersey, Connecticut and in particular New York State can be found largely where they are on any map: at the edge.
The statistical average American would be a stranger in New York, though the person generally would find its neighboring states more like home. But by many economic measurements in the 1990 census, all three states rank near one end of the spectrum or the other compared with the remaining 47 and the District of Columbia. 
 Connecticut can claim the nation's highest household median income, the highest percentage of people who make more than $150,000 a year and the second-lowest poverty rate.
New York often defies its national stereotype when measured as a state, rather than being defined just by its largest city. But it is distinguished by smaller percentages of homes or apartments that are owned by their occupants, of households that include married couples, of people who drive to work alone, and by more than four times the national average of people who commute to work on public transportation. New Yorkers also take longer to get to work.
 
Biggest Not Always First
 But even New York City itself ranks behind other major cities in several categories that signal economic and social distress. New York is fifth in the percentage of its children living in poverty (with 29.9 percent, behind Detroit, Chicago, San Antonio and Philadelphia); fourth in the percentage of its elderly who are poor (with 16.5 percent, behind Detroit, San Antonio and Houston), and eighth, with 9.6 percent, in the percentage of high school dropouts who are unemployed or not in the labor force.
States were artificial creatures of political map-makers, so statistical comparisons among them can obscure vast disparities within them. New York, for example, contains among the wealthiest (Nassau) and the poorest (the Bronx) counties in the nation. Also, for the most part the statistics do not reflect the impact of the recession, which hit the Northeast most severely since the census was taken two years ago. Nor do the figures include hundreds of thousands of people -- many of them poor, black or Hispanic -- who local officials say went uncounted.
Yet the statewide figures suggest a number of trends, when measured against one another, and against comparable figures from 1980.
"In most characteristics, Connecticut comes up high in education, income and housing valuation, New Jersey is somewhat behind and New York brings up the rear," said Connie O. Hughes, an assistant director for occupational and demographic research in the New Jersey Department of Labor.
 
Positives and Negatives
 New York in particular, said Regina Armstrong, an economic consultant for the Regional Plan Association, "has always been ahead of the rest of the country, either in the positive or the negative."
In all three states, the population is slightly older, more urban and better educated than the national average -- ranking roughly in the middle third in the percentage of high school graduates, but higher among those who received a bachelor's degree.
All three rank near the top in median household income -- Connecticut is first, with $41,721. New Jersey is third, with $40,927 and New York is 11th with $32,965. Per capita income in all three states is about two to three times the national average of $7,290.
New York fared better in another measure of wealth, the percentage of its people who make $150,000 or more. Again, Connecticut is first, with 3.53 percent; New Jersey is third, with 2.95 percent; and New York is fifth, with 2.48 percent.
 
Memorie of a Boom
 Reflecting the booming 1980's, real income in all three states rose by 18 percent or more between 1980 and 1990, as it did in only five other states, all in New England or in the mid-Atlantic region.
New York State was distinguished by greater poverty in the region, but with rates well below nearly half the states.
From 1980 to 1990, poverty rates declined slightly in all three states. New Jersey registered the sixth-largest decrease nationwide, but that was only 1.9 percent. The decline in Connecticut and in New York was even smaller.
Connecticut and New Jersey had the second- and third-lowest poverty rates in 1990 -- 6.8 percent and 7.6 percent, respectively. The rate in New York was about twice that, 13 percent, making it 31st. That was marginally higher than Florida, California and Ohio, but substantially less than the rate in many Southern states.
When the states were ranked by the percentage of families headed by women with small children and living in poverty, New York fared worst in the region, 20th, with 57.2 percent. Connecticut was 11th, with 51.5 percent, and New Jersey was eighth, with 45.9 percent. All three were below the national average, though not by much.
 
Differences Abound
 New York ranked second highest, behind only North Carolina, in the percentage of high school dropouts 16 to 19 years old who are either unemployed or who are otherwise not in the labor force. New Jersey was 11th, with 7.85 percent; Connecticut was 51st, with 2.81 percent.
"This region is different," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "It is different in its industries. It is different in its people. We have a greater concentration in complex and demanding jobs and more of a problem in taking measure to bring new deomgraphic groups into the mainstream.
"Connecticut is very different from New York and New Jersey," Mr. Ehrenhalt said. "And New York, when it comes down to cases, is very different from every place."
Nowhere is the region's changing complexion more visible than in New York State.
"There's no question that New York City and Los Angeles are the two major poles for immigrants to the United States, and no other metropolitan area comes close," said John Mollenkopf, a political science professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center. "That is changing all of our old stereotypes and shibboleths about what race and ethnicity mean."
 
People on the Move
 New York was third highest in the percentage of residents who had been born in the state, 8 in 10, compared to 6 in 10 in both New Jersey and Connecticut. But more than 1 in 20 New Yorkers immigrated from outside the United States during the 1980's. That was about half the number as in California, but enough to place New York second in the percentage of immigrants. New Jersey was fifth, with 1 in 20. Connecticut was 14th with about 1 in 40.
All three states were among the top 10 in the percentage of residents who speak a language other than English at home.
"In New York, there are pockets of extremes and places that mirror national averages," said Robert Scardamalia, chief demographer for the State Department of Economic Development. "In factors heavily weighted by immigrant populations, New York will stand out from national averages."
Both New York and New Jersey have a higher proportion of black residents than the national average, but the disparities among the three states were greatest in the percentage of non-Hispanic whites.
Nationally, they constitute about 80 percent of the population. Non-Hipsanic whites account for 69 percent of the population in New York and 74 percent in New Jersey. In Connecticut, they represent 87 percent.
People who classified themselves as Hispanic accounted for 6.5 percent of Connecticut's population, again, below the national average of 9 percent. In New York, they made up 12.3 percent; in New Jersey, 9.6 percent.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
A Stung Clinton Attacks Bush and Pokes at Perot

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., May 28

 BODY:
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, whose efforts to stage a triumphant final march to the Democratic nomination have been all but drowned out by the attention given to Ross Perot, struck back today with a veiled attack at Mr. Perot and a direct assault on President Bush.
Mr. Clinton, who had planned to travel the country raising money and campaigning in New Jersey and Ohio during the next several days, scrapped that agenda late Wednesday. By this morning the Governor and his strategists, stung by polls showing the campaign continuing to lose ground to Mr. Perot, had decided to use an appearance here in Silicon Valley as a first step toward regaining the spotlight. 
 And a poll published today in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette showed Mr. Clinton and his Democratic rival, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., in a virtual tie going into Tuesday's primary. The poll of 374 likely Democratic voters, which was conducted Friday through Tuesday by Mason-Dixon Political-Media Research Inc., showed Mr. Clinton with 45 percent to 44 percent for Mr. Brown. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.
Mr. Clinton told supporters that the President governs "by a nutty theory of abandonment of responsibility." The latest example, he said, was the speech Mr. Bush delivered in Atlanta on Wednesday in which he cited a new report that showed more American children watch television than read.
The President, Mr. Clinton said, was attempting to shift responsibility "as they always do in Washington."
"I believe people should read more to their kids and watch less television and let them watch less television," he said. "If we had a President who put his money and his actions and his heart and his work where his mouth is, more people would follow his example."
He also accused the White House of cutting money for literacy programs and failing to fully pay for Head Start.
 
Veiled Perot Reference
 Although he did not mention Mr. Perot by name, the intent of his dig was unmistakable. "But there's something else we don't need four more years of either," Mr. Clinton said. "Talk that sounds good with no plan or action to back it up. Anybody can talk about change, but there's one person in this race that's worked 10 years to improve education and to generate jobs in a tough global economy, and to bring people together, one person who's offered a plan instead of just saying things that sound good."
Mr. Clinton's advisers have wavered about how best to handle Mr. Perot and have been frustrated that reporters have spent more time asking about the Texas billionaire than about the President, whom they consider vulnerable.
As Mr. Clinton headed into a string of satellite interviews, appearances on radio talk shows and a taped interview with David Frost on PBS that is scheduled to air Friday night, he clearly hoped that today's remarks would turn attention back to his own top priority: portraying himself as as the best alternative to Mr. Bush. He has also agreed to appear on live television call-in program on CBS Tuesday night. Mr. Perot and the President were also invited, but declined, the network said.
Mr. Clinton acknowledged that he would have to alter his approach to be heard in California. "I have done everything I knew to do in this campaign, and I obviously have to do a better job of piercing through," he said. "Maybe one way of doing that is to be more aggressive."
Mr. Clinton and his campaign officials said he canceled plans for further campaigning in Ohio and New Jersey to avoid more all-night coast-to-coast flights within the next few days.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Undeclared Candidate;
Perot in Wide-Ranging TV Interview

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, May 28

 BODY:
In a television interview, Ross Perot, the likely Presidential candidate, said that he opposed raising taxes to trim the Federal budget deficit, that it would not be "realistic" for homosexuals to be in the armed forces and that he would not appoint homosexuals to top Cabinet-level jobs.
"No, I don't want anybody there that will be a point of controversy with the American people," the Dallas billionaire said during a segment of the ABC-News program, "20/20," which is scheduled to be broadcast Friday night. "It will distract from the work to be done. See, as far as I'm concerned, what people do in their private lives is their business." 
 During much of the interview, conducted by Barbara Walters, Mr. Perot repeated homilies familiar to those who have seen him on programs like the Larry King and Phil Donohue shows. In recent weeks, as the drive to place Mr. Perot's name on the ballot has gathered momentum and public opinion polls have shown him leading or in a dead-heat with President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the likely Democratic nominee, Mr. Perot has been under increased pressure to make his opinions known on critical issues.
A transcript of the interview, which was taped on Monday, was provided by the show.
 
Straightforward Answers
 Although he rarely gave detailed explanations of his views, Mr. Perot provided several straightforward answers to questions without the rancor he often has displayed when pressed on a particular subject.
For example, when he was asked if there should be parental approval for an abortion, he replied: "We're saying a 15-year-old girl? Sure. I think her parents should have a vote in that."
In commenting on last year's Senate Judiciary Committee hearings into allegations that Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed Anita Hill, a law school professor, when the two of them worked at the Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Mr. Perot castigated both the Senate and the nominee.
"I thought it was reprehensible, the way the Senators treated Dr. Hill," he said. "They were willing to destroy her for partisan reasons. And I thought it was a sad day for our country and really damaged the credibility of the Senate with the American people."
Ms. Walters asked Mr. Perot if he were a member of the Senate, would he have voted to confirm Justice Thomas.
"I would vote for a Supreme Court Justice without regard to color," Mr. Perot said of Justice Thomas, who is black. "I'd vote, vote solely based on ability. I have serious questions about his ability."
Would he have voted against him?
"Well, it, I'd say in, in that case, I would have urged the President to come forward with a more capable person," Mr. Perot said.
Asked about his ideas for reducing the Federal deficit, Mr. Perot said he favored a Congressional act to limit Federal spending and promised he would soon deliver proposals to cut waste in the Federal budget.
 
'Getting Rid of Waste'
 "The second thing you've got to do is then just turn the world upside down aggressively, getting rid of the waste," he said after declaring support for legislation to limit spending. "And there is a lot of waste. And in a few weeks I will be able to go down my detailed list of where the waste is so that we can get in very, very specifics."
Mr. Perot added that he wanted to "replace our current tax system with a new tax system," which he said he would develop in consultation with leading members of Congress.
When asked about increasing taxes, however, Mr. Perot said, "I'm absolutely against raising taxes."
In foreign affairs, Mr. Perot repeated his assertion that he would provide financial aid to the former Soviet republics to help them become economically viable. "I think the most cost-effective thing we can do is to help Russia get through the transition successfully," he said.
Mr. Perot, who has had contentious dealings with the State Department when he tried to deliver mail, food and medicine to American prisoners in North Vietnam in 1969 and 1970 and when two of his employees were jailed in the Iranian Revolution in 1979, said he would restructure the department.
 
State Department Shakeup
 "Well, first off, the embassies are relics of days of sailing ships," he said. "At one time, when you had no world communications, your ambassador spoke for you in that country. But now, with instantaneous communication around the world, the ambassador is primarily in a social role."
Seated by Mr. Perot's side during the interview was his wife, Margot, who is rarely seen at public events and has granted few interviews. She told Ms. Walters that as First Lady, she saw herself having a "supporting role."
"I -- really -- I say that because my first priority is the family, and creating a happy home life for Ross," she said.
Mrs. Perot described herself as an "independent" woman who "reads" and has her own opinions. But she said she does not provide any counsel for her husband. "He doesn't need my advice," she said.
Mrs. Perot said the biggest misconception about her husband was that he is "thin-skinned," and, without naming them, she criticized reporters for projecting that image.
"I think they're trying to, to build a persona that I wouldn't recognize at all," she said. "I think he's very warm."
Then she added: "Well, he may be impatient with some of the questions that they ask him. But I find that that's not the man he is, certainly not at home."

HEADLINE: Panel Votes to Release File on Kennedy Death

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
A House subcommittee today unanimously approved legislation to release Government records on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
The panel, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Economic and Commercial Law, gave the legislation its first favorable vote after defeating two Republican amendments that would have increased the executive branch's control over the documents. Today's action moves the measure to the full Judiciary panel. 
 The bill would set up a judicially appointed citizens' review board to examine all the secret files on the assassination and recommend which should be released. The President could withhold documents on the ground of privacy or national security, however.
The secret material contains everything from autopsy photographs and top secret intelligence reports to newspaper clippings and tax returns.
The Warren Commission concluded in 1964 that Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone, killed Kennedy in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. Conspiracy theories have abounded ever since.

HEADLINE: On China: Beyond All or Nothing

 BODY:
Very soon, President Bush is expected to renew China's favorable trade status for one more year despite Beijing's horrendous abuses of human rights. Before he does, he should consider a clever new proposal for using selective trade sanctions to advance human rights.
This fine-tuned approach was proposed by Holly Burkhalter of Human Rights Watch in a Times Op-Ed article this week. It would smartly sidestep the all-or-nothing trap that doomed past Congressional efforts to pressure China by putting conditions on all trade. If adopted by the President and Congress, it could rebuild consensus on China policy and restore Washington's squandered bargaining power with Beijing. 
 Despite Americans' horror over Beijing's 1989 massacre of democracy demonstrators, its continuing political persecutions and fierce repression of minorities, Congressional efforts to attach human rights conditions to China's trading status have repeatedly fallen short. A key reason was legislative overreach. Human rights advocates have tried to restrict trade severely unless unrealistic conditions were met, like the release of all political prisoners.
Sobered by successive setbacks, some rights advocates now favor a more narrowly calibrated approach. And the Bush Administration, at least in reacting to commercial abuses, has shown itself willing to threaten selective penalties. Put selective sanctions and human rights together, and America can constructively assert its influence on behalf of liberty.
Ms. Burkhalter proposes threatening China with tariff increases against selected products unless it agrees to release a significant number of political prisoners, respect basic religious freedoms and open its prisons and labor camps to international inspection. The longer Beijing resists, the higher tariff penalties could go.
There's reason to hope threats alone might produce results. When Washington threatened selective tariff reprisals for patent and copyright violations last year, Beijing responded with reforms. China has also made limited human rights gestures to influence the trade debate.
If it did become necessary to apply penalties, Ms. Burkhalter notes, these could be aimed at exports like silk, cashmere or petroleum-related products that are mainly produced by state companies, thus preserving steps toward entrepreneurial reform in China.
The selective sanctions approach would restore honor to American policy by supporting human rights in China. It follows tactics the Bush Administration has already used on the patent and copyright issue. And it offers considerable likelihood of success while maintaining strong ties with China. The White House and Congress would do well to embrace and refine Ms. Burkhalter's proposal.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Israeli Inheritance

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
In Israel, governments change, and may again, soon. But the life of the nation has certain constants. They last from one election to another. And they are the only certain inheritance of the winner.
The permanent realities of Israel are these: 
 Its size, the geography of the neighborhood, the animosity of the neighbors, its susceptibility to day-to-day attack from just beyond its borders or terrorism within them -- and its history as the only nation in the world whose existence has been the target of political, economic, military and hate-propaganda attack every hour of its life.
No other nation has quite this collection. And whatever their differences, the two men contesting for the prime ministership are both entirely clear-eyed about every item in it.
The national realities have a lot to do with how Israelis think of themselves. The choice seems to be as passengers in a circle of covered wagons, pioneers of the frontier or, mostly, just people who would give anything for a little peace and quiet, for God's sake.
The realities make them think about questions that never have to cross the minds of Americans. Will the country really last and what do we have to do to make sure it does, always?
Or, for leaders, this question: I have the right to entrust my own life to neighbors who frighten my people but do I have the right to entrust my country? Or this, for all Israelis: whom do I despise more, the terrorists who stabbed a Jewish girl to death or the mob that shouts "Kill the Arabs"?
The tensions built into national life make some Israelis pack guns when they go to work. Others just lean on the car horn as if it were Arafat.
But every time I visit I am seized all over again by the understanding so hard to remember from the outside: Israel is a country, not some kind of lament.
Its people insist on working, studying, making music, making money, making love, dancing -- just as if they were entitled to be as happy and creative as people who do not have to do army duty every year. Music comes out of schoolroom windows.
This time, a busy Christopher Columbus, I made another discovery. That image we have about the elections -- two leaders locked in battle about almost everything vital to Israel. It is not really so.
Talks with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and with Yitzhak Rabin, the front-runner at the moment, showed that although they may wish each other oblivion, they both know they may need each other again. Because of Israel's cockamamie election system, neither party may get a majority. That means whoever comes out on top may have to find partners, and Mr. Shamir and Mr. Rabin may wind up staring at each other.
On the "peace process," Mr. Rabin believes enough settlements have already been put up on the West Bank. This endears him to Washington and may get him the loan guarantees should he win.
Mr. Rabin says he will speed the day of Palestinian autonomy. Mr. Shamir's particular personality manages to obscure his own commitment toward autonomy for Palestinians.
Mr. Rabin hints that he will move Israeli troops out of highly populated areas -- without giving the Palestinians sovereignty. First of all, that would not happen until five years from now. And, like Mr. Shamir, he sees Palestinian statehood as an unacceptable military danger to Israel. Since Palestinians insist that statehood is the only acceptable goal, they may find a Rabin prime ministership as distasteful as Mr. Shamir's.
But where both men come together most importantly is in how they see the world in which Israel lives -- the world of election-to-election realities. Both said in conversations with me that the collapse of the Soviet Union and the defeat of Saddam Hussein had eased the threat to Israel for the short term.
But Mr. Rabin and Moshe Arens, Mr. Shamir's Defense Minister, underline precisely the same long-range dangers for Israel. Specifically: Iranian and Libyan nuclear weapon plans, Iraq's waiting army of skilled nuclear scientists and the rapid military buildup of Syria with Saudi cash.
Israel votes on June 23. If the election is close it may be a little time before things sort themselves out. Then Israel will find out who gets the prime ministership and the inescapable inheritance that goes with it.

What a decade. Those with jobs took 42 seconds longer to get to work in 1990 than they did in 1980. Workers were less likely to car pool or use public transportation. Americans were more likely to have graduated from high school, but their children were also more likely to be growing up in poverty.
The Census Bureau asked a lot of questions in 1990, and yesterday it released many of the answers. The announcement included a comprehensive state-by-state look at a host of statistics -- on income, housing, migration into the country and among the states, and fluency in English.

Over the last five years, Federal, state and city governments have invested nearly $200 million in cash and tax breaks for an airport in the heart of an extraordinary private real estate development spanning more than 17,000 acres of land owned by Ross Perot's family interests here.
 Where the Chisholm Trail once led cattle drives north, and longhorns still graze, lies Alliance Airport, paid for by taxpayers thanks to the kind of behind-the-scenes tactics and political favors that Mr. Perot now decries -- hiring former government officials as consultants and deploying lobbyists to win over politicians whose campaigns he enriched. 
The campaign to win government money for an airport that enhanced his land's value began in 1987, when Mr. Perot and his son, Ross Perot Jr., asked the Federal Aviation Administration to finance their $25 million proposal for a runway and control tower to be owned by the city.
 
Outflanked Bureaucracy
 The F.A.A., which had envisioned an airstrip at about a fifth the cost, backed off and concluded that Mr. Perot should "compete fairly against other important projects in Texas and the nation," Government records show.
 Instead, the Perots outflanked the bureaucracy. They turned to Representative Jim Wright, the powerful Texas Democrat from Fort Worth who was then Speaker of the House. After touring the site in a Perot helicopter, Mr. Wright returned to Washington and in three weeks pushed through a bill that dedicated the money for Alliance, calling it "essential to the continued economic development" of the area.
 Last year, Mr. Perot's lawyer, the former Texas Republican gubernatorial candidate Thomas W. Luce 3d, led the lobbying of the Texas Legislature that set the stage for a package of tax breaks that could be worth millions of dollars to Mr. Perot's project.
 An examination of the Alliance project, including a review of internal F.A.A. records, reveals deep reservations that F.A.A. analysts had for this project, one of the most expensive new airports of the 1980's, and provides new details of how the Perot family got around this reluctance through close ties to Federal and city officials.
 In a broader sense, the airport project shows how Mr. Perot gets things done, often by applying well-timed applications of money and pressure, two time-honored ways of Washington. In all the controversy over the project, no one has accused the Perots of doing anything illegal.
 Yet harsh criticism of the influence of lobbyists -- caricatured by Mr. Perot as "these guys with their alligator shoes" -- has become a refrain of Mr. Perot's public appearances, in which he has sought to portray himself as the ultimate outsider who does not play Washington's power games.
 "When Ross Perot influences an issue, it is not lobbying," said the acting F.A.A. administrator, Barry Harris, a President Bush appointee whose agency has already spent $51 million on Alliance. "When somebody else does it, it is. Perot has influenced legislators and lobbied as much as anybody else."
 Indeed, Mr. Perot, his family, and their business interests have used several lobbyists in Texas and Washington. On the Alliance project alone, they employed one of the most prominent lobbyists in Texas, as well as two Washington firms, Bayless, Boland, Bates & Madigan, and Lipsen, Whitten & Diamond.
 
The Airport

 Many Expect A Boom in Texas
 The Alliance Airport project is the one of the Perot family's first big real estate ventures, an attempt to get in on the ground floor of what many believe will be the next boom area in Texas. The Perots bought thousands of acres of Fort Worth land using some of their windfall from the 1984 sale of the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, the computer services company that the senior Mr. Perot sold to the General Motors Corporation.
 The Perots are promoting Alliance as the industrial complex of Fort Worth's future, a state-of-the-art development that will revolutionize airports and attract imitators around the country. They believe that the airport -- located on 418 acres the Perots donated to the city -- will lure manufacturers that want to airlift parts and products. These companies, attracted by the airport's location in the middle of the United States, will then buy some of the 17,000 acres owned by the Perots for their plants. Some will even ship finished goods on the nearby rail lines.
 Surrounding this complex will be housing, shopping and schools for thousands of workers -- all of it, again, built on Perot land.
 In a lengthy interview, the younger Perot said that he had already sold about 660 houses in the subdivisions the family is developing, and that they were planning thousands more in the $80,000 to $90,000 price range.
 The key to all the plans is the airport. One Perot company executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, estimated that tens of millions of dollarsof Perot land doubled in value when the airstrip was approved. Moreover, other tracts of Perot land nearby also rose in value, the executive said, by an average of 50 percent.
 For example, the Drug Enforcement Administration paid about $4.30 a square foot for land for which the Perots had paid 50 cents to $1 a square foot. However, that increase not only reflects the airport but the Perots' and the Government's costs of improvements like sewers and roads.
 Now, the Perot family is trying to get the F.A.A. to spend $108 million more to rip up part of the runway that was built two years ago, reroute railroad tracks and a road. The latest idea would lengthen the airstrip to accommodate fully loaded jumbo cargo jets flying international routes. Opponents in court have said that the plan was a Perot ploy merely intended to make some land that the Perots want to sell to the railroad more attractive.
 With so much at stake, the Perots have exercised remarkable control over the airport, even though it is the city's operation. Fort Worth officials acknowledge that almost every important decision, from the shape of the control tower, to the length of runway, originated with the Perots. The control has been so complete, in fact, that the F.A.A. has formally complained to city officials. Afterward, the city took greater interest in the airstrip.
 Mr. Perot and Fort Worth city officials say that while the airport has certainly helped the Perots, it has also created jobs and tax revenue. They portray it as a perfect marriage of public and private interests whose remarkable achievement was the construction of an airport in just three years.
 "Yes, the Perot group will benefit from it," said Deputy City Manager Ramon Guajardo. "There was never any question of that. But we see it as a partnership. He can't do it without us, and we can't do it without him."
 But Mr. Guajardo acknowledged that while the number of construction jobs had far outpaced the city's projections, the number of permanent jobs had been far smaller. The city projected 832 construction jobs; the project generated 4,131. It projected 1,209 permanent jobs; but so far yielded only 63.
 Nonetheless, Ross Perot Jr., 33 years old, said in an interview that the civic virtues of the project were as important to him as the commercial: "From a community perspective, it's been successful. Will it make money? If we work hard, maybe."
 At stages during the Alliance negotiations, the younger Perot contributed to city officials. One of the biggest supporters of the project, former Mayor Robert Bolen, received $1,000 from Ross Jr. in 1989. Former City Councilman Louis J. Zapata Jr., whose district included part of the airport, received $1,000 in 1987. Both are among the biggest single contributions in that period.
 And after Speaker Wright helped the project along, Ross Perot Jr. and his wife made a $5,000 political contribution to him. On May 31, 1989, Mr. Wright resigned from the House after an ethics investigation accused him of 69 violations of House rules, including receiving inappropriate gifts from a Fort Worth developer. None of the accusations involved the Perot family.
 
The Lobbying

 Success in Getting Federal Money
 The Perots' success at winning government money stands out because of the complexity of the development, and the mix of local and Federal agencies and officials.
 So far, the F.A.A. has spent $51 million for the airport's development, and the Federal Highway Administration has spent at least $30 million building roads and highways connecting Perot holdings to Alliance. The city of Fort Worth has spent almost $25 million on the project, mostly on street and sewer improvements for the airport and some of Mr. Perot's surrounding land.
 The lure of the airport prompted the Drug Enforcement Administration to give the Perots $2.5 million for 12.5 acres nearby where it plans to house 90 airplanes.
 The former D.E.A. administrator, Jack Lawn, recalled that the Perot site was suggested by his top aide, Thomas C. Kelly. Mr. Kelly knew Mr. Perot from the time Mr. Kelly was special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's office in Dallas, said Mr. Lawn, who is now an official with the New York Yankees baseball team.
 After retiring from the D.E.A. in October 1989, Mr. Kelly went to work briefly for an airplane manufacturer, then became a top aide to the elder Mr. Perot. James Squires, press spokesman for Mr. Perot, said Mr. Kelly's hiring had nothing to do with the role he played in the D.E.A.'s decision. He said Mr. Kelly had already left the D.E.A. by the time the agency actually made the decision to buy the land. Mr. Lawn said the Perot land was the best site the agency examined.
 Another Federal official who helped the project to advance also went to work for the Perots. Michael Goldfarb, the senior Washington F.A.A. official on the project, said his consulting firm now does work for the Perots, with the specific task of finding business for Alliance. The younger Perot said the family had hired Mr. Goldfarb about a year after he left the F.A.A.
 The General Services Administration, which operates most Federal buildings, is also considering moving the F.A.A.'s regional headquarters to Alliance from an area northwest of Fort Worth. To do so, it would also have to buy land from the Perots.
 
Sale to American Airlines
But the biggest catch for the Perots is an estimated $17 million land sale to American Airlines in a nationwide competition for a home for a new aircraft repair operation. It was financed by proceeds from a $500 million municipal bond issue as well as 10-year property tax abatements.
 The Perots biggest lobbying effort -- and one that generated the most controversy in Austin, the state capital -- was for a proposal to have Alliance declared a Foreign Trade Zone. This initiative was headed by Mr. Luce and Rusty Kelley, a former state house sergeant-at-arms who once lobbied for several of Texas's highest-flying savings and loan associations. The Foreign Trade Zone idea was intended to attract a McDonnell-Douglas Corporation plant to Alliance.
 Steve Wolens, a legislator from Dallas who at first opposed the idea and later supported a successful compromise bill, described the lobbying by Mr. Luce and Mr. Kelly as fanatical. Mr. Wolens claimed, for example, that when he had told Mr. Luce that he could not be in Austin for an important committee meeting, Mr. Luce tried to get the committee to meet without him.
 
The F.A.A.

 Several Disputes Over the Project
Throughout the project, the Perots and the F.A.A. had several disputes, according to interviews and internal agency documents. But despite the frequent clashes, the idea of building an airport north of Fort Worth was actually the F.A.A.'s.
 Beginning in the late 1960's and early 1970's, the agency began pressuring the state, as well as city and county governments near Fort Worth, to build a small airport to handle noncommercial, recreational and cargo traffic. The pressure continued to mount into the 1970's and 1980's, with the F.A.A. arguing that it was time for an airport, managed locally but financed by the F.A.A., to alleviate the growing traffic at Dallas/ Fort Worth International Airport.
 By 1986, the City of Fort Worth and the F.A.A. were considering eight sites near Fort Worth and Dallas. Then, city officials say, they read a news article that described how Ross Perot and his son, a passionate pilot who was the first person to fly a helicopter around the world, had been buying up the acreage north of Fort Worth.
 Executives of Mr. Perot's development company, the Perot Group, said the family started buying the property with an eye on long-term development -- exactly what kind, they had not decided. Having spent roughly $200 million, they were expecting to wait as long as 20 years before developing it, and had no plan to build an airport until the city and the F.A.A raised it.
 The younger Mr. Perot said he was attracted by the jobs the airport could create and the increase in the value of his property. Nonetheless, he said, he had to persuade his father to go along. His father's initial reaction, Ross Jr. recalled, was: "Don't do it. Airports make lots of noise."
 But the son persuaded the father to go along, and by early 1987, the Perots and the city had a plan for a $25 million airport. The Perots would donate 400 acres to the city, which would then apply to the F.A.A. for the money to build a runway and control tower.
 That is when the F.A.A. said there was no money for such an expensive project, and maybe there was not such a rush after all.
 The Perots, in turn, had no use for a tiny airport, company executives said. It would decrease the value of their land, creating the noise and traffic of an airport without the attracting big businesses. And the family "didn't have 10 years to wait," the younger Perot said. "Once we decided to do it, we wanted to just get it done."
 That is when the Perots took Mr. Wright for a ride on their helicopter.
 "This project probably would have fallen apart without that," said Gene Faulkner, a former regional F.A.A. official who worked closely on the project.
A spokesman for Mr. Wright said he was traveling and would not be able to comment on the airport project.
 The younger Mr. Perot said the Perots were never aware of this F.A.A. opposition. To the contrary, he said, F.A.A. officials told the Perots that the agency supported a large industrial airport, but needed Congress to approve money.
 Once the project began, the F.A.A. documents show a dispute developed over the Perots' design for a control tower, which the F.A.A. thought too expensive and declined to finance. The city ended up paying for it. In addition, the Perots wanted a drainage system that cost much more than the one the F.A.A. had selected. The dispute over the drainage system became so heated, F.A.A. officials say, that Mr. Faulkner, the agency's main link to the project, said he was removed as a result of it.
 The F.A.A. declined to comment on Mr. Faulkner's removal.
 But the most rancorous dispute continues, centering on the Perots' latest plan to lengthen the runway, completed in December 1989, to a total of 13,000 feet at a cost of $108 million.
 The younger Mr. Perot said the extension was necessary because the Perots were trying to attract international companies that would fly fully loaded giant cargo planes overseas. He said they had given the F.A.A. a list of interested companies.
 But Mr. Harris, the F.A.A.'s acting administrator, said the Perots and Fort Worth city officials have yet to prove this need. "The justification for this appropriation has been vague and pie-in-the-sky," he said.
 Of the $108 million, $78 million would finance the relocation of some railroad lines and roadway to make room for the longer runway. In a court challenge to the extension, officials of the neighboring town of Saginaw, Tex., asserted that the relocation of these lines was the real reason that the Perots are seeking the runway extension. In interviews and court filings, the Saginaw officials claiGthe Perots want the tracks moved onto some land the family is trying to sell to the Atchixson, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway; without the tracks, the land would have no value to the railroad.
 Perot executives acknowledge that they are trying to sell the land to the railroad and that the relocated track would make the land more attractive. But they say this is not the reason that they want to extend the runway. THe F.A.A. said it did not know what to make of these accusations. "I'm looking at this, and I'm saying $108 million is a lot of money." Mr. Harris said. "I don't think it is my job to participate in a speculative venture with Ross Perot."

HEADLINE: Portrait of America;
New Census Data Reveal Redistribution of Poverty

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
The best evidence yet of the widening economic gulf between the old and the young during the 1980's was provided today in newly released Census Bureau data that showed the elderly held their own during the decade's economic ups and downs while the nation's children increasingly slid into poverty.
The finding is part of a cornucopia of new information from the census showing growing differences between regions and population groups in areas as varied as the amount of schooling, type of disability, length of the commute, age of housing and ancestry of the nation's 250 million people. 
 The data also confirms the decade's place in immigration history: 8.6 million people told the census that they entered the country during the 1980's. That is almost as many immigrants as arrived from 1900 to 1910, the previous high-water mark of American immigration.
 
Redistribution of Poverty
 But the starkest picture drawn from the wealth of new information is the portrait of the redistribution of poverty among the generations. As the number of people beneath the poverty line grew by 4.3 million to more than 31 million between 1979 and 1989, increasing numbers of the poor were children. One in four of new entrants into the ranks of the poor in the 1980's was under 18 years of age; one in 25 was 65 or older.
Martha Farnsworth Riche, director of the Population Reference Bureau, a private Washington-based research organization, said the elderly fared relatively well because the Federally financed safety net was held relatively intact for them. "The indexing of Social Security payments to inflation was probably the single biggest factor that got people out of poverty," Ms. Riche said.
"A similar thing was not done for children. We just assume that parents raise children. Because we're all going to be elderly and we all have elderly parents, we just think that society provides for the elderly."
The nation's adults had higher percentages of high school and college graduates, and the percentage of high school dropouts had declined from 13 percent to 11 percent. But the educational gains were not reflected in the economic statistics, which showed growing numbers of poor people.
The figures make up a snapshot of the nation's economic health just before the current recession began, but the trends reflected in the census are continuing, according to more recent data.
The Census statistics on commuting show a smaller portion of workers using car pools or public transportation. The percentage of workers who drive alone to their jobs rose to 73.2 percent from 64.4 percent a decade ago; car-pool use dropped from 19.7 percent to 13.4 percent and public transit ridership fell from 6.4 percent to 5.3 percent.
Among the most striking geographic trends was the tendency of the rest of the nation to pull away from the Appalachian and Mississippi River states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and West Virginia, which were consistently poorer, younger and less educated than other areas.
The data also reflected the rapid pace of income decline in these regions, the Farm Belt and the Great Plains. Median income levels declined by at least 10 percent over the drought-plagued decade in Iowa, Montana, North Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming, as well as in Louisiana and West Virginia.
But there was marked economic buoyancy in states with large suburban populations. Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Virginia, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and California all ranked among the top 10 states in the nation in median income; all but New Hampshire ranked among the top 10 in the percentage of population earning more than $150,000 annually.
These states, however, were among the first to see their economies fall into recession in 1991 and have been among the hardest-hit by the current economic doldrums.
The newly released census figures reveal a wide range of information:
*Median income levels, adjusted for inflation, shrank during the 1980's in 24 states, from the Farm Belt to the depressed manufacturing states of Michigan, Ohio and Illinois to Texas, Arizona and New Mexico.
*Accounting for inflation, the median household income for the nation rose 6.5 percent to $30,056 a year, but the median amount spent on mortgage payments increased 26.9 percent, to $737 a month or $8,844 a year.
*Southeastern states, where education spending has historically been low, registered the sharpest gains in high school graduates. But even with these gains, the populations of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia remained among the least-educated. The best-educated populations were clustered in the West and Midwest, in states like Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, Utah, Alaska and Colorado.
*About 10 percent of the population ages 16 to 64, or 16.1 million people, had impaired mobility or needed help with basic tasks like dressing. One-third of those 65 or older, or 10.5 million people, were limited in mobility or in their ability to care for themselves.
*The proportion of the population speaking a language other than English at home more than doubled, from 6.6 percent to 13.8 percent, or nearly 32 million people.
*About one housing unit in five was built during the 1980's, compared with more than one in four in the 1970's. One dwelling in every 30 in New Mexico, West Virginia and Louisiana lacked complete plumbing facilities; in Alaska, the ratio is one in eight.
 
15 Million Households
 The census data released today was compiled from "long-form" questionnaires filled out by more than 15 million households, a sample size that dwarfs any other government or private research effort. As a result, while the numbers are somewhat dated, they also allow detailed regional and local analysis of everything from household type to commuting patterns.
One of the most striking facets revealed in the new data was the divergence in economic trends, which was often hidden within larger aggregates. For instance, California ranked fourth in the country in the proportion of households with annual incomes in excess of $150,000.
Yet while the state's median income grew by 17 percent in constant dollars -- more than twice as fast as the national average -- the number of California children in poverty increased by 40 percent. These high childhood poverty increases were explained partly, though not completely, by the 20 percent increase in the number of Californians under the age of 18.
California also ranked well below the national average in the proportion of working mothers, although it compared favorably with the rest of the country on the proportion of female-headed households in poverty. Half of such households in California were poor; the national rate was 57.4 percent.
Another cross-current was revealed in the data on 16- to 19-year-old high school dropouts. This group declined as a proportion of all older teen-agers, going to 6.6 percent in 1989 from 7.8 percent in 1979. But while in general they were concentrated in the inner cities and poor rural areas, the dropouts seemed to be where the unskilled work was.
In 1990, teen-age dropouts without work were concentrated in traditional bastions of rural poverty like Mississippi, aging industrial states like New York, or states like North Carolina and Oregon, whose economies were rapidly shifting from resource-based industries, like timber and tobacco, to service- and technology-based industries.
But the greatest number of dropouts, including both the employed and the idle, could be found in Nevada, Arizona, and Florida, all among the top five in new home construction, an industry that provides lucrative if short-term employment for the unskilled and semiskilled.
Among the states that had the fewest people moving in, three -- Michigan, Pennsylvania and New York -- had major cities where poverty became more concentrated over the decade, and where the shift in poverty from the old to the young was most evident.
The number of working mothers was measured in the census for the first time in 1990, and the figures revealed some regional disparities. Though nearly 60 percent of mothers of preschool children worked, the percentage of working mothers of school-age children was 75 percent. But these totals were much lower in the Middle Atlantic States, particularly in New York, where 52 percent of mothers with preschool children worked, along with 71 percent of those with school-age children.
The proportion of working mothers was also below the national average in California, and it was well above the national average in Hawaii, New Hampshire, Minnesota and the Dakotas.
Though the proportion of blacks, Asians and Hispanic people in the country climbed over the past decade, all three were outnumbered by whites claiming English ancestry (32.6 million), German (57.9 million) and Irish (38.7 million). Other European ancestries most frequently claimed were Italian and Polish.
About 30 million black residents were counted in the 1990 census, along with 7.3 million Asians or Pacific Islanders, and 1.9 million Americans Indians, Eskimos or Aleuts. There were also 22.3 million Hispanic people, who can be of any race, among the total resident population of 248.7 million people.
Though the census long-form data is collected to meet the requirements of various Federal laws, like statutes on highway and mass-transit subsidies and national welfare programs based on poverty rates, statisticians are beginning to discuss alternative means of collecting this data. Several witnesses at a Congressional hearing on census strategies suggested that smaller samples be taken at more frequent intervals to keep the data up to date.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 5, 1992, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of a computer processing error, an article and a chart last Friday about the 1990 Census misstated percentages of 16- to 19-year-olds who have dropped out of school and are not working. The five states with the lowest percentages are North Dakota, 2.81; Minnesota, 3.52; Nebraska, 3.67; Wisconsin, 3.74, and Iowa, 3.77. The states with the highest percentages are Kentucky, 9.16; Louisiana, 9.11; Arizona, 8.53, and West Virginia, 8.36. The District of Columbia had the highest percentage, 10.55.

What a decade. Those with jobs took 42 seconds longer to get to work in 1990 than they did in 1980. Workers were less likely to car pool or use public transportation. Americans were more likely to have graduated from high school, but their children were also more likely to be growing up in poverty.
The Census Bureau asked a lot of questions in 1990, and yesterday it released many of the answers. The announcement included a comprehensive state-by-state look at a host of statistics -- on income, housing, migration into the country and among the states, and fluency in English.

6 Vice Presidents Taking Early Pensions at Digital

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

 BODY:
It was a week of goodbye lunches at the Digital Equipment Corporation. The financially troubled computer maker is losing at least six vice presidents today as part of an early retirement program aimed at reducing the head count in the $14 billion corporation.
More executives are expected to accept the severance plan. Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., expects up to 7,000 of its 116,000 employees to take early retirement, which is aimed at those over 50 years old. 
 All those leaving are longtime Digital employees who played roles in the company's tremendous growth in the 1970's and 80's. A company insider said the list included George A. Chamberlain 3d, vice president for marketing and finance; Henry J. Crouse, vice president, strategic relations; James G. Cudmore, vice president, operations staff; William J. Heffner, vice president for image, voice and video; Robert C. Hughes, vice president, United States sales, and Domenic J. Lacava, vice president, Unix-based software and systems.
None of the vice presidents were available for comment. Mr. Hughes has already accepted a position with Bachman Information Systems Inc. in Burlington, Mass.
Mr. Lacava was the most visible of the officers to take the package. For four years he has been influential in developing Digital's open systems and Unix work station strategies, often speaking at Digital product announcements. Mr. Lacava lost his position in a recent reorganization and was expected to leave.
In 1983 and 1984, 16 vice presidents left after a broad reorganization. Marc Schulman, an analyst with UBS Securities, said there were parallels with that time, noting that the company was undergoing a stressful strategic shift in difficult economic times.
"The joke back then was losing those people was the best thing that ever happened to Digital," Mr. Schulman said. "There's no guarantee it will be the same this time. It certainly is more difficult now."
Digital has suffered back-to-back losing quarters amid difficult economic conditions for the computer industry. The company is expecting to take a restructuring charge of up to $1 billion starting on July 1, when its new fiscal year begins, to cover the costs of further staff cuts.
Dallas Kirk, a Digital spokesman, said the company would have no comment until Monday on those taking the severance package. He noted that employees had until the end of business today to change their minds.

HEADLINE: After the Cold War: Views From Latin America;
Sweeping Political Changes Leave Latin Poor Still Poor

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 29

 BODY:
Nowhere across the developing world does a new order appear more evident than in Latin America.
Armies that ruled much of the hemisphere barely a decade ago are shut in their barracks; most of the leftists they so dreaded are in a shambles. Countries that had barricaded their economies against the outside world have found the same new answers: Trade barriers are falling like dominoes, and state enterprises are everywhere up for sale. 
 Some peace has come to Nicaragua and El Salvador, some prosperity to Bolivia. A nationalist rivalry between Argentina and Brazil has evaporated, ending the regional arms race and its nuclear threat. Of Cuba's fiery promise of revolution, only embers remain.
 
An Uncertain Triumph
 Yet as so many countries struggle to reinvent themselves, they have begun to find the triumph of democracy and free enterprise far less decisive than the defeat of despotism and the command economy. What is the glory of fair voting, Brazilians and Peruvians and Paraguayans have asked, if corruption remains endemic, justice systems are still unjust, and presidents do as they please?
Though one government after another has brought down inflation and restored growth, relatively little of the wealth has trickled down. And with the fortune of a few growing more apparent, many of the indigent are asking more sharply how long the pain of economic "adjustments" will last.
"For the people who have good jobs, things are getting better, of course," said Victoria Ramos, an unwed 25-year-old mother of three who helps her father farm and bake bread in the Mexican village of Reyes Etla. "But they are living off the peasants, the humble people. For the poor, it is something very different. What do the poor get from the Government?"
The hemisphere's authoritarian structures and statist economics began to crumble long before the Berlin wall, and did so overwhelmingly for their own reasons. But to many people, the outlook is more hopeful than it has been in years merely for having been purged of superpower interest and sterile ideological conflict.
"It is as though the cold war had been a mask that blinded us to the reality of the world," the Mexican poet Octavio Paz said. And in a different conversation, a frequent political adversary of Mr. Paz seemed to complete his thought.
"The fact that we can see the problems in their proper perspective rather than through a mask of anti-Communism or pro-Communism," the Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes said, "is the beginning of the resolution of those problems on their real terms."
The clearer view has made it hard not to see that over the last two generations, Latin American government institutions have withered while social, economic and environmental challenges have grown. The violence and corruption of drug traffickers continue to tear through much of the region. The wildfire spread of cholera has revealed infrastructure and health-care systems in advanced decay.
According to United Nations estimates, poverty defines the lives of more than 40 percent of all Latin Americans. Although the region's foreign debt problem is seldom described as a crisis anymore, billions of dollars that might be used for social programs still go to banks overseas.
The common direction of policy in many countries has also obscured the sharp debates over what sort of capitalism they should have. A central question of the past -- who should bear the sacrifices of economic development -- is growing more insistent.
"There is no real consensus," said Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a leader of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party. "There is a feeling everywhere that if the economy recovers, social problems will be solved. But we don't know how to reconcile the markets with policies that will ameliorate poverty, misery and injustice."
 
Looking for Help
Financial Aid Is Hard to Find
 Stripped of the geopolitical import that defined their place in the postwar world, Latin Americans are uncertain to whom they might turn for help.
Japanese investors have become something like U.F.O.'s: Many people expect them to land one day, but almost no one can convincingly describe what one does. International lending agencies are swamped with new demands, and many private creditors see higher returns in Eastern Europe.
Across much of the region, relations with the United States have become almost cozy after a century of mistrust. But from 1990 to 1991, United States aid to Latin America dropped by 27 percent. And as isolationist themes have surfaced in the 1992 Presidential campaign, the hemisphere's ancient fears of American interference have given way to new worries that it might be ignored.
"The United States?" Tomas Borge, the former Sandinista guerrilla leader and Nicaraguan Interior Minister, repeated the words in a recent interview as though he had not heard them in a while. "With their rear guard safe," he said, "they don't worry about our countries much anymore."
So long as rebels like Mr. Borge could turn to Fidel Castro for help and threaten Marxist takeovers of their own, much of Latin America was able to count on United States economic aid, loan support and trade.
 
Duality of U.S. Policy
 Beginning with John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress in 1961, the benefits were meant to dissuade Latin Americans from socialism and revolution. But along with Washington's help came support for anti-Communist military dictators, an often heavy-handed United States presence in the region and a claimed American right to intervene where the enticements failed.
The duality reflected a 30-year split among American policy makers over the cause of instability in the hemisphere. To the right, and usually dominant, were officials who saw Communist adventurism. To the left were those who blamed poverty and injustice.
After 1962, when the Cuban missile crisis brought the world closer than ever to nuclear war, the United States generally made stability a more immediate goal than democracy. The Soviet Union, in the meantime, lowered its profile in the region, secretly financing Latin Communist parties and opening diplomatic and trade relations with as many countries as it could.
More important for the region's polarization, the Soviets sponsored Mr. Castro as he transformed Cuba at least temporarily into an example of social reform, a patron of Marxist guerrilla groups and a symbol of nationalistic defiance that obsessed the United States.
"Cuba gave us the illusion that we could be taken seriously," Mario Rasi, a Brazilian playwright, said as he prepared recently for a trip to show his solidarity with the Castro Government. "The cruel reality is that we don't count for anything in this phase of world history."
 
Conflicting Ideals
 American diplomats and Latin politicians often described the conflict as one of parallel ideals: democracy versus dictatorship, capitalism and free markets versus socialism and state control.
Yet the prevailing Latin American economic model of the postwar age -- state ownership and intervention to sustain unproductive industries; monopolies and trade protection, and endless public works to buy political support -- crossed ideological lines. It was applied by leftist civilian governments and anti-Communist military regimes, and it failed them all.
Although Latin American economies grew at an average rate of 5.5 percent in the 30 years before 1980, they also grew heavy with inefficiencies, addicted to deficit spending and dependent on imports of capital goods.
By the 1970's, the result was often inflation that shot out of control. Then, beginning with Mexico in 1982, countries found that they could no longer pay their huge debts, and creditors began demanding austerity and orthodox reform as the price of sustenance.
The fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 not only discredited statist policies in Latin America but also provided a further incentive for change: By putting Eastern Europe on many investors' maps, it intensified the fight for capital in the developing world.
It is in this light that many economists say most of capitalism's brave new Latin American soldiers had no alternative -- a historical subtlety, perhaps, but one that raises questions about the permanence of the reforms.
"The fact that politicians in Latin America have called in technocrats who believe in the formulas of the World Bank and the I.M.F. doesn't mean that there will be no return to the old populist policies," said the Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto, a strong advocate of the reforms. "Everybody is on their best behavior today because there's no money around, and the only way you can get any is to do what the I.M.F. says."
 
New Allies
Old Ideologies And Enmities Fade
 In Central America, where superpower tensions fueled violent conflicts almost until the Soviet Union's collapse, the cold war's end has had more visceral effects.
The wooded hills above Ocotal, Nicaragua, for instance, are seeded with the hatreds of killing that began in the late 1920's and then proceeded almost without interruption from the Sandinista rebellion in the late 1970's though the contra war to oust the Sandinistas.
But earlier this year, former contra rebels and former Sandinista soldiers came down from the hills together, pointing rifles in the same direction and demanding the same things: land, housing and farm loans.
So fully have war memories been overwhelmed by immediate concerns that the authorities to whom they turn are old enemies, too.
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the Sandinistas' bitter critic for a decade, is under siege by former supporters because of her alliance with leaders of the old regime. And such was the Sandinista uproar when Mrs. Chamorro's Sandinista Defense Minister, Gen. Humberto Ortega Saavedra, decorated a departing United States military attache not long ago that Mr. Borge felt it necessary to remind the enraged militants that General Ortega, the strategist of their victory 13 years earlier, was still a revolutionary.
The general's brother, former President Daniel Ortega Saavedra, said recently that Nicaraguans had managed to "depolarize" their society, only to find that a half-measure. Leftist Salvadoran guerrillas and their right-wing Government saw the problem long before they made peace: Without foreign aid at levels like those that sustained their fighting, they could never treat the country's problems with the urgency that war had conferred on them.
It seemed to follow a circular logic like that of Nicaragua's former and current combatants that a new guerrilla group appeared in Bolivia last year and an old one, the Cinchoneros, reappeared this month in Honduras. But familiar ideological impulses have also taken new shape.
As the United States debates whether to militarize the war on cocaine in the Andes, Colombian and Peruvian guerrillas have found a new source of funds in taxing the traffickers. In Bolivia, Marxist miners who lost their jobs when the Government sold its tin business have streamed into the jungle, organizing coca farmers with the zeal they brought to their socialistic revolution in 1952.
While guerrillas in Colombia and Guatemala fight on under Marxist-Leninist flags, the region's most potent insurgency is its most independent. The ideology of Peru's Shining Path, while often called Maoist, is such a singular mix of revolutionary ideas that a more accurate label is the one used by the guerrillas themselves. They call it "Gonzalo Thought," after their self-proclaimed "President Gonzalo," a former philosophy professor named Abimael Guzman.
But in Peru and throughout Latin America, more traditional leftist parties are linked primarily by their disarray. Whether or not they were agents of the old statism, most of them have been tarred by its failures. With their adversaries championing change to voters impatient for it, the left has often been forced to choose between endorsing Government policies or braving political jeers to advocate a more active social role for the state.
Sergio Bitar, a former minister in the Chilean socialist Government of Salvador Allende Gossens, said the quandary "has forced us to look much more at concrete proposals rather than theoretical ideas, to understand that we need to be more competitive and productive, and to put democracy at the center of all progressive thinking."
While Mr. Bitar's Party for Democracy was energetically revisionist before Communism ended in Europe, its success is rare. The leftist coalition that almost lifted Cuauhtemoc Cardenas to the Mexican presidency in 1988 faltered badly in elections last year. Colombia's former M-19 rebels, no longer a novelty at the polls, have had trouble building a real party.
Moribund as much of the traditional left is, some political analysts argue that support for "neo-liberals" may not be so strong as it seems, either.
They note that many of the reformers -- Presidents Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina, Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil, Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela and Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru -- all campaigned as populists, pledging little that was concrete, and sometimes the opposite of the economic changes they have made.
In Argentina, Mr. Menem has taken advantage of the economic chaos that preceded him -- annual inflation of more than 20,000 percent and supermarkets under siege by hungry mobs -- to win wide support for painful measures to stabilize and reorient the economy.
But only in Ecuador's May 17 election, which put two conservative candidates into a runoff, have presidential candidates running on vocally free-market platforms won clear backing at the polls.
<BH>What Road to Take
Economic Reform And/or Democracy
 That Chile and Mexico have emerged as examples of economic reform has led many Latin Americans to question how well democracy and free markets really go together.
In Chile, Gen. Augusto Pinochet was able to quiet critics with tear gas, water cannon and mass arrests as he imposed structural economic changes that during the military regime's first decade led to a 40 percent drop in real wages and some of the highest urban unemployment in Latin America.
Persuasion has been far more important to economic restructuring in Mexico, but the overwhelming political advantages and administrative control of a party that has been in power for six decades have often been essential.
Labor unions dependent on the Government have kept workers in line as their real wages have plummeted. Powerful union leaders who might have opposed the privatization of state companies or other policies have been toppled or even jailed.
In an interview after his party's strong recovery at the left's expense in congressional and state elections last summer, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari argued that the fall of the Berlin wall and changes in the Soviet Union had "significantly affected the vote of the left in Mexico."
His counterparts in Latin America have paid more attention to the fact that amid all the talk of efficiency and enterprise, Mr. Salinas's political strategy has remained populist. While his $3-billion-a-year antipoverty program stresses community involvement in public works, it also stamps each new sewer and school with a seal of Government munificence.
The money from the sale of state companies used to pay for such programs has been far less plentiful in other countries than it has been in Mexico. For an emerging underclass of Latin economies, big international bond issues, packs of foreign investors and trade agreements with the United States are also still part of a dream.
In the absence of such advantages, politicians say, the failings of leaders and governments are often seen as shortcomings of democracy itself.
Until recently, falling inflation, memories of violent military rule and weak opposition parties muffled the discontent. But even in Mexico, Chile and Argentina, Government officials still worry endlessly about the effects of prosperity unevenly spread.
To many officials, the peril was crystallized in February in Venezuela, when military rebels tried to overthrow Mr. Perez. After a year in which the economy grew 9.2 percent, the President's critics had complained that social services were breaking down, that only the rich were getting richer and that corrupt officials were growing richest of all.
The insurgent officers appealed almost unthinkably to students at whom soldiers had shot while crushing riots three years before. They capitalized on the widespread perception that Mr. Perez had worked harder at being a prominent statesman than on the problems of the poor. He protested that soldiers had tried to kill him; some Venezuelans applauded.
Many Peruvians also hailed Mr. Fujimori for suspending the Peruvian Constitution and shutting the Congress on April 5. Even some thoughtful analysts of the country's crisis believe that Shining Path's blunt appeal to destroy the existing system must be fought with draconian measures.
Others, like Mr. de Soto, the economist, argue that the actions are a vivid reminder of checks, balances and accountability dangerously missing from the region's young democracies.
"It reminds you of the guy with the seismograph in one of those old American films," he said. "You know that Los Angeles is going to crumble in two hours, and no one will listen."
 
The U.S. Role
Widening Debate And No Consensus
 United States officials insist that they are listening, and that if there is a lesson about Latin America in the world's changes, they have learned it.
"I will not deny that my own country bears its share of responsibility for having tended to view our hemispheric relationships through the sometimes distorting prism of the cold war," the Deputy Secretary of State, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, told the Organization of American States last June.
Mr. Eagleburger went on to warn, "Anyone plotting against an elected government should know in advance: This hemisphere will not stand idly by if democracy is assaulted, neither before nor after a crisis emerges."
What meaning that dictum might hold for two countries where the Administration sees democracy egregiously nonexistent is unclear.
His sponsors gone from the planet and his economy almost bankrupt, Mr. Castro has still thumbed his nose at American officials who tell him to hold elections he might lose.
Yet even with the urgency of a Presidential election in which Cuban-American votes may play an important role, the United States has been able only to persuade its Latin American partners not to help sustain the Cuban economy.
At another O.A.S. assembly last week, despite an agreement on stronger economic sanctions against Haiti, the United States also found itself unable to muster any broader consensus on how to come to democracy's defense. Venezuelans wanted a multinational force. Mexicans wanted nothing of the sort. And Americans watched almost helplessly as failures of democracy and economic development translated into a stream of boat people heading north.
Increasingly, Administration officials have turned to democracy-building programs long favored by Congressional liberals. They are financing judicial-system improvements in Colombia and new civilian police forces in Panama and El Salvador.
 
A Shift in Washington
 Almost at the same time, though, Congress has appeared to lose much of its interest in such efforts. This year, it declined to finance debt-relief and economic development programs proposed by the Administration, and some members have opposed free-trade agreements for Mexico and Chile.
"No one in Washington wants to spend much time talking about Latin America these days, except the people who are obliged to," said Lars Schoultz, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina who has long studied United States policy on the region. "The silence from Congress is deafening. Just no one cares."
The Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Bernard W. Aronson, said that is not so. He said Latin America's economic relevance to the United States was growing quickly, with its imports of American products up 29 percent over the last two years, and a $100 billion market for American goods expected by the century's end. But Mr. Aronson acknowledged that some new thinking was needed.
"We tend to be very impatient and arrogant about what it takes to build institutions," he said. "This isn't going to be a quick fix."

HEADLINE: U.S. to Reject Pact on Protection Of Wildlife and Global Resources

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
Less than a week before the start of a global environmental summit conference, the Bush Administration said today that it would not sign an international treaty recently negotiated by 98 countries to preserve the world's plants, animals and natural resources.
The treaty, the product of almost two weeks of intense negotiations in Nairobi, Kenya, this month, is considered one of the two main achievements of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which begins on Wednesday in Rio de Janeiro. 
 The other focus, a proposed treaty to combat global warming, was accepted by the United States, but only after the Administration persuaded other countries to drop their insistence on a strict timetable for curbing emissions of carbon dioxide.
 
Others to Follow U.S. Lead
 The Administration's decision on the treaty preserving plants, animals and natural resources, known as the biological diversity treaty, is almost certain to be followed by Japan and many European nations, according to preliminary indications from officials in those countries.
The actions by the President and other leaders of the industrialized world is likely to further roil an international conference that many world leaders and environmentalists had hoped would make repairing the planet a central organizing political force in the post-cold-war period.
But the American refusal to sign the biodiversity treaty is not expected to be a fatal blow. Unlike the case of the climate treaty, to which the United States is essential because it is the world's largest industrial emitter of carbon dioxide, the biodiversity treaty protects natural resources that are distributed among many nations. The treaty will come into force when it has been ratified by 30 nations.
Nevertheless, the Administration appeared to be sensitive to criticism of its refusal to sign the treaty. As if anticipating the criticism, the Administration announced its rejection late this afternoon, too late for the deadlines of some news organizations, particularly television.
And then, almost simultaneously, the White House announced that the United States and Germany were preparing a separate international plan to develop economic and technical practices for preserving the world's forests. President Bush is expected to announce on Monday that the United States will contribute more than $100 million annually to put it into effect.
The cause of protecting forests is expected to be a major point of contention at the Earth Summit, with Malaysia and other developing countries opposed to curbs on their use of forest land for economic development.
The forestry and species preservation issues are only two of several that are pitting rich nations against poor nations and stirring criticism among environmental groups of the leadership of the United States.
One major theme of these disputes is the demand by developing countries to be compensated for any curbs on their use of their natural resources. The United States has resisted such demands, and aides to Mr. Bush had advised him against going to Rio for fear that he would come under pressure to sign agreements deemed objectionable.
 
Patent Protection Cited
 In explaining why the President would not sign the treaty for preserving species, the State Department said the text was "seriously flawed" because it failed to give adequate patent protection to American companies that would transfer biological inventions to developing countries.
The State Department also said the United States had concerns with how money for putting the treaty into effect would be disbursed.
Lastly, the United States said it disagreed with the treaty's attempt to regulate the safety of genetically engineered products that would be used in developing countries. The State Department said it did not believe such products pose an environmental threat.
"In every negotiation, no matter how important the subject matter, the actual outcome must always be considered," the State Department said. "The United States does not and can not sign an agreement that is fundamentally flawed merely for the sake of having that agreement."
Scientists and ecologists have warned for more than a decade that the rate of extinction of plants, animals and microbes is accelerating as pollution and the destruction of forests and other habitats take their toll. The United States and other nations had expressed great interest in developing an international treaty to provide protections because new medical, agricultural and industrial inventions also would be lost as species vanished.
Many of the world's medicines were developed from plants. Many genetically engineered food crops expected in the future will incorporate genes collected from plant and microbial species in the tropics.
Countries that signed the treaty on May 22 in Nairobi committed themselves to developing programs to conserve the diversity of biological resources, set up protected habitats and restore habitats that had been destroyed or degraded by industrial development. The treaty called for the signers to meet periodically to review progress, but it did not specify how much money the richer countries would provide to the poorer ones.
The Administration said it was skeptical of the treaty long before today's announcement, provoking criticism from environmentalists and foreign leaders. In what was seen as an effort to deflect still more criticism, the President presented the new United States-German plan for the world's forests during a speech on Monday at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., just outside Washington.
The proposal on forests follows the broad outlines of a plan for improving management of the world's forests that Mr. Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl introduced in Houston nearly two years at an economic summit meeting. The new proposal has been prepared with the help of Mr. Kohl.
"There is no time to present something for signature at Rio," C. Boyden Gray, the President's counsel, said in an interview. "The hope is to elevate it above what else will happen in Rio and get it on a faster track than it has been for resolution sometime soon."
Like the other issues to be discussed at the Earth Summit, the forest initiative is certain to become embroiled in disputes between industrialized and less developed nations over a country's right to control its own resources. Malaysia, an important exporter of tropical hardwoods, has resisted proposals that would limit cutting.
"If this initiative helps break the negotiating log jam on forests, then it would be very useful," said Rafe Pomerance, senior associate with the World Resources Institute, an environmental research group in Washington.
The proposed treaty will offer ideas to slow cutting and burning of the world's tropical forests, develop improved methods of reforestation and encourage an approach to harvesting trees that would insure that more trees are planted than cut.
The forestry issue was discussed in preliminary talks last year, when negotiators agreed that a draft treaty could not be agreed on in time for the Earth Summit. Instead, they agreed to work for a statement of principles on forests at Rio, laying the groundwork for subsequent negotiations on a draft treaty.
Plans for even a set of principles have run into problems, however, with heavily forested nations expressing opposition.
Along with the Administration's decision not to sign the biological diversity treaty, European leaders and many environmentalists in the United States have expressed dismay over the Administration's successful effort to thwart aggressive measures to set limits and deadlines for emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas linked to global climate change. Instead, the United States negotiated a treaty that aims at, but does not require, reductions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
 
U.S. Eases Restriction
 Just two weeks ago, five Cabinet-level officials voted to exempt the Government from the Endangered Species Act and allow cutting of 1,700 acres of Oregon forests that are home to the threatened northern spotted owl. The same day, the Administration introduced legislation to cut roughly four million acres of ancient forests in the Pacific Northwest. It is unclear how the international treaty Mr. Bush plans to propose would affect the management of forests in the United States.
Ecologists say the world's forests play a central biological role in maintaining the Earth's environment. They are the Earth's lungs, taking in carbon dioxide and then separating the carbon for storage as plant tissue and releasing the oxygen. Forests also provide habitats for hundreds of thousands of species of plants, animals and microbes. They hold the soil, filter water, nurture soil and provide wood for industrial uses and fuel.
Forests, especially in the tropics, are disappearing under saw and fire. Scientists estimate that about half the forests that covered the developing world in 1900 have vanished, an area roughly the size of the continental United States.
Deforestation contributes more than 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere each year, according to a study by the World Resources Institute, adding to the 5.8 billion tons produced by burning coal, oil and natural gas.

HEADLINE: Helping 'Deadbeat Dads' Get Jobs and Pay Support

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.,

 BODY:
Fourteen men sat in a room, leafing through the classified ads with varying degrees of enthusiasm, poring over a tip sheet of companies that might have openings, calling to set up job interviews.
Each man had children with a woman who receives welfare. Each was unemployed and thousands of dollars behind on his court-ordered child-support payments. And each was here by court order, getting help with the search for a job. 
 This quiet scene at an adult education center in Wyoming, Mich., a suburb of Grand Rapids, represents the newest front in the battle against welfare dependency: extracting more from absent fathers.
 
Future of Welfare Change
 " 'Get from the mother and get from the father' is the trajectory on which welfare reform is moving," said Ronald B. Mincey, an expert on poverty at the Urban Institute in Washington.
But that will take more than enforcement of child-support laws, as the experience of the men in an experimental jobs program here demonstrates.
These fathers seldom fit the stereotype of the "deadbeat dad" as a prosperous divorce who lives in style while his former wife and children struggle for necessities. Many are poorly educated, have spotty work experience at best and can compete only for low-skill jobs with commensurate wages. Some have records of criminal activity or drug abuse.
Most need help in finding work, some need prodding even to try. And all have had to confront a recession and a long-term decline in real wages for low-end work.
Larry Price was one of the men calling prospective employers from the Wyoming Community Education Center. Thirty-nine years old, with seven children including six by his ex-wife, Mr. Price is supposed to pay $108 a week. But he has not had steady work for four years, and he owes the state tens of thousands of dollars.
"Sure, this program is voluntary," he said, smiling. "You come here or you go to jail." Still, he added: "It's a good thing. I do want to take care of my kids."
Mr. Price said he has gone through job-search programs six times in recent years without finding a position. Despite his previous disappointments, he said, this time "I've got a feeling I'll find one very soon."
The experimental program here, called "Parents' Fair Share," is one of nine around the country, including one that has just started in Trenton, for fathers of children on welfare. It was developed by the Manpower Development Research Corporation, a nonprofit organization in New York that studies social programs, with Federal and private financing.
Enrique Garcia, 33, appears to be an early success story in the program that began here April 27. He had fallen far behind in his $70-a- week obligation for support of three of his children, and owes more than $10,000 in back payments.
Mr. Garcia, who was laid off from a automotive shop three years ago, recently started working as a machinist with a local company in an on-the-job training position arranged through Parents' Fair Share. As an enticement to the employer, close to half his $6 per hour wages for the first six weeks will be covered by Federal money, with the presumption that he will be kept on without subsidies.
"To tell the truth, if it weren't for this program I'd still be unemployed," said Mr. Garcia.
 
Paying the State
 As is now customary throughout the country, his child-support obligation of $70 a week is being withheld from his paycheck and sent to the state. In keeping with Federal law, the state passes on to the mother only $50 per month from his support payments; the rest is used to help offset the cost of her welfare grant and to whittle away at Mr. Garcia's child-support debt.
But the hope is that eventually mothers will, through a combination of their own work and child support, gain enough income to get off welfare. In that case they would receive the entire child-support payment, a potential lifeline for independence.
Mr. Garcia, who said he was eager to support and stay close to his children, enthusiastically took up his new position even though he was discouraged by the wage level, which he considered far below what his experience and skills warranted. But he said, "Nowadays that's the only way you can get your foot in the door someplace."
 
Building Self-Esteem
 Parents' Fair Share starts, like many jobs programs, with two weeks of classroom discussions that aim to build self-esteem, teach interviewing skills and help participants develop a resume and search strategy. The men spend the next three weeks trying to set up interviews.
If that does not land them a job, officials help them decide whether they need basic schooling (many are high school dropouts), more extensive vocational or on-the-job training or other help. The cost per participant for these initial five weeks runs to several hundred dollars, while job training can cost several thousand dollars more.
In the most crucial innovation, the courts suspend child-support obligations while the men are in the program. In the past, many men refused to go into job training because they would continue to pile up child-support debt during their months of study.
As another inducement, the program offers men help, in cases where the level is clearly unrealistically high, in reducing their weekly child-support obligations. It also includes a peer-support group in which confused young men thrash out the challenges of fatherhood and are encourage to keep close relations with their children.
 
Sorry Track Record
 New programs like Parents' Fair Share must be measured against the generally sorry track record of job assistance for men like Mr. Price and Mr. Garcia. An earlier program here that offered job-hunting aid to men who owed child support received acclaim. But success in this field is a relative concept.
In the earlier program, from September 1988 to May of this year, the court referred 4,649 men to the training center. Most simply did not show up. Of 1,570 who enrolled, 566, or one-third, found work.
Of those, only 310, or one in five of those who joined the program, were still employed 90 days after starting work, at jobs that paid an average of $6 an hour.
Officials in Grand Rapids hope that Parents' Fair Share, with the extra inducements and closer assessment of participants' needs, will have a higher success rate. Signs in the first month are encouraging: two-thirds of the 50 men sent by the court so far have shown up, 7 have already landed jobs and 2 have gone into training programs.
 
Tracking Down Fathers
 The fathers in Parents' Fair Share have all acknowledged paternity of their children, or have been forced to. Many other unwed fathers have not declared their paternity or been caught by the courts, and so have escaped legal child-support obligations altogether.
But now, backed by tightened Federal laws, local officials are trying more aggressively to establish paternity and require payments. And in response, some young fathers, fearful or bewildered, dig themselves into a hole as they try to avoid or ignore an increasingly efficient collection system.
Reginald Battle, an unemployed 23- year-old with a 3-year-old boy, said he had received a letter informing him of support obligations a year after his son was born, but failed to go the hearing where the support level was set. Mr. Battle, who is supposed to pay $45 a week, has watched his debt build up to $5,000.
Now he is part of Parents' Fair Share, and hopes to find a factory or food-service job. "This program is helping me to get more motivated, to get up early and to look for a job," he said.
 
Sapping the Will
 Some men say that the knowledge that support payments will be deducted from their wages, and that most of the money goes into state coffers rather than directly to the family, can sap the will to work.
"They take a lot out of your check," said Howard Pimpleton, 35, who owes $55 a week for a 12-year-old son.
Mr. Pimpleton, who has two other children by his current wife, made payments for years until he left his job as a bartender in a dispute with his boss. Now he owes about $4,000.
Mr. Pimpleton has been through job programs several times in the last 2 years. "I go places to apply, but it seems like they don't want to hire an ex-bartender," he said.
Nonetheless, he added, "Some people feel they are wasting their time in a program like this, but I'd rather be here than sitting in jail."
In fact, for the last two years the jails in Grand Rapids have been closed to child-support delinquents because of crowding. When that became known, the attendance rate in the earlier jobs program fell by half, said William D. Camden, the Kent County "Friend of the Court" who supervises the child support system here.
This fall, however, a new jail will open with room for delinquent fathers, something officials think will push more fathers to seek work more aggressively. In the meantime, though they face no immediate threat of jail, nonpaying fathers still face the specter of accumulating debt and future legal problems.
"There is a carrot and there is a stick, and I will tell anyone that both are important," Mr. Camden said.
But the relatively low wages many of these men can command will remain a limiting factor.
Mr. Price, sounding as if he was trying to convince himself, said he might take a job flipping hamburgers at the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour while he searched for a better position. But after his support payment is withheld, he said, "I'd have only $25 a week for myself."
Still, the new program will offer a useful alternative to jail for delinquent fathers, said Judge Robert A. Benson, chief judge of the circuit court in Grand Rapids.
"I can say, 'I can give you 45 days in jail or you go through this program,' " Judge Benson said. "If he shows up it gives me a good idea that he is sincere in trying to support his children. If he doesn't, it tells me he's not serious about his obligation."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Heads for Europe as City's Salesman

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins will embark tonight on a seven-day trip to Europe to drum up investment from high-tech and service-oriented companies there. The trip is also intended to improve the Mayor's standing with New York business leaders, 20 of whom will be accompanying him.
The trip to Britain, France and Germany represents an unusually strong personal appeal by a Mayor of New York for foreign investment, mayoral aides said, and reflects the thinking of the recently appointed Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, Barry F. Sullivan, who was instrumental in persuading Mr. Dinkins to take the trip. 
 Mr. Sullivan, a well-known banker who was appointed in March to mend the administration's sagging fences with business, said that attracting foreign companies was crucial to restoking the city's service-driven economy, which has been battered in the last three years by huge job losses on Wall Street and in financial services. He said he viewed the mission as "a good signal to the private sector that the Mayor cares."
Mr. Dinkins and his aides will hold seminars next week in London and Paris, where they will try to persuade middle-sized, service-oriented European corporations to locate their North American headquarters in New York, city officials said. The Mayor will try to play down the city's reputation for high crime rates and poor public schools, while selling its telecommunications networks, mass transit, tax incentives and soft real-estate market, officials said.
The Mayor will also speak at luncheons to local chambers of commerce in London and Paris and will meet personally with the heads of several companies that already have headquarters in the city but have sent signals that they are thinking of pulling out, Mr. Sullivan said.
In London, the Mayor's delegation will concentrate on communications companies and retailers. In Paris, the focus will shift to clothing design companies and department store chains that officials believe may be interested in New York. A final day, in Germany, will be devoted to meetings with large banks in Frankfurt and Hamburg.
Mr. Sullivan said he would also meet independently with investment banks in London and Hamburg in an effort to get foreign underwriters for short-term city bonds.
 
Luring Foreign Corporations
 Asked yesterday about the trip's purpose, Mr. Dinkins said it was important to build the city's tax base by luring foreign corporations.
"We cannot simply wring our hands and say Washington is not spending enough money," Mr. Dinkins said. "We've got to see what we can do."
Last night, Dinkins administration officials and City Council leaders worked to try to reach an agreement on a final city budget before the Mayor leaves for Europe.
The Mayor will be traveling with a delegation of about 20 local business executives headed by Preston Robert Tisch, the president of the Loews Corporation and the chairman of the New York City Partnership/New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The trip was organized by the chamber, which is paying for the Mayor and his aides. The executives accompanying the Mayor are paying their own way.
The success of the mission will be difficult to measure, because no one involved believes that the Mayor will return from Europe with firm commitments from corporations.
Ronald K. Shelp, president of the New York City Partnership, a group business leaders, said the seeds that the delegation plants might take months or years to come to fruition. Still, he said, many New York business leaders believe that foreign investment will be the engine that powers the city's economy in the 1990's, much as the boom on Wall Street did in the 1980's.
Mr. Shelp said getting the Mayor to travel with the delegation was crucial to its credibility and would raise the Mayor's image in the eyes of business leaders at home. For much of the Mayor's first two years in office, the business community has been sharply critical of the administration's handling of fiscal policy.
Mr. Sullivan said that while the Mayor will extol New York's advantages as a world financial center, he will not offer tailor-made packages of incentives to individual companies. "We will be doing more spreading of the gospel than specific deals," he said.
 
Mayor Meets Mayor
 Tomorrow the delegation is to arrive in London, where Mr. Dinkins will have a light day, touring a traditional open-air market and meeting with the Mayor of Westminster.
On Monday, Mr. Dinkins will meet with the London Chamber of Commerce and hold discussions with British business leaders. That evening he will meet with the chairman of British Airways, a large employer in Queens, and attend a reception at the United States Embassy.
The Mayor will meet Tuesday with Conrad Black, the publisher of The London Daily Telegraph who has expressed interest in buying The Daily News in New York. Separate meetings are also planned with Pearson P.L.C., a newspaper and magazine publishing company, and Barclays Bank, which has cut back its New York operations. Mr. Dinkins will also take time out to visit the Globe Center, a quasi-public program for AIDS victims.
On Wednesday, the delegation flies to Paris, where the Mayor will speak to the Paris Chamber of Commerce and attend a reception with Mayor Jacques Chirac. In the evening, he will join the French Tourist Office for a boat ride on the Seine.
 
Setting Up Factories
 In Paris, the delegation will have private meetings with J.C. Decaux, a maker of public toilets interested in supplying New York, and Hachette, a magazine publisher. The Mayor will also talk to several clothing design companies about setting up light factories in New York, city officials said.
On Friday, the Mayor will travel to Frankfurt and Hamburg in Germany for several meetings with bankers and local politicians. Taking a break from business, Mr. Dinkins will visit the Holocaust Memorial at Eckenkheimer Landstrasse Jewish Cemetery in Frankfurt to lay a wreath. The delegation will return to New York Saturday morning.
Those who will accompany the Mayor on trip include:
From the private sector, Bruce Mosier, president of Riverbank Realty; Edward Lewis, publisher and chief executive of Essence Communications; Reginald F. Lewis, chairman and chief executive of the TLC Group; Peter J. Johnson Jr. of Leahy & Johnson; George Avril, managing director of the American Stock Exchange London office; Keith Mackie, vice president of Barclays Bank of New York; Ken Huszar, senior vice president with Burson-Marsteller; Preston Robert Tisch, president and co-chief executive of Loews Corporation and chairman of the New York City Partnership; Serge Bellanger, executive vice president and general manager of CIC-Union Europeanne, International et Cie and president of the French-American Chamber of Commerce in the States; Robert B. Catell, president and chief executive of Brooklyn Union Gas Company; John D. Collins, partner at KPMG Peat Marwick; James H. Dowling, chairman of Burson-Marsteller; Peter L.

HEADLINE: U.N. Is Said to Be Ready On Yugoslav Sanctions

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 29

 BODY:
At least 13 of the 15 members of the United Nations Security Council, including Russia, appear ready to support tough economic sanctions against the Government of Yugoslavia when the issue comes to a vote on Saturday, diplomats said tonight.
They said that after a day of consultations, it appeared that four of the five Security Council members with veto power would support the sanctions resolution drafted by the United States, and that the fifth, China, would abstain. 
 A number of small changes will be made in the resolution as a result of today's consultations, the diplomats said. Food and medicine would be totally exempted from the embargo, and the United States abandoned its attempt to force Belgrade to relinquish Yugoslavia's United Nations seat and apply for membership again. Some Security Council representatives discussed the possibility of military action if Belgrade still refused to help end the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 
Backfire Is Feared
 Those diplomats said they feared that the trade embargo might only make the Serbian-controlled Belgrade Government more intransigent, encouraging it to press on with efforts to carve a Greater Serbia out of the ruins of the old Yugoslav federation.
If that happens, some Council members see themselves being pushed into threatening military action along lines already familiar from their experience with Iraq. When he urged Europe to join him in imposing trade restrictions on Yugoslavia 10 days ago, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was careful not to rule out military intervention.
So far, no one is going as far as President Turgut Ozal of Turkey, who called today for United Nations or NATO military action to stop the killings in Bosnia and Herzegovina and said Turkey, a Muslim country angered by Serbian pressure on Muslims in Bosnia, is ready to send troops.
Some members say the Security Council might authorize a naval blockade of the Adriatic ports of the former Yugoslav federation, which now includes only Serbia and Montenegro. Such a blockade, they believe, could serve to enforce a trade embargo and to frighten the Belgrade authorities into a change of policy by hinting at more serious military action to come.
The Iraqi crisis provides a clear precedent for such a blockade. In August 1990, the Security Council authorized countries with naval forces in the Persian Gulf to "use such measures commensurate to the specific circumstances as may be necessary" to enforce its trade sanctions.
 
U.N. Allows Show of Force
 Article 42 of the United Nations Charter permits "demonstrations" of military power to warn an aggressor nation that the Security Council is contemplating military action.
A second idea discussed informally by some Council members is for the United States and European countries to close the airspace over Bosnia and Herzegovina and threaten to shoot down Yugoslav warplanes and helicopters that might try to assist local Serbian militants fighting there. Once again Iraq provides the precedent, with the United States and its allies still flying regular patrols over a zone in the far north of that country that they have declared off-limits to Iraqi warplanes.
The Council has already asked the Secretary General to examine the feasibility of using United Nations peacekeeping forces to reopen Sarajevo airport for emergency relief flights and to guard humanitarian convoys.

HEADLINE: Florio Battles G.O.P. Again With 2 Vetoes

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 29

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio said today that he would use his second and third vetoes in two weeks to try to force the Legislature's Republican majority to amend two bills that backers say will help New Jersey keep jobs and business.
He was reluctant to veto the bills, Mr. Florio said, because "they reflect the need to do everything possible to help our state's business deal with the devastating effects of this national recession." 
 But he said that one measure, to extend the time that construction permits are valid, did not provide adequate protection for wetlands. Supporters of the bill, which extended construction permits granted since Jan. 1, 1989, until Dec. 31, 1994, said Federal law safeguarded environmentally sensitive areas.
 
Deciding What Is Taxable
 The Governor also vetoed a bill intended to address a 1990 tax court ruling that made items such as business machines subject to local property taxes, just as buildings are.
Mr. Florio said he wanted to protect municipalities and homeowners by amending the bill to address such traditionally taxable property as pipes, wires and storage tanks.
The New Jersey Builders Association said Mr. Florio's veto of the bill to extend permits "demonstrates a calloused insensitivity" to hundreds of thousands of the unemployed. The group's vice president, Patrick J. O'Keefe, said the measure would generate 40,000 jobs.
Environmental groups, including the Sierra Club and the New Jersey Environmental Federation, praised Mr. Florio's decision.
"Fortunately, the Governor took a look at this bill and found out what the Legislature didn't want to hear when they allowed the builders to bulldoze the bill through the process," said Robert A. Stuart, program director of the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group.
In his first face-off with the Republicans, on May 18, the Democratic Governor vetoed a bill to roll back the sales tax to 6 percent, from 7 percent, effective July 1. The Republicans overrode the veto three days later, the first time in a decade that a veto had been overridden.

HEADLINE: Ex-Soviets Road to Capitalism Hits a U.S. Bump

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
A half- dozen newly independent republics in the old Soviet Union, still fumbling their way toward free markets and fast food, received a bracing lesson in American capitalism today. The Commerce Department said they were selling uranium at unfairly low prices and proposed a punitive import tariff that would more than double the price.
The preliminary ruling, which will be followed by a final determination in early fall, was issued in response to complaints from American uranium producers. The decision puts the Bush Administration in the embarrassing position of moving to cripple exports from some of the most impoverished republics while the United States is rallying international aid for them and criticizing Western Europe for excluding goods from Eastern Europe. 
 Struggling to set up governments and find officials trained in Western economic practices, the republics made little effort to defend themselves in a case concerning one of their most important exports.
"These guys are pretty naive over there, and they have sort of a blind faith in the American system," said James C. Cornell of the Stamford, Conn., office of Nukem Inc., a German nuclear fuels trading firm. "They're just not equipped to go in there and understand what Commerce is doing. It's hard for Americans to understand."
The collapse of the ruble and poor living conditions mean that the republics' mining and ore processing costs are the lowest in the world, so that their export prices probably do cover their costs with money left over for profits, Mr. Cornell said.
Today's decision, which proposes a 116 percent tariff and requires importers to start posting bonds for this amount immediately, drew a blistering response from the republics' American lawyer in the case. "It appears that the left hand of our Government does not know or care about what the right hand is doing, and the net result is to the detriment of the taxpayers and electricity consumers of the United States and the people of the six new struggling nations," said Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., who was the chairman of the Republican National Committee through most of the Reagan Administration.
Current and former Bush Administration officials defended the decision as the unavoidable outcome of a highly litigious and technical process over which they have little control. A long succession of laws has progressively limited the discretion of successive administrations to influence the results of trade cases for diplomatic and national security reasons.
"Our dumping procedure is a quasi-judicial process," a Commerce Department official said. "There is no political influence."
If today's decision becomes final, as appears likely, then uranium prices on the spot market may nearly double from their current levels at $7.80 a pound. But much of the world's uranium is sold under long-term contracts between mines and electric utilities, especially in Asian and European markets. Uranium is used in nuclear power plants, but at the current price it accounts for a negligible portion of their costs.
In practice, the law still gives Administration officials a little flexibility over cases in which goods may have been dumped on the American market at low prices. Many decisions must be made on which costs to include in calculating production costs. But even with political influence, it is difficult to affect the final decision by more than a few percentage points, officials familiar with the process say.
The republics botched some Commerce Department forms and failed to file others, making a detailed cost evaluation impossible, forcing the department to follow the American producers' suggestion of assuming that the republics' costs were comparable to those in Britain, Canada and Namibia.
The republics have filed separate legal cases contending that they should be excused from the petition because the case began before the breakup of the Soviet Union.
One republic that may be hurt most by the decision is Kazakhstan, which only last weekend met American requests that it eventually destroy its nuclear weapons or transfer them to Russia.
Today's decision appears to hold virtually no political benefit for the Administration to offset the international embarrassment. After more than a decade of decline, the American uranium industry now employs about 4,000 people, most of them in rural Western states like Wyoming that are already solidly Republican.
Congress has taken virtually no interest in the case, in contrast to other trade cases that have drawn numerous letters to the Commerce Department from legislators backing larger industries in their home districts.
By law, American nuclear weapons use uranium mined in the United States. The big increase in United States imports of Soviet uranium for civilian use came with a reduction of bilateral tensions in the late 1980's.
 
Imports Soared Last Year
 Imports soared to $110.4 million last year from just $2 million in 1986.
The United States has enjoyed a rapidly widening trade surplus with the former Soviet republics, exporting $3.58 billion worth of goods to them last year and importing goods worth only $812.8 million. The uranium imports have kept the bilateral trade surplus from growing even faster.
The American uranium industry's trade association welcomed today's ruling. "The industry hopes that the department's action will restore some stability to the market, which has been devastated by this massive unfair trade," said Michael McMurphy, the president of Uranium Producers of America.
Uranium prices fell last year from $12 a pound to a low of $6.75 a pound in November as the foundering Soviet Union exported much of its production and stockpiles in a desperate bid for foreign exchange.
The Commerce Department found that Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan were exporting at unfairly low prices, while the other six former Soviet republics did not produce or stockpile uranium. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are the two biggest exporters, followed by Russia, Mr. Cornell said.
Uzbekistan, already one of the poorest republics, faces particular trouble now because it has little else to export, said Barnett R. Rubin, the director of the Center for Central Asian Studies at Columbia University. Kazakhstan, on the other hand, should be exporting large quantities of oil within several years as a result of last week's contract with the Chevron Corporation to develop the giant Tengiz oilfield there, he added.

HEADLINE: Corporate Profits Post Rise of 8%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
Benefiting from severe cost-cutting and moderately higher sales, American companies increased after-tax profits by 8 percent in the first quarter, as the economy at large grew somewhat faster than initially estimated, the Government reported today.
The profit figure, the best performance in four years, was the highlight of the Commerce Department report, which put growth at a 2.4 percent annual pace during the first three months of the year instead of the 2 percent pace estimated a month ago. 
 Three other gauges of profitability also posted strong gains, including a 9.9 percent jump from fourth-quarter 1991 levels for earnings derived from current production, as opposed to profits from asset sales or other nonrecurring transactions.
 
Stock Market Is Cited
 "There's been an enormous improvement in the profitability of firms," commented Gary Ciminero, chief economist for the Fleet Financial Group based in Providence, R.I. This, he and others said, is reflected in new peaks in the stock market, where investors like both the profits themselves and their implications for lower interest rates as companies are better able to finance expansion without having to borrow.
The profit and growth figures in the report today gave the stock market further encouragement, and the Dow Jones industrial average held well above the 3,400 milestone level for most of the day. But late selling pushed the average down to a close of 3,396.88, off 1.55 points. [Page 36.]
In a separate report today that also gave signs of a strengthening economy, the Federal Reserve found in its quarterly survey of loan officers that demand for business and consumer loans "generally strengthened" over the latest three months. [Page 34.]
The Commerce Department's upward revision in gross domestic product was considered satisfactory even though most analysts had expected an even larger advance. The data did, however, prompt some analysts to trim estimates for the current quarter since inventories were not reduced during the winter as much as had been thought.
The President's top economic adviser, Michael J. Boskin, called today's report "good news -- further demonstrating a return to a pattern of solid economic growth." He dismissed the fact that the revised G.D.P. fell short of what had been anticipated, pointing rather to recent improvement in the automotive sector that he said bodes well for employment and production in coming months.
 
Outlook to Be Revised
 Mr. Boskin confirmed the Administration's intention to make a "significant upward" revision of its estimate for 1992 G.D.P., now 2.2 percent on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis, to a figure thought to approach 3 percent.
The main factors in adding four-tenths of a point to the first-quarter G.D.P. rate were smaller reductions of inventories and an advance rather than a decline for business investment.
Inventories shrank at an annual rate of $26 billion rather than $33.7 billion, thereby swelling G.D.P. by $7.7 billion. For the current quarter, and later in the year, however, the effect will be negative, because the fuller shelves will need less restocking. Nonresidential fixed investment grew at a $2.1 billion pace instead of shrinking $1.9 billion, adding $4 billion to output.
On the other hand, exports were considerably less robust than first estimated, with the result that foreign trade represented a $1-billion-a-year drag on the economy instead of a $3.5 billion spur.
 
Inflation Rate Is Raised
 Other data showed that inflation as measured by the fixed-weighted index of prices paid by American residents ran at rate of 3.1 percent instead of the 2.7 percent reported last month.
The savings rate was 4.9 percent instead of 4.7 percent, despite the fact that personal consumption rose at an even faster pace, 5.4 percent, than first reported. Some analysts questioned the personal spending data in light of a sharp downward revision in retail sales for March, reported in mid-May.
The 8 percent rise in after-tax corporate profits, to a rate of $204.9 billion, was the biggest since an 11.1 percent gain in the first quarter of 1988, the department said. The 9.9 percent jump in profits from current production was the biggest since the second quarter of 1987, when the advance was 11.7 percent.
Other gauges showed profits before taxes rising 7.5 percent and current-production cash flow -- the internal funds available to companies for investment -- rising 4.8 percent.
Last year, corporate profits fell 4.6 percent, their third straight annual decline.
At the first-quarter pace, G.D.P. was $4,896,900,000,000 in 1987 dollars and $5,817,500,000,000 in current dollars, the report showed.
Despite the upbeat nature of many recent indicators, most analysts continued to predict that the recovery would remain subdued. "I don't see anything to suggest a dramatic acceleration," said Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.

HEADLINE: Demand for Loans Is Up, Fed Survey Finds

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
In a sign that the economy may be rallying, the Federal Reserve Board reported today that demand for business and consumer loans strengthened during the last three months.
 In contrast to the review in January, which found that business loans had declined, "the May survey revealed that, on balance, loan demand had generally strengthened over the prior three months," the Fed said after surveying loan officers. 
 Loan applications from small and medium-sized businesses seeking money for new investment or to finance inventory had increased, the Fed said.
 At the same time, consumers sought more credit, and banks were more willing to lend, the central bank said.
 "Loan demand is one of the signals of an improving economy," said David Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association. "The pickup in loan demand is mirroring a pickup in the overall economy."
While demand for credit grew, banks generally left credit standards unchanged.
 
Criticism and Response

 For more than a year, critics of the banking industry blamed banks for a "credit crunch," which they said was prolonging the recession, but banks rejected the criticism and said customers simply were not seeking loans.
 Demand for home mortgages picked up during the last three months, as did applications for home- equity and consumer installment credit, the Fed said.
 The central bank surveys loan officers at three-month intervals to measure loan demand and the requirements that banks set for approving them. The latest survey covered 57 banks controlling $965 billion of assets.
 A number of banks reported easing some of their credit standards for small businesses; none of the banks surveyed reported tightening credit standards for such companies.
 Only commercial real estate companies experienced a tightening of lending standards, and that by a handful of banks, the Fed said. Residential lending standards were basically unchanged.
 While demand for loans by large corporations changed little over the last three months, demand by medium and small businesses "strengthened noticeably," the Fed said.
 The loan officers said businesses, no matter what their size, most often wanted loans to build their inventories or to make new investments.
 Of those banks reporting weaker corporate demand, several said potential borrowers apparently were using other sources of credit like the capital markets.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls As Japanese Support Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled sharply lower on world currency markets yesterday after early waves of aggressive dollar selling by the Bank of Japan to support the yen.
Analysts said the Bank of Japan entered the market overnight during Asian trading hours and sold dollars for Japanese yen. The move was followed by statements that the Japanese authorities might seek an even stronger yen in an effort to address their country's growing trade surplus. 
 "The Japanese are coming under a lot of political pressure" to reduce the growing trade imbalance, said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the advisory firm IDEA. A stronger yen would make Japanese goods more expensive abroad while making foreign goods cheaper for Japanese consumers.
The dollar continued to fall when the market opened in New York, dropping nearly 2 yen from its Thursday close.
 
Data Are Disappointing
 Traders expressed disappointment with a Government report that showed the United States economy grew at a revised seasonally adjusted annual rate of just 2.4 percent during the first quarter. Even though the Commerce Department figure was up from an initial estimate of 2 percent and marked the fastest rate of growth in three years, expectations were for an even more bullish annual growth rate of around 4 percent.
"The Bush Administration and the Federal Reserve seemed to be indicating that the figure would be a dramatic increase, and the market was disappointed," Mr. Chandler said.
Trading was choppy, as many dealers were apparently reluctant to take on new dollar positions on the final trading day of the month.
In New York, the dollar settled at 127.60 yen, down from 129.50 yen on Thursday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 128.33 Japanese yen from 129.92 yen at Thursday's close. And in London, it fell to 127.75 yen.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8295, from $1.8060 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.8282 to buy one pound, more expensive than Thursday's $1.8050.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.6080 German marks, down from 1.6270; 1.4560 Swiss francs, down from 1.4770; 5.3990 French francs, down from 5.4630; 1,210.00 Italian lire, down from 1,225.00, and 1.2037 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2035.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.6055 German marks, down from 1.6275; 1.4540 Swiss francs, down from 1.4780; 5.3920 French francs, down from 5.4640; 1.8080 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8325; 1,209.75 Italian lire, down from 1,225.50, and 1.2049 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2042.
Gold prices were mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $336.40 a troy ounce, off 60 cents from Thursday. The Republic National Bank said gold slid 65 cents an ounce to a late bid price of $336.25.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $337.25 a troy ounce, from $336.45 late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Up on Modest Growth Outlook

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher and interest rates fell for the third straight session yesterday, as traders seemed to become increasingly comfortable with the view that the nascent economic recovery will be neither explosive nor inflationary.
Data released yesterday appeared to support that sense. 
 Despite a great deal of trumpeting last week from the White House, revised first-quarter growth figures showed the economy performed only modestly better in the first three months than the 2 percent rise originally estimated by the Commerce Department.
Last week Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, predicted the revised numbers would be "substantially" higher than the initial estimate.
 
'Isn't That Hot'
 "When he said substantially, I thought it would be a really big number, like 3.5 percent," one government-securities trader said. "But 2.4 percent isn't that hot, and it's not such a great harbinger for growth in the second quarter."
Maria Fiorini Ramirez, president of Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc., said the Commerce Department's revisions meant more inventories were left on shelves than previously thought.
As a result, Mrs. Ramirez said: "There should be less of an inventory buildup in the second quarter, assuming a modest pace of consumer spending. The bottom line is that second quarter growth could be weaker than expected."
In addition to the revised gross domestic product numbers, traders were also encouraged by survey results of purchasing managers in the Chicago region.
The overall survey showed that conditions in the manufacturing sector improved modestly in May. But the employment component of the index fell from April levels.
"Those two reports provided the excuse to hold on" to securities, the trader said.
 
New Economic Data
 Next week market participants will receive a raft of fresh economic data, including May employment statistics, which are scheduled for release on June 5.
Without predicting what those figures will show, analysts said they were encouraged by the market's positive reaction to reports this week that could have pushed prices lower.
"We have confronted a lot of challenges this week, from the report on Saudi Arabia's desire to push up oil prices to a healthy rebound in consumer confidence and stronger auto sales," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
Despite those reports, "fixed income investors seem to be very comfortable with the notion that the recovery will be sustainable, but will not pose a threat to the bond market," Mr. Sullivan added.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 10130/32 , up 9/32 , to yield 7.83 percent, compared with 7.85 percent late Thursday and 7.86 percent on May 22.
Among Treasury note issues outstanding, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at 10110/32 , up 6/32 , to yield 6.95 percent. And the 5 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 9929/32 , up 1/32 , to yield 5.17 percent. A week ago, those securities were trading at a price to yield 5.24 percent.
 
Short-Term Results
 Short-term Treasury bill rates rose slightly.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.68 percent late yesterday, up one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 3.82 percent.
In the corporate bond market, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette acted as lead manager for an offering of $122.5 million worth of high-yield securities issued by Reeves Industries.
The 11 percent 10-year senior notes are noncallable for five years. They were priced at $99.276 to yield 11 1/8.
The securities are rated Ba-3 by Moody's Investors Service and BB- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

Alan Bond Gets Jail in Australia

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, May 29

 BODY:
Alan Bond, who built a $7.6 billion fortune from scratch and financed Australia's 1983 America's Cup victory over the United States, was sentenced today to two and a half years in prison for fraud.
The entrepreneur, who is now bankrupt, "is a very, very debased citizen today," his lawyer, Ian Callinan, said in closing arguments to a jury in Perth District Court. "Those dizzy heights are gone." 
 Mr. Bond, 54 years old, was charged in connection with efforts to save the Rothwells merchant bank, which was hit by a run on its funds after the stock market crash in October 1987.
Mr. Bond was the central figure in putting together a $280 million rescue package. He negotiated a $12 million fee for the role of his company, the Bond Corporation, in organizing the bailout.
 
Didn't Disclose Fee
 Mr. Bond was convicted on Thursday of failing to disclose the fee to one of the rescuers he enlisted -- a longtime friend who invested $6 million. Rothwells collapsed in November 1988 with losses of about $200 million.
Mr. Bond received half the maximum sentence for the offense.
Last month, just after his divorce was made final from his wife of 37 years, he was declared bankrupt. He filed a financial statement listing personal assets of about $1 million, including a partly constructed 50-foot yacht.
Born in London in 1938, Mr. Bond emigrated to Australia with his family when he was 11. He made his first property deal at 22 using borrowed funds and quickly used the same strategy to make his first million at age 25.
At its peak, Bond Corporation Holdings Ltd. had interests in brewing, media, resources and property. It had a gold mine in Chile; the Heileman brewing group and mining interests in the United States, and the Channel 9 national TV network in Australia.
 
Owned a Van Gogh
 Mr. Bond's personal tastes were expensive. He bought Van Gogh's "Irises" for a then-record $53.9 million as the centerpiece of an extensive art collection. He also owned a pair of $10 million penthouses in New York and a corporate jet.
Mr. Bond rode out the stock market crash on a strong cash flow from his beer assets but continued to overextend. The Bond Corporation eventually ran up debts estimated at more than $6 billion.
He blamed the world economic slump, high interest rates and the fall in the price of nickel arising from the Persian Gulf war for his financial woes.

HEADLINE: Joseph Trerotola, Unionist, 82; Led Teamsters Unit for 26 Years

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Joseph Trerotola, who started as a milk deliverer and rose to power in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, died on Tuesday at St. Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y. He was 82 years old and lived in Yonkers.
He died of a heart attack, his family said. 
 Mr. Trerotola served for many years as first vice president of the international union. For the last 26 years he was also president of the Teamsters' Joint Council 16, with 150,000 members in the New York City region, and chairman of the union's eastern conference, with 500,000 members from Maine to the Carolinas.
He retired under pressure last fall to satisfy Justice Department officials who had accused him of failing to investigate other union officers for ties to organized crime. Mr. Trerotola denied having mob associations and vowed, "I'm not investigating anybody." He said the Government wanted him "to be a stool pigeon."
 
Knew the Union Ropes
 Mr. Trerotola had thrived in internal union power struggles. He served temporarily as president of Joint Council 16 in 1956 during a bitter court fight between two contestants for the office who were supported by rival factions headed by the international president, David Beck, and by James R. Hoffa.
Mr. Trerotola was responsible for one of the teamsters' most vivid images when he was the host of a lavish 1986 party with tables laden with fancy food and drinks for thousands of union delegates at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.
The high point came as he and Jackie Presser, the teamsters president, were borne into the room reclining on an imperial chariot wheeled by men wearing the costumes of Roman soldiers while martial music played and the loudspeaker proclaimed "Hail, Caesar!"
Known as a calming influence, Mr. Trerotola helped New York locals settle various strikes, including walkouts by milk deliverers, fuel oil deliverers, United Parcel drivers and commercial trash collectors.
 
Social Concerns
 He also spoke out on political and social issues. In 1967 he reported that the city had lost manufacturing jobs and that welfare rolls had doubled in a decade. In a prophetic warning, he said those trends, coupled with expanded government spending, were a recipe for fiscal catastrophe. The city's financial crisis came to a head in 1975.
In 1977 he estimated that out-of-wedlock births in the city had doubled to 30 percent in a decade, a trend with social and fiscal implications. Another teamsters report that year showed that New York had the nation's highest state and local tax burden, sharply undercutting workers' take-home pay.
Mr. Trerotola is survived by his wife of 63 years, the former Anita Ranalli; a son, Vincent, of Greenburgh, N.Y.; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: To Help Itself, Utility Aids Riot Area

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 29

 BODY:
For the Southern California Edison Company, the response to last month's riots did not end when it finally got the power back on.
The utility, whose profits from selling electricity are directly dependent on the economic health of the Los Angeles area, saw that the unrest would be another blow to the long-term prospects of the region. The area was already being hurt by a severe recession and by a flight of companies and jobs to other states. 
 The riots also made clear to corporate leaders the severity of the city's social problems, giving Edison a troubling glimpse of what the future holds if nothing is done to give inner-city residents more economic hope.
So within two weeks of the rioting, the utility put together what is so far the biggest corporate financial commitment to improving conditions in some of the area's most blighted neighborhoods. The plan is to contribute $35 million worth of cash, buildings, labor and services over the next five years to create job training centers, support educational and charitable programs, and help businesses devastated by looting and arson.
"We as a company will be successful only if the region is vibrant, and the region will be vibrant and healthy only if companies like ours assume some responsibility for leadership," said John E. Bryson, the chairman of Edison and its parent company, SCEcorp.
Southern California Edison's response is an example of what government officials and economic development experts call enlightened corporate self-interest. If they are to succeed in building a stronger economic foundation for the poor neighborhoods of Los Angeles and other cities, those officials said, they will need to persuade many more companies to adopt that kind of attitude -- and then do more.
Government officials have long looked to corporations to play a greater role in shoring up schools, providing jobs and job training and financing charities and community development efforts. But perhaps never before have corporations been so directly challenged by government officials and community leaders to make a lasting difference as they have in the wake of the Los Angeles riots.
And although they express their thanks for programs like Edison's, government and community leaders ultimately want the business community to do more than make charitable contributions. They want companies to open factories, distribution centers and other operations in poor neighborhoods as a means of creating jobs for local residents and a strong framework for further economic growth.
 
Opportunity for Profit
 In return, they acknowledge that government must work harder to give companies greater opportunity to make a profit from their investments in the inner city. No matter how civic-minded, they said, no company will stay long in any area if it is losing money.
"Corporate America has to come together on a sustained, long-term basis to create opportunities that are money-making for them and that create jobs as well as real ownership possibilities for disadvantaged people," said Mark Fabiani, a Deputy Mayor of Los Angeles. "Anything short of that means failure."
Mr. Fabiani said a number of large companies had already offered to open new factories or other operations in the area to create jobs. But none have made public announcements, and Mr. Fabiani declined to identify them. He said that the companies, local governments and the privately financed Rebuild L.A. effort headed by Peter V. Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner, first wanted to study issues such as community support, tax breaks and low-interest loans that would give the companies a better chance of being successful in the long run.
"Our goal has to be to convince corporations that these investments are in their best interests, that they are essential to their interests," Mr. Fabiani said. "They have to know that the investments will be profitable and ultimately advantageous to their shareholders."
But Mr. Fabiani and others said it was unclear how many companies would be willing to make substantial investments in new operations in South-Central Los Angeles and other poor communities, especially once the publicity surrounding the unrest faded away along with the urgency of dealing with the underlying problems.
 
'Project for Marathoners'
 For every company that can identify a reason to make large-scale investments in improving the inner city, there clearly are many more that see little direct benefit to themselves in taking on the problems of security, insurance and an inexperienced work force by establishing some kind of permanent presence in a blighted area like South-Central Los Angeles.
"This is a long-haul game, a project for marathoners," said Jon P. Goodman, the director of the Entrepreneur Program at the University of Southern California, who has worked extensively in aiding businesses in the inner city. "What I am really waiting to see is whether, after the crisis, after the pressure of the recent events abates, they are still there, still rolling these projects out."
There are limits, in fact, to what even socially active companies like Edison are willing and able to take on, especially when it comes to actually creating new jobs in the areas that most need them.
Mr. Bryson said Edison would try to step up hiring efforts to some extent in poor communities. Yet Edison, which like many large corporations has been reducing its work force, decided it could not prudently make a commitment to hiring any substantial number of people in coming years from the neighborhoods affected by the rioting, he said.
Edison is instead concentrating much of its effort on job training programs. As part of its $35 million plan, it is allocating $6.5 million to developing such programs in Compton and Long Beach, two of the communities hardest hit by the rioting. In Compton, the company is donating an unused building it owns and will pay for it to be renovated and then finance the center's operations. The company expects the center to provide job training for hundreds of people each year.
 
Forgiving Utility Bills
 The company plans to contribute $7.5 million in cash, equipment and technical expertise to various charities, economic development efforts and community organizations, and increase by $500,000 the $2.25 million it had previously planned to spend on a program to help "at risk" students in local schools. To help owners of homes and businesses destroyed in the rioting, the company will forgive bills owed to it by those owners and will provide low-interest loans toward the purchase of energy-efficient equipment as they rebuild.
Edison will also make a multimillion-dollar donation to Rebuild L.A. And the company said it was still seeking suggestions from community leaders on how to spend an as-yet unallocated portion of the $35 million.
"As an electric utility, we have a network of wires, but also a network of people in all of the affected communities," said Robert H. Bridenbecker, Edison's vice president for customer service. "We're talking to leaders in each community to see what's needed."
For the most part, he said, the answers have centered on help in creating jobs and in improving education. But the company has also tried to address narrower and more immediate needs by soliciting employee suggestions.
Ed Robinson, an energy services representative in Compton, suggested after talking to many customers that Edison provide some employees to help small-business owners fill out the complex forms needed to apply for assistance from the Small Business Administration. He is also pushing for the company to help involve gang members, unwed mothers and other disenfranchised residents in deciding how to address the community's problems.
 
Key Is Involvement
 Economic development specialists say the key to any company's sustained efforts at community improvement is the involvement of employees. Edison executives concede that some employees oppose the spending of $35 million to address inner-city problems, especially at a time when the company is cutting employment. But over all, they said, employee support and involvement have been strong.
"I was around after the Watts riots in '65, and I saw a lot of Band-Aid solutions," said Bill Thomas, an area manager in Compton. "I see some of the things we are doing now as having positive long-term effects."

HEADLINE: Correction: The 1990 Census

 BODY:
An article yesterday about the 1990 Census incorrectly reported two statistics on disability in some copies. The fraction of people age 16 to 64 limited in mobility or ability to care for themselves was 10 percent, not 1 percent. The proportion of those 65 or older in this category was one third, not two thirds.
Charts about the Census also contained several errors in some copies. 
 Income growth from the 1980 Census to the 1990 Census for the metropolitan region was misstated. It was 18.2 percent for New York, 23.3 percent for New Jersey and 24.0 percent for Connecticut. The percentage point increase in the high school graduation rate in each state was also misstated. It was 8.5 points for New York, 9.3 points for New Jersey and 8.9 points for Connecticut.
On a front-page chart, the percentage of New Jersey residents who had moved into the state from another country in the previous decade was misstated in some copies. It was 5.0.
Maps accompanying various census statistics erroneously showed Arizona instead of New Mexico, and a map accompanying statistics about female-headed families with young children in poverty failed to show Nevada as one of the bottom five states.
In addition, a list of five states with largest percentage of dwellings lacking telephones included Arizona in some copies; it should have listed Arkansas. Because of a production error, the figures in that list were eliminated in some copies. The top five states were: Mississippi, 12.6 percent; New Mexico, 12.4; Arkansas, 10.9; West Virginia, 10.3, and Kentucky, 10.2. The bottom five were: Connecticut, 2.6; Hawaii, 2.6; Pennsylvania, 2.6; Minnesota, 2.4, and Massachusetts, 2.1.
A map shaded to show the range of English-speaking abilities was improperly labeled. It should have been labeled people who speak a language other than English at home, not people who speak no English.
Finally, a map intended to show the percentage of people born in the state in which they now live was shaded incorrectly in some copies. A corrected map appears above.

Father Aristide's Hebrew
The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the exiled President of Haiti, took more than a few Jewish organizational leaders by surprise yesterday when he addressed them in flawless Hebrew. 
 At a breakfast meeting in Manhattan sponsored by the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York, Father Aristide, a Roman Catholic priest, recalled that from 1979 to 1982 he lived in Israel and studied the Bible in Jerusalem. He added in Hebrew, "I may not remember everything I learned there but in my heart I always remember 'Love thy neighbor as thyself' " (Leviticus 19:18).
Referring to the Old Testament by its Hebrew acronym, the Haitian leader added: "In the Tanach we learn how we are one family with one Father. My friends, we all believe in God, and God for us is love and peace.
"The Jews can understand what is happening in Haiti. It is not hard for you. There is no shalom in Haiti. And you understand how important shalom is."
When President Aristide, who first spoke in English, finished his Hebrew remarks, Kenneth J. Bialkin, the president of the community relations council said, "Mr. President, you give us more credit than we deserve" in assuming that all the assembled knew Hebrew.
"But we all understand the words shalom and chaverim," Mr. Bialkin said, using the Hebrew words for peace and friends. The meeting, a breakfast attended by representatives of the 63 community and religious organizations that make up the council, was held at Mr. Bialkin's law office at 919 Third Avenue, between 55th and 56th Streets.
In his remarks, Mr. Bialkin said that the recent decision by the Bush Administration to turn back Haitian refugees to Haiti without giving them the chance to appeal for protection "produces very painful memories" for Jews. He recalled the boatloads of Jews fleeing Nazi persecution in the 1930's and 1940's that went "from port to port and were turned away."
Father Aristide would not be drawn into criticizing the new policy of the Bush Administration, which has supported his return to power.
As for the military coup that overthrew him last year after only seven months in power, he said he favored economic rather than armed action. "Let us continue to show how the power of love is stronger than the power of hate," he said.
 
Blue-Penciling the Archaic
 They are among the best known words in Christian prayer: "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name." But under a proposal by a Catholic commission that recommends liturgical changes, words like "who art" and "thy" would be edited out of the prayer as archaic.
Some Protestant denominations have already adopted the changes, as have conferences of Catholic bishops in other English-speaking countries, like New Zealand. The bishops of the United States are not expected to vote on the proposal until 1994. If approved, Catholics would say, "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name."
The changes are being proposed by the International Commission on English in the Liturgy, which makes recommendations for English-speaking nations. Changes are also being proposed for another central statement of Christian faith, the Nicene Creed. Instead of saying that Christ came down from heaven "for us men," the proposed translation would say "for us."
Translators say that the new wording is faithful to the authoritative Greek and Latin texts.
Msgr. Alan F. Detscher, associate director of the liturgy commission of the United States bishops, declined to predict whether the bishops would go along with the changes.
 
Lowering Its Sights
 The Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches, a mostly homosexual denomination, has temporarily abandoned its quest to be a full member of the National Council of Churches and is instead applying for observer status. The council is an ecumenical organization of more than 30 Protestant and Eastern Orthodox denominations.
The Universal Fellowship, which has 27,000 members in 265 churches around the world, first applied for membership to the council in 1981.
When a series of talks about the membership issue were canceled early this month by the national council, the denomination decided to make observer status its goal.
In the last year, Orthodox groups have threatened to withdraw from the council, saying they were unhappy with what they called its "liberal leanings." But the Rev. Kittredge Cherry, ecumenical director of the Universal Fellowship, said she believed the delays had resulted from "homophobia" within the member churches rather than the objections of the Orthodox.
The Rev. J. Martin Bailey, director of communications for the national council, said that "a complex number of factors" had led to a breakdown and acknowledged that one factor may have been a fear of homosexuals among some people. But he added, "I don't know anybody who is working harder than we are in the churches to eliminate homophobia."
Mr. Bailey said he could not immediately assess whether the denomination qualified for observer status, which would allow the group to attend meetings without the right to vote.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primary;
Enthusiasm Is Lacking On Ohio Ballot Choices

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, May 28

 BODY:
Ohio is so representative of America that some political analysts half-seriously say that Ohioans should nominate Presidential candidates in a single primary and be done with the long, noisy national campaigns.
But instead of having a leadership role, this bellwether state is holding a primary next Tuesday that is expected to draw fewer than a third of the state's voters and do little more than help shutter up the long primary season. 
 "How boring," Jerry Austin, a political analyst in Columbus, said of the primary and its wasted potential.
 
A Mirror of National Patterns
 Mr. Austin, who managed the Rev. Jesse Jackson's campaign in 1988, is one of those who wonders if it would not be easier to just let Ohio alone pick the nominees. After all, he said, the state has shown it is a microcosm of the nation by backing the winning Presidential candidate in every general election since 1964, and it has done so with voting patterns that were always within 2 percentage points of the national winning margin.
Presidential primaries are also being held Tuesday in Alabama, New Jersey, California, Montana and New Mexico.
Many Ohioans are showing more interest in Ross Perot's undeclared candidacy than in the uncompetitive primaries. Mr. Perot is the topic of so many political conversations here that some people seem to think he is on Tuesday's ballot. Although Mr. Perot is not on the ballot, voters in both parties' primaries will be able to cast write-in votes for him.
"Perot's going to do well, but I think he's too radical for this country," said Stephen R. Giesel, 41 years old, when asked about the Ohio primary.
 
A Choice of Primaries
 Mr. Giesel, a laid-off electronics engineer who is temporarily driving a taxi, said today that he would probably vote for President Bush on Tuesday, when voters will have a choice of voting in either the Democratic or Republican primary. He said he would not vote for Bill Clinton, who appears certain to be the Democratic nominee, because the Arkansas Governor reminds him too much of former President Jimmy Carter and long lines at gasoline stations.
Expressing the dissatisfaction that many Ohioans feel with the choices available on the ballot, Gregory S. White, a 37-year-old antique dealer, said, "I'm probably going to vote for Hillary Clinton's husband."
Ohio, with its slowly diversifying industrial economy, is the nation's seventh largest state, and has an ethnically diverse population of 10.8 million people and a per capita income that tracks the national average.
As in most other states, economic worries top the list of voter concerns here, even though Ohio has weathered this recession better than many other places. In April, Ohio had an unemployment rate of 6.9 percent, as against a national rate of 7.2 percent.
"There is a lot of worry here in the state that is the nation's No. 2 auto maker," said Herb Asher, a professor of political science at Ohio State University in Columbus. "Akron's already lost the tire industry; Youngstown's lost the steel industry, and General Motors is talking about closing plants."
This week the Clinton campaign began buying some advertising on radio and television here in the Cleveland area, where 42 percent of the state's Democrats live, said Greg Has, state coordinator of the Ohio campaign. Supporters of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., Mr. Clinton's last remaining Democratic opponent, say they plan to broadcast one radio commercial in Cleveland.
The state's news organizations have concentrated on the Perot phenomenon and have given short shrift to the primary campaigns, said Jesse F. Marquette, director of the Survey Research Center at Akron University.
"Clinton made good policy speeches here last week that got almost no media play," he said. "Bush was in Ohio and didn't get much coverage. Perot hasn't been around or said anything, but he is getting all the media play."
Mr. Marquette helped put Mr. Perot's name in the news last week when he conducted a statewide voter survey. It found Mr. Perot and Mr. Bush in virtually a dead heat, 25 percent to 23 percent, with Mr. Perot holding the statistically insignificant lead. Mr. Clinton trailed far behind with 14 percent, and 36 percent of those surveyed were undecided.
To a certain extent, the Presidential primaries here have also been overshadowed by Congressional races. There are 19 districts now, down from the 21 that existed before the reapportionment this year.
Dozens of candidates are fighting for three seats opened by retiring members and there is a heated Democratic campaign in which an eight-term incumbent, Representative Mary Rose Oakar, who has been caught up in the House bank scandal, is being challenged by Timothy F. Hagan, a Cuyahoga County Commissioner.
Redistricting also created a race between two incumbent Representatives, Bob McEwen, 42, a six-term member, and Clarence E. Miller, 74, a 13-term member. Both are Republicans.
Senator John Glenn has no Democratic primary opposition and most polls show him well ahead of his likely Republican opponent in the fall, Lieut. Gov. Michael DeWine.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION;
TV Shouts 'Baby' (and Barely Whispers 'Abortion')

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
Scottsdale, Ariz., in the early Summer of 1962: children shout and race bicycles, Dad washes the car, Mom cooks supper and the cul-de-sac hums contentedly. It is the prime of Miss Sherri Finkbine, the popular local host of the "Romper Room" television show.
Then, overnight, Miss Sherri becomes an international scandal. 
 HBO's new film "A Private Matter" (which stars Sissy Spacek and has its premiere June 20) tells the true story of Sherri Chessen Finkbine, who took thalidomide to help her sleep in the first month of pregnancy, only to learn that European women who had used the drug were giving birth to severely deformed children. She told a reporter, intending to warn American women, and inadvertently drew a worldwide firestorm of condemnation, because she also announced she wanted to terminate the pregnancy.
"You know how it is," her boss hisses as he fires her. "We can't even say the word pregnant on TV, and you want to have an abortion and go on doing the show?"
It has been 30 years since the Finkbine uproar, and pregnancy now gets said, shown and widely promoted on television. But the word abortion is scarcely heard. There have been times, particularly in the mid-80's, when entertainment programming dealt with the issue, however timidly. But as the national debate over abortion has heated up in anticipation of the United States Supreme Court decision on Planned Parenthood v. Casey, it has become increasingly taboo on the small screen.
For a medium that so freely appropriates its plots from the news, prime time has worked unusually hard recently to sidestep one of the country's most headline-grabbing topics. "It has been probably the most troublesome issue that the industry has ever dealt with," says Kathryn C. Montgomery, author of the 1989 book "Target: Prime Time -- Advocacy Groups and the Struggle Over Entertainment Television."
The complexity of the questions raised by abortion as well as the volatile emotions it triggers make it a subject much more difficult for television to deal with than rape, alcoholism or cancer. "It's easy to do movies on topics like child abuse," says Alison Cross, who wrote 19 drafts of "Roe v. Wade," the 1989 NBC film that cost the network a reported $1 million in advertising, "because everyone knows what side they're on."
Scarcely a month after NBC broadcast "Roe v. Wade," the United States Supreme Court handed down its so-called Webster decision, signaling that the legality of abortion was in question, and entertainment television has since become all but silent on abortion. Ms. Cross, who received an Emmy for "Roe v. Wade," says: "The message is if you do a program about abortion, you will get good reviews. You will win awards. And you will lose money. This is a bottom-line business, not a policy-education service." Many producers have concluded it is easier not to bother.
The subject of abortion makes networks and advertisers so uneasy that on the rare occasion it has been mentioned on a show, characters twist themselves into elocutionary contortions rather than actually say the word. Even the razor-tongued Murphy Brown did not use the word during an episode about whether to continue her pregnancy.
"She would have used the word many times," said Diane English, the show's creator, "but I wanted a lot of people to watch, and certain words have become inflammatory and get in the way of people hearing what we wanted her to say."
"A Private Matter," along with last month's HBO documentary "Abortion: Desperate Choices," may be the most explicit treatment of the subject ever on television. But as Bridget Potter, HBO's senior vice president for original programming, observes: "We're not any braver than the networks. It's just that our economic basis is different." HBO, a viewer-subscription service, does not have to assuage sponsors.
The networks, however, are jittery not only about potentially offending viewers but also about the very real prospect of advertisers dropping out. In 1973, when CBS reran an episode about the first abortion by a leading television character, Beatrice Arthur as Maude, not a single national sponsor bought ad time, and 39 affiliates refused to broadcast the segment.
The "Maude" episode galvanized advocates on both sides of the abortion issue who believed that popular entertainment could make a powerful, persuasive vehicle for their positions. Anti-abortion leaders argued before the Federal Communications Commission that its Fairness Doctrine should cover entertainment programming as well as editorials and public affairs: Maude had the abortion on CBS, so they should have the right to reply on CBS.
They lost the case, but the networks took heed. The Fairness Doctrine itself was struck down in 1987; but after the "Maude" furor, the networks strove for balance, however strained, as a way of handling volatile subjects on entertainment shows. Many network executives and producers alike say that, as a result, the dramatic tension of some stories has been weakened.
 
The Left Jabs, The Right Counters
 When the networks do prepare abortion-related shows, broadcasters have two apparently contradictory goals: they hope ratings will jump because of the controversial subject matter, but they also hope to preempt controversy by representing all points of view in the script. By those measures, the networks have not been particularly successful. The ratings for "Roe v. Wade," like those of a much-publicized "Cagney and Lacey" episode in 1985 about the bombing of an abortion clinic, were unremarkable. And advocates on both sides generally remain displeased by the programs, even when they have been consulted on the scripts.
Because Hollywood tends to be fairly liberal, representatives from abortion-rights groups like the National Organization for Women and Planned Parenthood have been consulted formally and informally; on occasion, advance screenings have been arranged for them as well as for groups like the National Right to Life Committee. Abortion-rights groups may appear to have greater impact than anti-abortion ones because of their influence during the early stages of production. But conservative groups like the Rev. Donald Wildmon's American Family Association organize boycotts of a sponsor's products when a show concerns abortion, thus sometimes determining whether a network will agree to broadcast a show at all. The Freedom of Expression Network, an alliance of Hollywood-based groups, sprang up to counter right-wing boycotts with their own letter-writing campaigns.
"Whenever a show deals with abortion, you hear a roar from the anti-choice community," says Loretta Ucelli, director of communications for the National Abortion Rights Action League. "With episodes on clinic bombings, they don't feel as much a need to enter the fray, because they want to distance themselves from the violence and terrorism. But the more personal the choice for a character, the louder they object."
Anti-abortion groups, however, believe that reports of their power are greatly exaggerated. "People in Hollywood will tell you their shows are balanced," comments L. Brent Bozell 3d, chairman of the Media Reseach Center, a conservative watchdog organization. "But you'll never see a program where there's a serious discussion of abortion, and at the end the star decides to keep the baby because of her right-to-life position."
S. Robert Lichter, author of "Watching America: What Television Tells Us About Our Lives," notes that Hollywood has a long tradition of liberal-to-leftist politics. "Hollywood is so overwhelmingly pro-choice that they're willing to accept some loss of revenue to tilt a show in the direction of their beliefs. There may be more socialist C.E.O.'s on Wall Street than there are pro-life producers in Hollywood."
 
Ad Battles And Talk-Show Treatment
 Both anti-abortion and pro-choice groups face a struggle when trying to place commercials that deal with abortion. A smattering of ads from both sides have received air time. But the sensitivity of individual stations, which make the decision whether to broadcast an ad, and the requirements of the F.C.C. for extensive documentation and disclaimers, have largely squelched issue-related advertising.
The exceptions are ads for candidates for Federal office. Under F.C.C. regulations, television stations must broadcast political ads. Thus Michael E. Bailey, an anti-abortion candidate who recently won the Republican nomination in Indiana's Ninth Congressional District, broadcast commercials that featured photographs of dead, late-term fetuses.
 Besides news and documentaries, the only programs to address abortion with regularity are the talk shows, beginning with the taped abortion shown on "Donahue" in 1975. Those shows have been able to seize upon many permutations of the issue and revel in the raucous debate they engender.
 
The Plots Thicken, And So Do Waistlines
 When a character does have an abortion on a prime-time show, the reasons must be so compelling and numerous that viewers could hardly quarrel with her decision. On an episode of "China Beach," the character played by Ricki Lake got pregnant after a tender one-night encounter with a soldier who had a girlfriend at home. Her decision to have the abortion, which included the almost obligatory penalty of a near-fatal botch, was prompted largely by the knowledge that if she kept the child, she would have to return to the United States, thus abandoning her cherished tour of duty in Vietnam.
Increasingly now, when a character becomes pregnant, she avows her right to choose even as she chooses to keep the baby, as was the case with Susannah, played by Patricia Kalember, on "Thirtysomething," and Murphy Brown. Diane English concedes that once Murphy Brown got pregnant, she really had to have the baby. "If I went to CBS and said, 'I'd like Murphy to have an abortion,' it would have been a long, hard struggle, and I can't say whether they'd stand behind me."
In another plot twist, a character will have the baby but recite a tear-stained memory about having had an abortion years ago, as Lacey did on the abortion episode of "Cagney and Lacey." Perhaps the most circuitous plot was on a 1990 episode of "Roseanne": the star thought she was pregnant, restated her belief in choice but decided to have the baby, only to learn that the pregnancy was a false alarm.
Nowhere on prime time does pregnancy-related soul-searching receive the Gothic treatment that it does on daytime soap operas. "Writers will fall all over themselves to avoid an abortion," says Meredith Berlin, editor at large of Soap Opera Digest. "Miscarriage is a convenient out. So is falling down stairs or off a horse. Or a hysterical pregnancy."
Abortions are in short supply on the soaps, but the first one predates Maude's by almost a decade. In 1964 Pat Matthews, a character on "Another World," had what was referred to as an "illegal operation," a back-alley abortion that left her unable to bear children. The archvillainess Erica Kane on "All My Children" also had an infamous abortion, in 1973. Agnes Nixon, the show's head writer, says that that was the last time she presented the subject: "We do issues about which the public needs to be informed, and the public already knows plenty about abortion. We don't do something just to be controversial."
In the mid-80's a "Young and the Restless" good girl, Ashley Abbott, had what may have been the last abortion on a soap opera. What happened next, says Ms. Berlin, was emblematic of the genre's anxiety about the subject. "She had a total breakdown and went to an insane asylum. That was her punishment."
 
Topical Dramas In More Tolerant Times
 In the mid-80's, a handful of programs broadcast at least one episode on abortion. "Hill Street Blues" and "Spenser: For Hire" tackled the subject. The creators of "St. Elsewhere" made a point of having at least one abortion-related show during each of its six seasons. "We weren't trying to sell the American public a line of thought, but we wanted to raise the question from different angles without being preachy or political," says Tom Fontana, the show's head writer. "We always had the woman go through with the abortion, because her not having it seemed such an easy out. Of course in those years, we thought Roe v. Wade was safe."
But most of today's television series remain quiet. Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, the creator of the CBS sitcom "Designing Women," says she has not done an abortion episode because she didn't think she could "illuminate the issue in a more meaningful way than the press already had."
"Abortion is coming to such a head that we may have to do it," she says. "But it's tough when you're doing a comedy and people see that favorite character week after week and remember what happened to her."
Rosalyn Weinman, NBC's vice president of broadcast standards and practices, says that network caution about introducing topics like abortion on sitcoms is more than warranted.
"The paradox is that the issues that are the most complicated and compelling are also the ones that can offend," says Ms. Weinman. "The real terror is taking a serious issue and trivializing it."
 
 
 
MURPHY'S CHOICES
 If it were up to Vice President Dan Quayle, the distinctly unmarried Murphy Brown would never have had sex in the first place -- much less a baby. (In Mr. Quayle's vision of prime time, only people who are married -- to each other -- and animals on PBS should have sex.)
But by the time the Vice President tuned into "Murphy Brown," it was too late for the CBS series' creator, Diane English, to erase the infamous episode in which Murphy (Candice Bergen, in photograph) and her ex-husband indulged in a wild moment of passion (on her desk, no less). And although Murphy declares herself pro-choice in the episode in which she learns she is pregnant, abortion on a network prime-time sitcom was never really an option.
Oh, for the days of "Father Knows Best" and "Leave It to Beaver," when television was all apple pie and children whose families didn't measure up cried bitterly into their pillows and wished for parents like Ward and June.
Since those days are gone, here are some of the life style choices Mr. Quayle might have wanted Murphy to make:
* Discover the pregnancy was hysterical.
* Remarry her ex and bicker miserably ever after.
* Give the baby to her married co-worker Corky Sherwood-Forrest to raise, and take on the role of doting spinster aunt.
* Leave the baby on the Quayles' doorstep for Marilyn to bring up as a proper Republican.
* Marry Jerry Brown and take the family to Calcutta to work for Mother Teresa.
* Start the Hester Prynne Home for Unwed Mothers, providing shelter for the likes of Molly Dodd and Carla the barmaid on "Cheers."
* Make all of this season's episodes turn out to be a dream. -- Jan Benzel

HEADLINE: THEATER;
On Broadway, the Lights Get Brighter

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
On the night Los Angeles was burning down, I went to the theater in New York.
Earlier on that Friday, May 1, such a plan might have seemed quixotic. Wild rumors and sheer panic seized New York once television images of the South-Central rioting traveled east, and Times Square emptied out at midday. Outside the Marquis Theater, home of the supposedly indomitable "Man of La Mancha," a hastily assembled wall of plywood materialized, turning one of Broadway's most conspicuous houses into a bunker suitable for downtown Beirut. 
 But the burning of New York was not to be -- not this day, anyway -- and when I returned to the neighborhood at curtain time, the theater district was reawakening. The marquees on 45th Street were all aglow, and at "Guys and Dolls," my happy destination, a line of hopeful theatergoers waiting for cancellations stretched halfway down the block. To be sure, "Guys and Dolls" is not a panacea for what ails Broadway, let alone for the ills of urban America. But on that tense night, it seemed to loom particularly bright, both as a symbol of a troubled town's resilience and as the glittery centerpiece of what nearly everyone agrees is the city's most exciting theater season artistically in years. A nationwide audience will see what some of the excitement is about as that season -- or, more accurately, the Broadway half of the season -- is celebrated tonight on the Tony Awards show on CBS at 9 P.M.
Why has "Guys and Dolls" become what politicians would call the season's defining event, proving so popular that audiences will stop at almost nothing to see it? It's not just that Jerry Zaks's production of Frank Loesser's 1950 masterpiece is fresh and fun. "Guys and Dolls" has touched a nerve because its very subject is a fantasy Broadway, both honky-tonk and cultivated, that perhaps never actually existed (except in the imagination of Damon Runyon) but that everyone keeps hoping will somehow be reborn. To believe in "Guys and Dolls" is to believe that such a rebirth is actually in the wings. And to believe that Broadway is coming back is to fantasize that New York is coming back from recession and decay, to believe that this city can solve its many problems without the riots that consumed the rival metropolis on the other coast.
These are romantic dreams, of course, and may well be shattered at any moment. Though a good Broadway season no doubt helps Manhattan's tourist trade -- no small part of the city's economy -- New York City cannot be saved by good theater alone. And the survival of good theater no longer depends in any case on Broadway, which generally imports its best plays from Off Broadway and institutional theaters throughout the country rather than create them from scratch. Yet one can watch the Tonys with a reasonably full heart tonight. Broadway's economic comeback, though not nearly as solid as the street's publicists would have us believe, is for the time being something more than an illusion. The theater district is, after all, full of booked theaters, some of them occupied by serious plays, when only months ago the landscape was defined by dark marquees, long-running English musicals and the eternally previewing and ultimately doomed "Nick and Nora." What's more, the artistic quality of the season was, if anything, even higher than tonight's undoubtedly hyperbolic Tony rites will reveal.
The Tonys will undersell the achievements of the season because this is the first year in ages when there were actually more worthy nominees in most categories than there were slots to be filled on the ballots. The four best- play contenders -- Brian Friel's "Dancing at Lughnasa," August Wilson's "Two Trains Running," John Guare's "Four Baboons Adoring the Sun" and Richard Nelson's "Two Shakespearean Actors" -- are all at the very least honorable choices, and so would have been such non-nominees as Herb Gardner's "Conversations With My Father," Alan Ayckbourn's "Small Family Business" and, had the Broadway production not emasculated its anger, Ariel Dorfman's "Death and the Maiden." A larger, even more impressive list of potential best plays could be drawn from Off Broadway productions, all ineligible for Tonys: Terrence McNally's "Lips Together, Teeth Apart," Scott McPherson's "Marvin's Room," Donald Margulies's "Sight Unseen," Jon Robin Baitz's "End of the Day" and Caryl Churchill's "Mad Forest."
The actors nominated for Tonys tonight are sensational. I will not soon forget, among other performances, best-actor nominee Brian Bedford's pickled old 19th-century ham in "Two Shakespearean Actors" and best-featured-actress nominee Brid Brennan's dreamy release from domestic drudgery into nameless ecstasy while dancing to radio music in "Lughnasa." But such was the quality of acting this season, both on and off Broadway, that one could field a gala awards ceremony with slates of performers ignored by the Tonys. Indelible theatergoing memories are made of Christine Baranski talking compulsively to ward off the hidden anguish in a Fire Island beach house in "Lips Together," of Laura Esterman extending her spirit in unselfish love even as her body fails her in "Marvin's Room," of Spiro Malas rising from bitterness and defeat to grab what he really wants in the Depression-era Napa Valley of "The Most Happy Fella."
These and the season's many other outstanding performances are thrilling in part because the roles often are. As has been true for several seasons now, the American theater is being reinvigorated by a new generation of artists, especially writers and directors. Many of the season's most interesting playwrights are in their 30's -- witness Mr. McPherson, Mr. Baitz, Mr. Margulies and George C. Wolfe (the author of "Jelly's Last Jam") -- and the producers who are making things happen, particularly in the nonprofit theaters that originated most of the best Broadway and Off Broadway plays, are often no more than a decade older. The vitality of American playwriting right now is such that by far the most adventurous and talked-about new play in London, an epic, revisionist view of recent American political, social and sexual history titled "Angels in America," is the work of a 35-year-old New Yorker, Tony Kushner. Currently in repertory at the Royal National Theater, no less, "Angels in America" is nearly certain to be a focal point of the next New York season.
As Tony show watchers will see tonight, the explosion of youthful talent now extends to the American musical, a form that has been reeling for much of the last decade and without which an economically healthy Broadway cannot exist. In 1991-92, even the one British import nominated for best musical, Cameron Mackintosh's production of "Five Guys Named Moe," is a tribute (however sanitized) to an American jazz artist, Louis Jordan, conceived and performed by Americans. It is also the only negligible show in its category, and it may mark the end of New York audiences' infatuation with the West End esthetic that places Euro Disneyland gimmicks above content. (The environmental stunt of "Five Guys," comparable to the kittyland of "Cats," is an adjoining restaurant called Moe's into whose cash bar the audience is hustled at intermission.)
The other best musical nominees of the season, to be seen in excerpt on the Tonys tonight, are, if one chooses to look on the dark side, a repackaging of old goods. "Crazy for You" is fashioned from Gershwin standards, "Jelly's Last Jam" from vintage Jelly Roll Morton jazz, "Falsettos" from two one-act musicals that were seen Off Broadway in recent seasons. And certainly the past is on view in "Guys and Dolls" and "The Most Happy Fella," the twin testaments to the genius of Frank Loesser, which have been nominated for best revival.
But in my view all these musicals give one enormous hope for a regeneration of this indigenously American theatrical form. "Crazy for You" has, in Susan Stroman, the most imaginative new choreographer to reach Broadway since Tommy Tune (who a mere season ago was the only game in town in his field); she makes us hear and see some of the most familiar and beloved songs in the American repertory as if they were written just yesterday. Hope Clarke, the principal choreographer of "Jelly's," and Christopher Chadman, of "Guys and Dolls," are also likely to have big futures following their Broadway debuts as dance makers.
Mr. Zaks and Gerald Gutierrez, the directors of the Loesser shows, are both young men who bring their rich experience with contemporary American playwrights (from John Guare to Wendy Wasserstein) to bear on works that are usually not explored for their emotional reality. Their productions are not Broadway revivals in the way that dirty term has come to mean, but rethinkings of American classics by artists too young to have seen them the first time around. Instead of relying on the old tricks and familiar stars, these directors start from scratch and create new stars, most notably Faith Prince, the Adelaide of "Guys and Dolls."
What makes "Jelly's Last Jam" and "Falsettos" remarkable is that they bring the contemporary passions that inform many of the best new American plays to the musical theater. As conceived by Mr. Wolfe, "Jelly's" is the first black Broadway musical that can truly be described as African-American, in that it views its characters' identity (and their battles with racism) from within, rather than as merely an external matter of black-versus-white melodramatics. Mr. Wolfe's depth of vision, sophistication and honesty about his subject, reflected in both his book and his direction, also lead him to reinvent the musical's form. He doesn't merely pile on jazz and blues numbers and the tap dancing of the incomparable Gregory Hines for showbiz effect but seeks to uncover the ethnic and political meaning of the music, as well as the pain and sheer rage expressed in the dancing. That this show, thorny and (its last number excepted) uncompromising, is becoming a hit with an integrated public may prove an epochal event in Broadway's cultural history.
"Falsettos" is a much different piece in style and texture but a related breakthrough for the commercial theater in content. While homosexual characters are hardly new on Broadway, even in musicals, "Falsettos" presents its gay men and women from an intimate, adult perspective on their own individual terms, much as "Jelly's" does with its black men and women, rather than turning them into generic figures engaged in predictably symbolic battles with bigots. The characters' idiosyncratic specificity gives William Finn's songs for "Falsettos" a distinctive quirkiness, both musically and lyrically, that is as far removed from "I Am What I Am" in "La Cage aux Folles" as Susan Birkenhead's tough, ribald lyrics for "Jelly's Last Jam" are antithetical to those of Broadway's civil-rights-era musicals like "Raisin" and "Purlie."
The fate of "Falsettos" as a Broadway venture is unclear. It's a small-scale musical on a street full of blockbusters, and it deals in part with AIDS. That this moving, original show should have to fight for an audience is just one example of why Broadway, despite its current boom, remains a precarious venue for any attraction that does not have one of two commercial attributes -- big stars or a large dose of spectacle.
Of all the fine plays produced on Broadway this season, the only two now playing to anything like full houses are two of the most poorly received of the lot, both of which were largely (and justifiably) slighted in most Tony categories: Mike Nichols's candied version of Ariel Dorfman's "Death and the Maiden" and Gregory Mosher's musty revival of "A Streetcar Named Desire." They have big audiences because they have Hollywood stars -- including the Tony-nominated Glenn Close (for "Maiden") and Alec Baldwin (for "Streetcar") -- and all power to them. But even these two hits, like every other straight play on Broadway, were selling tickets at the half-price ticket booth by last weekend, and they will close the moment that their stars depart in August. Many of the other, starless plays on Broadway, no matter how many Tonys they win or how good their reviews have been, will have to fight to last that long. By Labor Day, give or take a couple of weeks, the two dozen current Broadway productions may have dropped to half that number, with most of the survivors being musicals. We'll be back where we came in, and the "Is Broadway Dead?" chorus will be sounded yet again.
Why do plays without stars have such a hard time of it on Broadway, even when they receive critical acclaim and prizes? In a word, money. Audiences who are paying Broadway ticket prices, now reaching $50 for plays and $65 for musicals, want a sure bang for their buck, and that means a known title, a known name above the title, a known quantity of dancers, singers, scenery and glitter. A "Falsettos" or "Conversations With My Father" or "Two Trains Running" does not fit this bill, and the younger or more adventurous audience that might take a flyer on such shows is often priced out of Broadway entirely.
That audience has not gone away, however. When prices are lowered from the Broadway norm, whether at the half-price ticket booth or through subscription series run by companies both competent (the Tony-nominated Lincoln Center Theater and Roundabout Theater Company) and not (the new and Tony-snubbed National Actors Theater), theatergoers will turn up -- for the classic and the offbeat. It's an audience that materializes nightly Off Broadway, which is why a "Marvin's Room" or "Lips Together" will run far longer than a comparable play produced on 45th Street. It's an audience that might yet be lured back to Broadway for daring, impossible dreams more visionary than "Man of La Mancha" if the theater industry could find its Lee Iacoccas or Ross Perots -- which is to say, reformist business minds as imaginative and revolutionary as its most inventive playwrights and directors.
This year's Tony Awards should be uncommonly festive, as befits the artistic health of the 1991-92 season. But there's still a long, hot summer ahead, both in the theater and in the city around it. If you want to know more about what divisions New York is facing at this moment, the play to see is not "Guys and Dolls" but Anna Deavere Smith's brilliant evocation of the people and forces swept up in last summer's Crown Heights riots, "Fires in the Mirror," at the Joseph Papp Public Theater. If you want to know the real economic state of the commercial theater right now, you must look beyond the lines at "Guys and Dolls" to consider that hit's struggling neighbors. No matter who wins the Tony Awards tonight, this has been an uncommonly winning season for American theatrical talent. But as a business Broadway remains, more unhealthily and nervously than ever, the oldest established permanent floating crap game in New York.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Just Whose 'Malcolm' Is It, Anyway?

 BODY:
"Malcolm X" is a film that didn't have to be made to be controversial. The project has been embroiled in controversy since it was launched in 1968. At that time, a screenplay by James Baldwin and Arnold Perl was commissioned by Marvin Worth, a producer who had acquired rights to Alex Haley's as-told-to "Autobiography of Malcolm X." Over the years, the focus of the controversy has changed. Initially it involved Hollywood's readiness to deal with Malcolm X. Later it concerned which phase of his ideological development to emphasize. Then it focused on whether a white director could capture Malcolm's complexity.
When Spike Lee actually began filming "Malcolm X" for Warner Brothers last year, everybody, it seemed, had an opinion about what was in store. Within the black community, ideologues and intellectuals of every stripe -- cultural nationalists and integrationists, buppies and revolutionaries, Five Percenters and Baptist ministers alike -- wondered aloud about Mr. Lee's right to portray the complex life of Malcolm X for the big screen. 
 In addition to battling critics like the poet Amiri Baraka, and amid reports of a conflict over Mr. Lee's insistence on a three-hour running time for the film, the director became engaged in a budget dispute with Warner Brothers. He also ran into financial difficulties. When Mr. Lee exceeded the film's $28 million budget, the Completion Bond Company, which insures investors against films going over budget, seized financial control and refused to approve further expenditures. In mid-May, Mr. Lee announced that prominent African-Americans -- among them Bill Cosby, Michael Jordan and Oprah Winfrey -- had responded to his appeal to donate money to save the film, which is now being edited.
But much of the hue and cry has been over who "owns" the image of Malcolm X, an image that evolved considerably. Here was a man who went from pimp, hustler and thief to defiant prisoner, black nationalist, and leading minister and propagandist for Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam. Then -- after a visit to Mecca -- in the year before his assassination in 1965 at the age of 39, Malcolm X became a profound humanist. So forceful and incisive in life, Malcolm has, paradoxically, become a cultural and political Rorschach blot for the generations who honor his memory. The result has been considerable discussion and soul searching about the black artist's "burden of representation," as James Baldwin put it, as well as about the film itself, which is scheduled for release in November.
One afternoon recently, at Mr. Lee's 40 Acres and a Mule Studio in Brooklyn, the film maker talked with Henry Louis Gates Jr., W. .E. B. Du Bois Professor of the Humanities at Harvard University and editor of Transition Magazine, about the making of "Malcolm X," and various other subjects -- among them, fact and fiction in films, his vision of Malcolm, his thoughts about black youth and the recent disturbances in Los Angeles. Here are excerpts from their conversation.
 HENRY LOUIS GATES JR.: The "Malcolm X" project has been in development hell for two decades. James Baldwin and Arnold Perl, David Bradley, Calder Willingham, Charles Fuller and David Mamet were attached to the project as writers at various points. What's the real reason this movie was never made -- until now?
SPIKE LEE: I just think the studios were scared of the film. And the rising popularity of Malcolm, coupled with the box-office appeal of Denzel Washington and myself, is what made it economically feasible for them to invest in the project.
GATES: David Bradley says the writers weren't fired because the scripts were wrong; they were fired because the story was wrong.
LEE: I would agree with that. Malcolm X was basically disputing the American dream. And if there's one thing Hollywood is about, it is selling the American dream. So Malcolm X is at odds with the images that Hollywood has always been about.
GATES: On the other hand, he is the American dream: the self-made man. His story is very much like Benjamin Franklin's autobiography or Booker T. Washington's.
LEE: Yes, but the story Hollywood chooses to tell is always John Doe's, Horatio Alger's. It's never been about people of color.
GATES: What do you think about the relation between the film and the facts? Any form of narrative history involves falsification or distortion to fit a narrative framework. But in the case of Malcolm X, there's an especially heavy political freight to carry. There was a taste of this in the controversy over the historical veracity of Oliver Stone's "J.F.K." While the "Autobiography" stands as a fundamentally truthful document, individual episodes are disputed or controversial. As a film maker, do you think that matters?
LEE: It does matter. That's something every film maker or writer has to deal with when dealing with someone who has lived. I think Oliver Stone's "J.F.K." is a great movie. And the most important question you have to ask is: What is the intent? Our intention is not to tear down Malcolm; for us, this is an act of love.
In those cases where we had to change names, change events or make three or four characters into one, well, I don't think that's distorting the Malcolm X story. You have to realize we're not making a documentary; we're making a drama. You can't include everything; some things you switch or turn around. But you always have to ask artists what their intent is. I know there are people who will say this film is false because Malcolm didn't do such and such, and Denzel is too light-complected; and even though he dyed his hair red, that's not the color Malcolm X's hair was. Those little things do not detract from the overall work. Let's look at the body of the film, the overall sense of it.
GATES: Is this a "Malcolm" for our time?
LEE: Viewers will have to make up their own minds. One of the reasons we've gotten static is that Malcolm was so many people. Everybody has their own Malcolm who is dear to them, and their Malcolm fits their own personal and political agenda. So everybody claims him in whatever period of life he was in at that particular time. All I can say is: I was the director, I rewrote the script by James Baldwin and Arnold Perl, and I will take full responsibility. I will say that this is the Malcolm I see.
GATES: Is Spike Lee's Malcolm the Malcolm before or after he went to Mecca?
LEE: We show them all. That's why this film is an epic. That's why it's three hours. We want to show the total evolution of what made him. We want to show the three or four different people he was along the line. People tend to have one view of Malcolm, but he had many different views over his life; he turned completely around several times in this life. We leave it up to the audience to pick and choose which one they agree with, but we want to show all the Malcolms.
GATES: Do you have a favorite?
LEE: I like them all -- even when he was a hustler. I can see what steered him that way, having seen the state commit your mother, the family broken up, your father killed. I try to keep him together as one person, and all these things, you might say, are spokes in the wheel that made him. I know for sure Warner Brothers is trying to stress the Malcolm after Mecca, when he stopped calling white folk blue-eyed mutant devils.
GATES: Does this post-Mecca Malcolm, this more embracing figure, appeal to you, given your own sensibilities?
LEE: Yes. I think Malcolm came to a point where he saw that we're all brothers.
GATES: You mentioned that Warners prefers a certain Malcolm. How did that manifest itself, and how did you deal with it?
LEE: They just make suggestions; I have final cut. I know what they're trying to get at. At the same time, they have a point. Because Malcolm post-Mecca is the Malcolm who evolved the most. That is not to negate what Malcolm did when he was in the Nation, aside from those theories that white people were grafted by the evil scientist Yakub, and that there's this wheel spinning above us that's going to destroy the world. Even in those days, he was speaking important truths about oppression and resistance, and at a time when no one else had the courage to say the things Malcolm was saying.
GATES: One way people attack you is to say that, in the end, you don't really have final cut.
LEE: I have final cut on all my films. That means I decide what goes in, what stays out of the movie. That's it.
GATES: What's your relation to the Nation of Islam? During one of the many controversies about this film, you were quoted as saying that a nonblack director like Norman Jewison wouldn't be able to do justice to the subject. By that logic, what about a non-Muslim director?
LEE: I think it's got to do more with race than religion. There was so much research that had to be done, and the people you had to speak to for the most part were black. I don't think they would have opened up to anybody white.
GATES: Why is the life of Malcolm, Spike Lee's Malcolm, needed right now?
LEE: It's needed for the same reason that Malcolm was needed when he was alive, and even more so today. One of the things that Malcolm stressed was education. Well, we're just not doing it. It's such a sad situation now, where male black kids will fail so they can be "down" with everyone else, and if you get A's and speak correct English, you're regarded as being "white." Peer pressure has turned around our whole value system.
GATES: I saw the results of a survey conducted in black Washington schools in which students listedthings they consider "acting white." One thing on the list was going to the Smithsonian Institution. I couldn't believe it -- when I was a kid, going to the Smithsonian was like going to Disneyland, or better. Then you realize that a certain amount of romantic black neo-nationalism is tied into this attitude we've been discussing. Is your movie going to counteract that?
LEE: You see Malcolm educate himself, you see him going through the dictionary, copying every single word and definition, A to Z. You see him striving to better himself, to educate himself, to talk correctly, to stop swearing and stop other people from swearing.
GATES: But there's a generation for whom Malcolm is purely a symbol, rather than somebody with substance.
LEE: That's something we hope to address in this film. You have to realize there's a lot of re-education that has to go on. I guess the first step is their wearing a cap or a T-shirt with a Malcolm X quotation. But hopefully that's only a first step. Then you hope that it starts to be more, and deeper.
GATES: Why do you think there has been such a resurgence of interest in Malcolm X, especially among black youth? You see "Malcolmania" in rap music, posters, baseball caps, a flood of new books and, of course, your movie.
LEE: Chuck D., with Public Enemy, and K.R.S.-One, with Boogie Down Productions, have to be credited with really giving black youth Malcolm through their lyrics. It began there, and it just started to build. Even more, though, the issues he talked about haven't gone away. Conditions have even gotten worse. That's why he's more popular now than ever.
GATES: What about the need for heroes? I think one reason Malcolm is so visible on the streets is the lack of heroes. Does your Malcolm emerge as a hero?
LEE: Very heroic. I think Ossie Davis put it best in his eulogy. He said Malcolm is our shining black prince.
GATES: Why are we seeing "Malcolmania" and not "Martinmania"? Why isn't Martin Luther King Jr. comparably appealing?
LEE: Well, Martin was more mainstream. The whole nonviolent, turn-the-other-cheek business just isn't getting anywhere in black America.
GATES: What was your reaction to the verdict in the Rodney King case and the ensuing riots?
LEE: This is definitely a wake-up call to the nation. And what has been sad for me is the insidious way that the media have been portraying this. This wasn't a case of random violence or a riot; a better word for me was a revolt or uprising. The media have tried to say this was the work of black thugs and gang bangers. But the fact is that everybody was looting.
The media want to give equal weight to the image of four black men pulling one white man out of his truck and beating him up, as they did to the image of Rodney King being beaten by the Los Angeles police. Ironically, the same videotape that allowed the four white cops to walk free is going to send four black men to prison. People are fed up. It only takes one spark to ignite a revolt. In L.A., the disparity between the haves and have-nots is astronomical. That's the difference between New York and L.A.
GATES: What should the government do?
LEE: Stop blaming this on welfare. They don't want to do anything really. They just want to keep us confined to the inner city, killing each other off with drugs and violence.
GATES: What audience is "Malcolm X" primarily directed toward. Are you trying to educate black America or white America? Given the complexity of the subject, can one film do both?
LEE: Yes, I think all my films have done both. I've always found it interesting to view my films as having two different audiences, one black and one white.
GATES: That's a hard balancing act to pull off.
LEE: It can be done. This film's about America, and all Americans can learn from it. Like Malcolm, we're taking a global view of this film: it's not just about the United States; we're thinking about the world. And there will be people who'll want to see this around the world.
GATES: Baldwin said that when white people attacked him, it got his blood up; but when black people attacked him, it made him want to cry. Could you talk about what it's like being trashed by black people?
LEE: I don't think that just because you're black, you can take the attitude that you're beyond criticism. For the most part, black people have been too lenient on black artists. If a black artist goes around doing stuff that we feel is an affront to the people of the race, we should stop buying their records or seeing their movies, or whatever. But we never realize our economic clout the way we should.
GATES: Still, is black criticism more painful than white?
LEE: I think Public Enemy said it best when they sang, "Every brother ain't a brother." You can't assume that because you're black and they're black, they're going to love your work. In the end you have to please yourself.
GATES: Film history is littered with flashes in the pan: the black message films of the 40's, Harry Belafonte in the 50's, the blaxploitation era of the late 60's and early 70's. What have you done to render yourself flashproof?
LEE: Flashproof means having a body of work. With "Malcolm X," that makes six films over the last seven years. We need to grow and to get better, because there's so much to learn in film making.
GATES: How do we keep the renaissance in black film making from being just a trend?
LEE: By trying to be the best film makers we can be, by learning the craft, by having a love of cinema. Not being in it just for the money, for the glory or the sexual conquests you can make when you're casting your films. It was a love of music that enabled Duke to do what he did. You've got to have that love of whatever it is you're doing. And you have to go and spend time in the woodshed. John Coltrane, Wynton Marsalis, they practice five, six hours a day. A lot of these guys making films today, they don't have any craft, and they're proud to say: "I didn't go to film school, I never made a film before." Most of the time it ends up looking exactly like that.
There are so many stories to tell. Hollywood -- for the most part -- is dried up. And our stories have not really been told. Think of all the novels that have still to make it to screen: "Song of Solomon," "The Bluest Eye," "Their Eyes Were Watching God." It's like virgin territory.
GATES: Critics talk about a Ford film, a Hitchcock film and so on. What will a Lee film be remembered for?
LEE: I want to be remembered for honest, true portrayals of Afro-Americans and for bringing our great richness to the screen.

Air-Conditioner Charges
 
Question: In August I signed a new two-year, rent-stabilized lease. It included a separate charge for "new equipment" and a rider requiring me to pay a $5-a-month charge for each window-mounted air-conditioner if I put them in. Is the air-conditioner charge legal? . . . Kenneth Lee, Manhattan
 
Answer: It probably is. According the Joseph D'Agosta, acting deputy commissioner for the Office of Rent Administration in the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, in certain circumstances landlords of rent-regulated units are allowed to add an extra charges to the rent for the use of tenant-owned air-conditioners.
If a rent-stabilized tenant pays for his own electricity and installs his own air-conditioner, the landlord is entitled to a $5-a-month fee for each air-conditioner that protrudes beyond the window line. This fee would apply to the use of most portable air-conditioners.
Tenants whose rent includes electricity and who use their own air-conditioners may also incur extra charges. The air-conditioner charge, which is set each Oct. 1, is based on the index of the operating costs for rent-stabilized housing in New York City. The current allowable charge is $18.57 a month.
 
Damage From Renovation
 
Question: I am the owner of a co-op apartment. With the permission of the co-op board, a neighbor has been doing a lot of construction and renovation recently. The constant hammering and pounding has caused some walls in my apartment to crack. There is even a hole in one wall now. Who is responsible for repairing the damage caused by the work, the neighbor or the co-op? . . . Isabel Kivy, Manhattan
 
Answer: Responsibility could fall on both the neighbor doing renovations and the co-op.
According to Ronald Sher, an attorney who specializes in real estate matters, the shareholder doing the renovation should pay for the cost of repairing damage done inside your apartment, like cracked plaster. But if the work has resulted in damage to any of the building's structural elements, like interior-wall supports, the co-op would be responsible for the repair work.
"Part of the specified area of responsibility for co-op boards," said Mr. Sher. "is to insure the structural soundness of their buildings, So if the renovation work caused structural damage, ultimate responsibility for repair work would be the board's.
"But I would also expect the board to seek compensation from the shareholder doing the work for any expense for these repairs."
Some boards require shareholders making renovations to sign indemnification agreements, before the work begins, to protect the co-op against the costs of repairing damages.
 
Late Fee in Co-op
 
Question: I live in a small, seven-unit, town-house co-op. We have recently had two unexpected assessments in two months, which came to $5,000. I paid my share 10 days to two weeks late. I was charged a late-payment penalty, which usually is charged only for late maintenance bills.
My late payment did not cause the co-op to incur any extra charges. Is it legal for the co-op to charge for late payments if they do not result in costs to the co-op? . . . Eleanor Kairalia, Manhattan
 
Answer: Yes. The board has the legal right to impose fees on shareholders for the late payments of assessments as well as for late-payment on maintenance fees. The financial impact of the tardy payment to the co-op would not be a factor in the board's ability to enforce late payment rules. The right to impose late fees has withstood court challenges.
Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives, said that some co-ops are willing to be flexible on late charges in certain circumstances.
"Most boards recognize that unexpected assessments, particularly ones that are close together, can be hardships for shareholders," she said. "If the board was notified in advance of the financial problem of the shareholder, it might have made an exception on the late payment charge, if the shareholder was able to pay part of the assessment on time."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living in: Port Chester

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD

 BODY:
LIFE was sweet in the village of Port Chester when the Life Savers plant was operating there. In its heyday, it pumped out four million packs a day of the "candy with the hole in the middle."
Mayor Peter Iasillo said that while growing up he could always tell what flavor was being made. "The smell would permeate the entire town," he said. 
 When the plant closed in 1984, it threw the village into a commercial decline that it is still struggling to overcome.
"I remember when this was a bustling village," said Goldie Solomon, vice president of the Port Chester Historical Society and a 44-year resident of the Westchester community. "After industry left, they tried to replace it with urban renewal, but that didn't work out too well."
Today, the village has a somewhat mixed character. On the one hand, it has some of the most beautiful housing in the county. Stately Tudor, colonial and Victorian homes, all built before World War II, sit on spacious lawns on tranquil suburban streets. On the other hand, parts of the downtown are run down. And the Life Savers plant was just the last in a long series of industries to leave.
For years, officials have been predicting a revival, bolstered by a series of development projects. But most have been stalled by the real estate malaise.
The only successful one was the refurbishing of North Main Street in 1987. The street was widened and lined with 80 saplings. Overhead wiring and utility poles were removed, and replaced with 49 Victorian-era lamps, each with four globes, creating one of the most dramatic night-time scenes in the county.
South Main Street, with its tangle of overhead wires and rundown storefronts, is still waiting for its makeover. The Robert Martin Company, Westchester's largest commercial landlord, is planning a $250 million project for Main Street, Westchester Avenue and the waterfront by the Byram River, including a 315,000 square-foot shopping center, 660 apartments, a 20-screen movie theater and a waterfront park with a promenade.
This project got its first approvals back in 1986, but was held up until the right commercial tenants could be found. According to Robert Weinberg, chairman of Robert Martin, "Significant leases are now in the process of being drawn."
One of the leases, he said, involved the movie theater, the project's linchpin. "The theater will bring in people from all over," Mr. Weinberg said. "And then all kinds of different stores will come in to take advantage of that market."
Another ambitious project, proposed by Trammel Crow Developers, involves the building of 400 waterfront rental apartments on Long Island Sound. "We'd like to create a New England town appearance with small clapboard buildings that blend into the topography there," said Thomas Ferrell, director of development. The plan is still preliminary and has yet to be approved by the village board.
"Five years from now, you won't know Port Chester," predicted John Boyle, president of the Port Chester/Rye Brook Chamber of Commerce. "Lately, I've been hearing more good things than ever before. I'm cautiously optimistic."
That optimism has not carried over to home sales. Real estate agents say selling activity in almost all areas has been slow. "The only really active category right now is in houses in the low $200,000's," said Susan McDonnell, sales associate with Coldwell Banker in nearby Rye. House prices in the village top out at around $400,000.
"WE moved here because there were homes we could afford," said Teri Koenig, who came from Harrison, with her husband, Edward, nine years ago. They now feel they may have outgrown the village.
"It's a great place to get started," Mrs. Koenig said. "But if we're going to go up in price, I'd rather go elsewhere."
Port Chester is surrounded by some of the most affluent communities in the nation, among them Rye and Greenwich, Conn. Parts of the village are indistinguishable from those areas, except for the price of housing. "I have a listing now for a $429,000 house in Port Chester," Ms. McDonnell said, "that would be $690,000 in Rye. And it's the same house."
There are also many condominiums and cooperative apartments available at good prices, since they are not selling well at the moment. Most condos have amenities, such as a pool and tennis courts. And prices range from the mid- to upper-$200,000's for two- to three-bedrooms.
The old Life Savers factory is now a 198-unit condominium complex known as the Landmark. Because of the factory's peculiar design the apartments vary widely in size and design. Prices run from $150,000 for a one-bedroom unit to $180,000 for a two-bedroom.
Co-ops, mostly in converted mid-rise brick apartment buildings, are priced from $90,000 for a one-bedroom to $150,000 for the most deluxe two-bedroom.
Port Chester was originally known as Sawpits, because of a prevalence of saw mills in the area. In the 1830's, residents changed the name to Port Chester after Chester in England, the birthplace of many early settlers.
Two of the original settlement houses still stand. One, the Samuel Brown Homestead, built in 1740, is now a private residence. And Lyon Park, the home of Justus Bush, a New York City merchant, built in 1750, houses the Port Chester Historical Society. It is on the National Register of Historic Places.
The stock of historic houses and such landmarks as the Summerfield Methodist Church on King Street, built in 1828, is what attracted Lynn Mara, an artist, and her husband, Frank, promotions director for the New York Giants, to Port Chester. Two years ago, they bought a seven-bedroom white clapboard colonial, built in 1855.
"Being an artist, I'm endlessly fascinated by all the house's little details," Mrs. Mara said. She and her husband moved from Rye Brook, a more affluent community to the north.
Like many residents, they often shop at the Stamford Town Center, a 15-minute drive into Connecticut. The village itself, with about a million square feet of retail space, also has many shopping and dining options. Among the more popular restaurants are the Willett House for steaks and Bel Paeze for Italian food.
Unlike some Westchester communities, Port Chester has a racially diverse population. And Anthony Napoli, the schools superintendent, says racial balance in the elementary schools is his goal.
At present, the King Street and Park Avenue schools are predominantly white and upper middle class, while the Edison School has a largely Hispanic attendance, and the John F. Kennedy mostly black.
LAST fall, the district turned Kennedy into a magnet school, specializing in math and science. "We hoped to attract more white students, and it's worked to a degree," Mr. Napoli said. "It is now about 20 percent white. That's an improvement, but we still have work to do."
Mrs. Koenig, who is white and lives in the Park Avenue district, sends her 7-year-old son to Kennedy, where he is completing the first grade. "It's been great," she said. "He takes Spanish and art once a week, and he's reading above his grade level."
Next fall, all the elementary schools will be k-4. The fifth grade will move to the Port Chester Middle School to relieve overcrowding in the lower grades.
Rounding out the district schools is Port Chester High School, which has four science labs, a photography lab, a cable-TV studio, three computer centers and a 16,000-volume library. In addition. there are three Roman Catholic elementary schools, Corpus Christi, Our Lady of Mercy and Holy Rosary.
There are five village parks, with basketball and tennis courts, baseball fields, and children's playgrounds. The 22-acre Lyon Park is a popular picnic spot and has open-air concerts Friday nights in July and August.

HEADLINE: Talking: Relocation;
Companies Cutting Benefits

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
IN the heady days of the 70's and 80's, corporate employees could rely on their companies to pick up virtually all the expenses of a transfer to a different community.
Today, transferees will find a somewhat frayed welcome mat at their relocation department door as recession and business cost-cutting pare traditional expectations. Increasingly, employees are being asked to bear some relocation costs themselves -- a change that will force many to take a more active role in the move. 
 "We are seeing caps being put on all types of relocation benefits," said Chris Collie, executive vice president of the Employee Relocation Council, a trade group based in Washington.
Corporate officials defend the change by insisting that the cost of transferring an employee at a time of declining real estate values is proving steeper than anticipated. It now costs an average of $45,000 to move a home-owning employee, up from $31,000 10 years ago, according to the Employee Relocation Council.
Take, for example, the loss-on-sale benefit given to a transferee whose home has dipped in value since it was bought. This benefit alone costs about $15,000 an employee, reports Terry Portale, senior relocation specialist at Colgate-Palmolive Company. He saidthe figure can rise to $40,000 or more in the Northeast.
The biggest loss facing transferees will probably come from the refusal of their companies to buy their homes if they do not sell on the open market before the scheduled moving date -- a benefit known as a "buyout."
Ann Moore, vice president of William Pitt Relocation Corporate Services of Stamford, Conn., estimates that only 60 percent of the transferees she handles are being given buy-outs today, compared to virtually everyone years ago.
Starting in July 1990, USAir, which moves about 500 home-owning employees a year, began dividing them into two categories: Senior executives and those with special technical skills, who could still count on a buy out, and lower rank employees, who would have to make do with a "settling allowance" equal to two weeks' salary.
Other companies are making their buy-outs contingent on the transferee's doing more to sell the home before the scheduled move, said Karen Alpi, manager of the New York regional office of Home Buyers' Assistance Corporation, a national relocation counseling service.
To qualify for a buyout, said Ms. Alpi, the transferee may be required to establish a listing price that conforms to company policy, such as taking the average of three brokers' opinions rather than putting the house on the market at the highest possible price.
They also may be limited to a selling agent on the company's recommended list. And they may have to make cosmetic improvements along guidelines provided by the brokers and counselors. But these should not prove onerous, said Mrs. Alpi, being most often limited to removing clutter, getting rid of pet odors, cleaning or removing soiled or worn carpeting and painting a shabby room.
If they work for a company that prefers to use the carrot rather than the stick, they could actually end up with more, not less, money. Typical of this approach is A.T.&T., which is motivating its transferees to sell their own homes by offering a bonus equal to 3 percent of the sale price if they are successful. The bonus provides cash benefits of about $4,500 a family, said John Bemont, the company's relocation director.
SOME companies are also providing a "marketing allowance" of around $1,500 to pay for improvements such as painting or repairs or to subsidize a buyer's closing costs, said Susan Bankes, director of marketing at PHH Homequity of Wilton, Conn., which buys transferees' homes on behalf of their employers.
This option can be particularly valuable now because selling a home independently should bring a better price than a buy-out -- a result, say these experts, of a new method of buyout appraisals that factors in a possible further decline in market values during the period the home might have to remain in corporate inventory.
Another setback facing transferees is the retreat of employers from paying all the auxiliary costs of a move, such as house-hunting trips and temporary accommodations. In lieu of total reimbursement, the transferee is increasingly likely to be offered a lump sum.
Runzheimer International, a corporate relocation policy research company headquartered in Rochester, Wis., said that 36 percent of companies regularly involved in relocations have gone over to lump-sum allowances compared to 20 percent in 1989. It reports that the sum ranges from a low of $2,200 to a high of $15,000.
For transferees, this may mean cutting corners. But it might also mean cash to spare if a resourceful way can be found to pare costs.
Consider the experience of Kenneth McNeely, a lawyer with A.T.&T. who moved from Charlotte, N.C., to Atlanta last October. Given a $9,000 lump sum, he managed to end up with a $1,000 surplus by moving quickly into an apartment on a short term rental instead of spending weeks in a hotel.
He also saved on travel between the old and new locations by selling his Charlotte home in five days using the more aggressive marketing strategies recommended by the company.
Others may not always be so fortunate. The decline of automatic buyouts means that an increasing number of families are having to split up temporarily, with the spouse and children staying behind until their home is sold.
Still others are taking modest rented quarters in the new location while waiting for a sale. Should this happen, the family might consider the approach of an Atlanta couple with two school-aged children who came to Fairfield County, Conn., last year facing just such a predicament.
According to Ms. Moore, whose agency handled the move, the family felt it would be best to rent in the neighborhood where they eventually intended to buy so they could enroll their children in school right from the start. They did so, she said, and although it was a difficult period it proved to be the least disruptive way of handling the problem.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Semi-Custom Houses;
A Bid for Staten Island's Move-Up Buyers

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
TO find a location in New York City where a builder is producing semi-custom, single-family houses in a sizable subdivision it is necessary to venture to Staten Island.
There, on 7.3 acres where the Franzreb family ran a riding stable for 42 years, Tom Costa is developing 56 lots under the name Park Place North. Eighteen of them are reserved for brick colonial models that are priced from $350,000 to $500,000, or more when customers are inclined to greater luxury. 
 The rest, a more standard single-family house on a smaller lot, are on the market for $275,000 to $280,000. A model is nearly complete.
The land is off Clove Road near Bard Avenue in one of the prime residential neighborhoods of Staten Island's North Shore, close to Clove Lakes Park, the Staten Island Zoo and the city-owned golf course at Silver Lake Park. On the slope overlooking the golf course, Mr. Costa is offering sites for high-end homes.
It has not been easy. "I should have sold at least 10 customs by now," he said. Instead, only one is finished and occupied and two others are sold and in construction. Nevertheless, interest is stronger this year than last.
The Park Place North development illustrates the attempt by builders to reach for the move-up market during what may be a transitional period in home sales. Time has purged the new-home sales market of the product that was least salable when the recession struck, the small two-bedroom starter home, and builders have largely abandoned it.
But the key to builders' success will be the pace of resales this year. Most people have to be able to sell their current houses before they can buy a move-up house.
In 1986 and 1987, the market for starter houses was strong, said Philip Farinacci, who is building semi-detached houses under the name Palmers Run off Jewett Avenue near Forest Avenue on the North Shore. But when the recession struck, starter houses were the hardest of all to sell, he said.
"The trend is to stop developing town houses," said Thomas Maira, a broker with Daniel Master Real Estate, a large packager of land for builders. "Duplexes are more popular now. Builders are hounding me for duplex sites -- but not for 22 houses anymore. More like five or six."
Mr. Costa's presence at the site of the former Clove Lakes Stables is the result of another builder's problems. He is coming back to build on land he sold to a New Jersey group six years ago. The price was about $120,000 a lot, which is about the value of land for the lower-end houses today, he said.
BECAUSE of the market's decline, prices for house and land are down roughly 20 percent from three or four years ago, said Mr. Costa, who is the 38-year-old son of the late Joseph Costa, the builder of about 1,000 houses on Staten Island.
The stables property was originally sold by the Franzreb family in 1985 to another builder, Sal Surace. He subdivided the land into 66 lots.
Then he sold the property with the approved plans to Mr. Costa, who installed sewer and sanitary lines and resold it to the New Jersey partnership.
They started sales and construction, but ran into trouble. The Buildings Department stopped the job on the ground that the houses failed to conform to a new zoning law adopted for one- and two-family districts in northern Staten Island. The change came after a model was up and commitments accepted based on approved plans under the old zoning, Mr. Costa said.
Caught by this and other financial problems, the builders sold to still another investor, Michael Rottenberg. He drew Mr. Costa in as a co-venture partner.
At the time, Mr. Costa was building custom homes in the Annadale section of Staten Island under the name Park Place. These were imposing houses on lots of 100 feet by 100 feet. A five-foot brick wall along the street gave the development the look of "estate housing," Mr. Costa said.
A similar wall encloses the 650 feet of frontage of Park Place North along Clove Road. The backyards of the new lower-priced housing will abut this wall, illustrating one of the less desirable characteristics of several of the newer Staten Island residential projects along major thoroughfares: insensitivity to the vista from the street.
To build to the maximum permissible density, developers have sacrificed the opportunity to provide a better street-side shield for their developments. One effective way is to raise the land along the avenue side and provide heavy landscaping. That creates privacy and noise insulation for buyers, and a better streetscape for the public.
Instead, along such thoroughfares as Richmond Avenue, Ocean Terrace, Victory Boulevard and Hylan Boulevard, the backyards of new houses frequently run up to plain unattractive barrier walls at the sidewalk.
At Park Place North, the key change brought about by Mr. Costa and his architect, Jerome L. Grushkin Associates of Bulls Head, on Staten Island, was a reduction in house lots. With 56 lots instead of 66, the builder has provided for the 18 higher-end houses.
One of the buyers is Anthony Fiore, a 37-year-old officer at Canadian Imperial Bank in Manhattan. He bought a co-op in a high-rise called The Fountains across the street from Park Place North five years ago. Now he is trying to sell it for $60,000 while buying a new house for $430,000.
"This is one of the nicest areas on Staten Island -- suburban but convenient," he said. He commutes to midtown Manhattan on a city express bus that stops at his doorstep. The fare is $4 each way.
The other buyers are a couple, Philip and Donna Collins, with two young sons. They spent two years trying to sell through brokers a raised-ranch house in Annadale on the South Shore. They bought it new for $350,000 in 1987 and spent about $150,000 to improve it, Mrs. Collins said.
UNABLE to sell it through brokers, they took matters in their own hands, slashed the price and sold so quickly that they found themselves forced to move out before their new house was ready. So they have moved temporarily into Mr. Costa's model house as renters. Their garage is the sales office.
"We loved our old home," Mrs. Collins said, "but the problem was we always wanted a center hall." Mr. Collins is a financial broker.
After he refiled plans, Mr. Costa was permitted by the Buildings Department to complete 12 unfinished houses on the site. They were sold for $280,000 to $310,000 and are now occupied.
He also is building the remaining lower-priced houses under the new zoning. The effect of this zoning is to drive the builder to lower the garages within the house, which are approached from an inclining driveway.
Lowering them allows the garage space to be classified as a "cellar" rather than a "basement." Under the new area basements count as floor area but cellars do not. By taking advantage of the topography of the property to create living space in "basements" but garage space in cellars on the same level, the builder is able to provide a house with no loss of living space.
The houses, 28 feet wide by 40 feet deep, have 2,200 square feet of living space on two levels, plus the basement level and garage. They also have two entry doors, one at the front and one at the side. A buyer could alter space entered through the side into a private apartment, although this would be illegal under zoning law.
Nevertheless, "mother-daughter" houses are popular. Buyers often have a single parent or relative living in the downstairs space.
Financing for Park Place North has come from the Richmond County Savings Bank.

HEADLINE: Pressure Mounting to Restrict Boaters' Sewage

BYLINE: By States News Service

 BODY:
IF Federal regulators reject a plan by Huntington to restrict boat waste in the town waterways, town officials may have to choose between the baymen and the weekend boaters who flock to the bays and harbors each summer.
Huntington is one of six Long Island towns that face the closing of shellfish beds to baymen because of the pollution from sailboats and motorboats. The town is the first to propose a compromise that may keep summer boaters and the shellfish industry afloat side by side. 
 Town officials are proposing to the State Environmental Conservation Department that that the Federal Government declare Lloyd Harbor and the East Neck Coast Guard Basin zones where boat discharges are prohibited. Under rules of the Environmental Protection Agency, boats would be forbidden to dump any waste, even sewage treated with chemicals.
Huntington and the state hope to stave off requirements by the Federal Food and Drug Administration to make a choice between the summer boaters, many of whom contribute to the tourism industry, and the shellfishers, whose families have pulled their incomes from the bays and harbors for centuries.
There is no evidence linking the waste from sailboats and yachts that anchor overnight in bays and harbors to shellfish-related diseases, experts on both sides of the issue say.
But just the possibility of clams, oysters and other mollusks' ingesting raw sewage is too much of a risk, said David Dressell, chief of shellfish sanitation in the F.D.A. For that reason, he said, boating and shellfishing are incompatible.
For the towns, the problem is as much rooted in economics as in tradition. Long Island shellfishers received more than $27 million for their harvests at the docks in 1990, according to the Long Island Regional Planning Board.
Recreational boating brought in $42 million in 1990 in fuel, repairs and other activities, according to the Long Island Sound Taskforce, which commissioned the University of Connecticut to conduct a study.
The E.P.A. will decide whether to designate Lloyd Harbor and the Coast Guard basin as no-discharge zones, but the F.D.A. will have the final say on whether the zones can be enforced. F.D.A. officials say they are skeptical.
One researcher said the cost of such zones could be prohibitive.
 
Two Towns Step Forward
 Although Huntington is taking the first step toward a no-discharge area, other towns may follow. The state has targeted five other North Shore and East End towns for possible closures.
Southold and East Hampton volunteered last summer to eliminate overnight boat anchoring in shellfish beds. Parts of the West Harbor in Southold are closed to boaters, and East Hampton officials moved their anchorage area in an attempt to accommodate the baymen and the boats.
The Environmental Conservation Department is studying boating this summer in Brookhaven, Oyster Bay and Shelter Island. At stake are popular anchoring and shellfishing spots in Port Jefferson Harbor, West Neck Bay, West Harbor and Oyster Bay Harbor.
Boaters who enjoy the Sand Hole at Caumsett State Park will continue to anchor overnight there. The state refused to exclude the boaters, so the shellfish beds likely will be closed, according to the D.E.C.
 
Planning by the State
 "There are more demands that people put on our harbors and bays than they can accommodate," the state director of marine resources, Gordon Colvin, said. "Jet skiing, water skiing, sailing, swimming, fishing, harvesting shellfish. It becomes increasingly difficult to navigate all those activities without limit."
If the no-discharge zones are not approved by the E.P.A. or are rejected by the F.D.A., the beds at the Coast Guard Basin will close to baymen on Memorial Day and reopen in October. The Lloyd Harbor beds would close next summer, state officials say.
Baymen, boaters and marina owners are angry.
The president of the North Shore Baymen's Association, Charles Murphy, has raked clams out of Lloyd Harbor and other waterways for 30 years. The threat of losing the harbor and other prime areas to recreational boating infuriates him.
"There's more than 100 of us trying to make a living on the water," Mr. Murphy said. "Those months they are talking about are our prime months. We earn 65 to 70 percent of our income then. How would they like to be told that for those five months they won't get a salary?"
The North Shore baymen have contacted lawyers in Washington, who say they will go to Long Island to discuss suing the state if the shellfish beds are closed.
The commodore of the Greater Huntington Council of Yacht and Boating Clubs, William Saltzman, said he understood the baymen's fears, but believed that the boaters were being blamed for pollution that much more often comes from sewage overflows and agricultural and street runoffs.
"We as pleasure boaters are very annoyed over the fact we have become easy targets, especially when we contribute less than 1 percent of the waste problem," Mr. Saltzman said. "I don't know what the solution is. I really don't. Clammers have a bona fide interest. They are scratching out a living. But these boaters are not wealthy people by any means."
Marina owners are upset, too. The co-owner of the Coecles Harbor Marina on the eastern side of Shelter Island, Peter Needham, said the threat of closing the harbors to overnight anchoring could drive away an already diminishing business.
"The boaters I've talked to say they will just avoid the areas" that are closed, Mr. Needham said. Out-of-town boaters might not travel to Long Island, and local boaters may sell their boats, he said, adding, "If they close these areas, boaters don't see any reason to own a boat anymore.
"I don't doubt there is discharging by boats," Mr. Needham said. "But nobody has ever come up with a clear idea of what the potential is or if it even exists."
 
Harm to Boat-Related Businesses
 A lobbyist for the Empire State Marine Trades Association in Albany, Richard True, said he doubted that the proposed rules would drive away recreational boating, even if the no-discharge proposal fails.
"I don't think any of the towns intend to directly ban" overnight anchoring, Mr. True said. But he agrees that the perception that boaters were not wanted on the Island would hurt marinas and other boat-related businesses.
The association had its members sign an agreement to ban boat discharges in their marinas, and it is pushing for a state ban on discharges. The bill would require all marinas serving at least five boats to provide facilities to pump out sewage waste at the site or within two miles, Mr. True said.
He added that the no-discharge zone was the only acceptable option for the boaters and baymen. The E.P.A. has established such zones in Texas and California. Local authorities police the boats by locking the valves that would discharge any waste and by dropping dye tablets into their toilets.
A marine specialist working with the New York Sea Grant Extension Program, Jay Tanskey, questions whether the state or local governments have the resources to enforce no-discharge zones. "Right now the state doesn't have the manpower to manage the sewage-treatment plants," he said. "Are they going to have the manpower to go out and check all the boats? It's not going to be easy, and it's going to be expensive."
 
25,000 Boats in Huntington
 Town officials are sympathetic to the boaters but still want to preserve the baymen's way of life.
The Huntington Harbor Master, Harry Acker, said that 350 to 400 baymen earned their livings from the town waters and that 25,000 boats were registered in Huntington. If the the E.P.A. or the F.D.A. rejects the no-discharge request, the town will have a tough time deciding what to do, he said.
If Oyster Bay has to choose between the two, the town would most likely pick the baymen, said Town Supervisor Lewis J. Yevoli, adding, "It would be a tragedy if there were no oysters in Oyster Bay Harbor."
East Hampton Town Supervisor Tony Bullock said his town reached a good compromise by moving the boat moorings and prohibiting overnight anchoring in the shellfish beds. Yet he criticized the choice officials had to make.
"That's a very good goal, protecting the shellfish from contaminants," Mr. Bullock said. "But if some people just drop anchor for the night, that doesn't mean all the shellfish are suddenly contaminated.
"We're doing all the things we should do. We shouldn't have to decide if we should have a boat or a clam. It's too simplistic. It's not workable in the real world."

HEADLINE: Trying to Change the Way People Mow the Lawn

BYLINE: By TOM CALLAHAN

 BODY:
AS the familiar sounds of lawn mowers usher in a new summer season in Westchester, county and local officials are asking homeowners to radically change the way they mow their lawns in order to save both money and the environment.
A new recycling program, called "grasscycling," encourages people to leave grass clippings on their lawn after mowing. By mowing more frequently, program advocates say, homeowners can keep their lawns looking good and at the same time provide fertilization through natural methods. Most important, thousands of tons of grass clippings will be kept out of the county's overburdened waste stream. 
 The term grasscycling was originated by the Professional Lawn Care Association. The county received permission from that group to use the name.
"Westchester epitomizes the suburban ideal of green lawns with a manicured look," said James J. Hogan, recycling director of Westchester County. "But somehow we have to stop putting material like grass clippings at curb-side."
In 1990, 27,300 tons of grass was generated in the county, according to an October 1991 study prepared for the county by S.C.S. Engineering of West Nyack, N.Y. In total, the county study says, yard waste, which includes leaves and brush as well as grass, accounted for 109,200 tons of waste in the county.
 
Waste Taken to Peekskill
 Mr. Hogan estimates that much of that waste was being taken to the Charles Point Resource Recovery Plant in Peekskill for incineration. The plant there is limited by state law to burning 675,000 tons of waste yearly. By contrast, Westchester generates 900,000 tons of waste a year.
In addition to the environmental benefits, proponents of grass recycling point to the economic saving to taxpayers because less yard waste will have to be picked up and hauled away by municipal sanitation departments. While saying that it is difficult to gauge the exact saving under this program, Mr. Hogan said it has the potential to reduce county waste by 30 percent in the summer.
The county's program is modeled on similar efforts in Texas and Ohio. The Long Island towns of North Hempstead and Islip also recycle grass clippings.
Under the program, the county recycling office, with the help of a $350,000 three-year grant from the State Department of Environmental Conservation, printed 50,000 brochures to explain grass recycling. The brochure was prepared with technical assistance from the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Westchester County.
The idea of leaving freshly mowed grass on a lawn is not new but was often rejected by homeowners as unsightly and bad for the lawn.
"Everybody is interested in the esthetics of having a beautiful lawn," said Nancy Cook, senior horticultural consultant with the Cornell Cooperative Extension. "But they can also be taught that recycling will eliminate labor and costs. You may have to mow more often, but the labor savings come in not having to bag the clippings. The money saving comes in what you will save on fertilizer."
 
Savings on Fertilizer Costs
 Because every garbage bag of clippings is estimated to contain up to a quarter pound of usable nitrogen, residents can save about 25 percent of their annual fertilizing cost by letting the lawn recycle its own nutrients. Experts claim that recycling will also cut by 25 to 30 percent the amount of time spent mowing a lawn since there is no need for raking or emptying bags.
To recycle grass properly, homeowners should mow when grass is dry and three to four inches tall, never cutting it shorter than one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half inches. This builds up the lawn's root system and protects it against weeds and drought.
Westchester lawns are composed of "cool spring grasses." They grow most rapidly in the spring. Ms. Cook recommends mowing every five days during the spring and maybe once a week in the summer.
Alfred Krautter, owner of the Sprainbrook Nursery in Scarsdale, said golf courses have practiced this type of recycling for years, but many homeowners mistakenly feared that grass clippings caused the formation of thatch, a layer of decomposing organic matter on the lawn.
"Among those of us in the turf industry, there has to be an educational approach to tell people that recycling can be done and will work," Mr. Krautter said. "We have to change our way of taking care of our lawns. We have to do it in a more environmentally safe manner."
 
Aggressive Action in Cortlandt
 The town of Cortlandt is taking an even more aggressive approach by becoming the first municipality in the county to ban the curb-side collection of grass clippings. The decision was reached by the Town Board late last year and is now in effect.
"It was a twofold decision," said Richard McIntyre, Superintendent of Sanitation for the town. "First, it was environmentally sound, and second, it is economical. Taxes are foremost on everybody's mind. In order to set up these recycling programs with the same personnel, we had to streamline what we collected. We had to bite the bullet on this."
Mr. McIntyre said that his town, along with all other Westchester towns and municipalities, must step up recycling efforts in order to reach the state-mandated goal of recycling 40 percent of the waste stream along with reducing waste by 10 percent by 1997.
Public reaction so far has supported the ban. "Two out of three people who have called about it understand our need to recycle," Mr. McIntyre said.
Mr. Hogan of the County Recycling Office praised Cortlandt officials for their "progressive effort" and said the town is "moving in a direction that everyone will take eventually."
Murray Bodin, a resident of Hartsdale, said he has been recycling the grass clippings on his lawn for 30 years.
"I didn't realize the value of doing it when I started," said Mr. Bodin, a member of the county's Recycling Advisory Board. "It just seemed logical to me. It didn't make sense to take the grass off the lawn. But now grasscycling is a win-win situation. It is healthier for the lawn; it saves you money and at the same time does something to improve the quality of life on the planet."

HEADLINE: Did Insurers Abandon the Inner City?

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
As the rioting ebbed here, Kibok Yoo stared into the cave-like ruin that once had been her liquor store. Melted electrical cables hung like tendrils from a blackened ceiling. A lifetime's savings lay in heaps of ash and shattered glass. The rioters had destroyed the business that provided Ms. Yoo with $6,000 a month in income and the promise of delivering her 3-year-old son into a comfortable life in middle-class America.
But the greatest trauma to Ms. Yoo came in the news from her insurance agent: Her $280,000 insurance policy, it turned out, was written by a tiny, unlicensed company in the Caribbean. Like hundreds of other inner-city merchants, she had unknowingly bought from a gray market of policies sold widely in poor areas. She was shocked to hear that she might have to wait months or years to get money on her claim, if she gets it at all. 
 Several miles away in a battered neighborhood of South-Central Los Angeles, 65-year-old Robert Cunningham and his son stood guard with shotguns during the riots to protect the liquor store they have owned for 23 years. Like many small-business owners here, Mr. Cunningham said he cannot afford more than minimal insurance, and an hour's looting would have left his family penniless.
"I wouldn't have risked my life like that if I'd had insurance protection," said Mr. Cunningham, who is black. "Insurance is a giant weight on my back, and all of us in this area are climbing uphill."
Nearly a quarter-century after President Lyndon B. Johnson's National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders declared insurance "redlining" a crippling barrier to economic development in the inner city, many of the same problems persist. In more than a week of interviews, dozens of black, Korean and Hispanic business people throughout South-Central Los Angeles spoke with rage about what they charge is blatant discrimination and abandonment of poorer areas by the nation's large insurance companies. Their experiences in finding insurance vary greatly -- depending on the company, the type of insurance and the luck of the individual involved. Large businesses and chain stores seem to find insurance easily. Homes are easier to insure than businesses or cars.
 
The Lost Neighborhoods
 But the lack of insurance, the high price of insurance and the poor quality of insurance sold in the impoverished neighborhoods of Los Angeles, merchants and politicians say, have choked small business and with it the chance for economic life. And the riots could worsen the situation by raising prices or making insurance even harder to find.
The insurance industry strongly denies such charges. But in the aftermath of the riots, California's Insurance Commissioner, John Garamendi, has called for a change in insurers' treatment of the poor and for investment by the industry in poor neighborhoods, just as the banking industry was required to do by the Federal Community Reinvestment Act of 1977.
"I am convinced redlining exists," Mr. Garamendi said on a recent driving tour of blighted areas. "The bottom line is either you can't get or can't afford it. For the long-term growth of these communities, insurance is absolutely critical."
Insurance is crucial to small businesses in myriad ways. It allows them to obtain credit, lease equipment or order merchandise on consignment. An auto repair shop cannot get most referrals without fire and liability insurance. A liquor store, whose wholesale costs are determined by ability to buy in large quantity, may be limited if it cannot insure merchandise.
Spokesmen for the state's largest property and casualty insurers bitterly deny that the industry is "redlining," the practice of refusing to write insurance in certain neighborhoods. They say critics confuse the painfully high price of insurance in poor areas with discrimination by insurers. Prices are high because the risks are high, said Patricia Lombard, the executive director of the Western Insurance Information Service, a trade group representing a dozen major insurers. The high prices, she said, may lead consumers to buy cheaper policies from so-called non-admitted or unregulated companies or to go without it.
The industry, she said, cannot be held responsible for solving the problems of poverty. "We can't go in and make neighborhoods safe," Ms. Lombard said. "We can't make people feel good about their lives."
One piece of evidence that the industry is making insurance available in the inner city, she said, is a recent industry estimate that insurers will pay $775 million for damages during the riots. The claims, she said, were from large and small businesses. Neither the state, the city, nor the industry has data, however, on losses of uninsured or underinsured businesses.
Another indication that insurance is increasingly available from private insurers, the industry says, is that policies written by California's FAIR plan, a state-sponsored program that provides limited insurance to property owners who cannot find coverage elsewhere, has dropped 15 percent since 1987. And at least two regulated companies, the Crusader Insurance Company of Woodland Hills, Calif., and the Farmers Group of Los Angeles, have made aggressive marketing efforts in poor neighborhoods.
"Insurance is available and it is affordable," said Richard G. Donegan, the regional underwriting manager for the Allstate Insurance Company in Los Angeles. "We are committed to those communities."
 
Charge of Unfair Pricing
 Critics of the industry, including lawyers for Consumers Union in San Francisco, say one way insurers deter inner-city buyers is pricing. Instead of considering the risks of neighboring poor and affluent areas together, they say, companies consider poor areas alone, assuring high prices. They say it would be more fair to look at risks over larger areas.
One 28-year veteran of Allstate, who heads its sales office in downtown Los Angeles, said the company developed rules and a price structure designed to turn away inner-city businesses and automobile drivers. "Their actions speak louder than words," Brian Storey said of Allstate. "You will find it in every major city. It is not just Los Angeles."
Black and Asian insurance agents in the area, some of whom testified in state hearings last year, say many residents in South-Central Los Angeles and other poor areas do not have access to insurance from major companies because there are few agents there. One indication of the lack of access, the California Insurance Department says, is the high number of uninsured inner-city drivers.
That is one reason why, according to Insurance Department figures, more than 40 percent of drivers in poor, inner-city zip codes in Los Angeles County drive without insurance.
At least in the property-casualty area, the minority agents say, agents are scarce in the inner city because it is extremely difficult to get appointments -- or the right to sell insurance -- from major companies.
 
'A Gool-Ol'-Boy System'
 "They are not giving these appointments because they don't want to insure these people," said Barbara Glenn Miller, a black insurance agent who is vice president of the Alliance of Inner City Brokers and Agents, a trade group here. "I've been in this industry long enough to know it is a good-ol'-boy system."
Juno Eun, one of the few Korean agents who has appointments from several major carriers, says insurance companies often make it impossible for small businesses in poor areas to buy coverage by using ploys such as taking months to estimate the price of a policy. Rather than wait, they may buy unregulated policies.
Mr. Eun, a member of the board of directors of the local Korean Insurance Agents and Brokers Association, says the best indication of the unavailability of insurance is the present precarious situation of hundreds of Korean merchants. In his survey of 900 of the more than 2,000 Korean businesses damaged or destroyed by the Los Angeles riots, Mr. Eun found about 20 percent had no insurance and more than 40 percent had insurance from companies unregulated in the state, mostly off-shore companies.
The unregulated policies, while not illegal to sell in California and some other states, have been the source of widespread consumer abuse in recent years, the Insurance Department says. The policies are sold under a regulation designed to help consumers get rare or hard-to-obtain types of insurance. But in recent years, the department says, scam artists have entered the field, selling what seem like cheap policies in poor and immigrant communities. The Commissioner has recently taken legal action against several brokers selling such policies, and has proposed tougher regulation of unregulated carriers.
The industry says most of the non-admitted companies are honest and offer good services. But the Insurance Department says that off-shore companies have frequently turned out to have few assets and have disappeared suddenly without paying outstanding claims. In such cases, policyholders receive no protection from state guarantee funds.
Ms. Yoo, a 37-year-old Korean immigrant, was paying $1,600 a year to insure the liquor store on Centinela Avenue in Inglewood. Only recently did she discover, through her agent, that her policy was sold by a company with a post office box on Grand Turk Island in the British West Indies; no phone number was listed on the policy itself. After her store was destroyed by rioters, she said her agent told her that because of the riots, Pacific Fire and Marine might take as long as a year to pay. Her agent, she said, told her to accept whatever money Pacific offered.
"This was all my savings and income and now I need money to pay for my mortgage and food," she said. "My boy needs food."
Repeated calls to Pacific's office in Scottsdale, Ariz., reached an answering machine; the company did not call back. The Insurance Department said Friday it was about to order agents and brokers to stop selling Pacific policies after finding it had inadequate assets and reserves.
The agency that sold Ms. Yoo her policy said it had explained that it was from an unregulated carrier. A number of Korean-American agents said they sold policies from off-shore companies because they were locked out of the licensed market by the major carriers.
Spokesmen for major insurers, including Allstate, State Farm, and TransAmerica, said they do have agents in the inner city. They pointed to their losses in the riots -- tens of millions of dollars each -- as proof.
Mr. Donegan of Allstate, for one, said customers can simply look up the phone number of a company's nearest agent and call. He offered numbers of four Allstate offices near riot-affected areas, including that of Mr. Storey in downtown Los Angeles.
On a walk along Crenshaw Avenue, near the center of the disturbances, merchants still open among the blackened storefronts tell of their adventures trying to find good insurance and the price they pay for its absence.
Sherman Draper, the owner of Sherman's Bar-B-Que, said that in the last 10 years he has gone to agents as far as 30 miles from his store to find insurance. Mr. Draper now has a policy from an unregulated company.
"Most of the agents in the neighborhood just don't have insurance for businesses," Mr. Draper said. "If you ask the big companies for business insurance they tell you one thing or another until you get the idea."
A few blocks south, Gerald Hutchinson, the owner of the Crenshaw Body Shop, which his father founded in 1968, said that without extensive fire and liability coverage 90 percent of the cars he repairs would not be referred to his shop. Recently, he said, Crusader Insurance canceled his policy because he surpassed their limit on the number of cars he could keep on his property. Mr. Hutchinson said he called more than 20 companies before he was able to buy insurance from a Farmers agent miles away in more-affluent Santa Monica. He now pays $4,500 a year, he said, and can no longer keep up with the rising cost of liability insurance. He has had to give up six tow-trucks, and with them, nine employees.
At All Star Liquor, Mr. Cunningham says the high price of insurance in the area plays a critical role in his profit margins. His business, he says, is under severe pressure from Korean competitors who buy stock jointly to get lower prices. To compete, Mr. Cunningham says, he buys in lots that are as large as possible, but is limited because he cannot afford to insure the stock -- already he stores more merchandise than he can afford to lose. If he had cheaper insurance, he said, his prices would be lower and his business far healthier.
Although he believes the lack of insurance is often the result of redlining, Mr. Garamendi says he does not have enough evidence to prosecute. Many insurers, who say the state's first elected Commissioner is taking a tough stance because he is looking to run for higher office, accuse him of making charges without proof.
 
Incentives for Insurers
 Steven L. Miller, deputy commissioner, said the department was developing a plan to provide incentives for insurers that increase the number of policies they write in the inner city, under a formula that would allow for greater profit margins. Such a plan, the department says, may increase insurance prices outside poor areas. The Commissioner also said he will pressure the property casualty industry, with its hundreds of billions in assets, to provide capital for investment in inner-city areas.
The banking industry in the state has made billions of dollars available to homeowners and small businesses in underserved areas. Security Pacific, now a part of Bank of America, for example, has committed $2.4 billion over the last 10 years, said Selwyn Whitehead, president of the Economic Empowerment Foundation in Oakland, Calif., a group that pressures corporation to invest in poor areas. By contrast, she said, the insurance industry has made no such large commitment of capital to the state's poor urban areas.
Ms. Lombard of the Western Insurance Information Service, said insurance companies, unlike banks, do not make loans and are precluded by state regulations from investing most of their portfolios in stocks or high-risk business ventures. Insurers do help cities by buying municipal bonds, she said. And many companies provide charitable grants to people and businesses in poor areas.
"The business of banks is making loans," Ms. Lombard said. "Our business is selling insurance. And we do that."
 
 
 
GOVERNMENT OFFERS HELP, BUT ONLY SO MUCH
 As a result of the riots of the 1960's and the subsequent disappearance of insurers from many poor urban areas, Congress passed legislation in 1968 that helped 28 states create property insurance plans for people unable to get coverage in the private market.
The program in California, known as Fair Access to Insurance Requirements, or FAIR, has more than 113,000 policies in force for homes and businesses in the state.
The program, which is operated jointly by insurers doing business in the state, has significantly helped businesses and homeowners in inner-city areas get at least minimal coverage and access to bank loans. FAIR expects to pay out more than $40 million for 535 claims as a result of the riots.
But Steven L. Miller, the California deputy insurance commissioner, points to FAIR's limitations. FAIR policies are just as expensive as private policies for the same coverage in poor areas. Although FAIR provides property insurance, it does not provide liability insurance or business-interruption insurance. It also insures only the market value of a building, not the cost of replacing it. Because of the riots, Mr. Miller said, the department and the industry are discussing ways to improve coverage.
And the 15 percent annual drop in the number of FAIR commercial policies since 1987, while perhaps an indication of the wider availability of insurance in inner-city areas, may instead reflect the unknown number of people who have dropped insurance because they cannot afford it, department officials say.
It could also reflect purchases from the growing number of unregulated, off-shore companies.
 
 
 
WHERE OTHERS SEE RISK . . .
 Even some bitter critics of the insurance industry from poor areas of Los Angeles praise the Crusader Insurance Company. Since the tiny company in Woodland Hills, Calif., started selling policies in 1985, it has tried to carve out a niche by insuring small businesses, including those in the poorest neighborhoods.
While many large insurers believe that the worst risks are mom-and-pop operations in poor areas, Crusader made money with such customers. Cary Cheldin, the executive vice president, said its assets grew to $23 million in 1991, from less than $2 million in 1985, and that its underwriting each year remained profitable. Crusader, which is owned by the Unico American Corporation, a publicly traded holding company, has 7,000 customers, mostly minority-owned businesses in Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Mr. Cheldin and his father, Erwin, who founded the company, are white. "My parents were poor immigrants," said Erwin Cheldin. "Discrimination was everywhere and I hated it."
But the riots have transformed the Crusader story. The company suffered $20 million in losses and although reinsurance and tax write-offs will reduce losses to $10 million, it must now consider withdrawing from business or raising rates in poor areas.
The company's reinsurers say their actuaries expect one such riot every 15 years in Los Angeles. The result for Crusader, Mr. Cheldin said, could be price rises of as much as 30 to 35 percent.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Profits Are Growing, But Is That Enough?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Will profits catch up with the stock market?
That was the hope raised last week when the Government reported that after-tax corporate profits leaped 8 percent in the first quarter. The number was better than the seers expected and may reflect the benefits of all the corporate restructurings of the last couple ofyears. 
 The long recession in corporate profits started just as George Bush was preparing to be sworn in as president, well before most analysts figured out that an economic recession was coming. And while overall earnings seem to have turned up in the summer of 1991, it was not until Friday's report was released that things really seemed to be moving ahead.
For a while, it looked as if that increase in profits would spur the Dow Jones industrial average to a close above 3,400. But perhaps it was appropriate that share prices fell back late Friday. After all, if stocks could zoom while profits were stagnating, should they not slip when profits are soaring?
But another reason may have been the fact that corporate cash flow -- the money that companies have available for such uses as paying dividends, building plants and paying down debt -- is not rising quite as rapidly as the profit numbers would indicate. In the 1980's, particularly after the Reagan tax cut of 1981, cash flow rose much more rapidly than profits, and the stock market eventually responded. During Mr. Reagan's eight years in office, corporate cash flow rose by 78 percent, while profits climbed by just 46 percent.
As profits fell early in Mr. Bush's term, cash flow also fell, but at a slower rate. Unfortunately, when the rebound came, cash flow rebounded less rapidly, gaining just 5.7 percent in the first quarter.
As everyone knows, the lousy profit performance of the past few years has not dragged down stock prices. That may illustrate the market's confidence that earnings will improve, or perhaps it reflects such other factors as the relatively low rates of inflation and rapidly falling short-term interest rates. In some previous eras, notably the 1970's, high inflation and high interest rates depressed share prices despite rising cash flows.
In the end, however, the reason to own stocks is to share in corporate profits. And last week's fiasco in Centel, whose shares plunged 23 percent on the news the company would be acquired -- at a price far below what investors had hoped -- provides a reminder of how optimistic some market prices have become.
In the short run, higher share prices appear likely. There is a lot of cash sitting in mutual funds and short-sellers have stepped up their activity to levels that sometimes precede sharp market rallies.
But in the long run, a big gain in share prices is likely only if Friday's report of rising corporate profits is followed by reports showing even bigger gains. That could happen -- profits leaped 33 percent in the first nine months of 1983 -- but it is far from being a sure thing.

HEADLINE: Aircraft-Leasing Giant Strives To Insure Its Growth

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Tony Ryan, the founder and chairman of the GPA Group P.L.C., the aircraft-leasing giant, seemed unusually subdued the other day for a man whose company, after a year's delay, was about to go public, thereby confirming him as one of Ireland's richest men.
If the public offering in the United States, Europe and Japan goes as planned, investors will pay $10 to $12.50 each for 80 million new and existing GPA shares. 
 Some analysts, though, warn that the worldwide travel slump could hurt GPA's ability to raise the hoped-for $658 million in the sale. And that could jeopardize its ability to pay for one of the world's largest orders for new jetliners and turboprop planes -- one that could more than double the 420-plane fleet it now owns or manages, and would consolidate its position as the one of the world's leading plane lessors.
If GPA is not a household name, this Irish company is well-known to the more than 100 airlines to which it leases planes. Smaller airlines or carriers in developing regions dominate GPA's customer list, but it also includes big carriers like American Airlines, Delta, Swissair, Air France and Iberia. With airlines unable to pay for the huge number of planes they believe they will need over the next 20 years, they are expected to turn increasingly to companies like GPA.
Carriers have already found that leasing enables them to obtain planes they otherwise might not be able to afford. It also increases their flexibility to adjust their fleets to the changing demands of their markets. With its large purchases, GPA can wring 20 to 25 percent discounts from manufacturers and it passes part of the savings on to airlines.
By aggressively seeking out airline customers and by employing innovative financing techniques, GPA has become the world's biggest operating lessor of planes built after 1985. It already holds an estimated one-third of the market. Its only significant rival in operating leases, those in which the lessor retains ownership of the plane, is the Los Angeles-based International Lease Finance Corporation, with 162 planes. GPA accounts for 48 percent of the orders and options placed by operating lessors, twice the share of International Lease.
As of March 31, GPA and its joint ventures with aerospace companies had placed firm orders with manufacturers for 308 planes to be delivered through the year 2000. This is a whopping $11.9 billion worth and represents about 10 percent of manufacturers' backlog of firm orders. GPA has options to buy 220 more planes for $9.1 billion.
The stock offering is essential if GPA is to raise the more than $7 billion it needs to pay for planes scheduled for delivery in the next three years. GPA has $2.5 billion in unused credit lines from banks. Its debt already totals $4.16 billion, or 3.4 times shareholders' equity, and GPA cannot allow its debt to rise by more than $1.07 billion on a sustained basis without breaching debt covenants.
Reflecting the pressing need for the stock sale, Moody's Investors Service has placed $1.8 billion of GPA debt securities under review for a possible rating downgrade. "The outcome of the share offering will influence our decision, but we also wanted to take another look at the long-term fundamentals of the air travel industry," said Charles P. Mancuso, an analyst at Moody's.
Another reason for GPA's offering is that two of its biggest private shareholders -- Aer Lingus and Air Canada -- need money to modernize their own fleets. The shareholders planning to sell part of their stakes -- the two airlines and some financial institutions -- stand to make up to $285 million.
Mr. Ryan is not selling any of his 18.7 million GPA shares, which could be worth as much as $234 million. So why isn't he jubilant? "I have a heavy cold," Mr. Ryan, 56 years old, said during a recent lunch with reporters at GPA's headquarters near Shannon Airport in Ireland.
There are other reasons that Thomas Anthony Ryan, who lives on a 300-acre estate in Tipperary, Ireland, and has an impressive collection of 19th and 20th century paintings, might be less than thrilled. Even if the shares fetch $10 to $12.50, this would be about a third below the level hit in mid-1990 in the private secondary market. Some analysts think even $10 is too high.
The offering is being made asthe airline industry climbs out of its worst slump ever. Economic problems plaguing several big countries, including the United States, and fears of terrorism during the Gulf War kept many would-be travelers on the ground last year and prompted GPA to postpone the offering. Air travel fell for the first time ever, by an estimated 2 to 4 percent.
Weakened by the slump, many airlines have postponed or canceled deliveries of ordered planes, analysts note. While air travel is now recovering, a surplus of planes continues. In its prospectus, even GPA notes that "it is not possible to predict how long this period of aircraft oversupply will last."
That, in turn, will affect the prices GPA can get for leases and the planes it sells to investors. All these factors will affect its ability to raise new capital.
Since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, prices for older jets like DC-10's and Boeing 727's have plunged by 30 to 50 percent, according to Avmark Inc., the American aviation appraisal, consulting and publishing company. Prices of jetliners built within the last five years, which had been rising, have been flat since then.
Reflecting the tough times, GPA's profit margins in leasing shrank to 13 percent in the year that ended March 31, down from 21 percent the year before; the planes GPA and its joint ventures sold fell to 36, from 67. GPA makes most of its money by selling investors planes that airlines have leased.
Even so, GPA's profits rose by 32.9 percent, to $202 million, in the latest fiscal year by United States accounting rules. (Under Irish rules, they rose only 2.9 percent.) Its return on equity has consistently remained above 20 percent.
Mr. Ryan hopes investors will be impressed. "Having been through the worst year in aviation history, the company has performed very well," he told European reporters.
GPA concedes that the tough times are not over. It still has 14 or so planes for which it cannot find customers. In its latest fiscal year, GPA decided not to exercise or reschedule 44 options on planes, canceled 11 firm orders and rescheduled delivery of five other planes for 1995 or 1996. In a testimony to GPA's clout, manufacturers have not made GPA pay cancellation penalties.
GPA leaders also are hoping that the industry glut will disappear by early 1994. They are also counting on global air travel growing by an average of 5 to 6 percent a year over the long term, an outlook shared by many airlines and plane manufacturers.
But John Vosper, managing director of Avmark's British subsidiary, points out that the outlook for leasing prices and the prevailing bullish view about the need for new planes assumes there will not be another slump in global air travel. He said this cannot be ruled out. "The problem is if there is another recession or a Gulf War somewhere else," he said.
Not surprisingly, GPA and manufacturers prefer not to think about such things. Their view is that there has not been a dramatic change in airlines' need for vast numbers of new planes to replace aging, fuel-guzzling aircraft; to meet tougher noise standards, and to meet anticipated passenger demand. The need will just take a little longer to materialize than thought two years ago, they say.
The industry consensus is that airlines over the next decade will need 6,200 to 6,400 new planes that will cost $400 billion to $450 billion. Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive of British Airways P.L.C., recently said the main factor in determining whether those forecasts would come true was the availability of bank financing for purchases.
Tony Ryan loves that kind of talk. GPA and other experts assume that airlines' cash flow and ability to sell new stock will cover only 40 to 50 percent of the cost of the planes they will need through 2000. With banks around the world retrenching, that spells a big opportunity for leasing companies like GPA.
Mr. Ryan, who founded the company as Guinness Peat Aviation with $5,000 in savings in 1975 after he left a middle management job at Aer Lingus, has spotted and exploited such market trends before. GPA's revenues have tripled in the last five years, and its net income has nearly done the same.
It is no accident, GPA leaders say, that only 10 percent of its leasing profits last year came from North America. They say they foresaw the consolidation of America's airline industry and concluded that the surviving giants would be able to obtain discounts from manufacturers as large as GPA's and, therefore, would not have much need for it. Thus, GPA has not been badly hurt by the airline bankruptcies in America, although it did suffer a $52 million loss from the Braniff bankruptcy in 1989.
Mr. Ryan argues that GPA's diversified customer list of 106 carriers in 49 countries will protect it from a big hit. After all, if one regional market runs into trouble and does not need a plane, it can always be flown to another that does, he says. That is true, providing a lot of markets don't sink together, creating a glut of planes like the one that exists today.
 
 
 
RAISING CAPITAL TO BUY PLANES
 GPA has earned a reputation as an innovator in developing new sources of capital to finance aircraft purchases.
It has been adept at attracting Japanese, European and American financial institutions as well as airlines. GPA's larger shareholders include Mitsubishi Trust and Banking, Air Canada, Aer Lingus, Prudential Insurance Company of America, ong Term Credit Bank of Japan, Irish Life Assurance and Citicorp.
Last year, GPA tapped the public debt markets, selling $500 million worth of seven-year notes on the New York Stock Exchange. GPA plans to issue another $1 billion in the next 18 months.
Another important new source of capital that GPA has developed in recent years is the sale of leased planes to institutional or individual investors. In GPA lingo, this is "securitizing" planes or "turning metal into paper." The attractions for investors include the leasing income, the residual value of the planes and tax benefits -- components that GPA in the past year or two has been selling separately.
"When it comes to developing new investor markets from the point of view of securitization of aircraft, they're very much at the forefront," said Clive Anderson, an analyst at Smith New Court Securities Ltd.
GPA now plans to break new ground by issuing a variety of debt and equity securities with varying risks and yields that are backed by portfolios of planes.
GPA and some financial institutions, including Citicorp, are putting the final touches on a $500 million-plus fund that will package 14 planes leased to 14 different airlines in 12 countries. This diversification, GPA hopes, will enable the fund's publicly listed senior debt to get a top credit rating. GPA hopes to put together two other funds of similar size by the end of the year.
Analysts say the first fund will be a critical test of how great an appetite investors have for aircraft-backed securities. "GPA has a lot of new aircraft on order," Mr. Anderson said. "To pay for them, it will be necessary to constantly expand the investor market."

HEADLINE: Who Paid the Most Taxes in the 80's? The Superrich

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
If your Federal income tax bill shrank in the last decade, you probably owe William H. Gates, Steven J. Ross or some other latter-day Rockefeller a thank-you note.
The richest of the rich -- the top 1 percent of American families -- reaped 70 percent of the growth in average family incomes in the late 1970's and the 1980's, Congressional Budget Office data show. But according to a Federal Reserve Board governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, the top 1 percent of families also shouldered a bigger share of the American tax burden, lightening the load for everyone else. 
 Allowing for inflation, all American families together paid $45.2 billion more in Federal income taxes in 1988 than they did in 1981, Mr. Lindsey said. In that same period, however, the income taxes of the top 1 percent, families with incomes averaging $310,000, rose by even more -- $50.2 billion.
In short, the top 1 percent paid the entire increase in tax payments -- and then some. The not-so-rich, it turns out, got a $5 billion tax cut.
"The bottom 99 percent paid less in real terms," said Mr. Lindsey, author of a lively defense of the 1980's supply-side tax cuts, "The Growth Experiment."
"People say Reagan cut taxes on the rich," he added. "Here's a refutation of it."
Not quite. "The predominant reason that the share of taxes paid by the top 1 percent has risen is that the share of taxable income received by the top 1 percent has risen," said Joel Slemrod, a tax expert at the University of Michigan. According to the Congressional Budget Office, very rich families ended up with 13 percent of all pretax income in 1989, up from 8.7 percent in 1977.
The rich did enjoy huge tax rate cuts during the Reagan years. In 1981, the top rate was sliced from 70 percent to 50 percent. At the same time, said Alan J. Auerbach, deputy chief of staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, high-income individuals got several new tax breaks, such as accelerated depreciation allowances for equipment and real estate.
In the 1986 tax reform, the top rate was slashed again to 28 percent, although that reduction was balanced by a rise in the capital gains tax rate and the closing of various tax loopholes. Now the top rate is 31 percent.
Thanks to the lower rates, families in the top 1 percent kept more of their income. They paid an average of just 27 percent of their incomes to the Internal Revenue Service in 1989. In 1977, the earliest year for which Congressional Budget office data are available for the top 1 percent, they paid a much heftier 36 percent.
So how did the rich end up paying a bigger share of America's tax bill? Their incomes surged and that more than offset the lower rates.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the pretax income of the top 1 percent shot up 77 percent after inflation between 1977 and 1989. The average for all families rose just 9 percent.
The facts contradict received wisdom on both sides of the political aisle. Republicans have long argued that the Reagan tax cuts were manna for the middle class. Democrats have always countered that the rich made out like bandits. In some sense, thanks to the explosion of pretax income at the top, both turned out to be true.

"IT'S correct that the top income group is paying more taxes," said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, "but their incomes have risen faster than their taxes." The after-tax income of the top 1 percent grew even faster than pretax income, by 102.2 percent between 1977 and 1989, adjusted for inflation.
"Virtually any set of data that one looks at shows that the decade of the 1980's was a very good decade for those at the top end of the income distribution," Mr. Reischauer said in a recent television interview broadcast on "The Wall Street Journal Report." "The same is true, incidentally, for the second half of the 1970's. This is not a partisan issue."
The critical question for economists, if not for politicians, is, as Mr. Slemrod put it, "to what extent the tax cuts caused the greater concentration of income."
Mr. Lindsey, for one, argues that the income of the top 1 percent went up mostly because their tax rates went down, encouraging them to work harder, report more taxable income (salaries as opposed to fringe benefits) and shift their portfolios toward taxable assets (stocks, say, instead of houses).
In his book, which was published in 1990, Mr. Lindsey reported that the 1980's favored the creation of new fortunes over coupon-clipping and old
 A General Accounting Office report says that the Federal policy of not taxing fringe benefits results in an unfair system. Page 23.
money: "What I found is that in 1963 when the top rate was 91 percent, the typical high income tax return was that of a rentier collecting interest and dividends. In 1983, when the top rate was 50 percent, the typical high income tax return was either someone with capital gains or a wage earner."
Mr. Lindsey's thesis that the tax cuts caused the income spurt at the top is not, however, widely accepted. "The consensus view," Mr. Auerbach said, "is that it's hard to see any significant change in the income distribution in response to the tax cuts."
Mr. Lindsey is now planning to update the analysis of supply-side tax cuts that appeared in his book. And Mr. Slemrod is currently at work on a study of how the rich have responded to changes in tax rates between 1962 and 1989.

A RECENT Council of Economic Advisers staff memorandum supports Mr. Lindsey's contention that the very well heeled contributed a bigger share of Federal tax revenues. The top 1 percent paid 15.4 percent of all Federal income taxes in 1989, according to council economists, up from 13.6 percent in 1977.
By contrast, the bottom 40 percent of American families -- whose income actually declined in the period -- paid just 7.9 percent of the taxes in 1989. That's a smaller share than the 9.2 percent they handed over in 1977. The share of total pretax income of the bottom 40 percent is about the same as that of the top 1 percent -- 13 percent.
The Council of Economic Advisers also used Congressional Budget Office data in its analysis.

Bankruptcy Swallows Canary Wharf 

Olympia & York, North America's largest developer, sought protection last week from its creditors in the British courts for its Canary Wharf project outside of London. It is the largest development in Europe. Olympia went to the courts when 11 banks, with about $990 million in construction loans, declined to provide more money. The filing gives control of the project, which is about $2.07 billion in debt, to a court-appointed administrator. Though a few blue-chip tenants have rented office space and there's enough room for 70,000 people, many potential tenants have shied away from Canary Wharf. It takes hours to get there from London. Olympia was supposed to put up about $720 million in additional funds, which would be matched by the British Government, so a subway line could be extended to the project. Last week Prime Minister John Major ruled out building the rail line without Olympia's help.

Into the Pill Trade
 
Last week industry analysts said Procter & Gamble Inc. was in talks with Marion Merrell Dow Inc., a pharmaceutical manufacturer, to distribute an over-the-counter version of Marion's hugely successful antihistamine, Seldane. Non-prescription medicines are one of the fastest-growing segments of the consumer market.

Perot as Quintessential Insider
 
Although he portrays himself as a political outsider, when it comes to getting government to do what he wants the billionaire Ross Perot knows which buttons to press. In the last five years, Mr. Perot managed to get Federal, state and city governments to invest nearly $200 million in cash and tax incentives to expand Alliance Airport outside of Fort Worth. Alliance is situated in the middle of 17,000 acres of land Mr. Perot is developing. In 1987, Mr. Perot asked the Federal Aviation Administration for $25 million so the airport could accommodate Boeing 747's. When the F.A.A. refused, Mr. Perot went to the House Speaker, Jim Wright of Texas. Congress authorized the money.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
The Saudis Switch Strategies
 
OPEC sets oil prices by consensus: Whatever Saudi Arabia wants is the consensus. Last week oil prices moved up by more than $1 a barrel to $22 after Saudi Arabia let it be known that it was no longer averse to letting prices rise. That was a shift from Saudi Arabia's traditional strategy of keeping prices low to foster long-term demand for oil. The impetus for the change was the European Community's plan to tax oil, beginning at $3 a barrel this year and rising to $10 a barrel by the end of the decade. The new tax was unveiled in preparation for this week's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. But with Saudi Arabia now determined to make its money in the short term, economists worry about a new round of global inflation.

The War on Saddam's Money
 
Operation Desert Storm may have routed Iraq's army from Kuwait, but it failed to dislodge Saddam Hussein from Baghdad. Last week details of a secret destabilization plan leaked out. The plan, which involves several Western governments including the United States, aims to spur inflation. Fake dinar notes are being trucked into Iraq while airplanes pelt the countryside with "dollars." But the plan must have been cooked up by the economists, not the generals: History records few examples of inflation-induced coups. And even if there is unrest, Hussein and his Government are protected by a guard of 45,000 troops.

Science's Bargain Basement
 
The Russians may not be capitalists yet, but they are learning. Last week a physics institute in Moscow made a deal with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company to put 100 Russian scientists on A.T.& T's research payroll. But the new employees in Moscow evidently haven't learned how to negotiate. While American researchers hire out for about $70,000 a year, Russia's mental muscle will go for just $40 a month.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
So Vile, Everyone's for It
 
The House energy bill, which was overwhelmingly passed last week, must be a compromise of a very high order. No one likes it. Conservationists got a ban on new offshore drilling, angering the White House. They also got higher mileage standards for cars, angering Detroit, and an increase in the use of alternative fuels, angering oil producers. The nuclear power industry got its regulations streamlined, which upset environmentalists. Competition between electricity suppliers was intensified, which pleased consumers while distressing producers. Gas producers liked a provision speeding up pipeline licensing, but disliked rules taking away their right to limit production to keep prices high. "This is half a good energy bill," said Daniel Becker, a lawyer for the Sierra Club.

Consumers Are Cheerier
 
If the Conference Board's Index of Consumer Confidence is any indication, consumers are beginning to emerge from their funk. The board's index rose to a cheerful 71.6 in May, from 65.1 in April. The index was 100 in 1985. Since two thirds of all economic activity is driven by consumers' spending, a rosier attitude forecasts growth.

A Smart Bet for Recovery
 
While the nation's academic economists have yet to declare the recession over, the National Association of Business Economists revised upward its growth forecast for the year, to 2 percent from 1.5 percent. "The odds against another downturn are 5-to-1 " said Joseph Duncan, vice president of the association.

At Last, Detroit Gets a Break
 
For Detroit, mid-May could be the light at the end of the tunnel. Sales of North American-built vehicles rose 9.3 percent in that period, the auto makers reported last week. The figures were especially welcome by the Big Three, since they showed Detroit had won back a smidgeon of market share from Japan. Detroit's share of total sales -- cars, trucks, vans and buses -- rose to 89 percent from 88.4 percent last year. "If the rate were to stay like this for a few periods, we could definitely say it was a turning point," said Harvey Heinback, an automobile analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York.
 
Good News on Joblessness
 
New jobless claims fell by 4,000 last week to 403,000, the best showing in more than seven months, the Labor Department said last week. The drop came despite 1,400 new unemployment claims in California growing out of the Los Angeles riots.
 
Growth, Yes, but It's Wimpy
 
Most recessions are followed by at least a year's worth of spunky growth in gross domestic product. Five to 6 percent is normal. By those standards, this recovery is plagued by the wimp factor. In the first quarter, the Commerce Department said last week, the nation's GDP increased by 2.4 percent, up from an earlier estimate of 2 percent. "This recovery is like an aircraft that takes off but fails to gain much altitude," said Norman Robertson, an economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "Though it's sub par, it's nothing to sneer at. It's the best growth performance we've had since 1989."

HEADLINE: At Work;
Should Fringe Benefits Be Taxed?

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
If Government reports were zeppelins, the skies over Washington would perpetually look like a turn-of-the century airshow. Last month, the General Accounting Office quietly floated its own lighter-than-air craft, a baggage-crammed survey of the pros and cons of taxing employee benefits as income, and let it drift quietly onto the desks of various interested parties, most of whom cast a nervous glance toward the electorate and madly disavowed any knowledge of the report's provenance.
Little of "Tax Policy: Effects of Changing the Tax Treatment of Fringe Benefits," the G.A.O.'s report to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, is original. But it brings together data that had previously been reported by several agencies in different publications, and in doing that it provides a centralized document for Washington's tax policy experts to pore over. "It put some of the details behind what we knew intuitively," said David Certner, a pension specialist at the American Association of Retired Persons. "We knew benefits are expensive." 
 As the report points out, the Treasury Department forgoes an estimated $91 billion in revenue annually because benefits like pensions, health care and life insurance are not counted as taxable income.
Pensions and health benefits are two of the top three forms of "tax expenditure," or reductions in income tax because the Government chooses not to collect it. Mortgage deductions are the third. Giving fringe benefits tax expenditure status is "an important incentive to provide socially desirable benefits like medical care," said William Custer, research director of the Employee Benefits Research Institute in Washington.
The G.A.O. says the report was done, not at the request of Congress, as is common at the agency, but of its own volition, to clarify a complicated and controversial topic. "We are not out there trying to advocate a position; it's meant to be a thought piece for Congress," said Thomas J. McCool, assistant director for tax policy and administrative issues at the G.A.O. and an author of the report. "We wanted to see if income tax systems treat people with similar incomes in the same way."
The report concludes that tax systems do not treat similarly situated people similarly. It said, "Current tax treatment of fringe benefits works against tax equity because some workers receive employer-provided, tax-preferred fringe benefits while others do not." In the words of the A.A.R.P.'s Mr. Certner, "The deficiency in the current system is that not everyone gets the benefits even though everyone pays for them."
Millions of Americans receive untaxed compensation in the form of pensions, health benefits, life insurance and flexible plans, which taken together have become increasingly important. Since 1950, benefits as a percentage of total compensation have more than tripled, to 16.2 percent.
But the proportion of the civilian work force covered by employer-provided pension plans -- to take the single largest type of tax expenditure, at $51 billion -- has declined to less than half and is expected to keep dropping for the next few years. And even workers who have pension plans today are more likely to have them in a form considerably more limited in value and certainty than the traditional pension, in which an employer pledged a defined amount that an employee could count on for life.
So should taxpayers who are already footing more of the bill for their retirement have to subsidize the pension system? The intuitive answer is no. But as the report and several people in the benefits "community" pointed out, a pension system has functions other than subsidizing the sunblock of a few lucky retirees in Florida.
"To the extent that employers contribute and it's tax-free, people have an incentive to save" through contributory benefit programs like 401(k) plans, said Andrew Katz, who tracks tax-related compensation issues at the Research Institute of America, a publisher in New York. Pension funds in their present form provide assets of more than $2.7 trillion to the national economy, and they make unnecessary an even costlier system backed by the Federal Government.
Given the number of groups with a potential interest in any change in the system, on the one hand, and the sheer amount of untapped revenue, on the other, it is impossible to predict where the inevitable push-me, pull-you of lobbying will go, but few people expect any discussion of taxing benefits to rise above a whisper before the election. "In the short run, the danger of any policy change is quite minute," said Jim Jaffe, a spokesman for Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is vice chairman of the Joint Committee on Taxation.
 
 
UNSPEAKABLE IDEAS ON HEALTH CARE
 "Tax hike" is a phrase that nobody dares to speak aloud in Washington in an election year. So it is an indication of how seriously the crisis in the health-care system is taken in Washington that some, even some on the Hill, are pondering the possibilities in untaxed health-care benefits.
Yet despite what many call the inequity between high-salary employees with rich health-care plans and the millions of employees with medium salaries and no health care, any attempt to impose taxes will almost certainly encounter ferocious opposition. "It has been suggested that the tax treatment of health care is one of the causes of health-care cost inflation," said William Custer of the Employee Benefits Research Institute.
Jim Jaffe, a spokesman for Dan Rostenkowski, treads carefully around the possibility of change. "In the context of health-care reform legislation, there is a growing awareness of how large a subsidy exists," he said. Still, the only proposal on the horizon is to put a cap on the deductability of health care benefits and that is given only a slim chance of ever seeing the light of the Capitol's dome.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
Ford Caps Its Line of Crown Victorias

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
EXCEPT for New Orleans, where the cabs are as flamboyant as the food, you are not likely to see a spiffy taxi in most cities, much less in New York. So I was surprised when I got into one last week that had both a fresh wax job and a newly polished interior.
Another surprise was that the car was a Ford, a rarity on potholed streets that are the special province of the Chevy Caprice. My comment on the oddities produced a conversation with the driver, who was genuinely pleased to hear that Ford has resumed its sale of rear-wheel-drive fleet vehicles after a 14-month hiatus. 
 "I've been waiting and waiting," he said. "This is my own car. It's an '89 and I've been nursing it along. I wouldn't have one of those Chevies. On these streets, they're always out of alignment."
Half of his brain thought for a moment while the other half dealt with a fire engine that was bearing down on us. And then he said: "This one's always out of alignment, too. But I take it to Sears."
The four-door sedan that Ford has finally brought to market as a commercial and police vehicle is its Crown Victoria, introduced in March 1991 as a '92 model. Incredibly, the new car represented the first major redesign of the company's full-size sedan since 1979, and Ford decided to hold off on fleet sales until the retail market had been satisfied.
Until this spring, the car could be had only in standard and LX models, but now there is a civilian version of the heavy-duty chassis and it takes over the line's top spot as a Touring Sedan.
As such, it sports a 210-horsepower V8, antilock brakes, a stiffer suspension with front and rear stabilizer bars, cast-aluminum wheels with performance tires, tinted glass, air-conditioning, an air bag for the driver and an optional bag for the front passenger.
According to Ross Roberts, Ford Division's general manager, the new Crown Vic is meant to bridge generations, and it just might do that.
The long if not the short of it is that this is a b-i-g old-fashioned American sedan, and some of us love that. It offers size, comfort, security and status. It has a column shift for the standard automatic transmission. It has terrific headroom and you can actually see out of it.
It has chrome trim and bench seats, front and rear, with pockets on the backs of the front seats. The rear compartment is, as they say, commodious, and the back windows go all the way down, just like they did in the old days.
The Touring Sedan even has a power antenna that you have to raise and lower by pushing a button, unlike most cars today with automatic antennas that work when you turn the radio on and off.
O.K., so that's not a genuine plus. And neither is the front bench seat, particularly. Despite the power adjustments, it is simply too flat. It is uncomfortable on a trip, and the tester's gray leather upholstery offered no grip for the seat of the pants.
There is no place to put a coffee cup and there is pretty much no place to rest your left foot when you are driving. But those are the only complaints, I promise, and there are plenty of really neat things to compensate.
Like its sister ship, the Mercury Grand Marquis, the Vic is very quiet, very supple on the road. Gearing is meant to preserve fuel economy and the high ratios take their toll on acceleration, but the car's performance certainly is satisfactory.
It also handles nicely for the sort of car that it is, and it is . . . well, just plain pretty. There is a roundness that evokes the early 50's with a touch of Jaguar thrown in, all with a modern overlay.
The doors merge into the roof, limousine-style. Glass is nearly flush, and the steeply sloping nose does its bit for aerodynamics. The test car's black paint was complemented by gray vinyl cladding on the lower panels, and the bumpers are integrated and body-colored.
The Touring Sedan's doors also feature Ford's better idea, combination locks, and they are teamed with the rolling-lock feature that seals all doors when the car is in motion.
Things are equally amenable inside, with a clean dash whose black instrument panel includes a 120-m.p.h. speedometer and gauges for volts, fuel, temperature and oil.
The seat belts have up-down adjustments, a nice touch usually reserved for cars with luxury price tags, and the controls are excellent, even including a sensible single knob to control the parking lights and headlamps.
Perforated leather is wrapped around the four-spoke steering wheel, and the cruise-control buttons live between the spokes next to the air bag. Also, even with a passenger bag in the right side of the dash, the designers have managed to find room for a useful glovebox.
All that said, the new Crown Victoria is no match for the original, at least to my eye.
For a start, and comely as it is, the Touring Sedan is far less sporty than the 1955 model that made sense of the "crown" in its name. And, like its rival, the Chevy Caprice, the new car cries out for treatment as a coupe, maybe a full-size ragtop.
When the Crown Victoria appellation was born 37 years ago, "hardtop convertibles" were just beginning to be the rage. The original Fairlane Crown Vic was one of those, a pillarless two-door hardtop with what came to be called basket-handle roof trim.
An even jazzier version, the Skyliner, had the front half of the roof made of transparent green plexiglass. Ford produced only 1,999 Skyliners, so those cars were fairly rare. But the standard Crown was a big hit, and the company rolled 33,165 of them out of the showrooms.
Along with Ford's bread-and-butter models, the sporty two-door helped to make 1955 the second best year in the company's history, behind 1923 when Model T's dominated America's roads.
Oh, and one other thing: 1992's Crown Victorias carry stickers ranging from $20,108 for the base sedan to $24,377 for the new top of the line. In 1955, the most you could pay was $2,372.
I knew there was something I liked about those old cars.

HEADLINE: Groundwater

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Stephen Hess, president of the developers' Association for a Better Long Island, is correct in saying in his letter on May 3 that groundwater can be protected by cluster development with covenants guaranteeing perpetual open space in the remainder of the properties. However, the location, type and overall development density of the properties are much more important. 
 For example, within Long Island's nine designated watersheds (called Special Groundwater Protection Areas), which supply all of the Island's aquifers, the fast-disappearing open spaces are so vital to the quality of the groundwater that the Long Island Regional Planning Board has recommended five-acre residential zoning for the remaining large undeveloped tracts. These areas, which comprise about 25 percent of the Island, are the major precipitation recharge areas to the aquifers.
Five-acre zoning is already in place in several Nassau villages (Brookville, Matinicock, Mill Neck, Muttontown and Upper Brookville), and in four Suffolk towns (Brookhaven, Easthampton, Southampton and part of Southold). Five-acre zoning has also been upheld by the New York State Court of Appeals.
Open spaces in the Special Groundwater Protection Area watersheds are as important to the groundwater and ecnomy of Long Island as the Catskill and Croton watersheds are to New York City's reservoirs and economy. Clustering should be employed whenever a large tract is developed within a Special Groundwater Protection Area in order to preserve Long Island's water supply; with the number of units per cluster limited to the number based on five-acre zoning of the overall property. If developers and environmentalists can agree on this, cooperation can replace obstructionism, and the Island's economic recovery can begin.

HEADLINE: OUT THERE: PRAGUE;
Still Another Spring

BYLINE: By Roger Cohen

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
Call it a marriage of high-tech Western razzmatazz and the fin-de-siecle elegance of a salon in Mitteleuropa. A grand piano stands in the middle of the office, but the only music is Bruce Springsteen's "Human Touch" on the sound system. Moldings of violins adorn the cornices, but the only instruments in use are cellular telephones and computers. "I hope," says Jean-Claude Van Gansen, "that this mix makes my clients confident."
Whatever the appeal of Mr. Van Gansen's headquarters in the music room of a 19th-century mansion, its eclectic style is appropriate. For this former jeans retailer from Belgium is trying to make a fortune by wedding the financial savvy of the West with the myriad opportunities in an East Europe emerging from years of Communist inertia. 
 Like hordes of other entrepreneurs drawn to this new capitalist frontier, he wants a piece of the action in what amounts to a gold rush. His company, East-West Finance, might as aptly be called Wild-West Finance.
Mr. Van Gansen, who is 40 years old, arrived here from Brussels five days after Czechoslovakia's Communist regime fell in December 1989. He had sold his Jeans Fizz chain of stores in Belgium and reckoned there was money to be made in the East European lurch to capitalism. "I did not come with a single purpose but with an open mind," he said with a smile, "and I soon found the problem is not looking for opportunities but limiting yourself."
Imagine the scene: no advertisements, no marketing, no stock market or fast food, no financial regulations, virtually no private enterprises and just a scant notion of profit and loss. In such circumstances, chutzpah, slickness, style and persistence count for more than the lessons of Wharton or Harvard.
Mr. Van Gansen -- who manages to look both cherubic and fairly ruthless -- moved fast. He started the country's first billboard business and now has 35 percent of that burgeoning market. Then he and a partner bought the rights to produce the Czechoslovak Yellow Pages, and later sold them to New York Telephone for what he calls "a big profit." A move into real estate followed, and a Prague office block is under construction.
Throughout this splurge, he was dismayed by the relative absence of American businessmen. Indeed, German companies had plowed about $2.5 billion into Czechoslovakia before United States businesses recently began to move more aggressively. One possible reason: sometimes, Mr. Van Gansen concedes, you have to give a little baksheesh to get things moving, and that is not part of American corporate style.
The opportunities, even now, remain vast. You only need to sample your second plate of greasy pork and stodgy cabbage smeared with sour cream to realize that in restaurants alone, fortunes await. Drugstores appear stocked with the leftovers from a day of Los Angeles rioting. McDonald's, that worldwide barometer of emergent capitalism, has just opened its first restaurant.
Indeed, all that has been done up to now amounts to little more than an hors d'oeuvre. A blowout sale of 1,446 state-owned companies valued by the Government at $9.3 billion began this month, and Mr. Van Gansen is among those who intend to profit.
There is plenty of dross among the firms being sold but there are also some jewels, among them the renowned Pilsener brewery, another brewery named Budweiser (the original, it claims), several glass factories and some excellent ceramics companies. The nifty thing about the sale is that nobody really knows the value of these companies. In the absence of a market, any valuation is difficult, so there should be bargains. About 8.6 million citizens have paid $37 each for a booklet of vouchers enabling them to buy shares in the companies being auctioned.
Mr. Van Gansen is shopping, too. Using aggressive TV advertising last year, when a 30-second spot cost as little as $1,000, he guaranteed a fifteenfold return in a year to people who ceded him their booklets. He has set up a mutual fund and secured vouchers with a book value of about $20 million.
Mr. Van Gansen is more commercial than industrial. He wants to wheel and deal rather than hold onto the shares he buys. Image is therefore important, to induce trust in his clients. "Take the piano and rock music in this office," he said. "Nobody would have dreamed you could combine such things with business, but it helps put people at ease."
Another thrusting young entrepeneur, Viktor Kozeny, a Czech who attended Harvard and has started a company in Prague called Harvard Capital and Consulting, started earlier and secured vouchers with a book value of close to $700 million by promising a tenfold return within a year to investors.
"I've got $700 million to spend in the next few months," the 28-year-old Mr. Kozeny said. "It should be nice shopping."
The catch is that Mr. Kozeny's $700 million and Mr. Van Gansen's $20 million are purely theoretical, based on the Government's valuation of the companies on sale. Until a true market emerges nobody knows what the shares the two entrepreneurs will acquire with the vouchers are really worth.
"Everyone's playing Monopoly right now," concedes the apparently unrufflable Mr. Van Gansen. "My fund might be worth $100 million in a few years and I started it with virtually nothing. Of course, it might not be worth that much. But to even try this sort of thing in the West you'd need a bank."
It is precisely the absence of strong capital backing for the likes of Mr. Kozeny's or Mr Van Gansen's funds that worries some people. Suppose, a year from now, everyone wants to cash out and take the promised tenfold and fifteenfold returns. The entrepreneurs could be forced to dump their shares and a mass sell-off in a nascent stock market could lead to panic.
"Sure, there's some risk," Mr. Van Gansen said. "But the upside here is so great that it's a mistake to hesitate in seizing a share of the market. The Czechoslovaks are very nice people and good technicians, but they do not understand the power of marketing and commercialism yet."
In other words, style takes you a long way right now on Prague's fast-and-loose frontier.

HEADLINE: Dismissing Inflation Too Easily

 BODY:
To the Editor:
This letter is triggered by Alfred E. Kahn's comments on air fares (Forum, "A Dogfight Over Deregulation," May 17) but does not apply only to him. Is there no end to our being told that the cost of something has gone down or only up X percent, after allowing for inflation? The implication is that we really have nothing to complain about. Tell that to those on fixed incomes. Yet, nowhere is it mentioned that one of the causes of the inflation for which we are adjusting is that same something whose price has gone up. 
 By the way, Mr. Kahn, whom do I charge for my time after having wasted countless hours flying involuntarily into Atlanta, Charlotte, Pittsburgh, Newark and so on?

HEADLINE: Conversations/Cajuste Carelus;
A Haitian Refugee Wonders When He'll Return

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: HUNTINGTON, N.Y.

 BODY:
Cajuste Carelus, who is in the 12th year of exile from his native Haiti, can speak freely. He has no plans to return home anytime soon.
President of the Haitian Community Association in Huntington, N.Y., and chairman of its Multi-Cultural Center, Mr. Carelus has pledged not to return to Port-au-Prince until democracy does. "I work for change from here," he said. His association tracks Haiti's faltering attempts at democracy, helping scores of the casualties: refugees who land here without money, housing or friends. Mr. Carelus and a friend feed and shelter the newcomers, and provide a lawyer. 
 The friend sits by, listening closely as Mr. Carelus speaks, but says little. He clings to his anonymity because he intends to go home sometime soon.
Through their work, the two men have encountered the fear and desperation of Haitians who have fled the military takeover of their country. They are incensed by President Bush's decision to turn back the rattletrap boats bearing Haitians bound for America, and believe Washington would only have to place one tersely worded phone call to Port-au-Prince to restore to power Haiti's democratically elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
"I don't believe in military intervention from America," said Mr. Carelus, "but if Bush wanted it, Aristide would be sleeping in Haiti tonight." Mr. Aristide left Haiti after a military coup Sept. 30. Since then, thousands of Haitians have escaped the country, and filled the holding camps at the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in their quest to reach Miami.
Citing overcrowding at Guantanamo Bay, the Bush Administration announced last week that to discourage more Haitians from striking out for America, the Coast Guard would escort back to Haiti any boats not in imminent danger of sinking.
Those seeking political asylum would have to do so at the American embassy in Port-au-Prince, Washington said. At the same time, the United States is applying economic pressure against the military regime run by Gen. Raoul Cedras through an embargo.
Mr. Carelus's friend, who had refrained from speaking, now addressed him in Creole. The two agreed that the American-backed embargo of Haiti amounted to little more than an attempt to hedge political bets.
 
Casual Racism
 "There's a big hole in the economic embargo," Mr. Carelus said, switching to English. "We do have the Dominican Republic next to us. Anything can go through there. The embargo would be good if any ship or plane couldn't travel to Haiti, and if the people of the O.A.S. [Organization of American States] enforced it."
He maintains that most of the refugees bobbing over the Caribbean are escaping military repression rather than poverty. "They are political refugees, because before Aristide, a lot refused to come by sea because it was so dangerous," Mr. Carelus said. "But we see this real flow after Aristide lost power, when the military took over."
At 42 years of age, Mr. Carelus, a high school science teacher when he left Haiti, now works in Syosset as a school maintenance man. His 62-year-old friend founded an elementary school in Haiti in the 1950's. The Tontons Macoute blew it up a few years later. Defying a presidential order to remain in Haiti, the principal fled. Now he paints boats for a living in Port Washington, N.Y.
Their Haitian Community Association has also tried to improve the quality of education that the Huntington schools provide for immigrant children. An investigation by the New York State Department of Education found that the schools offered minimal instruction in English as a second language, and placed a disproportionate number of foreign and minority children into special-education classes.
"I had a meeting with the superintendent right here in this room," said Mr. Carelus. "We offered to talk to the children a few times a week, to translate, to work with the school district. I said, 'We have teachers in the district from Haiti.' They smile when we talk, but they definitely don't want us."
The superintendent, Richard B. Stock, did not return a reporter's phone call seeking comment.
Their lives on Long Island are not marked by the harshness faced by Haitians in New York City. Perhaps because the minority population is smaller than in New York, the racism is more overt here, said Mr. Carelus. "You live with it. You see it. You touch it."
The battles Mr. Carelus fought in Haiti were more dangerous than casual racism in Long Island. There he had spoken to his students against the regime of Jean-Claude Duvalier. One April night, the Tontons Macoute took Mr. Carelus to a cafeteria-style restaurant turned torture chamber. "I was there just because I was caught talking to a few people. Some of them were big officers in the regime.
"From 5 P.M. to the next morning, all night, they made me watch. I saw two men beating another man with sticks and then poking him in the ribs with sticks. A woman was so shocked and frightened, she fell on the floor and had her period right there from the emotion. I saw them beat a man so hard until there was blood, just because he sold somebody's painting for $25 and kept a few dollars for himself." Mr. Carelus shook his head as if to empty out the memory. "He was a student of mine."
He was on his feet, acting out the horrors, and glanced over at his friend: "I see all of that. I saw things must change, and the only way to change was to leave the country," he said.
 
'Time to Go Back'
 The men have differing ideas about how to bring change to their homeland. "This is a good time to go back to Haiti," his friend replied. He believes that if he waits for democracy, he may never get back.
Mr. Carelus is troubled that Haitians are being denied hearings to determine whether they are in danger of political persecution. He believes that the United States has not been complying with the United Nations' 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, which guarantees political asylum to victims of persecution.
He mentioned the Russian Jews who have been taken in by the United States without severe scrutiny. The policy towards Haitians is different. "They're going by our skin."
The abrupt shift in United States policy toward the Haitian boat refugees could spread to people escaping persecution in other countries as well, he cautioned. "Today it's the Haitians, tomorrow it's somebody else."
Neither of the men believed that Mr. Bush's policy, requiring Haitians to apply for political asylum at the embassy in Port-au-Prince, would succeed. Mr. Carelus's friend could not contain his feelings. "If one or two go," he said, "it's no big deal. But if it's 400 or 500, the military won't let them go.
"Those military like to see blood. They like to see bodies on the floor. They don't even think about the consequences," he said.
The educator looked down at his hands as he spoke. A week before, his nephew disappeared. His family in Haiti searched for two days, only to find him dead, an electrical cord around his neck.
Nonetheless, he plans to return home this summer. He speaks of building a school, a clinic, a canteen, a tool bank for farmers. It is because he wants to go back so urgently that he restrained himself during the conversation. For when he has spoken publicly about the plight of Haitians, chilling phone calls followed: "You're going to die tonight," unnamed voices warn. Until now, they have never been able to silence him.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
It's Harder Now to Figure Out Compelling National Interests

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Behind the Bush Administration's groping for an appropriate response to the crises in Yugoslavia and Haiti is a much deeper problem bedeviling American foreign policy: figuring out what is an "American national security interest" now that the cold war is over. Which conflicts, if any, really are worth American intervention to settle, and which ones can be safely ignored?
In some ways, the existence of the Soviet Union made life easy. The Kremlin was the North Star of America's foreign policy. All the policymakers had to do was take out their compasses, point them at any regional conflict in the world, see which side Moscow was on and immediately deduce which side America should take. Virtually every conflict from Namibia to Afghanistan to Nicaragua engaged American interests, and prompted some level of American military involvement, because the Soviets were backing one side or the other. 
 But with the collapse of the Soviet empire, the old American compass no longer works. As a result, both the "realist" school of American foreign policy and the "idealist" school seem to have lost their way. After all, what does it mean to be a realist when there is no Soviet threat to override human rights considerations? And what does it mean to be an idealist when what is required to preserve human rights in places such as Yugoslavia and Haiti is military intervention?
This confusion was not immediately apparent in the first post-cold war crisis -- the gulf war -- because oil and an Iraqi nuclear program were involved, and the Soviets were still lurking in the background in Baghdad. Clearly, American national security was at stake.
But then came the coup in Haiti. The island's first democratically elected government, that of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was ousted Sept. 30 by military plotters. Immediately afterward Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, in an echo of the Bush Administration's firmness against the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, stated "this coup must not and will not succeed."
That was eight months ago, and the Administration has still shown no inclination to go beyond a policy of sanctions to restore Mr. Aristide the way it restored Sheik Jabar al-Ahmed al-Sabah of Kuwait -- despite the fact that Mr. Aristide was democratically elected and Sheik Jabar never was.
In Yugoslavia, the Bush Administration sat on its hands for months as the Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic ripped apart that country and engaged in "ethnic cleansing" of Serbian occupied areas inside Bosnia. At a recent briefing Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokesman, was asked by a reporter whether the Bosnians "deserve some kind of protection from somebody, given that there is a new world order which has been declared by the President of the United States?" She candidly replied: "The only honest answer I have is one that happens to be a fact: Where is it written that the United States government is the military policeman of the world?"
As tragic as the situation in Yugolsavia was, she explained, the United States had no "national security interests" at stake there.
Although Secretary Baker changed course a few days later and intensified Bush Administration sanctions on Serbia, Miss Tutwiler's statement nevertheless seemed to reflect the Administration's real thinking: that the defense of human rights alone is not in the national interest, especially if it involves getting into quagmires like Haiti or Yugoslavia.
There are good, serious arguments for such prudence, but neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Baker has made them. To the contrary, Mr. Baker said in a major speech last month: "We face a summons to leadership. This time it is not about winning a war, hot or cold, but about winning a democratic peace. The choice for America is this: We can either try to win this peace through a deliberate policy of working with others to shape our times, or we can stand aside and drift while the times shape us. We plan to build a democratic peace."
In other words, the Bush team members talk like idealists but in the crunch act like realists -- without acknowledging the tension between those two principles. At least during the cold war, there was an open debate between idealists and realists. The realists argued that the United States had to stifle its support for human rights in some countries, such as Iran under the Shah, because they were allies against the Soviets; the idealists countered that this was morally too high a price to pay, and such policies in the long run would backfire.
Making the realist argument today is much more difficult with no Soviet threat to justify indifference to human rights in any particular country, and Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker know it. Privately senior Administration officials acknowledge that the realist argument in Yugoslavia is embarrassing because it is so cynical. As one official summed it up: "Do you really think the American people want to spill their blood for Bosnia?"
In fairness, though, the idealists also have not been leveling with the American people. Their case, too, is much more complicated without a Soviet empire around.
During the cold war the principle of nonintervention in the internal affairs of another country was a given, particularly since intervening could set off a nuclear war. And behind the Iron Curtain, civil wars in places like Yugoslavia or Nagorno-Karabakh were prevented by the existence of totalitarian regimes. Therefore, the focus of the idealist argument was on advocating human rights -- demanding free emigration and an end to torture or arbitrary imprisonment in places like the Soviet Union, Rumania or Yugoslavia. The idealists' agenda was to make existing regimes less brutal. They never dreamed they could replace them.
But when the cold war ended, the lid came off various ethnic and nationalist disputes behind the Iron Curtain and the collapse of the Soviet empire removed the biggest impediment to foreign intervention. To protect human rights in Bosnia or Haiti today requires, and invites, a much more ambitious effort.
Human rights activists who have criticized the Bush Administration for refusing to pick up Haitian boat people say the decision will not solve the problem, because the problem, fundamentally, is that life in Haiti is unbearable, and as long as it is people will pour out.
What they won't publicly acknowledge, though, is that the only real solution is intervention -- with peacemakers and peacekeepers on the one hand and political advisers on the other to help develop stable democratic institutions in Haiti that can preserve freedom and promote economic development. That is a tall order.
And what the idealists also don't want to admit is that there is a great discrepancy between what idealism in a place like Haiti or Bosnia requires for fulfillment today -- some form of intervention -- and the amount of real interests the United States has at stake in such places.
 
Cynicism and Constraints
 Realists and idealists both need to reexamine their positions, argues Michael J. Sandel, a Harvard University political theorist. Realism can be a principled position provided it is grounded in a compelling conception of the national interest, he said. Before, the compelling factor was provided by the necessity to confront the Soviet threat. Now, unless national interest can be redefined, the realist argument risks lapsing into cynicism.
"What idealists need to do is move beyond advocating human rights alone to fostering political structures within countries that will allow for genuine pluralism and the self-determination of peoples," Mr. Sandel added. "But this agenda has to be constrained by the sober fact that the American people have neither the ability nor the political will to solve every ancient feud on the map."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
As American as Apple Pie, Dim Sum or Burritos

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Henry Luce called it the American Century, but social observers in a future time may smile as they recall the grandiose sobriquet. They will know how the word American was redefined by two surges of immigration, one ushering in the 20th century and another that is ushering it out. Even national nicknames have lost their resonance. What is a Yank? Can one be found in San Antonio's barrios? Was Kilroy here? Or was it Nguyen?
These future observers will have the advantage of us. Three or four censuses from now, they are likely to know what researchers are just beginning to explore: How the Mexicans, Koreans, Cubans, Filipinos, Hmong, Haitians, Jamaicans, Cambodians and Russian Jews fared after crossing to America. 
 In 1990, the researchers will note, the United States Census marked two watersheds: It found 19.7 million foreign-born residents, the most in the country's history. And it found that in the expanded population of first-generation immigrants the Asian-born now outnumber the European-born. Those from Latin America -- predominantly Mexicans -- outnumber both.
"As recently as the 1950's, two-thirds of legal immigrants to the country were from Europe and Canada, with the bulk from Europe," said Jeffrey Passel, a researcher with the Urban Institute, a Washington research firm. "That ceased being true in the 1960's and it's not even close now. European and Canadian immigration is less than 15 percent of total immigration."
The immigrant meccas also changed: as many immigrants entered California during the 1980's as entered New York State from 1901 to 1910.
Mr. Passel and his colleague Barry Edmonston calculate that 66 percent of Asian Americans and 41 percent of Hispanic Americans in 1990 were immigrants. Another 21 percent of Asians and 26 percent of Hispanic residents were children of immigrants.
If the current levels of immigration continue, the two researchers believe, Hispanic residents will number 39 million in two decades, surpassing blacks as the largest minority group. The number of Asians, which doubled in the last decade to 7.3 million, will double again in 20 years' time, and will triple, to 21.5 million, by 2020, according to the Urban Institute's projections. Black immigrants, from Africa and the Caribbean, who now number 1.1 million, will triple their numbers by 2010.
Who will these immigrants be? Nurses, entrepreneurs, scientists, day laborers or part of the welfare rolls? The work of another researcher, William P. O'Hare of the Urban Research Institute at the University of Louisville, offers clues about Asian and Hispanic populations, though he said he has not been able to study black immigrants.
In the case of Asians, the new arrivals either stimulated the group's overall economic performance, or, at the least, failed to hold it back. Mr. O'Hare calculates that in 1979 the median income of Asian-American households was at least 12 percent higher than that of white, non-Hispanic households. By 1990, the household income of Asian-Americans, whose education levels are well above the general population's, was 18 percent higher than that of non-Hispanic whites.
But the news was not all good. Though median income rates were high for Asians as a whole, poverty rates were also above average. In 1990, the poverty rate for the Asian and Pacific Island population was 12.2, compared to 8.8 percent for non-Hispanic whites.
Mr. O'Hare believes that the overall economic success of Asians will be furthered by the next wave of immigrants. "I think a disproportionate share of the new professional immigration slots will go to Asians," he said. "Asians have come here since 1965 on the basis of their skills," agreed Dave Simcox, director of the Center for Immigration Studies.
Mr. Simcox's characterization of the Asian groups as having "an impressive core of well-trained people," certainly seemed true a decade ago. Then the average Japanese-American household had a median income of $40,537 (in constant 1990 dollars); median income among Filipino households was $39,473 and it was $37,082 among Asian Indians, all in excess of median household income for whites.
Hispanics immigrants, from Latin America and the Caribbean, make up more than a third of the foreign-born population. But this tide of immigration, Mr. Simcox says, cannot be controlled by such legal checks as quotas or by the immigration law's current bias toward skilled immigrants.
While the poverty rate in the country climbed for the population as a whole, it climbed more steeply for Hispanic people in the years between 1979 and 1990. At the beginning of the decade, 23.5 percent of them were living on incomes below the Federally defined poverty level; in 1990 the figure was 28.1 percent.
That gloomy portrait is balanced, Mr. Passel said, by new indications that "the recent immigrants at the end of the 1980's seem to be doing better than recent immigrants did 10 years ago." "We tend to focus on the lower end of the income spectrum of immigrants, and that gives a misleading picture," he said. "They are coming in throughout the economic spectrum."

HEADLINE: WORLDS APART;
Rio: A Start on Managing What's Left of This Place

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
Most of the delegates converging on Rio de Janeiro for the start of the Earth Summit on Wednesday, it seems safe to say, believe that humanity must do something about the harm that human expansion is doing to the rest of the biosphere. But it also seems that many of the world's governments tend to pin primary responsibility on someone else and to duck strong measures that could hurt them economically or politically.
That is why the Rio meeting -- as has already been made abundantly clear in pre-summit talks on the key issues of climate and extinction of species -- is likely to disappoint any who are expecting a dramatic environmental leap forward. 
 This is not to say that nothing important is happening. For the first time, the nations of the world are seriously coming to grips with the fundamental and seemingly intractable question of how to pursue economic growth and combat poverty while at the same time protecting the interacting web of atmosphere, water, soil and biological organisms on which human life depends. But the task is proving difficult and frustrating, made so by the fact that rich and poor countries approach it with divergent perceptions and agendas.
"They come to the bargaining table, literally and figuratively, from two different worlds," said Richard Mott, the treaties officer of the World Wildlife Fund.
 
Blame the Rich
 While most of the industrialized countries can afford the luxury of contemplating environmental problems, most of the poor ones are preoccupied with economic survival. Spanning this North-South gulf, as diplomats refer to it, has been the main difficulty but hardly the only one.
Generally speaking, the poor countries of the South blame most environmental damage on the rich countries of the North, who engage in what they see as wasteful overconsumption. The poor countries say they have no choice but to make economic development their first priority. If the South is to play the game of environmental protection, they insist, the North must pay.
Their attitude, says one American diplomat, is: "You've had your turn; you're fat, happy and breathing dirty air and you have no trees. We want our turn, and when we're rich we can start worrying about the environment." Besides, the diplomat added, no leader in a developing country gets elected on environmental issues.
The North, while acknowledging its own responsibility, asserts that the South's frightening population explosion and advancing industrialization threaten to ultimately eclipse any damage done by the North. If the poor countries develop as the industrialized nations have, the North argues, the result will be environmental disaster.
All of this is the political leitmotif of the summit, but it has endlessly complicated variations, exceptions and sub-themes.
 
Talks on Warming
 In talks on a treaty to limit emissions of heat-trapping gases that scientists fear will cause the earth's climate to warm, the North-South split resulted in an agreement three weeks ago that put most of the responsibility on the industrialized countries. They now emit most of the gases, but that is expected to change in the decades ahead as the developing countries grow. Also in the agreement, the rich countries agreed to give poorer ones money and technical help for cleaner cars and smokestacks.
But many political cross-currents affected the path to that rapprochement. The industrialized countries, for instance, were split over insistence by the European Community that emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, first be stabilized at 1990 levels by the year 2000. The Europeans, with their forceful "green" parties, committed themselves to an economic future in which fossil fuels loom smaller.
The Bush Administration, given the United States' dependence on huge amounts of coal, oil and natural gas, was unsure the country could meet the Europeans' modest targets without hurting the economy. Given a recession and an election year, anti-environmentalist hardliners in the Administration pressed for no concessions at all. But more moderate forces prevailed, the United States agreed to some vague first-step targets, and a compromise was struck in which the Europeans seemed to yield more.
Nor were the developing countries monolithic. India led a hard-line faction that refused to sign any treaty that did not require the Northern countries to take strong first steps. It is still unclear whether India will sign the agreement that emerged. Other developing countries, recognizing that global warming would hurt them as much as anyone, were more conciliatory, though still insistent that the North bear the cost. Few were fully satisfied with the treaty that emerged on May 9, which is to be presented for signing in Rio. But it is widely considered a step forward in that it establishes a process and general commitments aimed at stabilizing greenhouse-gas levels. Even this lowest-common-denominator agreement was nearly derailed at the last moment when Saudi Arabia, whose economy is based on a fossil fuel, tried unsuccessfully to introduce small amendments that could have filibustered the treaty to death.
 
Biological Diversity
 In the talks that produced a treaty on protecting biological diversity two weeks later in Rio, the United States again became a naysayer. But this time it was actually united with other industrialized nations in pressing for strong action on the main point of the treaty -- creating national strategies for protecting ecosystems and integrating protection and economic development.
The bargain struck in Nairobi says that the South will do nothing without Northern money and states flatly that economic development must be its first priority. The concessions to the South, including some less-than-ironclad commitment language, make the treaty less than satisfying to some ardent conservationists. But again, it sets up an international process for long-term management of the problem of species extinction. And for the first time, it institutionalizes the idea of integrating development and conservation by recognizing that preserving jungles and grasslands can bring in money -- through tourism, for instance, or through royalties from companies that develop new drugs from protected plants or gene material from protected animals or microbes.
The United States has refused to sign the treaty, however, and the balkiness stems again from self-interest. American officials say it does too little to protect the patents of companies that share biotechnology with developing countries and that it tries to regulate genetically engineered materials, in which the United States is a leader.
With Rio nearly here, the likelihood is that the international arguing will reach a new pitch as delegates negotiate a declaration of goals and a more detailed blueprint to guide nations in pursuing environmentally friendly economics, as well as a statement of principles on protection of forests. Developing countries, led by Malaysia, which derives much of its national income from logging, have already drastically weakened the statement in preliminary talks.
The overall outcome in Rio will be at least one big measure of how well the world can unite against a danger that all recognize.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "On the Agenda at Rio"
 
The Rio Declaration
 
In its original form, a brief and dramatic "Earth Charter" for protecting the planet. But that was rejected after developing countries wanted language that didn't implicitly recognize their need to build industriesv and put less emphasis on population control and that put more on the responsibilities of rich nations to help poor ones pay for for the cleanups. A longer compromise draft will be considered.
 
Agenda 21
 
A 900-page blueprint for what governments, development agencies and the United Nations should do to protect the environment while letting third world industries grow in the 21st century. It is not legally binding.
 
Treaties
 
A treaty to slow down global warming requires that the 143 signatory countries submit plans for reducing their emissions. The rich countries are asked to aim at returnig to 1990 levels, though they are not required to. They have to report periodically on their progress.
 
A biodiversity treaty was adopted on May 22 by 98 nations who agree to protect ecosystems. It says that rich nations should pay for protection efforts, and that companies that use the plants, animals or microbes of other countries should share the profits and technology with them. The United States, worried about patent protection, will not sign.
 
Negotiations for a legally binding treaty on forestry collapsed when developing countries complained that the talks focused on preventing them from destroying tropical forests but did nothing to control logging in the temperate forests of the United States, Europe and Canada. A "statement of principles ' may be issued. (pg. 6)

Here Comes The Finale; No Need To Applaud

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
One myth of American political culture envisions the Presidential campaign as a kind of Arthurian quest.
A group of men (it is usually men) sets out in pursuit of the great prize, endures many tests and trials (at the hands of the press, the voters and one another) and is gradually winnowed down to the worthiest of their number. Democracy is served, the voters are served, and the candidate who finally emerges is better for what he has endured. 
 So much for the myth. The 1992 primary campaign limping to a close this Tuesday can be described in many ways, but "redemptive" and "ennobling" are not among them. The man about to win the Democratic nomination, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, is struggling to repair the damage he sustained in the getting of it. President Bush dispatched Patrick J. Buchanan early on, but rather than gaining strength from the challenge remains stuck in the polls and still searching for a message.
The hottest candidate on the scene at the moment, Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, is the one who completely bypassed the primaries -- and seems to be prospering in part because of it. Some political professionals worry that a process that used to enlarge a candidate, make him seem more like a leader, has instead become a diminishing experience. "Gennifer Flowers" and "but I didn't inhale" have entered the popular culture, woven in night after night in a succession of comedy monologues. Mr. Clinton has a wary, hurt look to his eyes that he did not have six months ago.
The voters seem heartily dissatisfied, about as gloomy at the end of this season as they were at the start, judging from the polls. The news media, which entered this campaign cycle vowing to provide better, more substantive coverage, are widely accused of reverting to their old habits, an obsession with the horse race and "character issues."
Bruce Buchanan, a professor of government at the University of Texas who headed a major study of Presidential politics for the Markle Foundation after the widely bemoaned 1988 campaign, describes this primary season as plainly "unsatisfying." Perhaps the surest sign of the unhappiness with the process and what it has produced, Professor Buchanan and others say, is the boom for Mr. Perot.
A primary campaign is shaped by many forces -- the candidates, the press, by recessions and riots and other things that have a life of their own. On the Democratic side, much of this campaign was determined a year ago, when Mr. Bush was soaring in the public opinion polls after the war in the Persian Gulf and the Democrats considered most likely to run decided not to. The field that formed was politically young and largely untested in national politics; they collapsed under the rush of the early primaries when most people barely knew their names.
The season had an over-before-it-started feel, in part because of the Democrats' frenetic primary calendar. Party leaders set out to produce an early nominee by encouraging a schedule that was jam-packed with primaries and caucuses in the first month. It worked: Mr. Clinton was in a two-man race with former Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. only a month after the New Hampshire primary. But voters in huge states like California, Ohio and New Jersey, which vote Tuesday, and New York and Pennsylvania, which voted last month, faced very limited choices. The exit polls often reflected voters' anger at the options before them; so did the astonishing rise of Mr. Perot.
Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said, "I wish that important general-election states like California had played a more significant role; it's one of the reasons I urged California to move up." But he still defends the calendar, arguing, "There are inherent advantages in having an early nominee."
Still, many political professionals agree with former Governor Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, who ran for the Democratic nomination in 1988.
"The problem is too much democracy in too few states," Mr. Babbitt said. "The winnowing process is over much too quickly." Mr. Babbitt, like many other Democrats, argues for a more rational, representative schedule of primaries, perhaps determined by lottery. Geography, after all, is often destiny in Presidential politics; Mr. Clinton's lock on his native South, which voted just about en masse on March 10, was critical in his drive toward the nomination.
Many Democrats also make a case for more involvement by party leaders as a kind of safety net to assure that the party ends up with an electable nominee. Much of the disgruntlement in the party last spring came from a sense of powerlessness, a sense that those with the greatest stake in choosing a strong nominee had the least to say in it.
Whenever blame is apportioned for this dispiriting season, the news media get an ample share. "There seemed to be a good deal of good intentions," said Mr. Buchanan, "but along came the Clinton character stuff, and we were off in paroxysms of that."
Gennifer Flowers was a driving force for much of the New Hampshire primary, producing what Marvin Kalb, director of the Joan Shorenstein Barone Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University, calls the "tabloidization of the news." Health care and economic recovery plans paled beside the accusations of marital infidelity and avoiding the draft.
And while television coverage of the campaign began with a far more substantive tone, Mr. Kalb said, the candidates' soundbites shrank on the evening news as the horse race -- who's ahead, where and when -- once again became the driving concern.
But the voters also had something to do with the tone of the season. "People are so disdainful of politics and politicians now that this process almost by definition was going to be an unsatisfactory experience for the voters," argues Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster.
 
The Electorate Myth
 Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat, says: "Much of the critique of politics starts with the assumption that we have this quite well-informed, thoughtful electorate with well-formed preferences, and somehow the political system distorts that. One of the problems with the political system is it sometimes too accurately reflects the public's inconsistencies."
To wit, voters like the benefits of government spending and hate the costs. They like promises of tough, truth-telling leadership and dislike the details, as former Senator Paul E. Tsongas discovered. "I'm no Santa Claus" drew cheers in the abstract; when it got down to higher gas taxes and curtailing entitlements, much of the cheering stopped. Mr. Perot is still in the stage of abstractions: honesty, action, leadership.
As the next phase of the campaign begins, the test for all three men may be whether they can do more than simply reflect the voters' conflicted, cynical mood. For now, the primary season winds down with the ritualistic chorus: "There's got to be a better way."

HEADLINE: CONFERENCE IN RIO/The Rich Vs. the Poor;
Cooling the Globe Would be Nice, But Saving Lives Now May Cost Less

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
One of the frustrations for planners of the Earth Summit in Rio has been the inability of the world's nations to reach agreement on an idea that seems relatively obvious: that something must be done to keep the earth from slowly getting hotter.
Despite the possibility of floods, famines and droughts within the next 50 or 100 years -- though not all scientists are convinced that global warming is a real threat -- the pre-conference talks have already badly split on the issue. Rich nations want poor ones, with their rapid birth rates, to stop scrambling to get more factories and more cars, even if that means they will stay poorer for a while. Poor nations, by contrast, furious that the rich ones have produced far more pollution per person for the last 200 years, want the industrialized countries to be the ones to drive less, plug in less and put expensive scrubbers on their smokestacks -- and they want them to admit that it's more important for poor nations to get out of poverty than to be ecologically pristine. 
 Interestingly enough, many economists, including some outspoken liberals, think the poor nations are right.
The World Bank's 1992 "Development and the Environment" report argues strongly that eliminating poverty should remain the world's top goal. It recognizes that countries will use more energy and pollute more, but argues that growth is a powerful antidote for the kinds of pollution that are killing people right now.
Nearly 2 billion people live without clean water or sewers, and cholera, typhus and other diseases kill two million children a year. One billion live in cities with unsafe sulfur dioxide levels; coal-fired factories spread lung disease and acidify cropland. Leaded gasoline fumes leave many children retarded. Topsoil depletion costs the third world up to 1.5 percent of its annual gross domestic product, and farmers starve.
Sacrificing more people by slowing progress in order to forestall deaths in 50 or 100 years makes no sense, the report concludes.
"Poverty is already a worse killer than any foreseeable environmental distress," said Lawrence H. Summers, chief economist at the World Bank, who calculates that 34 million people a year -- more than live in California -- die of poverty-related causes. "Nobody should kid themselves that they are doing Bangladesh a favor when they worry about global warming."
These economists insist that it is cheaper and fairer for rich countries to shoulder the anti-warming effort. Any funds they spend in the third world should go for things like safe drinking water, sewers, cleaner smokestacks and engines and soil conservation. Education for girls should be another priority, some say, since studies have shown that girls in developing countries with high school educations have an average of three children, while those without average seven.
Economic growth increases pollution, economists admit, but they say that the pendulum eventually begins to swing back. By some estimates, once a nation's per capita income rises to about $4,000, it produces less of some pollutants per capita because it can afford technology like catalytic converters and sewage treatment. Solid waste and carbon dioxide emissions keep increasing, though. Some countries, like Mexico and Russia, are at that $4,000 threshold now.
Poor countries can still fight global warming, the economists say. But the most sensible steps for them to take first are relatively low-cost ones that will also help their economies. For example, eliminating government subsidies on coal and oil will force factories and utilities to become more efficient. Enforcing property rights can slow deforestation. Educating girls can slow population growth.
 
Small Results With High Prices
 "Scientists say there are all these neat things to do for free," said Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, an economics research group. "If it would do so much good now, why haven't we done them? The reasons are political."
In the industrialized world, he points out, even rudimentary steps like adopting taxes on pollution have often been stymied. In the United States, measures like the gas-guzzler tax on big cars and the creation of saleable air-pollution rights have had some effect, but gasoline is still cheap, so there is little incentive to conserve.
On another front, the economists argue that the high price of curbing global warming will yield only small gains.
The World Bank cites estimates that keeping American emissions of greenhouse gases at present levels would cost between 3 and 7 percent of the G.D.P. Three percent equals Federal health spending; 7 percent equals military spending.
The key question is: how much sacrifice is it worth? "You could get rid of highway fatalities if you reduced the speed limit to five miles per hour," said Mr. Hahn. "How much economic growth do you want to give up to buy insurance against global warming?"
 
Like a Recession
 In developing countries, the price might be twice as high, largely because they lack capital, rely heavily on cheap but dirty fuels like wood and charcoal, and have less flexibility since more energy goes for uses like cooking than for air-conditioning.
On the other hand, the economists argue, the costs of global warming, while large, are hardly infinite. William Cline of the Institute for International Economics and others estimate that if the United States's weather became 2 or 3 degrees hotter 50 years from now, the extra costs of adapting -- such as building seawalls and shifting crops -- would equal only 1 to 2 percent of G.D.P., the impact of a mild recession.
In developing countries, putting money into job-creating industries might make more sense, they argue. If every dollar invested today grows to $100 in 50 years, the higher incomes would make climate changes less painful, since people could afford safer housing, more farm irrigation and the like. "The evidence implies that investments with real rate of return as low as 5 percent do more for future generations than investments in large reductions of greenhouse gas emissions," the report said.
The scariest prospects involve the damage to agriculture. But as many economists have pointed out, most famines in recent centuries have been caused not by food shortages but by poverty. As a whole, the world grows more food than it can eat. With higher incomes, poor countries could buy more.
Economists with environmental groups say these estimates are too conservative, and, more important, that they miss the point.
"The approach that 'We'll be 1 to 6 percent less rich' leaves out the risk of catastrophe," said Mr. Cline. And models that rely on the American economy do not take into account the devastation of, for instance, hurricanes in Bangladesh after ocean levels rise.
"It's very difficult for economists to conceive of cataclysm," said David Batker, an economist for the environmental organization Greenpeace.
The debate is apt to continue long after the Rio meeting adjourns. "If science were more certain that we were going to hell in a handbasket," said Mr. Hahn, "you'd get more consensus."

HEADLINE: Dinkins and Council Reach Accord on $29 Billion Budget

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins and the City Council reached an accord on the basics of a $29.5 billion budget for New York City yesterday, nearly a month ahead of schedule and three hours before Mr. Dinkins was to take off for Europe on an economic-development trip.
Mr. Dinkins and Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone announced late yesterday afternoon that they had agreed to add $88 million for schools and other programs to the budget proposed by the Mayor last month, to be paid for by changes in revenue estimates and trims in administrative spending.
 
Police and Parks Gain
 But the settlement, the earliest in recent memory, represented only minor changes in the Mayor's plan. In some ways, its greatest significance lies in its being reached so early and so amicably, signs of an improvement in the city's fiscal picture and a consensus among Council leaders that the Mayor's budget proposal was sound. 
 In addition to money for schools, the Mayor and speaker said funds were being restored for police, parks, highway cleaning, cultural institutions and city colleges.
City officials said that to allow the Board of Education to keep elementary class sizes at 25 students, they restored $34 million to its budget. About $10 million was added back to allow the Police Department to go forward with a program of using civilians to replace officers at desk jobs, and $48 million was reinstated for park maintenance, highway cleaning, cultural institutions and services for college students.
The changes from the budget the Mayor proposed last month are to be paid for by $47 million in other cuts, mainly across-the-board administrative cuts at city agencies, $35 million in higher tax-revenue estimates in the 1993 fiscal year and $6 million in additional state aid.
Even with the restorations, the budget agreement still cuts city services by some $201 million, meaning fewer jail beds, bumpier roads, deferred sewer repairs, the elimination of a fire battalion and engine company and reduction of about 16,500 city jobs through attrition over four years.
The budget also cuts spending by $235 million through "streamlining" initiatives, like reducing administrative and office staffs at city agencies, and by $129 million through "restructuring" initiatives, like consolidating scofflaw towing and privatizing some city-owned housing.
Late yesterday, at a news conference at City Hall to announce the accord, the Mayor, surrounded by City Council members, acknowledged that the budget was not "going to please everybody."
 
A 'Prudent' Pact
 "But it is prudent, thoughtful and fair," he said. "It doesn't spend money we don't have -- nor does it begrudge New Yorkers the programs and services that make our city a decent, humane and livable place."
Mr. Vallone, in remarks that pointed to the contrast to last year's long and painful budget struggle, joked that the talks had been hurried up so that Council members could take advantage of new low air fares and accompany the Mayor. "This is the best I've seen in the years I've been here,' Mr. Vallone said of both the process and the budget itself.
Mr. Vallone had set an informal deadline of Mr. Dinkins's departure for the agreement, vowing that the Council would pass its own budget in his absence if no accord was reached.
The budget agreement, which goes before the full City Council for ratification later this week, is for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Budgets are usually not approved until the end of June, when the state has finally fashioned its budget and the city knows exactly how much money it can expect in state aid.
Since there was general agreement on the Mayor's spending proposal and the state approved its budget on time this year, Mr. Vallone strongly suggested that both sides reach an agreement by the June 5 deadline imposed in the City Charter, which is almost always bypassed, aides to the Speaker said.
 
Before European Trip
 Because the Mayor planned to be in Europe on June 5, it was decided late last week that the two sides would try to reach an agreement before his departure last night.
Participants on both sides of the negotiations said that the breakthrough in the talks came late Thursday when the Council and administration agreed that only about $41 million could actually be added to the spending plan. The compromise represented a retreat by Council budget officials, who had estimated earlier in the week that as much as $100 million in unanticipated revenue would be available.
In stark contrast to the city's last two budgets, which contained deep service cuts, the spending plan agreed to yesterday reflects a slight upswing in the city's economy that gives the Mayor and the Council a fiscal breathing spell, with the chance to restore some of the programs and services that were cut and to create new ones.
The Mayor had already been making use of the easing of gloom to make a series of announcements that represented some of the only good news he has had to publicize since tax revenues began to plummet as he took office. Last month, as he proposed his budget, the Mayor announced that libraries would be open for longer hours, new health clinics built, new tuberculosis programs created and other improvements in city services made. The final budget includes all these programs and in fact speeds up the timetable for libraries in all five boroughs to resume five-day service.
Perhaps the most important development has been the substantial surplus that budget officials predict the city will realize at the end of this fiscal year. The surplus -- projected at $515 million last week -- will allow the city to avoid borrowing to help balance the new budget and will offset hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal funds and new taxes that the city will not receive.
Mayor Dinkins had initially planned to close major gaps in the budget by borrowing $250 million with the help of the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation, but bond raters and fiscal monitors strongly resisted that plan, warning that such an arrangement could jeopardize the city's credit ratings.
 
Some Financing Fell Through
 The Mayor's spending plan also had assumed $200 million in Federal anti-recessionary funds that have not been forthcoming, and $115 million in new local taxes, which the City Council supported but both parties agreed to abandon last week when it became clear that the State Legislature would not approve them.
Mr. Dinkins had threatened to make deeper cuts in the budget, including layoffs, if the state did not approve the taxes, but as estimates for the city's budget surplus began to grow, the administration said that the surplus would more than make up for the proposed taxes.
The surplus comes from several sources, including deep spending cuts over the last two years, higher than expected city tax revenue, an untapped general reserve fund and money set aside for contracts that are no longer needed.
But the surplus also created some political problems for the Mayor. Chief among them is one that is not resolved by yesterday's agreement: Leaders of the city's municipal labor unions, which are working without contracts, demanded wage increases and accused the Mayor of distorting the budget outlook to win concessions from them. And the surplus killed any chance of winning approval in Albany for new taxes.
But Dinkins administration officials maintain that the city is not out of the woods yet financially and that this year's surplus may not occur next year, when the city must close equally large projected deficits.

HEADLINE: U.N. VOTES 13-0 FOR EMBARGO ON TRADE WITH YUGOSLAVIA; AIR TRAVEL AND OIL CURBED

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 30

 BODY:
Rejecting last-minute Serbian appeals for a delay, the Security Council voted overwhelmingly today to follow the Bush Administration's lead and impose tough economic sanctions on the Yugoslav Government in an effort to force Belgrade try to bring peace to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In addition to calling for the establishment of a "security zone" around the Sarajevo airport to allow emergency supplies to be flown into the Bosnian capital, today's resolution committed the Council to "consider immediately, whenever necessary, further steps to achieve a peaceful solution in conformity with relevant resolutions of the Council." [Excerpts from the resolution, Page 8.]
 
U.S. to Seize Yugoslav Assets
 Although the resolution, which passed with 13 votes in favor and two abstentions, made no specific reference to using force, some Council members are informally discussing the possibility of a naval blockade of the Adriatic ports and closing Bosnian air space to Serbian planes that are supporting forces fighting there. In Sarajevo today, Bosnian Serbs and Muslim Slavs battled at an army barracks, but the Serbs were later reported to have ordered their troops to halt artillery fire.. 
 Tonight, President Bush ordered the Treasury Department to seize all Yugoslav Government assets in the United States by Monday. The White House said they amounted to about $200 million.
"The grave events in Serbia and Montenegro constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States," Mr. Bush said in a statement.
 
Loopholes Are Seen
 Together with the comprehensive ban on all commercial and financial links imposed on Iraq before the Persian Gulf war, today's decision by the Security Council represents the second time that it has taken punitive action against an aggressor nation since the end of the cold war.
In Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, economists and Western diplomats agreed that the sanctions would impose hardships on the republic but that contingency plans and loopholes were likely to enable the Serbian economy to function for a long time. [Page 8.]
Today's embargo, which closely resembles the sanctions against Iraq, requires all the countries of the world to cease trading in any commodity, including oil, with the Yugoslav federation formed by Serbia and Montenegro and to freeze all its foreign assets.
All air traffic links to and from the country must also be suspended and no one may repair, service, operate, insure or provide spare parts for aircraft registered in Serbia or Montenegro.
In addition, the resolution bans Serbia and Montenegro from participating in any international sporting events. It requires all countries to suspend cultural, scientific and technical contacts with Belgrade and to reduce the size of its foreign diplomatic missions.
Russia dropped its earlier reservations about the embargo and voted in favor of the sanctions. In a strong statement issued in Moscow today, Russia said Belgrade had "brought upon itself the United Nations sanctions by failing to heed the demands of the international community."
China, traditionally reluctant about Security Council interference in any country's internal affairs, abstained, but did not threaten to block sanctions with its veto as a permanent Council member. Zimbabwe, one of the Council's six third-world members, also abstained. But the other five, India, Cape Verde, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Morocco, one of the embargo's sponsors, supported the move, as did Austria and Japan. Other members voting for sanctions were the other sponsors of the resolution: the United States, Britain, France, Belgium and Hungary.
As the Council voted, Serbia began an eleventh hour bid to avert sanctions. In letters to President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia asked the United States and Russia to place "all the forces involved" in the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina under their joint command.
 
Serbs Appeal for Conference
 Earlier today the Serbian leadership cabled Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to ask him to propose an international conference on the Balkans crisis instead of sanctions.
"It's bobbing and weaving," said a Western diplomat in Belgrade. "The time for proposals like this has long passed. The Serbian side has to act quickly and unilaterally to stop the brutal destruction of Sarajevo and the aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina. Words are not enough."
The new sanctions package came some 10 days after Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d lost patience with the European Community's efforts to negotiate a peace settlement in the former Yugoslav federation. He bluntly accused Serbia of stirring up a civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and said the Security Council should impose sanctions on Yugoslavia. At the time he pointedly refused to rule out international military intervention to end the fighting and allow relief supplies to reach suffering people.
After the United States sat on the sidelines for months, the Secretary of State's intervention, made at a conference in Lisbon, represented a reassertion of American leadership in the Balkans crisis and finally forced the hesitant Europeans to approve a separate, less onerous sanctions package against Belgrade earlier this week.
Explaining his decision on Yugoslav assets, Mr. Bush said, "The measures I have taken today express our outrage at the actions of the Serbian and Montegrin governments and will prevent those governments from drawing on monies and properties within U.S. control."
 
Weapons Deliveries Banned
 The Security Council has already banned all deliveries of weapons and other military material to any of the constituent republics of the former Yugoslav federation.
The aim of these sanctions, the resolution says, is to force the Serbian authorities in Belgrade to cooperate with the demands the Security Council laid out earlier this month in Resolution 752, which called for an immediate cease-fire and an end to ethnic oppression in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This means Belgrade must cease all interference in Bosnia and Herzegovina and use its influence to promote a general cease-fire, oversee the disbanding and disarming of elements of the Yugoslav National Army and irregular forces and end efforts to create an purely Serbian enclave by driving out other ethnic groups.
 
Belgrade Condemned
 In the Security Council discussion, speaker after speaker condemned the authorities in Belgrade for deliberately encouraging ethnic conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"There is no doubt the principal responsibility lies with the civil and military authorities in Belgrade," said Sir David Hannay, the British representative. "Multiple rocket launchers are not found in Serbian peasants' barns. Somebody puts them there."
But while today's resolution is directed principally at Serbia, it also expresses concern at cease-fire violations and acts of racial discrimination in Croatia and calls on all parts of the former Yugoslav federation to cooperate with the European Community's peace conference for the region.
 
France Opposes Ban on Sports
 The vote was also delayed by a last-minute attempt by France to delete the ban on sports at the personal request of President Francois Mitterrand. But France eventually dropped its demand in return for language clarifying that the Serbs are not solely responsible for the crisis in the Balkans, diplomats said.
At least 2,200 people are known to have died in Bosnia and Herzegovina since Croats and Muslim Slavs, who together make up more than 60 percent of its 4.3 million people, voted in February to secede from the Yugoslav federation.
Bosnia's Serbs opposed independence and have fought with help from Belgrade and the Yugoslav Army to carve out an enclave for itself by driving away other ethnic groups.
The United Nations has already dispatched a large peacekeeping force to monitor the fragile truce that ended ethnic fighting in Croatia and Slovenia that broke out after they declared independence. But the organization was forced to withdraw its token presence from Sarajevo earlier this month as a result of the intense fighting there.
In addition, the United Nations and other relief agencies have been hindered and harassed in their efforts to help the more than 500,000 people driven from their homes by the fighting.
And the Secretary General has said that many of the warring factions there are actively trying to deny food and medicine to some civilians to force them to move elsewhere.
Sales of medicine and food were exempted from today's trade embargo, but the Security Council committee established to monitor compliance must be notified of such shipments. 

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Fighting Continues in Sarajevo
 BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, May 30 (AP) -- Bosnian Serbs battled Muslim Slavs at an army barracks today in Sarajevo.
Apparently reacting to an appeal from President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, leaders of Bosnian Serbs said later that they were ordering their forces to halt artillery fire in the republic's capital, the Yugoslav news agency Tanyug reported.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
Pressure Is Growing on President To Bring Baker In for Campaign

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
Warned by friends and advisers that his re-election is imperiled by Ross Perot's unexpected strength and a perception that he is not doing anything about the country's problems, President Bush is under growing pressure to call in Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to rescue his campaign.
Mr. Bush today denied published reports that a senior aide, Robert A. Mosbacher, the titular campaign chairman, had urged him to dismiss Samuel K. Skinner as chief of staff and replace him with Mr. Baker. 
 Friends and advisers of Mr. Bush, Administration officials and Republican strategists said the President had indeed made no decision to shake up a team that he rearranged six months ago in hopes of stopping his political slide.
 
Baker Reported Reluctant
 But Mr. Bush not only failed to rebound, he is also now facing a challenge from Mr. Perot that he had never taken into account. And a friend of the President said there was an "inexorable logic" building to have Mr. Baker leave the State Department and take over the White House and re-election teams, just as he resigned as Treasury Secretary in 1988 to salvage Mr. Bush's faltering campaign to succeed President Ronald Reagan.
 
Air of Expectancy
 The friend said Mr. Bush had not approached Mr. Baker and that the Secretary, who has been assiduously polishing his reputation as a statesman, "doesn't want this." But he said State Department officials were beginning to adjust to the notion that Mr. Baker would leave, and that if he did, it was expected that Lawrence S. Eagleburger, his deputy, would be made Secretary of State, as a caretaker during the election season.
The idea of bringing Mr. Baker into the campaign has been long discussed but now seems to have moved out of the realm of gossip to take on a new air of expectancy.
Calling in Mr. Baker would pose problems for Mr. Bush. It would raise questions about his often-declared commitment to policy over politics, especially in foreign affairs, and contribute to the notion that he is paralyzed politically without Mr. Baker.
"The last thing Bush wants is to be viewed as someone who can't get elected without his pal Jim Baker; that would be a humiliation," a longtime associate of Mr. Bush said today.
Traveling in California, Mr. Bush banged his hand on the roof of his limousine and said, "No. Absolutely not," when reporters asked if Mr. Mosbacher had urged Mr. Skinner's removal, as The Washington Post had reported.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said, "The President's very satisfied with the conduct of the White House and campaign staffs." Mr. Skinner denied the rumors on Friday night, and Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, said today that no staff changes were imminent.
It is impossible to assess such denials fully, since the White House flatly denies any major personnel change as a matter of routine, right up to the moment it is announced.
In recent weeks, Mr. Bush, Mr. Baker and other top Administration and campaign officials have been deluged with telephone calls complaining about the performance of the White House under Mr. Skinner and urging the President to replace him, officials and Republican strategists say.
"The message is that they can't make any kind of decision at the White House; they have no policy concept and no idea how to sell anything," a Bush adviser said, speaking, as most of the others did, on the basis that he not be identified.
 
Alarm Over Perot
 These long-smoldering complaints have been fanned by a showing by Mr. Perot that is far stronger than the White House had expected, by alarm among Bush advisers that the tepid economic recovery has so far not translated into a gain in Mr. Bush's popularity, and by a growing concern that Gov. Bill Clinton, while still struggling, may be recovering from his political wounds. That has undercut the central pillars of the Bush team's strategy.
Mr. Baker and Mr. Mosbacher, who has no real authority over the campaign, discussed the situation over a round of golf recently and concluded that some sort of change was needed, officials said.
Mr. Mosbacher was also said to have told friends about a recent fund-raising dinner in Texas at which an oilman who had contributed to Mr. Bush said he would not vote for the President this year.
Mr. Baker, Mr. Mosbacher, Vice President Dan Quayle and other senior officials were angered by the White House's confused response last week to a speech by Mr. Quayle in San Francisco in which he made his attack on the "Murphy Brown" television show. The White House issued a series of contradictory reactions to Mr. Quayle's accusation that the show had sent the wrong message by having its main character give birth to an illegitimate child.
Mr. Mosbacher expressed his concerns to Mr. Bush at a meeting last week after he returned from a trip to Spain, officials said. Several Bush aides dismissed these reports, saying that Mr. Mosbacher has little influence.
"I don't think anybody's happy with our progress in the polls," one aide said. "How could you be when the President's positives aren't going up and his negatives aren't going down? But it's nervous Nellies that get unnerved this early in the game and depart from the track you're on."
Robert M. Teeter, the campaign chairman, said Mr. Mosbacher had said nothing to him about a staff shake-up. "Mosbacher and I have had several conversations about the need to pick up the pace and get things moving faster," Mr. Teeter said.
 
Skinner and Bad Will
 A senior Bush aide said that Mr. Skinner had been talking to his own staff about "the need to restructure the way they operate." The aide said Mr. Skinner had generated some bad will by effectively demoting four or five White House aides and that there were complaints that he "delegates too much."
Noting that such complaints are not new, and that there have been several flurries of rumors about staff changes in the Bush team, a Republican strategist said: "What's different now is the high level of disappointment with the White House. It is striking when one travels around the country just how contemptuous the operatives, the state chairmen, the Bush-Quayle people are of the current team."
The strategist added: "One thing that has changed is the complacency that Perot was going to collapse and Clinton was dead, so even if we mess up we're going to win it. People do really believe now that we can lose the election."
White House aides were alarmed last week by reports that Mr. Perot was talking to a string of Washington political consultants, including several former aides to Mr. Bush or Mr. Reagan who had been shut out of the 1992 re-election organization. "It suddenly seemed like the Bush camp was driving Republicans into Perot's arms," one official said.
As for the Democrats, George Stephanopoulos, the communications director for the Clinton campaign, suggested the Administration was overreacting to Mr. Perot's threat.
"We are going to take Perot very seriously, but it's also important not to panic," Mr. Stephanopoulos said. "The White House is in an uproar. We're going to continue to show people who Bill Clinton is, and the more people see of him, the more they'll like him."

HEADLINE: CBS Discloses Plan To Begin Charging Fees to Its Affiliates

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
CBS announced a plan yesterday that would radically alter the way the television network deals with its affiliate stations, by charging the stations fees to carry certain programs.
To explain the need for the change, the network cited low profits and increased competition from cable networks, the Fox network and program syndicators. 
 CBS executives say they must change certain fundamental procedures of the broadcasting business to respond to the new competition. "We are now in a leadership position and we have to institute changes," said a senior CBS executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "This will not be the last move we make to change the way the broadcasting business is conducted."
In an interview after a meeting of the affiliates in New York, Anthony Malara, the president of affiliate relations for CBS, called the plan "the most dramatic change in the economic relationship between a network and its affiliated stations in 25 years."
The move is expected to be vigorously opposed by many stations and could lead to some stations' seeking to leave CBS for a different network, or to stations' carrying fewer CBS programs than they did in the past.
"Some station owners are very upset and think we're crazy," Mr. Malara said. He conceded that the plan carries risks but added, "Retaliation by the stations could end up killing us both."
In various markets, if stations leave CBS, viewers might have to lose certain CBS programs, or look elsewhere for them.
Neither NBC nor ABC officials could be reached for comment, but in the past, when one network has changed its compensation system, the others have followed.
Although the network will continue to pay its affiliates compensation for carrying its programming, the move sets a precedent by establishing a payment to the networks. The networks pay the compensation to establish and maintain the coast-to-coast distribution needed to broadcast commercials nationally. The compensation has varied, depending on the size of a station's television market.
But for several years, as new owners have come to control the networks and as profits have diminished, many efforts have been made to change the system. Reductions have already taken place at all three networks.
CBS is in a position of strength now and apparently felt able to take this step because of the significant comeback in its performance, especially in prime time in the last year. The network is predicting that its programs will be even more popular in the next television season.
Despite its ratings success, the CBS network lost money last year, furthering the corporate pressure to seek the reductions in compensation payments.
Two years ago, CBS cut its compensation to its 200 stations from $150 million to $121 million. CBS said that amount still left the network paying the most in compensation, although it is generally thought to have the best lineup of stations. NBC instituted a plan to base compensation more on the individual performance of a station.
CBS's chairman, Laurence A. Tisch, has been among the most adamant in seeking to change the compensation system, which he has criticized as outdated. Mr. Tisch has been known to feel that the CBS stations already have the benefit of being able to sell local commercials on network programs and should not require further inducements to carry the network schedule.
 
Stations Also Hit Hard
 But stations have been as hard hit as the networks by a slump in television advertising, and they have resisted every effort to change compensation agreements. Talks between the stations and CBS about a new compensation plan ended when the stations walked out earlier this year.
CBS argued in its official statement of the new affiliate plan that the benefits of the network-affiliate partnership flow both ways, and that the stations should be willing to give something back to the network for programming and promotion costs, and news coverage.
Starting Jan. 1, the network intends to impose what it is calling an affiliation charge. Though the network also said it was not cutting the compensation it pays to stations, the charge amounts to a virtual exchange of dollars.
Stations would still get compensation from CBS, but they would then have to pay the charge to the network at a varying rate depending on market size. For the top 100 markets, the charge would be 25 percent of the overall compensation. For the next 50 stations in size the charge would be 20 percent, and the rest of the slightly more than 200 stations would have to give back 15 percent of their compensation.
 
Incentives for Weak Shows
 Another part of the agreement calls for a realignment of the way compensation is paid. CBS said it intended to maximize the incentive for stations to carry prime-time programs as opposed to shows in other parts of the day. That proposal could make CBS's morning news program vulnerable to pre-emptions by disgruntled stations.
But CBS also said very little would be paid for hit programs, which stations would presumably be loathe to pre-empt, but more would be paid for weaker programs that are often the target of syndicators who are now willing to pay compensation themselves to stations to carry those programs.
"Common sense says that we should not pay the same amount for '60 Minutes' or 'Murphy Brown' as opposed to other programs that are not so highly rated," Mr. Malara told the affiliates.
The network also plans to pull back from the stations what it calls soft commercial inventory, commercial spots that are difficult for stations to sell in certain sports, daytime and morning programs.
The network valued that commercial time at $4 million to $5 million. It said the overall value of the new agreement to CBS was in the range of $20 million to $25 million.
But the new agreements will require CBS to draw up new affiliation contracts with every single CBS station and presumably would open each station to the possibility of signing on with a different network.

HEADLINE: Rash of Brain Defects in Newborns Disturbs Border City in Texas

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BROWNSVILLE, Tex., May 26

 BODY:
For three years babies have been born with missing or incomplete brains and other devastating neurological defects at a startling rate in this border city, and although the cause remains a mystery, United States officials are now investigating whether industrial pollution from Mexico might be at fault.
Since January 1989 at least 42 babies have been born in Cameron County, at the southeastern tip of Texas, with various manifestations of a condition known as neural-tube defect . That is about three times as many cases as would normally be expected, said Dr. Dennis Perrotta, chief of the epidemiology division of the Texas Department of Health. 
 In Brownsville, the outbreak has primarily involved anencephaly, a condition in which a baby is born with all or part of its brain missing. The victims are generally stillborn or die within days of birth. Some fetuses, however, developed spina bifida, an often survivable deformity of the spinal cord that causes paralysis and other severe neurological problems.
Across the border from Brownsville, in Matamoros, Mexican officials have reported 42 cases of neural-tube defects over an 18-month period that began at roughly the time as the outbreak on the United States side, Dr. Perrotta said. He said data were still being gathered to determine how the new cases in Matamoros differ from the average rate there.
On the Texas side, most of the babies have been born to Hispanic mothers living in poverty near the Rio Grande. Most of the births seem to have been in the spring. But Dr. Perrotta said that these patterns were tenuous and that no common factors in the parents' lives had been discovered to explain the outbreak.
 
U.S. to Test for Pollution
 Speculation has focused on the industries that have grown rapidly along the Mexican side of the Rio Grande as a result of cheap labor and special tariff provisions in Mexican law. Last week, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency said it would conduct a two-year study to assess the presence of toxic chemicals and other pollutants in the Rio Grande along the 889-mile border it forms between the United States and Mexico.
"This study is urgent," William K. Reilly, the agency's administrator, said in making the announcement. "We need it, and we need it now, to find out whether environmental pollution is causing the high incidence of birth defects in the lower Rio Grande Valley and whether the health of residents along the border is at risk."
Environmental groups have sought such a study for several years. They say the industrial plants on the Mexican side of the river, many of them owned by United States companies, take advantage of lax enforcement of Mexican laws by releasing toxic chemicals into the river and the air.
The charges have taken on an added urgency since the Bush Administration began negotiating a free trade agreement with Mexico in the last year. Even if no link is established between the pollution and the birth defects, an official finding that toxic industrial wastes are entering the Rio Grande from Mexico could complicate the delicate politics underscoring negotiations on the free trade agreement.
Among many of Brownsville's 107,000 residents, those issues seem abstract compared with the very immediate fear that something unseen is attacking the unborn.
Teresa Salazar and her sister-in-law, who lives next door in a neighborhood of wood-frame shacks near the Rio Grande, were pregnant at the same time last year.
In March, Mrs. Salazar, who is 29 years old, delivered a stillborn child with a severe neural-tube defect; her sister-in-law later gave birth to a healthy child. Mrs. Salazar and her neighbors are troubled by the uncertainty about what caused the defects.
"The truth is, yes, there's a lot of worry," she said, "I have friends who want to get pregnant, yet they're afraid the same thing might happen to them."
Like other Mexican border cities, Matamoros, with a population of more than 400,000, has experienced rapid industrial development in recent years. Much of it consists of maquiladoras (pronounced ma-kee-la-DO-ras), plants built by United States companies to take advantage of special provisions of Mexican law allowing them to import equipment and raw materials from the United States and export their products back to the States virtually free of duties.
 
'Something Environmental'
 In Brownsville, a loosely knit group of professionals and local leaders has been trying to find out what is causing the brain defects.
All that is known about anencephaly is that it develops soon after conception, when the neural tube, an embryonic structure that normally develops into the brain and spinal cord, fails to close.
"There's no clear evidence to prove it, but until a better explanation comes up, it seems to me we're dealing with something environmental," said Dr. Timothy P. Thurber, a pediatrician who is part of the group. "Especially because the majority of the women live in a part of town that is close to the river and where the prevailing winds carry the vapors from the plants on the other side."
Last year the National Toxic Campaign, an environmental group based in Boston, said its monitoring had revealed toxic discharges far in excess of American standards coming from maquiladoras in Matamoros and elsewhere along the border.
 
No Scientific Consensus
 About 4,000 babies a year are born in the United States with neural-tube defects, and in 90 to 95 percent of the cases no clear cause can be pinpointed, said Dr. Joe Leigh Simpson, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Tennessee at Memphis.
"Industrial pollutants have been touted as a cause in some studies, but it is fair to say that there is no consensus in the scientific community on this," said Dr. Simpson, who has conducted extensive research on neural-tube defects, although he has not taken part in the Brownsville investigations. The detective work is further complicated because the genetic makeup of individual women, or groups of women, may make them more susceptible than others to environmental, nutritional or other potential causes of the defects, the experts say.
"To come in and exonerate any one factor or to conclude that the answer lies in the fact that women live within a mile of a particular plant, is to offer a simplistic answer to an extremely complicated problem," Dr. Simpson said.
In Brownsville, Dr. Perrotta said his office had calculated that neural-tube defects are occurring in the Brownsville area at a rate of 15 for every 10,000 births, compared with the national average of 4 to 5 for 10,000 births.
But he said, "For all the speculation going around, our studies have not found a smoking gun."

Officials are to begin studying whether industrial pollution from Mexico along the Rio Grande is to blame. (Hart Van Denburg for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Bush Says He Seeks Balance on the Environment

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FRESNO, Calif., May 30

 BODY:
President Bush today defended his rejection of a treaty to protect biological species that will have broad support at the Earth Summit opening next week in Rio de Janeiro, saying he is "fighting for balance" between environmental needs and the health of the American economy.
"We cannot accept standards that are not based on the soundest of science," Mr. Bush said. "And we cannot shut down the lives of thousands of Americans by going to extremes" on environmental policy. 
 He spoke a day after the Administration announced that it would not sign a global convention on preserving biological diversity, to be offered at the Earth Summit because of concern that it would require the United States to strengthen laws protecting endangered species.
The Administration has recently increased efforts to limit the Endangered Species Act, one of the oldest American environmental laws.
In recent years, the timber industry and others have campaigned against the law, arguing that it does not fairly balance environmental and economic interests.
The State Department issued a written defense today of the decision not to sign the biodiversity treaty.
It argued that the United States' record in preserving threatened plants and animals is "unparalleled" and that the treaty, which was negotiated with the approval of 98 nations last week, violates earlier agreements on the means by which developed nations would help finance environmental programs in poorer countries.
"The United States is prepared to help others protect our world's biological resources," the statement said, "but the funding must be workable."
The State Department said the proposed treaty would impinge on world patent and copyright agreements and would unfairly penalize the developing biotechnology industry.
The White House said on Friday that Mr. Bush would attend the Earth Summit in mid-June, a day or two after a stop in Panama on June 11.
Mr. Bush responded to questions here in Fresno, in the San Joaquin Valley of California, one of the nation's most productive agricultural areas. He said he had earlier withheld a decision on whether to attend the Earth Summit because he "also wanted sound economic policy" to be written into its treaties.
The President said he would attend after negotiators agreed to strike language in a second treaty, aimed at curbing global warming, that would have set goals and timetables for nations to cut their emissions of certain industrial pollutants.
Mr. Bush said today that the United Nations-sponsored conference "started off getting requirements that nobody could keep" because they were unreasonably stringent. But now, he said, "we've got something really sound" to which he could pledge adherence.
Mr. Bush has come under sharp criticism from some environmental leaders in this country and abroad for his positions. Critics say the United States' refusal to support stronger controls on pollution and other environmental hazards has undercut a consensus among most of the world's other nations to slow or reverse damage to the environment.
Mr. Bush disagreed today. "My general philosophy is that we've got a good, sound environmental practice," he said. "I think we've got something to be really proud of and to take to Rio."
The President also announced a program that would encourage property owners to restore wetlands lost to development.
The Administration has proposed spending $160.9 million in Agriculture Department funds next year on the program, which would purchase up to a million acres in land easements from property owners who agree to convert unused acreage to the original wetlands state.
The pilot program would cover nine states and restore about 50,000 acres of wetlands.
The White House said that the United States has lost about half its 221 million acres of wetlands since colonists began arriving in the 17th century.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Voters;
Perot Petition Embraced As Manifesto of Change

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SHERMAN OAKS, Calif., May 29

 BODY:
Ross Perot has struck political gold here in the San Fernando Valley, and the rush is on. By the thousands, people are signing petitions to put him on the November Presidential ballot, not merely affixing their names but appending a "Yes!" A rap on the table. An "All right!" A grin that says they are up to mischief and are proud of it.
"This makes me feel good; this makes me feel very good," Clayton Zonshine, a 40-year-old Democrat who voted for Michael S. Dukakis four years ago, said as he signed a Perot petition. "Bush, Clinton are politicians. They talk out of both sides of their mouths. Mr. Perot gets things done." 
 With the primary less than a week away in this, the most populous state, these days ought to belong to the presumed Democratic and Republican standard-bearers, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and President Bush. But here, as in much of the country, they belong to Mr. Perot.
 
Declaration for Independent
 Two, 10, 20 at a time, people are lining up at shopping malls and on street corners to sign petitions for a candidate who is not on the ballot Tuesday and for whom write-in votes will not be counted. This is John Hancock 1992, the signature as protest and empowerment, writ large so as to be not just a name but a shout.
"I hope Bush and Clinton read this," Gypsi Luck-Morford, a 30-year-old psychology student at California State University at Northridge, said as she signed. "Really, I do. I want them to see my name. I hate politicians. It's all lip-service and no action. I want a doer. I don't know anything about Perot except that he's not a politician. That's enough for me."
In five days of interviews and chats with about 100 voters in the San Fernando Valley north of downtown Los Angeles, the support for Mr. Perot seemed almost a fervor. His backing appeared to draw from Democrats and Republicans, young and old, men and women.
But Mr. Perot was also something of a blank screen onto which people projected what they hoped to find in a President. In the same line of petition signers, a 67-year-old Republican praised Mr. Perot as a friend to business while a 22-year-old Democrat said he would be good "for the karma of the country."
 
Old Fashioned Populism
 On television, Mr. Clinton's image is pervasive, thanks to campaign commercials, but on the streets there's no sign of his candidacy or Mr. Bush's, as if the energy has been sapped. The Perot campaign, on the other hand, is everywhere to be seen, an old-fashioned political revival of buttons and T-shirts, rallies and posters, brass bands and bumper stickers.
Mr. Perot is paying the rent for some of the larger store fronts, but the impression is of a campaign by the people. It is led by a volunteer corps of students, housewives, retired businessmen and the unemployed, most of whom said they had never been politically active. Most of the costs are covered by donations and the sale of campaign items.
It all has a spark of fun to it, of being part of a movement that is turning the political establishment on its ear. And that includes the news media, which many of Mr. Perot's supporters seem to feel have put themselves above the people, dictating for whom citizens will and will not vote.
"The press doesn't like him," 62-year-old Harry Rosen said with devilish delight. "He screwed up their plans. He interrupts them. He's not interested in the bull from Sam Donaldson."
 
To Each, His Own Perot
 In some ways, Mr. Perot is getting the treatment voters gave a decade ago to Ronald Reagan, a man who caught their spirit and in whom they were willing to overlook flaws. Most people acknowledge that they know little about him, saying they are drawn to his business accomplishments, to his unvarnished folksy ways and to a give-'em-Hell style that many petition signers compared to Harry S. Truman's. People are doing very nicely concocting their own vision of Mr. Perot, thank you, and they don't want anyone tinkering with it.
"George Bush is a good ol' boy from Texas who made a lot of money in oil and has lost touch," said 43-year-old Marilyn Johnston.
Asked if that did not apply to Mr. Perot, too, she became indignant. "No, not at all," she said. After a few seconds of thought, she added, "I suppose Mr. Perot may be a good ol' boy, but he went out and made his own money, started from nothing. God bless him. Bush was born into money."
 
Amazed He Wants the Job
 One of the paradoxes of the Perot campaign is that in an age when many people are fed up with the extravagances and greed that marked the Reagan years, they nonetheless embrace the billionaire from Texas, finding it almost noble that a man who is what they aspire to be would deign to consider the Presidency. The other candidates are referred to as "Bush" and "Clinton," but more often than not, the billionaire is called "Mr. Perot".
"Mr. Perot's his own man," said 64-year-old Dolores Flanigan. "He doesn't owe special interests anything. You wonder why a man of his accomplishment would want the job."
In a throwback to the 1920's, many seem to feel that the business of the country is exactly that: business, perhaps best left to someone with that background, even during a crisis like the Los Angeles riots.
"I don't know what Ross Perot is going to do about the inner cities," said Mr. Rosen. "But he's a smart man. He'll figure it out. If you can make billions of dollars, you must be doing something right, yes?"
Said Richard Irby, a 22-year-old student at Los Angeles Pierce College in Woodland Hills: "Maybe what we need is a businessman. Let's give him the shot. He can't do any worse than the politicians have.
Mr. Irby added: "Perot said he would have come right away when the riots started. He sounded sincere. Bush just came to get his picture taken."
Asked about Mr. Clinton, he said, "I don't have any sense of him. He's like mush."
 
Competence and Strength
 Throughout the interviews with Mr. Perot's supporters, Mr. Bush was often described as inept, while Mr. Clinton was described as spineless. The questions of character that dogged Mr. Clinton in earlier state primaries, like whether he had engaged in an extramarital affair, are almost never being raised here.
"Perot took on General Motors; he took on the high-school football interests in Texas," said Stephanie Claxton, a 32-year-old Republican who said she voted for Mr. Dukakis four years ago. "Every time I see Bush I think less of him. Clinton means well, but what's he stand for? He's always looking over his shoulder at who he might offend."
To be sure, not everyone here is on the Perot bandwagon. A few said they saw fascist overtones in the nation's longing for a strong leader, like Mr. Perot, who would sweep aside critics and tell the nation what to do.
"I'm frightened by him, by his power," said Arlette Coblenz. "It's dictatorship."
 
Some Signers Skeptical
 Others said that while they were intrigued by Mr. Perot, they were awaiting specific proposals. "When he comes up with a platform, we'll see,' said 30-year-old Robin Johnson.
Like many others, Mrs. Johnson was concerned that Mr. Perot would corrupt himself, that he would turn into the very kind of politician he denounces. "I'm concerned it's taking him so long to come up with a platform," she said. "It makes me think he's listening to handlers who are trying to shape him."
It is not clear how many people who sign the petitions will remain loyal through the election. A big part of the pitch by petition gatherers is that a signature is not a commitment to vote for Mr. Perot in November.
That argument won over Mrs. Johnson, and she signed at the Fallbrook Mall, where the Perot kiosk was doing more business than the stores. The volunteers used up their initial allocation of 500 petition forms on the day the kiosk opened, a week ago. Trying to borrow more from the Perot volunteers across the street proved futile; they, too, had gone through their 500 the same day.
With 134,781 signatures needed statewide by the Aug. 7 deadline, Perot organizers say they have already collected 530,000. And each day the lines continue to form here for Ross Perot.

HEADLINE: From Budget Doomsday to Surplus and Smiles

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Last year, it was Doomsday and deadlines. This year, it was surplus and surprise.
New York City officials wrapped up an agreement on a new city budget yesterday in record time, and they attributed their swift success to an essential fact: everyone involved understood that the government had a little extra money to spend, but not too much. 
 The slight upturn in the city's fiscal fortunes, after three years of severe recession and uniformly grim budget developments, made it possible for Mayor David N. Dinkins and the leaders of the City Council to dispense a few goodies to important constituencies, from the Board of Education to the libraries and parks.
But the shared sense that the city was still reeling from the economic decline of the last three years apparently restrained some of the budget brinksmanship that often prevails when the city's budget is either very lean, as it was in recent years, or very fat, as it was during the boom of the 1980's.
To anyone familiar with the bruising and prolonged battles that ordinarily accompany the passage of the city's budget every June, the alacrity with which the Mayor and Council leaders came together over the last few days was startling. The city's top elected officials usually camp out in City Hall for days in the brutal heat of late June, maneuvering and threatening until, in sheer exhaustion late at night, they finally compromise just hours before the new fiscal year begins on July 1.
 
A Happy Announcement
 Yesterday, a full month before the deadline, the Mayor and Council leaders assembled in the late afternoon to announce that they had reached a budget accord. It was the earliest date in memory that an agreement had been reached, and it was apparently achieved with such relative good humor that Norman Steisel, the crusty first deputy mayor, was seen smiling and joking and smoking a cigar in the corridors of City Hall during the last two days.
"Underlying it all is the fact that the fiscal situation has eased a little bit, but not a lot," said Manhattan Borough President Ruth W. Messinger, a veteran of nearly 20 years of budget politics. "There is some money there to do a little bit, but everybody knows that it is circumscribed. There was a little space here for each faction to address some of its greatest concerns."
Many other factors also contributed to the quick resolution. There were no overriding differences separating the Mayor and the Council. Last year, for example, they locked horns over Mr. Dinkins's proposal to increase the property tax to help the city through its extreme fiscal duress; they did not reach a compromise over the tax increase and the overall budget until late in the evening of the final day of June.
The Mayor and Council also did not find themselves stuck waiting for action by the State Legislature, as they often have. This year, for the first time in nearly a decade, the Legislature approved its own budget on time, by the end of March, putting some pressure on city officials to act decisively, as well.
"Once we knew exactly what we were getting from the state, it made our work that much easier," said Peter F. Vallone, the Council Speaker. "Even though we would like to get more, at least we knew what we were getting."
City officials had also been seeking approval from the Legislature of a proposed package of $115 million in new taxes, including an increase in the commuter tax. But on Tuesday, bowing to the obvious reluctance of the lawmakers to approve the plan, Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Vallone withdrew the proposal. The administration said that higher-than-anticipated revenues in two taxes -- the banking and general corporation taxes -- and constrained spending had made it possible to balance the spending plan without the proposed new taxes. That decision removed another potential obstacle to a settlement.
 
Surplus Will Ease Borrowing
 Politics of course also played a significant role. After being criticized extensively during his first two years in office for his stewardship of the budget, Mr. Dinkins earned broad praise in the last month for the cautious revenue estimates and spending restraint that had enabled the administration to amass a surplus in the current year that is now estimated at $515 million. Much of that money will be used in the next year to enable the city to avoid borrowing money for expenditures -- a plan that had raised many eyebrows in the financial world and among fiscal monitors.
Weeks of protracted and abrasive negotiations with the Council might have removed some of the luster from the Mayor's recent budgetary achievements.
Mr. Vallone also had political motives for coming to an agreement quickly. The Council, now expanded to 51 members, many of them brand new, could easily have fallen into bickering had the budget talks dragged on.
The surplus does not signify that the city's economy is now robust and that the free-spending of the 1980's can return. But countless interest groups, each with legitimate but competing needs, have viewed the slightly brighter fiscal horizon as an occasion for restoring some of the Draconian service cuts of recent years. Leaders of the city's labor unions, the Board of Education, social service agencies and many others were in the corridors of City Hall the last two days, seeking the attention of Council members to press their cause.
Had the budget negotiations languished for weeks, Mr. Vallone might have been under far more pressure to increase city spending further, several Council members and staff members said. Prolonged negotiations also would have made it more difficult for the Speaker to keep restive members from pursuing their own agendas, they said.
The Speaker and his allies, who maintain a tight control over the Council, clearly made most of the major decisions themselves. At a public meeting on Friday afternoon, some members complained to Mr. Vallone that they did not know the details of the budget negotiations, and some even said they were unaware of the leadership's position on broad matters, such as the Council's position on adding money for recycling.
In many ways, it was Mr. Vallone who pushed hardest to complete the budget talks quickly. He set the pace by suggesting publicly on Thursday that both sides try to resolve their differences by last night, when the Mayor was to leave for a one-week trade mission to Europe. The Speaker also threatened that, if an accord could not be reached, the Council would pass a budget on its own this week.
"This is the first year literally that everything is on time," Mr. Vallone told his colleagues, with obvious pride, on Friday night.
Mr. Steisel said he thought the talks had been amicable "on the whole" because both the Council leaders and the Mayor "had an interest to get it done quickly."
"Once you get to the point where everybody says, 'There are some important things we both want to do and there are limited resources with which to do it,' why schlep this out over a period of weeks?" Mr. Steisel said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Financing;
Despite Many Distractions, Cash Flows Steadily Into Party Coffers

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 29

 BODY:
The economy is a little sluggish, Ross Perot is a large distraction and the voting here counts for little in this year's Presidential primary season, yet the flow of political money remains strong in New Jersey.
This is one of the nation's wealthiest states, and the interest in politics here is keen. So in the Presidential primary campaigns New Jersey has become a net exporter of cash, and in the Congressional contests, the candidates have been able to find plenty of money. 
 "I hope Gov. Pete Wilson enjoys spending our money," William Palatucci, executive director of the Bush campaign in New Jersey, said of California's Governor, who is leading the Bush campaign there. He said about $800,000 would be raised for the Republican President's campaign, but only about $100,000 would be spent locally, since Mr. Bush had already clinched the nomination.
On the Democratic side, Clay Constantinou, state finance chairman for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, said the New Jersey effort would raise about $1 million, the third or fourth highest total of any state. The ability of New Jersey Democrats to attract about $275,000 early this year helped Mr. Clinton stay in the race when his fortunes were rising and falling.
 
Help in New Hampshire
 "They were ready to lower the coffin in New Hampshire," he said. But he said that as a result of the money from New Jersey "the campaign was able to use direct mail and to send 20,000 videos to households in the state to keep his message alive."
With Governor Clinton closing in on the Democratic nomination, his national campaign has earmarked only about $147,000 for his New Jersey effort out of the $1 million raised here, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.
Both Mr. Palatucci and Mr. Constantinou said the effect of Mr. Perot's petition gathering on their campaigns has been more psychological than financial, so far. The big economic drain, they said, has been the sluggish real estate market. "A lot of traditional contributors to both parties engaged in development: contractors, lawyers, accountants, engineers and environmental consultants," said Mr. Palatucci. And they "haven't been contributing."
 
More Candidates Than Usual
 New Jersey lost 1 of its 14 Congressional seats because of population shifts found in the 1990 census. The resulting reapportionment and decisions by three incumbents to retire have inspired fields of candidates that are larger than usual in a few districts. With the larger fields has come a need for more campaign contributions.
But there is no shortage of money. Reports to the Federal Election Commission show that a number of candidates had raised $200,000 with a month to go before the primary. Prof. Stephen A. Salmore, a political science expert at Rutgers University, said the lack of a Senate race makes fund raising for House seats easier.
Redistricting has affected the campaign of Representative Frank Pallone Jr., a Long Branch Democrat who has represented the Third District along New Jersey's north shore for two terms. But this year he is running for the party's nomination in the new Sixth District, which includes a large part of Middlesex County from the old Sixth District.
Fund-raising became a last-minute issue between Mr. Pallone and Bob Smith, a State Assemblyman from Piscataway who is considered to be Mr. Pallone's chief rival for the Democratic nomination. Mr. Pallone, whose campaign contribution list includes gifts from a large number of political action committees of labor unions, cried foul when Mr. Smith transferred about $120,000 from his state legislative fund-raising committee to his Federal campaign account.
Mr. Pallone said that more than $67,000 of the transfer was illegal since much of it had already been committed in his state races, or included individual gifts of more than $1,000. Mr. Smith said the transfers were legitimate and accused Mr. Pallone of trying a last-minute campaign smear.

HEADLINE: Compromise on Urban Aid Plan Is Reported Near

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
A month after the Los Angeles riots, the Bush Administration is cautiously moving toward granting more emergency aid to the cities than it had planned, Republicans in Congress say.
Although disputes over philosophy and money continue to doom any but the most modest initiatives in urban policy, Congressional and White House negotiators have managed to bridge their differences on the outlines of a package worth up to $2 billion. 
 Those close to the negotiations say the package would include emergency aid to Los Angeles and a sprinkling of money for summer jobs, Head Start and other educational initiatives, and law-enforcement programs for more than 70 other cities, including New York.
"Bush accepts it," said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the leading conservative proponent of increased aid. "There's been a battle in the Administration, but enough officials accept it now. I'd like to do more, but it's going to be difficult in this budget year to do more."
 
Two Versions of Bill
 Publicly, the White House still supports a bill passed by the House that would provide $822 million in emergency grants and loans to Los Angeles and to Chicago, to repair damage from a downtown flood in April. It says the Senate version, which adds $1.5 billion in mostly summer job money and law-enforcement aid for the nation's largest cities, is too expensive.
But senior Republicans said White House negotiators were likely to agree this week to most of the Senate version. The Administration wants to drop a provision that would exempt local governments from having to contribute matching funds for Federal highway construction. It also wants the price tag on some items reduced, and President Bush insists on retaining broad discretion on allocating the money.
The White House and Congressional negotiators will resume talks on Monday in a session that both parties say is a test of whether they can iron out details without adding provisions unacceptable to either side. Senior Republicans close to the negotiations say splits in the Cabinet over how far to compromise with Democrats may still sabotage an agreement.
Those close to the negotiations say Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has warned against falling into a trap in which the President would agree to a package only to have the Democrats, at the final hour, add spending or tax provisions that would force Mr. Bush into a politically embarrassing veto. At the same time, they say, Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, has wavered in his enthusiasm for the negotiations because Democrats refuse to accept Administration proposals on education.
A White House official who deals with urban issues said that such resistance had an impact on Mr. Bush but that "the President wants to get things done."
"There's a lot of room for agreement," the official said. "The quicker we move the better."
Congressional leaders say they are prepared to spread some of the aid to rural areas to make the compromise more palatable to House Republicans who have charged that the aid is nothing more than a reward to urban rioters.
New York City stands to gain up to $50 million in aid, a small contribution to the city's total $30 billion budget.
 
The Democrats' Strategy
 Congressional Democratic leaders said they were leaning toward accepting the compromise and then defining their differences with the Republicans by proposing an additional $9 billion package of education, family services and public works programs that they do not expect Mr. Bush to support. Speaker Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, called this a "two-track strategy" and said he understood that Gov. Bill Clinton, the likely Democratic Presidential nominee, supported it.
"Much larger efforts have to be made than I think the Administration will be likely to commit to," Mr. Foley said. But he added that Congress and the White House were likely to agree on an emergency aid package "to bring some immediate help not only to urban areas around the country but to Americans who are falling out of the cycle of education and employment."
Congressional Democrats and the Administration would both gain something in the compromise. Democrats like the $675 million in the Senate version devoted to summer jobs, a provision that a White House official said the Administration could accept if "the people who get the jobs leave with skills to take them forward."
The primary selling point for the Administration is $250 million for Mr. Bush's proposed "weed and seed" program, although the White House official said the President would like to see twice that amount. Under the program, part of a six-point urban plan that Mr. Bush dusted off after the riots, specially trained police detectives and SWAT teams would rid neighborhoods of gangs and drug dealers to provide security as new educational and other social programs are instituted.
Administration officials and Democratic leaders say that there is also hope they can agree on the centerpiece of Mr. Bush's plan, urban enterprise zones, but that it is not part of the emergency bill.
 
Urban Enterprise Zones
 The Administration argues that eliminating capital gains taxes on businesses willing to set up in designated poor inner city areas will flood those zones with new capital and an enhanced entrepreneurial spirit. More and more Democrats agree, but the proposal must go through the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. In both, the plan is likely to be linked to tax measures the White House will find unacceptable.
Democratic Congressional leaders are refusing to consider other components of Mr. Bush's program, especially the granting of subsidies to parents who wish to send their children to private schools.
And they express major doubts about a component that would help public-housing tenants buy their homes from the Government. Representative Ronald V. Dellums, Democrat of California, estimated that it would cost the Government $150,000 to $175,000 to rehabilitate some housing units before they could be sold, at a time when the waiting lists for people wanting to enter public housing are growing.
Similarly, Republicans and Democrats take divergent positions on changes in the welfare system, although almost all officials say some change is needed.

HEADLINE: Charting the Delaware's Future Course

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BARRYVILLE, N.Y.

 BODY:
Bill Hupalo loves the upper Delaware River for its bountiful shad fishing. And he fully supports a far-reaching plan to preserve the high quality of the water in the river's northernmost 121 miles, even if the plan curbs development along the rural southern fringes of the Catskills.
"If they could protect this river, it's worth every cent to keep buildings and sewers out, because you can never bring a river back," said Mr. Hupalo, who lives in Swan Lake, 20 miles from here. "You've got to give up something to preserve something." 
The situation is different for Don Rupp, who lives just upstream of Rose Eddy, which is Mr. Hupalo's favorite shad-fishing spot. He grumbles in his riverfront home about how the plan would mean a loss of local control, erosion of homeowners' rights and more heavy-handedness by the National Park Service, which helps regulate the river.
"They want jurisdiction over the total waterway," he said of the park service. "The river has never deteriorated before. We've protected it for 100 years. What needs to be protected now?"
The answer, the Delaware River Basin Commission says, is the river itself, from the Delaware Water Gap north to Hancock, and the $60 million a year in recreational spending that it helps generate.
The commission, whose members represent Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and the Federal Interior Department, worked with the park agency to draft a proposal calling for "no measurable change" in the upper Delaware water quality, which the commission says is among the purest of any major urban river in the Northeast.
Under the Federal Clean Water Act, purity levels are allowed to deteriorate to designated "safe" levels for fishing and swimming. The proposed rules would prohibit any major slippage, but would permit some fluctuations from the current 14 benchmarks of a river's health. The commission says those ranges allow enough latitude for continued development of the river.
Millions of people live within a two-hour drive of the upper Delaware, which Congress placed under the protection of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act in the late 1970's. The law spares free-flowing rivers of scenic and recreational value from overdevelopment and new dams.
 
Park Land in Jersey
 In the 80's the population in the three New York counties bordering the upper Delaware -- Delaware, Orange and Sullivan -- increased, from 373,000 to 424,000. The bordering counties in Pennsylvania -- Pike, Monroe and Wayne -- grew, from 122,917 to 163,819. In Sussex County, N.J., much of the land along the river is already Federal and state park land largely off limits to developers.
The new plan calls for tougher controls on sewage and effluents flowing into the river and its 70 tributaries and new controls on storm-water runoff, which is rich in nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen that spur plant growth, algae and, eventually, stagnation in the water.
The plan discourages the traditional discharges of treated sewage into the river and its tributaries and calls for disposing the material on land by spraying the waste in woods and fields.
New or expanded sewage plants would be banned, unless alternative land disposal was found to be technically and economically unfeasible. New or expanded plants would be required to institute higher treatment levels. The allowable levels of the fecal coliform bacteria in sewage would be cut, from 200 to 50 a milliliter of water. Nitrogen and phosphorus would have to be removed for the first time.
The plan would also require builders to tell the commission how they would keep their runoffs, which officials believe account for half the pollution in the river, from adding to the current runoff.
Environmentalists are ecstatic about the plan, which was proposed in February and is months from enactment. Kevin Coyle, president of American Rivers, a conservation group in Washington, said perhaps two-thirds of the river miles in the country had waters purer than the standards of the Clean Water Act. "But there's no well-established program to keep clean pristine waters that way," Mr. Coyle said. "For a river this size, in so highly developed an area, this is a real first."
A spokeswoman for the Watershed Association of the Delaware River, Cynthia Poten, said the commission was the first agency in the country to propose that existing water quality be the standard to set limits on discharges. "It's a major innovation," she said.
Developers did not voice open hostility to the proposal at hearings this month. "The river is a vital part of our economy, and any source of pollution has to be controlled," said Edward Nikles, a developer in Pike County and a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Builders Association. "Developers will have to pay some more, but I think that's well worth the price if it will protect the water."
A real-estate agent in Pike, Davis Chant, said: "We're all for the river. But we just don't want things so overdone that it eliminates any future development."
Down river from Mr. Hupalo's fishing spot, officials in Dingman Township, Pa., are worrying about the higher costs for tighter sewage and pollution controls. The officials contend that weekend or vacation users would enjoy a clean river and that local residents and developers would end up paying the bill for the tougher regulations and continued purity.

HEADLINE: Chronicling the Spread of AIDS Throughout Brooklyn

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
The man flipped on his tape recorder and turned to the woman sitting cross-legged on a couch. "O.K.," he began, scanning a long list of questions, "why don't you tell me a little bit about how you found out you're H.I.V.-positive."
For the next two hours, the woman spoke of her life before and after she learned she had the virus that causes AIDS. She told of a 17-year relationship with a man she thinks was infected by another lover before passing the virus to her. She talked of days punctuated by visits to a doctor, an AIDS counselor and an herbalist who sells "healing" teas. Then there were the hours spent trying to start an AIDS newsletter for Crown Heights, her Brooklyn neighborhood. 
 "The level of ignorance in the community is abysmal," said the woman, a 42-year-old former administrative assistant who requested anonymity, saying she had not told neighbors she has AIDS. "Most of the information is still being addressed to people with alternative lifestyles -- gay people, people who use intravenous drugs, people who are prostitutes. What about the rest of the people?"
Now, the Brooklyn Historical Society is collecting this woman's chronicle, along with scores of other oral histories, photographs, medical records, journals, T-shirts and telephone bills in an ususual effort to grapple with her complaint. The show is scheduled to open early next year at the Historical Society in Brooklyn Heights.
The project, turning the techniques of oral history to the AIDS epidemic in Brooklyn, is thought to be the first attempt by a museum or historical society to explore the material culture of AIDS in exhibition form.
 
Borough's AIDS Profile
 By focusing narrowly on Brooklyn -- home to 2.3 million people and some 90 ethnic groups -- the exhibit will also strive to give visitors an in-depth look at the growing number of ways AIDS is affecting the social, political and economic fabric of urban America.
Though second to Manhattan in total number of cases, Brooklyn's AIDS profile shows how the disease has moved from gay men, prostitutes and intravenous drug users to an increasing number of women and children.
"Every neighborhood, from Brooklyn Heights to Bedford-Stuyvesant to Bensonhurst has been hit by the epidemic," said Ellen Snyder-Grenier, the chief curator of the historical society. "Part of the point is that its not just someone else's problem. It's everyone's problem."
Brooklyn, with the largest population of the city's five boroughs, has more AIDS-infected women than any other borough or city in the state, with 1,811, according to a recent study by the New York City AIDS Surveillance Unit. About two-thirds of those women believe they contracted the disease through intravenous drug use. A growing number of others, however, believe they were infected by a boyfriend or husband.
Brooklyn also has the highest number of infected teen-agers and is third behind Manhattan and the Bronx in the number of children with the virus, according to the study.
 
Mark on Entire Communities
 Like epidemics of years gone by, such as polio and yellow fever, AIDS is leaving its mark not just on individual lives, but entire communities. Documenting that impact is the mission of this exhibit. It is also the latest effort in recent years by the Brooklyn Historical Society and its executive director, David M. Kahn, to blow dust from its tradition-bound, research-oriented doorstep with innovative exhibitions that explore the changing culture of the borough.
"My sense is that they are doing something that nobody else is doing," Gary Kulik, the assistant director for academic programs at the National Museum of American History in Washington, said of the AIDS project.
The exhibition, which is being researched and produced by the guest curator and Brooklyn-based filmmaker, Robert Rosenberg, should be an eclectic display.
From the woman in Crown Heights, Mr. Rosenberg has collected empty bottles from the herbalist, a pamphlet from a workshop for people with AIDS and two hours of her interview to be edited and played through special telephones.
Her story, one of several already collected by Mr. Rosenberg, is one of broken stereotypes. A graduate of Bronx High School of Science, she earned an associates degree in administration and was working at a local taxi company when she met the man who would become her longtime boyfriend.
"I had been in what I thought was a monogomous relationship for 17 years," she told Mr. Rosenberg.
 
Moved Back Home for Care
 In 1987, however, the two broke up, and in despair, she moved to California to work. Four years later, she said, she contracted pneumonia and her lungs collapsed. Her doctor diagnosed her as H.I.V.-positive. Horrified, she was told that her ex-boyfriend had been diagnosed months before with the virus.
Ill and unable to work, she came back to Brooklyn almost two years ago so her family could take care of her. Though she feels fine most days, she now has full-fledged AIDS. Dark circles cut under her eyes. Once a vigorous woman, she now collects Medicaid and Social Security checks. Once a great fan of street corner shish kebob, she now must carefully prepare her own food.
As for subways and buses: "I don't ride public transporation because there's a TB epidemic and I have no defenses against it," she said. "I walk or take a taxi."
Another contributor to the exhibit is Ivan Weinstein, a 30-year-old Flatbush resident, who has donated several AIDS-related books, T-shirts and fliers from AIDS-awareness events and a copy of a lawsuit that charges a Brooklyn hospital with discriminatory treatment.
"I can tell you, rotten treatment still exists," Mr. Weinstein said during a recent interview with Mr. Rosenberg, referring to his treatment in Brooklyn.
 
Trying to Increase Awareness
 Like many other gay Brooklyn residents who suffer from AIDS, Mr. Weinstein said he prefers the hospitals, clinics and doctors in Manhattan, where the greatest concentration of the city's AIDS-related care-givers is located.
Since he was diagnosed as H.I.V.-positive, Mr. Weinstein, who now has full-fledged AIDS, has joined a local acting group, the AIDS Theater Project, which performs for schools and community organizations to help educate others about the disease.
The information packets and pictures from the shows are being submitted to the Historical Society in hopes, he said, that they will increase awareness among his neighbors and larger political circles as well.
"I think if the government or anyone else woke up 10 years ago, then I think they would have had a headstart on this," he said. "At least they could have done much more than what's been done."

HEADLINE: City of Pain and Rapture: Reflections in an Urban Eye

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES; The writer of this article, who wrote the About New York column from 1976 to 1979, has returned to New York after spending 13 years in Times bureaus in Washington, London and Moscow.

 BODY:
"I was explaining to you about the rapture," the tall, Bible-toting black man suddenly announced, standing solemn as Socrates within the Lexington Avenue local as he moved through another day of subway proselytizing. "What is the rapture?" the handsome, thin-faced man asked rhetorically of riders clinging fervidly to their various inattentions. The doors slid shut and he rode on out of the station with his answer lost in the steely noise of the city.
The passing reminder that there might be rapture for someone in the toughness of New York, and that a man felt compelled to move through the city's innards to tell about this, was weird welcome enough for a reporter returning home to the city after 13 years. On renewed sight, the city seems as good and sad and true as ever, when viewed in all its shards, and the search for rapture is understandable.
 
Ruthless Regeneration
 The city remains regenerative in a certain ruthless way, as out in the marshes beyond the runways of Kennedy International Airport, where the Norway rat breeds better than the snowy owl in the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge. There, Don Riepe, city born and bred in the Ozone Park shadows of Aqueduct Race Track, has chosen a strange life in the city, reigning as chief ranger for the wildlife refuge. 
 In this job, he attends to such minor poetic justices as helping his fellow ranger, Bob Cook, cart garter snakes and green snakes back from suburban development tracts to the 9,000-acre marshland refuge in Queens, where such snakes were last seen hieing from vacant lots when the postwar building boom finished off the borough's last green swatches four decades ago.
In the magnificent National Park Service refuge, where a lethally beaked greater yellowlegs can poise still and graceful as the World Trade Center on the western horizon, Mr. Riepe watches for warblers, egrets and ospreys. Then again, he occasionally spies a floater, a human corpse dispatched by killers in the underworld to bob amid the bay reeds.
"At least 8 in the past 12 years," Mr. Riepe says as if they were a special New York fauna, corpus urbanus, to be tallied along with the even rarer sooty tern and the rufus-necked stint. He speaks with a flat Queens accent that sounds refreshing from someone in a traditional ranger's uniform who wants no part of working the Rockies or any other great outdoors beyond the city's wildlife preserve out where the A train ends.
"When I want to get away from this I go flamenco dancing in Manhattan," says the ranger. He really is known for organizing flamenco exhibitions with fellow enthusiasts at such Queens places as Danny's Szechuan Garden on Cross Bay Boulevard.
 
Ebb Tide Music On Sunwashed Piers
 So goes the ranger's rapture. Further west along the city shore, other humans teem differently on a hot and sunny day out along the old Steeplechase pier on Coney Island, off West 17th Street. They are crabbing with chicken legs as bait and with boomboxes full of Latin music to spice the city's ebb tide. To a returning New Yorker, the scene contains the reassurance that the poor retain the knack for having more varied public fun together in larger crowds of far more rambling families than the rich usually do.
They dance on the pier in different groups to different songs, cooking sizzling dishes above the ocean. They gamble cheaply in the breeze at their own illicit gaming tables, quenching thirsts with cold beers and elaborate rum and fruit-punch drinks made by a happily profiteering vendor tending bar from a converted Good Humor cart.
Nostalgia has long since ravaged Coney Island, with weeds lushly growing up a rusted roller coaster that stands oddly amid the later world of public housing. The pier scene, with the laughter and flavor of fresh immigrants, is a remembrance that liberalism and left-wing politics used to flourish in the city for people such as these.
"Socialism is dead and liberalism is discombobulated," Raymond S. Franklin says flatly, as if the city were a noir tale with the denouement finally as clear as wet asphalt at night.
This New Yorker talks not quite like the Queens College professor of economics that he is as founder and director of the Michael Harrington Center. This is a scholarly research memorial to the city's late, last Socialist, Mr. Franklin's drinking buddy from the old days when the antipoverty program was generating hope and community organization among the ghetto poor.
"I can't go out in the morning without a dozen quarters," says the professor, less a social strategist these days than a confessed easy touch for the waves of beggars who have taken unabashed hold of the city's streets. "They're unbelievable," he admits. "Still, they put in a day."
As a professor, Mr. Franklin measures this phenomenon mainly as another jagged New York irony: He traces it to the end of the old single-room-occupancy hotel problem of his Upper West Side Manhattan neighborhood, with the poor retreating from real-estate developers only to return as the current plague of homeless.
One of these beggars, a bearded man who calls himself Vincent, says that while he would have been too ashamed to beg five years ago, he came to recognize a kind of peer-group protection among so many city poor rising up publicly across the Reagan years. So Vincent took up the street cup.
"You think it would be better if I robbed you?" he asks. "This is kind of like a job," he says, patiently opening the door to a bank office for each working New Yorker making a visit on payday.
Professor Franklin and Vincent share meaner streets. Vincent insistently jangles his coin cup, and the professor shifts across the years from idealizing as an East Harlem antipoverty consultant in something called the Human Dynamics Corporation, to organizing conferences now on such themes as "London and New York: Two Cities in Decay."
Seeking financing, not idealizing, proved the ultimate antipoverty lesson for the poor, he has concluded, offering a rough maxim for the city: "When you want to change society, you can't imitate your oppressors too soon."
As always, the city's working poor don't need a professor to teach them that.
 
Street Lesson: Move or Get Stuck
 "It goes up and down," says Shirley Mack, surveying the kaleidoscopic scene along Flatbush Avenue in south Brooklyn, where the poor shop in cut-rate stores that, amid their nonstop sale signs, discreetly post window warnings to potential burglars: "Steel-plated roof and walls."
"Macy's leaving don't mean nothing," says Mrs. Mack, a long-ago migrant from North Carolina who works six days in the Rich Rach women's boutique near Church Avenue and says she somehow never quite realizes her vow to move on, to move up.
"You know how it's, just, sometimes you get some place and you get stuck?" she asks. "Hitting the lottery is the only way I'll get out of here."
Macy's, three blocks south on Tilden Avenue, will indeed be closing the Flatbush store as executives tend to profit margins. The store already is tomblike within, with a big security desk watching at the entrance and the air-conditioning lending a sepulchral chill.
It's more warm and welcoming out on the street. In this part of the city, whites are the minority as crowds of blacks shop the small stores that seem the stuff of occasional bargains in hope.
"This block is really is a zoo, can't you feel that?" a clerk in a notions store conspiratorially asks a fellow white. "You feel safe? Walk at night here after 7 o'clock and see."
The man, identifying himself as Ilan, an immigrant from Israel, is bitter after two years of failing to make economic progress in the city. "For me the American dream is over," he says, cursing the unknown people who broke into his car last week. "Here, I've seen people die in the streets. I'm going back to Israel because at least nobody dies in the streets there," he says, overlooking the mortal tally in the clashes there with the Palestinian community.
 
Seeds of Hope In Stony Despair
 At that, the man's imagination seems daunted more by the counters of petty notions he tends rather than his selective comparisons of home and New York. Around the corner on Church Street labors a counterbalancing agent, Yvonne Graham, an immigrant from Jamaica, who landed in East Flatbush 12 years ago.
"It's hard to take root," she says, "You must till and nurture the soil in this city. At first I suffered the cultural shock of all immigrant groups, but now I like the city for its cultural diversity."
Miss Graham is entitled to some optimism. The storefront program she founded, the Caribbean Women's Health Association, has grown from four part-time volunteers and a $82,000 budget 10 years ago to 37 full-time workers and $1.5 million offering 10 community programs to thousands of residents.
Even so, a sense of success must apparently remain a luxury in East Flatbush. "We're part of the Crown Heights troubles," Miss Graham says, referring to the street troubles between blacks and Hasidic Jews last summer and the simmering social aftermath.
"There's lots of tension left," she says warily about the mix of hot weather, unemployment and routine street despair. The Presidential political year, with the candidates' attempts at stirring promises and hope, has not touched the neighborhood, she says.
This is not new. The city always seems to hunker unbelieving through the Oz-like show of Presidential politics, as if it knows there are terrible things happening routinely here that cannot, maybe should not, be accounted for in mere human debate.
Most ineffable among these in the eyes of a returning witness is the sight of the growing communities of AIDS babies, the children of diseased parents who most unfairly bear the latest mark of Cain that humanity has invented for itself.
 
Mortal Weariness In the Age of AIDS
 A New Yorker looking for fresh life in the city cannot afford to linger long watching them play in such a sanctuary as the preschool day-care center at Bronx Municipal Hospital, where two dozen toddlers bear the AIDS virus and its perpetual threat of having no mortal defense against mundane illness. One boy whose health fails chronically and cruelly these days worries the staff most. He smiles like the little boy he is in joining the others to make pizza for a simple picnic; but he has a touch of adult weariness, too, that remains haunting in remembrance.
All about him, the staff fights to present ordinary childhood, nothing more, day after day to the children. There is a "family kitchen" designed for staff workers to mingle over coffee with the AIDS parents to show "we're not afraid to break bread with people who have the disease," says a worker.
Still does the city urgently wield bread and continuing life even as it must bear despair and death.
Morris Hershman, a man interviewed two years ago in Moscow, said then that he was fighting to emigrate from the Soviet Union simply to get to New York and die here.
He was born in the city and kidnapped six decades ago as a 5-year-old by his Marxist father, who ran off to join the Bolshevik revolution. The boy was orphaned and spent much of his life in prisons and camps in the Soviet Union for being "Yanky," a suspect, a misfit.
Finally, world weary and living in Brooklyn, Mr. Hershman has received a note of congratulations from "your fellow inmate" and old friend, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the dissident master of Russian literature, who encourages him to write his memoirs for his two granddaughters.
In his second year in Brooklyn, Mr. Hershman was nostalgic and visited Moscow last month.
"It was awful," he says. "No hope there."
"Please correct my story to say I no longer want to die in New York," he pleads. "Show me smiling now. There is light here," he says, holding his hands toward the window of his apartment off Ocean Parkway.
"In Moscow is anger, boiling anger; in New York is life, boiling life," he says, threatening New York with more talk of the rapture.

HEADLINE: U.S. Remains Moscowcentric on Once-Soviet Asia

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
When Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was trying to persuade former Soviet republics in recent weeks to give up their nuclear weapons, the only holdout was Kazakhstan. Though it ultimately went along, the largest nation of Central Asia was toying with the idea of using nuclear weapons as political bargaining chips to get international attention.
The affairs of Kazakhstan, along with those of the other four former Soviet republics of Central Asia, have been largely overshadowed by developments in republics like Russia or Ukraine, which are better known outside the former Soviet Union. With their Islamic, often anti-Russian populations, moreover, the Central Asia countries -- nicknamed the "stans" after their common suffix -- are emerging from the collapse of the Soviet empire as a world apart from Moscow, policy analysts and area specialists say. 
 Despite their separate identities, these nations continue to be treated by the United States as branch offices of Russia, said Paul Goble, a former State Department adviser on Soviet nationalities. "We're acting as if the Soviet Union still lives," said Mr. Goble, now a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
In policy research organizations and embassies, analysts are questioning whether the Bush Administration is responding with sufficiently new ideas and policies for the region. Many view Washington's approach as simplistic and old-world, focusing on nuclear issues and promoting Turkey as a secular model for a region whose Muslim populations raise fears in the West of Islamic militancy.
 
Closer to the South
 Culturally, the area -- which encompasses Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan -- is non-European and traditionally closer to the broad band of nations to the south, stretching from Iran through Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and into western China.
The State Department, however, still classifies the region bureaucratically as part of Europe.
The Administration's decision to leave Central Asia in the State Department's European bureau with other remnants of the former Soviet Union was not a casual one, a State Department spokeswoman said. It was made to keep the Central Asians in the sphere of European organizations, especially the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which sets standards for political and human rights.
Nonetheless, Representative Stephen J. Solarz, the New York Democrat who wrote legislation that recently created a new South Asian bureau for the State Department, said there is "some merit" in considering inclusion of the Central Asian nations under the purview of the new bureau, which is still in its formative stages.
 
Searching for Ports
 The new countries' developing economic links and search for ports, for example, are likely to draw them closer to Asian neighbors. Iran, Pakistan, India and China have an interest in the future of the region, which is also poised to influence Afghanistan and the independence movement in Indian Kashmir.
Several of the five nations have approached the Asian Development Bank about membership. Pakistanis, Iranians and Indians have moved aggressively to develop business relations in the Central Asian capitals. Pakistani textile mills hope, for instance, to draw on the cotton grown in the region.
Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, who recently toured Central Asia and has been active in questioning the Administration on its aid plans for the region, praises Secretary Baker for taking the lead in opening embassies there. But the Senator said in an interview that he is concerned that Washington is listening too closely to fears of Islamic revivalism voiced for political reasons by old-guard Communists still in power in several new states.
Mr. DeConcini is also critical of the Administration's decision to meet the threat of Islamic militancy through a policy of encouraging Turkey as a model for Central Asia. Administration officials say they have agreed on a joint technical pact with Turkey, which is Islamic but secular, to "foster democratic and market reforms, and orient their trade and other ties westward."
"Turkey has immense problems, including in human rights," the Senator said.
 
'Cold War Pattern' Faulted
 Barnett Rubin, director of the recently revived Center for the Study of Central Asia at Columbia University, said: "The main obstacle to intelligent policymaking in Central Asia is the repetition of the cold war pattern of looking for a threat and for a partner against that threat -- and then finding that the partner has a regional agenda that isn't yours." In this case, it is the spread of Turkic influence across the region.
"At the moment, the new threat perception is some kind of Iranian fundamentalism, and our partner is so-called secular Turkey," Mr. Rubin said in an interview. "I think that the Central Asian nations are not going to be the passive recipients of somebody else's models."
Edward Allworth, also of the Columbia center, said making Turkey the model was "a simple-minded solution to a very complex problem." He said that the five Central Asian nations were all different in various ways, but that at the grass-roots level it appeared that the urge to adopt an Asian Islamic identity was strong.
Firuz Kazemzadeh, professor of history at Yale University, told a Congressional subcommittee recently: "Central Asia is not well known in the Western world. Even the term itself has no universally accepted definition."
 
A Range of Islam
 Professor Kazemzadeh, a scholar of the Russian empire and the nationalities it absorbed over the centuries, said any post-Communist revival of Islam would take different forms -- ranging from Kazakhstan, with a large non-Muslim, ethnic Russian population, to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, whose cities were centers of Islamic scholarship.
But he added, "Islam has had a stronger hold on the masses of Central Asia than Orthodox Christianity had on the Russians." He advised American policymakers to be prepared to accept some aspects of government there that might not be tolerated at home, including limited electoral franchise and a central involvement of religion in the state.
"Conducting relations with Central Asia will not be easy," he said, even with a great deal of interest among Central Asians in closer ties to the West. "Yet the United States stands at a propitious moment for influencing the future of that remote and very significant part of the world."

HEADLINE: Arson Rate, After Decline in 80's, Jumps in Northeast Recession

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
Firefighters and insurance-claims adjusters say they can track a recession as well as any economist. If arson is up, business is down.
Arson, which declined in the prosperous 1980's, has jumped in states like New York and New Jersey that have been hit hard by the weak economy, adjusters say. The Northeast leads the nation in fires deliberately set to destroy failing businesses, as well as houses, cars and boats. 
 "My office map showing the location of suspicious fire claims has clusters of pins all over the Northeast, Texas and Oklahoma, the regions with the longest-running economic downturns," said John Barracato, a former deputy fire commissioner in New York City who heads the fire-investigation unit at Aetna Life and Casualty. He said that houses in the $80,000-to-$145,000 range led the list of properties involved in suspect fires and that policyholders filed inflated claims for the loss of household contents.
He estimated that claims to Aetna involving suspicious fires rose more than 20 percent in the last two years and that the claims for a wider range of losses covered by homeowners' insurance had increased even more.
The chief of special investigations for the CNA Insurance Company of Chicago, Jay Williams, said: "Arson is a continual problem, but much more so during a recession. People don't burn their homes or business until they are in dire financial straits."
Mr. Williams said the number of suspicious claims on all CNA policies, including fire, automobile theft and workers' compensation, had risen 63 percent in the last year. "Separate claims on fires are notoriously slow in coming in because of the time needed to investigate them," he added. "The data on 1991 are still being processed."
In New York State, the number of incendiary fires, the term used to describe deliberately set fires, was 13.7 percent higher in 1990 than in 1987, the year of the Wall Street crash.
"This and other data support the belief that arson is on the rise," State Fire Administrator Francis A. McGarry said. "Given the economic climate, we suspect it is continuing. People can be pressured by the economy to do some pretty crazy things."
In New Jersey the number of incendiary fires climbed, from 2,509 in 1989 to 2,991 in 1990, a 19 percent increase, according to Sgt. Daniel Cosgrove of the state police.
In Connecticut, a state with a reputation for aggressive arson investigation and training, the level appears to be holding steady, said Sgt. James Butterworth of the state police, who is assigned to the State Fire Marshal's office. "There definitely is an economic fire situation out there, because everyone is mortgaged to the hilt, and they see values going down," Sergeant Butterworth said. "Some people just drive away and let the bank foreclose. Others torch it."
Fire statistics for last year, when the recession deepened, are not available in the New York metropolitan region. But anecdotal evidence is strong that problems with arson continue, for reasons that sometimes go beyond the economy.
Investigators say street gangs and drug rings are increasingly using firebombs as weapons for intimidation, revenge and terror. "We are seeing the use of firebombs by drug gangs as part of an ascending spiral of violence that is topped by the use of explosives," said Jack Killorin, a fire investigator who is a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. "It is a phenomenon of the last three years that has become national in scope."
 
Difficulty in Counting
 Jack Ward, who stepped down this month as president of the 7,000-member International Association of Arson Investigators, said: "Every investigator I talk with has been extremely busy. We have an exceptional number of fires to work, not counting the Los Angeles situation. And when private investigators like us are busy, you can bet the local fire departments have their hands full."
Not only do local fire departments have their hands full, but some also complain that their hands are tied by budget constraints that limit investigations even as the number of suspect fires increases. In New York City, fire officials say that because of such constraints, they cannot give precise figures on the number of fires that they believe were intentionally set.
The city's Chief Fire Marshal, John J. Stickevers, said that budget cuts had halved his force of 350 marshals, but that 45 marshals were recently added, putting total at 198. He said the Fire Department was now responsible for controlling illegal social clubs, a police function until the Happy Land Social Club fire that killed 87 people in the Bronx in 1989, further stretching manpower.
Mr. Stickevers acknowledged that even in prosperous times the Fire Department had to limit the number of suspicious fires it pursued. In a recession, with more fires occurring but with fewer resources, the problem only deepens, he said.
"Store fires are an indication of people in financial trouble, and small stores are the first to go," he added.
Last year, Mr. Stickevers said, the number of fires in "mom and pop" stores rose 14 percent over 1990, "but how many were intentionally set we'll never know."
He said the department pressed hard on "provocative" fires that drew public attention or incurred significant financial losses. But fires in vacant buildings, small businesses and houses were less likely to be investigated, unless there were compelling reasons to do. "There were 2,300 fires in the city last year we didn't investigate and should have," the Chief said.
 
The Need for Training
 Another city fire official, who insisted on anonymity, said recent New York arson statistics were meaningless because of the budget cuts. "A fire isn't arson unless a fire marshal calls it arson," the official said. "Cutting back on fire marshals means fewer fires are investigated, which means the number of arsons goes down, which prompts the Office of Management and Budget to say since arsons are going down, the city doesn't need so many fire marshals."
A New York fire marshal is a firefighter, who, after taking a Civil Service test, receives nine weeks of training and works in the field under the tutelage of an experienced officer.
"If you don't investigate with trained people, you can't know what the arson problem is," Mr. Stickevers said. "Even with trained people, we get beat, and we get beat more often than we like to admit."

HEADLINE: Students Plunge Into Crowded Labor Pool

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
As coordinator of the jobs programs for the City University of New York, Daniel E. Powers keeps students at the 17 campuses appraised of summer job openings. These days, he does not have too much to do.
"In the late 80's, we would be under paper, with so many jobs coming in," he said recently. "Last year I thought was the all-time low, but this is even lower. I've been here 15 years, and this is the worst I've seen it." 
 Some economists, job counselors and college students are more upbeat than Mr. Powers, but most predict frustration for young people who are hoping to use the summer to help pay rising tuition costs or to strengthen their resumes for the increasingly competitive job market.
Because of the sluggish economy, sectors of the city job market that usually swell in summer, like tourism and recreation, will probably remain slack this year. Given a city unemployment rate of 9.5 percent in April (compared with 7.2 percent nationwide), college students hoping to do everything, or anything, from painting houses to unloading trucks must plunge into a labor pool already crowded with experienced workers to claw for the few opportunities.
 
Lots of Competition
 "This year, students can expect to be competing with a lot of unemployed people who will be willing to take basically anything," said James Brown, an associate economist with the State Department of Labor who focuses on New York City. "It's going to be a very hard summer." Mr. Brown said he expected up to 60,000 16- to 19-year-olds to enter the job market this summer, joining 312,000 New Yorkers already hunting for work.
On the supply side, Mr. Brown expects the number of seasonal jobs, like waiting tables and working at beaches, to total 15,000, a figure that understates the volume of summer work because it omits temporary jobs that open up as permanent employees go on vacation. Over all, Mr. Brown said he expected the job market to be a little better than last year's.
"But that's damning with faint praise," Mr. Brown said. "Last summer was disastrous. This will be the second-worst year in a decade."
Isaac Jordan, a student at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, would seem to have an edge. Now 30 years old, he already had seven years of clerical and computer experience when he began college.
Mr. Jordan has not been particular, trying temporary agencies, department stores, catering and messenger services. So far, no good. "It's tough," he said. "It's been really tough."
Even for employers who are hiring, bringing in untrained college students can be a low priority. The city's Department of Parks and Recreation has traditionally been a major employer of students hoping to make some money over the summer. But since 1988, the number of temporary jobs has dropped about 40 percent, to just over 2,000, and the department has stopped recruiting, said Stewart Desmond, a department spokesman.
The slump has created what Greg J. Pappas, dean of student services at Fordham University, calls a trickle-up effect, in which low-skill, low-wage jobs are snatched up by more experienced workers. With graduates poaching college students' jobs, he said, the college students, like Mr. Jordan, are hunting in high school students' territory.
"High school students traditionally would work in retail, but now you're seeing more college students working in retail," Mr. Pappas said. "You're seeing more 15- and 16-year-olds unemployed, because their jobs are being taken by college students."
For many college students, he said, the problem this pecking order creates is that they they cannot use the summer to gain experience in the professional fields they want to pursue after graduation, experience they need more than ever.
One apparent solution to this problem is internships, temporary training slots targeted at young people. "Students are more interested in internships," said Thomas L. Thomas, director of Career Development Services at Hunter College and president of the Career Counseling and Placement Association of CUNY. "A student who has one or two internships when he graduates is much more marketable than a student who just has the degree."
And companies in recent years have become more interested in hiring interns, said Victor R. Lindquist, a dean at Northwestern University who surveys mid- to large-size businesses each year about their hiring plans. Through internships, companies can give prospective employees a tryout period.
But companies are cutting back on paid internships, expecting students to work for free in exchange for the experience and credential, career counselors said. And competition for even the unpaid positions is getting stiffer.
"Many students who have graduated and can't find jobs or even part-time jobs are now looking for internships, which they never did before," said Shelly Shapiro, internship coordinator and director of the corporate careers program at Brooklyn College. "The pool out there is just overwhelming."
 
Lowered Expectations
 Ewa Wieczorek, a 23-year-old Polish immigrant who worked her way through her freshman year at Hunter College as a receptionist, hoped to find an internship this summer in her chosen field, physical therapy. But she quickly learned she could not beat the competition and lowered her expectations.
"I called every hospital in New York City to find a job as a volunteer," she said. "I wanted to work in a hospital to get the experience to get the internship."
But she found that no one wanted her, even to clean rooms or to answer telephones for free. "They said no, no, no -- they all said no," she said. "I'd call back, hear a different voice, and hope maybe this time -- but no way." After a month of searching, she got a volunteer job by pleading with the chairman of the physical therapy department at one hospital.
"They're closing the door for people," she said. "They said I needed experience, but how can I get the experience if no one wants to hire me?"

HEADLINE: Arson Figures Are Difficult To Compile

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
Arson is regarded as one of the most underreported crimes. Historically it has been difficult to track.
Two Federal agencies and one private group collect national statistics on arson, and they have reservations about the completeness of the information, especially on arson for profit. 
 The problem is threefold. A blaze and the efforts to extinguish it can obliterate the evidence of arson, although technological advances and training have made that more unlikely. Second, overlapping police and fire jurisdictions in an investigation can create a tangle of conflicting conclusions about whether the cause of a fire was arson, a prosecutable felony or a case that can be attributed to a less clear description like "suspicious," "incendiary," "deliberate" or "unknown."
Even the legal definitions of arson can vary from state to state.
 
Trends Rather Than Details
 Collecting and analyzing fire reports is slow. The latest national figures are for 1990. The United States Fire Administration has a data center that gathers and analyzes information drawn from 13,023 fire departments in 40 states and 27 cities -- there are 33,000 professional and volunteer fire companies in the country -- to provide a picture of trends rather than complete national figures.
The Uniformed Crime Report compiled yearly by the Federal Bureau of Investigation based on records supplied by law-enforcement agencies has a section on arson as a major crime. But it is filled with footnotes that bluntly acknowledge that the information is incomplete and not totally reliable. The F.B.I. reports that 1 in 6 arsons involves an arrest.
The National Fire Protection Association in Quincy, Mass., a group that helps set safety standards, publishes national statistics provided by fire departments. Dr. John T. Hall Jr., who is in charge of fire analysis and research, says arson for profit is just a small part of fires that are deliberately set. Juveniles playing with matches are the largest single group, and those who set fires for revenge are another. The umbrella category of arson, therefore, does not show great movement with economic cycles, he said, but a sustained recession can contribute to "regional spiking."
According to the latest figures from the association, there were 97,000 structural fires in 1990 classified as "deliberately set or suspicious" and causing an estimated $1.394 billion in property damage.
