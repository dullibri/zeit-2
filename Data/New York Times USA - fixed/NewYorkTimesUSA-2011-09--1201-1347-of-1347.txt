HEADLINE: A Spray Like a Punch In the Face

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Last week, a girl in the Bronx pulled out a can of pepper spray and used it in a fight with two other girls in her high school, an event that resulted in her arrest, her mother's arrest and a report on WNBC.
The mother got locked up because she bought the stuff and gave it to her daughter, and the law in New York is strict about who can carry it -- no teenagers, no felons -- and how it is used. There was a long legislative fight over whether people should be allowed to carry it, and in 1996, New York became the last state to make it legal, over the objections of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who felt the rules were lax. 
The law requires the following label to appear on the cans:
''The use of this substance or device for any purpose other than self-defense is a criminal offense under the law.''
Pepper spray is regulated with other dangerous weapons. For anyone interested in the effect it has on people hit with it, there are plenty of videos available online. You can hear agonizing screams, especially when it hits the mucous membranes and soft tissue like the eyes.
Or you can check in with Chelsea Elliott, 25, who learned about it Saturday while standing on the sidewalk on East 12th Street with others who had been part of a march protesting elements of the American economic system.
''I felt something weird and wet on my face,'' she said. ''I said, 'What's that?' Then it burned so bad, my eyes -- it was unbelievably intense. My eyes were on fire.''
There are now multiple videos available that show some or all of the encounter, which took place at the end of a march that began in the financial district, where Occupy Wall Street has based itself for more than a week, and continuing to Union Square, a little more than two miles. The protesters did not have a permit, walked the wrong way up some streets, and when the police tried to steer them, just plowed ahead. It's a crowded city: a few hundred people wanted to march anywhere they felt like it, and a few hundred thousand people were going about their lives. In between were the police.
Inevitably, things came to a head.
''It got kind of weird around Union Square,'' Ms. Elliott said. ''That's when they tried to corral us into those nets. The march had ended. I was exhausted -- I just wanted to walk back to Wall Street.''
She was standing in one of the nets, occasionally screaming when someone was arrested.
Then a deputy inspector, a senior rank in the Police Department, walked up to the corral, quickly doused several people standing there with pepper spray, and just walked off. It stunned the protesters and police officers standing around them.
''I was in a state of shock,'' Ms. Elliott said. ''The officer I was talking to said, 'Thanks for the warning.' ''
IN the video, the deputy inspector, Anthony Bologna, looked as if he were spraying cockroaches. When asked about the matter, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, Paul J. Browne, said it had been used ''appropriately.''
In his statement, he also said, ''Pepper spray was used once after individuals confronted officers and tried to prevent them from deploying a mesh barrier -- something that was edited out or otherwise not captured in the video.''
Other videos have surfaced, and it is hard to square the events described by Mr. Browne with what they show. Earlier in the week, after a different encounter, Mr. Browne said a man had been arrested ''for jumping a police barrier and resisting arrest.'' A sequence of photographs published on the City Room blog of The New York Times showed precisely the opposite: a deputy inspector tried to pull a protester over a barrier, and then he jumped over to grab the protester. Mr. Browne later said he had gotten his facts scrambled.
It is axiomatic that early reports in confusing situations are usually wrong.
The pepper spray videos have gone around the world, trailed by Mr. Browne's instant justification and defense of them. The combination has done little credit to the Police Department, which, in fact, has had a generally civil and accommodating relationship with the protesters, according to many people on the scene.
If a nightstick were substituted for pepper spray, a conventional weapon instead of an exotic one, the events on 12th Street would bear a strong resemblance to simple assault.
''I have respect for police officers, but that man assaulted me,'' Ms. Elliott said. ''Bizarrely. Stupidly. Needlessly.''

HEADLINE: Instead of Waiting for Storm Aid, Going Online in a Do-It-Yourself Movement

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME; Sari Botton contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For Rob Hastings, it began when a fellow farmer offered him a pig.
With his 185-acre Rivermede Farm in the Adirondacks torn apart by the floodwaters of Tropical Storm Irene and his fall crop destroyed, on top of record flooding in April, the pig led to an idea borne of desperation. Why not hold a fund-raising dinner at his farm, which needed an instant infusion of funds for fixing fences to keep out deer, repairing a collapsed greenhouse and his maple sugaring equipment, and preparing for next year before the snows set in?
Mr. Hastings sent out word, 20 percent by regular mail and 80 percent by e-mail, hoping that 60 people might come and that he could raise $3,000. On Saturday night, he ended up with more than 100 people and more than $10,000, much of it from people he did not know who had heard about the event online.
''Needless to say, I'm blown away,'' he said. ''This could not have happened as quickly without getting out the word online. It allows us to do the work we need to do right now, while we play the waiting game for state and federal aid, if it does come.'' 
First comes the disaster, and then comes the help. It is an old rhythm, particularly of rural life, but as Washington squabbles over how much the country should spend on disasters, a combination of new media and economic despair has helped turbocharge do-it-yourself relief efforts in regions hit hard by the storm.
And while the phenomenon is presenting opportunities for instant aid, it is raising some potential problems as well.
Peg Ellsworth, executive director of The MARK Project, a 30-year-old organization that raises money for emergency repairs and affordable housing in the Catskills, said she was amazed by the impact the Internet and social media had on information sharing through the storm and during relief efforts afterward.
''It created a higher injection of awareness or support than there ever would have been in the past,'' Ms. Ellsworth said. ''I cannot possibly describe to you how broad our reach has gotten.''
She said that since the storm hit, the MARK project had raised $190,000 for flood relief.
Patrick Rooney, executive director of the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University, said there had long been an urban-rural divide, with city residents more inclined to give through established charities, while rural giving was more informal and spontaneous. The audience for those small events is now much wider.
''What's happening is Facebook and other social media and the Internet are allowing people to keep up with people who are very distant and people who are across the street or down the road in a way that didn't happen when you had to rely on face-to-face communication,'' Mr. Rooney said. ''There's really no data on this, but I could see how it's accelerating a very granular level of communitarian support and person-to-person relief.''
He said that giving was more a nimble and targeted supplement for government aid and traditional philanthropy than a replacement for it.
As it roared through upstate, Tropical Storm Irene was perhaps New York's first natural disaster that was fully a creature of the Internet and social media, its critical information source The Watershed Post, an online publication run by Julia Reischel and Lissa Harris from Delhi. It went from about 1,200 unique visitors a day to 60,000 on the day of the storm, and through Facebook and Twitter, the two women, as much as anyone, made the disaster national news.
Since then, Ms. Reischel and Ms. Harris have played a similar role in publicizing and vetting relief efforts.
A week ago Sunday, to pick a single day, there was the Catskill Mountain Healing Day, with New Age healing for people worn down by the storm and donations for flood victims; the Raise the Roof fund-raiser for local farmers in Hamden; and a relief concert in Woodstock. Other events and fund-raisers include Gowns for Greenbacks, a group that hikes the Catskills' highest peaks dressed in gowns as a way to raise money, or the ''Say Goodnight Irene''-themed flood-relief reading by local writers in Woodstock.
Heather Toboika of Krumville was taking her first shower after being without power and water for a week when she got the idea for the Catskill Mountain Healing Day.
Ms. Toboika, who works for an online marketing firm, contacted Adam Bernstein, a well-known psychic reader in Woodstock, and the two hit every online and offline medium they could. A week and a half later, they were at Chichester Yoga with organic sauerkraut and vegan zucchini muffins, Nidhi Huba's yoga classes, Mr. Bernstein's readings and assorted other New Age healers. They raised $600, and Ms. Toboika brought 10 bags of food and supplies to a shelter in Phoenicia.
Michael Wilcock, a musician and D.J., and Jacinta Bunnell, an artist, teacher and author of children's books, raise money for women's groups through campy arm-wrestling competitions. When the Rondout Creek rose and swept through their rental home, they created a Web site documenting their own disaster and asking for donations with a link to PayPal. They received responses from as far away as Seattle but declined to say how much they raised.
''We are in the privileged position of having access to technology and social networking, which helped us immensely in getting the word out,'' they said via e-mail. They added, ''There are a lot of people still in need of assistance who were left with nothing and who do not have the kind of support we have.''
Still, with so many people looking for help, some worry about issues including fraud and donor fatigue.
Jenifer Constantine, co-owner of Market Market Cafe in Rosendale, said that even before the storm, she received so many requests to place fliers asking for aid and containers for donations, she felt forced to turn them all down rather than look as if the cafe were promoting one over another or expecting customers to give.
''We don't want to push people,'' she said. ''We don't want to present an opinion one way or another about a cause that makes anyone feel obligated. Everybody's struggling. We're struggling.''
Similarly, Alison Gruber, a D.J. who is often asked to spin at fund-raisers, said she was beginning to feel tapped out.
''There are these farmers who completely lost their livelihoods,'' she said. ''It's frustrating, and it makes me sad not to be able to help everybody.''
Still, not all the social networking was done online.
Ms. Toboika, after networking online, drove into Phoenicia the day of the event to coax people out to her day of healing. She was pleasantly surprised.
''You know, old-fashioned talking to people face to face works better than anything,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Feeling Pinch of Europe's Oil Embargo, Syria Urgently Seeks New Customers

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
Syria is scrambling to find foreign buyers for its oil because of the tightening grip of a European embargo that has severely impeded Syrian oil sales, a vital source of earnings for Damascus.
The effects of the oil embargo were beginning to pinch Syria as the United Nations Security Council renewed its efforts on Tuesday to issue a resolution condemning the repression of pro-democracy demonstrators there, although continued Russian opposition to any Security Council sanctions means the measure is unlikely to include any, diplomats at the United Nations said.
Even without international sanctions coming from the United Nations, Europe and the United States have imposed their own. 
Syria normally exports about only 100,000 barrels of crude daily, but earnings from that oil have become more important to an economy battered by months of political unrest. Nearly all of the exports went to Europe until the European Union imposed sanctions this month, depriving the regime of President Bashar al-Assad of a quarter of its earnings denominated in foreign currency.
The last oil cargo loaded from a Syrian port was on Friday, and potential buyers are unable to finance purchases of Syrian crude so far because of the sanctions, said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, a Houston consulting firm, and former Amoco trader.
With the world economy slowing and Libya poised to begin exporting some oil again over the next month, supplies on the world market have become more plentiful in recent weeks, so there is no great urgency for an Asian buyer to do business with Syria, oil experts said.
Syria has requested that foreign oil companies operating in Syria cut back production because excess crude is filling the country's storage capacity. Some of those companies have already stopped their operations in Syria anyway -- in order to comply with the sanctions.
But oil experts say it is only a matter of time before the Syrians will be able to sell at least some of the oil, although they may have to sell at a discount.
''There is almost certainly someone who will buy it,'' said Michael C. Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, a consulting firm. ''In the past there have been trading companies that would launder oil for Iraq or Iran, for example. Some countries will buy gasoline from Caribbean refiners without knowing the origin of the oil.''
Ayham Kamel, a Middle East analyst at Eurasia Group, another consulting firm, said one Indian oil company had already been contacted by the Syrians and was considering making purchases.
Whether Syria is eventually able to sell its oil may depend on how hard the United States and Europe pressure Asian countries to abstain from buying.
It may also depend on how strongly protests in Syria continue, since Asian buyers may not want to be perceived as backing a losing government, especially after the victorious rebel forces in Libya have said they will favor countries that supported them and not the Qaddafi government during their rebellion.
Foreign oil companies operating in Syria include Royal Dutch Shell, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation of India, Total of France and the China National Petroleum Corporation. Bill Tanner, a Shell spokesman, said the company had stopped production in Syria and was not supplying ''any refined products to the Syrian government.''
Before the oil embargo, Syria sold nearly two-thirds of its exports to Italy and Germany, with almost all of the rest going to France, the Netherlands, Austria, Spain and Turkey. Shipping to Asia would cost the country at least $3 a barrel more in transportation costs.
At the United Nations, four European members of the Security Council -- Britain, France, Germany and Portugal -- negotiated the language of a draft resolution on Syria, trying to test the limits of what Russia would accept, diplomats said.
Until now, the Security Council has been able to issue only two statements about the uprising in Syria, falling short of the support needed for a full resolution, its strongest instrument. The decision to try again emerged from a meeting last Friday of the foreign ministers from the five permanent members on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.
''Politically speaking, morally speaking, it will be progress, because we cannot accept the silence of the Security Council when we see the violence and repression in Syria,'' Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, said in an interview after the meeting.
In his speech to the United Nations on Monday, the Syrian foreign minister, Walid Moualem, portrayed the government as having been on the brink of introducing reforms when a rebellion inspired by foreign radicals forced Syria to put aside change to maintain a united country. He warned that international sanctions would harm the daily lives of ordinary Syrians.
Russia and China, as well as other emerging powers currently on the Security Council -- India, Brazil and South Africa --were dismayed that the tough resolution passed on Libya in March was used as justification for the NATO bombing campaign. They appear determined not to allow a recurrence.
Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, defended Syria in his speech on Tuesday before the United Nations, calling on the opposition to work with the Assad government.
''It is inadmissible to boycott proposals on a national dialogue, stir up confrontation and provoke violence,'' Mr. Lavrov said, ''while neglecting albeit late but still achievable reforms proposed by President Bashar al-Assad.''
He added, ''It is important to encourage the authorities and the opposition to start negotiations and agree on the future of their country.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Reduces Estimate of Same-Sex-Couple Households

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
The Census Bureau on Tuesday greatly lowered its estimate for the number of same-sex-couple households in the United States, saying an inconsistency in the responses on census forms had inflated the numbers. 
The bureau reported that there were 646,464 same-sex-couple households in 2010, not 901,997 as it had reported in August. Among the couples in the new total, 131,729 were married.
Martin O'Connell, an official in the bureau's Social, Economic and Housing Statistics Division, said the problem appeared to have been caused by follow-up surveys of people who did not respond to the first census form and the bureau's misidentifying the sex of some respondents.
Gary Gates, a demographer at the University of California who helped review the bureau's revision, said the new estimates changed the total numbers of couples but not their regional distribution throughout the country.

HEADLINE: Political Waves From a Solar Deal

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''The Phony Solyndra Scandal'' (column, Sept. 24), Joe Nocera dances around the extracurricular behavior surrounding the Solyndra loan that may cost the taxpayers more than half a billion dollars.
Bad loans are made every day by banks; consider the mortgage bubble and subsequent events. The Solyndra affair has a similar footprint: the lender (our government) didn't do adequate due diligence, the loan is going sour because the market for the company's products crashed and everyone is pointing fingers at management for being too optimistic, which is not a crime. 
The problem with Solyndra is that the loan was politically motivated. The Obama administration rammed the deal through the system for its own political advantage, making it impossible for government credit analysts to ascertain that the market for the company's products was about to dry up.
It's a lesson this country fails to learn: government should stay out of commercial transactions and hire independent professionals to execute deals to support critical industries such as solar power. Now the opposition party is making hay out of the misstep.
SALVATORE J. BOMMARITO New York, Sept. 24, 2011
The writer is a retired investment banker.
To the Editor:
The lesson learned from Solyndra, the solar cell maker that received $528 million from the federal government and then went belly up, is not that the United States government should cede the battlefield in the clean energy sector to our competitors.
In fact, the United States is now losing the race for renewable energy to China and Germany in large part because those two governments provide strong supports for solar, wind and other technologies. These governments assume some risk, and not all projects succeed. But they are now the top two leaders in a worldwide industry that saw investment jump 32 percent in 2010, even in the midst of a widespread economic crisis.
If we're ever going to catch up to China and Germany, United States-based clean energy companies need help from our government, along with complementary policies to address the overall trade imbalance. Without that support, our clean energy companies will continue losing ground and our country will continue losing the manufacturing jobs they provide.
LEO W. GERARD President, United Steelworkers Pittsburgh, Sept. 24, 2011
To the Editor:
Joe Nocera focuses on whether Solyndra executives misused a federally guaranteed loan. Who cares? The real ''scandal'' is the Obama's administration's sweet-sounding solar-energy fantasies.
The solar-power industry is in disarray: rife with bankruptcies and companies that can't stay afloat without loans, subsidies and government interference in the market.
Someday solar energy might be able to compete with and even surpass coal as an energy source. But right now, it can't, and no amount of investing will change that.
ANDY HARALDSON Boca Raton, Fla., Sept. 24, 2011
To the Editor:
Bravo, Joe Nocera. Government incentive programs are intended to make high-risk ventures bankable. A priori, these ventures are more prone to failure. The governor of Massachusetts, Deval Patrick, is getting pilloried for his $58 million underwriting of Evergreen Solar, which was also overrun by the Chinese attack on solar panel prices.
We need to learn from Germany, easily the world leader in solar energy. It understands that government must subsidize and nurture renewable energy to make it competitive. Its panel producers survived the industry repricing, and Germany has announced the closing of all of its nuclear plants by 2022. Whatever your take on nuclear energy, Germany at least had the option to redesign its energy platform.

HEADLINE: Putin Returning to Presidency, Not Necessarily to Form

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- We know Vladimir V. Putin will rule Russia for the foreseeable future. The question is, which Mr. Putin?
Will he be the reformer of 2001, who said the single most important measure of a country's leaders is ''how they protect citizens from the arbitrariness of racketeers, bandits and bribe-takers''? Or perhaps the man who called President George W. Bush on Sept. 11 before any other world leader?
Will he be the bully of the next year, who responded to a French reporter's critical question about civilian casualties in Chechnya with a threat to circumcise him? Or the hawk of 2007, who stood on Red Square and compared United States foreign policy to that of the Third Reich? 
Or even the conciliator of 2010, who knelt in the forest of Katyn to mourn 20,000 Polish officers massacred by the Soviet secret police at the start of World War II?
Mr. Putin, 58, has made many shifts since 1999, when, after a career in the shadows of Soviet intelligence agencies, he was selected to succeed Boris N. Yeltsin as Russia's president. His transformations trace the fortunes of Russia itself, which rode the oil boom to become a defiant presence on the world stage and was thrust into deep uncertainty by the 2008 collapse of financial markets.
Putin 2.0, as some people are calling him, is unlikely to diverge drastically from the path set by President Dmitri A. Medvedev, who succeeded him in 2008 and sought to improve the business climate and reassure foreign investors. But Mr. Putin will most likely find it difficult to embrace reforms that devolve power away from the Kremlin, like the establishment of an independent judiciary, said Marat Guelman, who was a political operative and ally of Mr. Putin's in the early 2000s.
''It's not simple, because he will have to overcome what he did himself,'' said Mr. Guelman, who now owns an art gallery in Moscow. ''It is difficult to fight with yourself. It is a different Putin, but nevertheless it is the same. His type of management is vertical. That is the only way he knows how to manage. To manage something more complex, to take into account conflicting opinions -- he never learned how to do it.''
At the outset of the ''tandem'' government three years ago, Mr. Medvedev made modernization his political brand, while Mr. Putin stood for stability. But Mr. Putin seems to be adjusting his message. On Monday, in his first appearance as the chosen presidential candidate, Mr. Putin ordered federal bodies to switch from paper to electronic documentation -- a curious order from a man who, aides say, remains reluctant to use the Internet.
On Friday, the day before the announcement that he would be a candidate for president, Mr. Putin said leaders needed to listen to criticisms from human rights organizations. The remark was a little grudging, as he noted that rights campaigners ''concern themselves with problems which do not affect a person's everyday life,'' in contrast to first-tier rights like salaries. But it was, at least, softer than his 2007 statement that they ''scavenge like jackals at foreign embassies.''
Mr. Putin seems ready to throw his weight behind cooperation with Western European and American companies, as evidenced by the signing in August of a deal allowing Exxon to explore for oil in a Russian part of the Arctic Ocean. And Saturday left no doubt that Mr. Putin has supported the reset with the United States, a project publicly tied to Mr. Medvedev.
A far bigger question is whether Mr. Putin will tolerate pluralism. It was in his first presidency that he wrested control of television stations that criticized his policies, and he eliminated direct elections of governors and senators. He will return as president of a different country -- one in which the population can get news from the Internet, the oil-fueled rise in living standards is ending, and the popularity of the ruling party, United Russia, is waning.
In the past, he cracked down precisely when he felt under threat, said Aleksei Mukhin, director of the Center for Political Information, a Moscow research center.
''Putin is a liberal -- it's just that when the situation around him becomes dangerous and tense, he momentarily turns into an authoritarian,'' Mr. Mukhin said. ''It is a self-protective reaction.''
In fact, reform and authoritarianism are bound together in Mr. Putin's view; the strong centralized governing style known as the ''power vertical'' was seen as necessary for reforms, said Aleksei V. Makarkin of the Center for Political Technologies, another research center in Moscow. The early Mr. Putin, he said, could fairly be compared to the czarist prime minister Pyotr Stolypin, who pushed through historic land reforms but executed so many of his rivals that the hangman's noose became known as ''Stolypin's necktie.''
The second Mr. Putin, Mr. Makarkin said, dated from the 2003 arrest of the defiant oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, when the state strengthened its role in the economy; in 2005, Mr. Putin began to put up protections against popular uprisings like the one that had shaken Ukraine.
The third appeared after the 2008 financial crisis, when it became clear that Russia had no choice but to open up. The fourth, Mr. Makarkin predicted, will seek to preserve the political status quo while allowing economic reforms.
''I think actually it's not four Putins -- it's the evolution of one person,'' Mr. Makarkin said. ''It's the evolution of a person who came with one sense of what was necessary to do, and then felt those things were not enough to protect his power.''
In any case, a decade, or two decades, in the byzantine environment of the Russian power elite can have its own effect on a person. Alexander Rahr, who wrote a biography of Mr. Putin, recalled an impromptu invitation from the leader early in his presidency. By the time both were on their second vodka, Mr. Rahr said, the conversation had begun to feel ''completely normal.'' But that was a long time ago.
Now, Mr. Rahr said, ''he would never meet with people like me simply to find out what people think.''
''He is surrounded by a byzantine kind of servants who praise him, who work this way: they praise the leader to get benefits and privileges for themselves,'' said Mr. Rahr, of the German Council on Foreign Relations. ''You need a very strong character to resist it, especially in a country like Russia. I hope he will manage it, with his own conscience.''

HEADLINE: $4 Billion Tech Deal Is Cheered as Sign of State's Appeal

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY - I.B.M. and four other technology companies agreed Tuesday to pour $4 billion into computer-chip research in New York, promising to hire thousands of workers and giving a major boost to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo as he campaigns for companies to invest in the state and create jobs.
Mr. Cuomo, sounding downright giddy as he kicked off an economic development conference here, heralded the investment as a ''really, really big deal'' that proved that New York, especially upstate, could lure new investment from major corporations flush with potential suitors. 
His announcement came as former President Bill Clinton, whom Mr. Cuomo served as housing secretary, made an appearance at the conference and urged business leaders and local officials to embrace environmentally friendly technology and new industries as they try to create jobs.
The computer-chip investment deal will be led by I.B.M., which will invest $3.6 billion, and will also include Intel, Samsung, GlobalFoundries and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. The governor's office said it would create 2,500 high-technology jobs and 1,900 construction jobs, and would also preserve 2,500 existing jobs.
''I think it's important to remember, as we start this conference - a better affirmation of our potential you could not have,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''These companies could have gone anywhere on the globe.''
Over the past two decades, New York State has invested heavily in the burgeoning nanotechnology industry, primarily in the capital region. Mr. Cuomo and others have highlighted the effort as a model for regional economic development in the economically depressed upstate region.
The state will spend $400 million over five years as part of the new research deal. The money will go toward expanding the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering at the University at Albany, and the investment by the technology companies will go toward creating jobs in Albany, Yorktown Heights, East Fishkill, Utica and Canandaigua.
Mr. Cuomo and other lawmakers said they hoped that the new research and development activities would lead to the construction of chip plants in several years, creating many more jobs, and would also serve as an example to other companies that New York was increasingly attractive to major corporations seeking to invest in research and high-technology manufacturing facilities.
''It's huge for the message, and it's huge for the jobs that go with it,'' the State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who has been a booster of the nanotechnology sector in the capital region, said in an interview.
In his speech, Mr. Clinton, citing San Diego's success with biotechnology and the computer simulation business in Orlando, Fla., suggested that the capital region could similarly exploit its nanotechnology industry to turn around its economic fortunes.
Mr. Clinton focused mostly on giving economic-development tips: he particularly encouraged pursuing jobs related to clean energy sources and retrofitting buildings to be more energy-efficient. But he also offered a dollop of praise for the governor and lawmakers for their handling of the state's budget gap last winter, suggesting that Mr. Cuomo's fiscal stewardship would help encourage businesses to invest here.
''I travel all over America and all over the world, and the confidence people have in New York outside this state has exploded just because the government did its job,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''They showed up, passed the budget on time, didn't raise taxes - it's an amazing, amazing thing for you.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: For Bank of America, a Looming $50 Billion Claim of Havoc

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff, a former corporate lawyer, is a professor at the Michael E. Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @Steven Davidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
Bank of America's potential liability for bad mortgages - in the tens of billions of dollars - is well known. But Bank of America is haunted by other demons from the financial crisis, the most significant one being a lawsuit arising from its troubled Merrill Lynch acquisition.
This lawsuit, brought by Bank of America shareholders, claims that Bank of America and its executives, including its former chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, failed to disclose what would be a $15.31 billion loss at Merrill in the days before and after the acquisition. The plaintiffs contend that this staggering loss was hidden to ensure that Bank of America shareholders did not vote against the transaction.
Bank of America disclosed this loss after Merrill was acquired. At the same time, Bank of America also disclosed a $20 billion bailout by the government. The bank's stock fell by more than 60 percent in a two-week period, a market value loss of more than $50 billion. 
This episode also spawned a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission that Bank of America, Mr. Lewis and Joseph Price, the former chief financial officer, settled for $150 million. Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the Federal District Court in Manhattan approved the deal but complained that it didn't sufficiently penalize the individuals involved. The amount was paid by Bank of America with no liability for Mr. Lewis or Mr. Price. Judge Rakoff called the settlement ''half-baked justice at best.''
Judge Rakoff may see his wish for greater penalties granted. The New York attorney general's office has a lawsuit on the matter.
More significantly, a lawsuit seeking about $50 billion was brought by some of the largest class-action law firms and is quietly advancing in the Federal District Court in Manhattan.
The plaintiffs contend that Bank of America engaged in a deliberate effort to deceive the bank's shareholders.
According to the plaintiffs, who include the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System and a Netherlands pension plan that is the second-largest in Europe, Bank of America's senior management, including Mr. Lewis and Mr. Price, began to learn of large losses at Merrill Lynch in early November 2008, months before the deal closed.
Mr. Price met with the bank's general counsel, Timothy J. Mayopoulos, to discuss whether to disclose the loss - at the time about $5 billion - to Bank of America shareholders. Mr. Mayopoulos testified to the New York attorney general's office that while his initial reaction was that disclosure was warranted, he decided against it. Merrill had been losing $2.1 billion to $9.8 billion a quarter during the financial crisis, and so this loss would be expected by Merrill and Bank of America shareholders.
Plaintiffs in the private action and the New York attorney general's complaint claim that after this meeting, Mr. Price and other senior executives at Bank of America sought to keep this loss quiet and that Mr. Price in particular misled Mr. Mayopoulos.
Mr. Mayopoulos has testified that on Dec. 3, 2008, Mr. Price told him that the estimated loss would be $7 billion.
Mr. Mayopoulos concluded again that no disclosure was necessary. Plaintiffs contend that Mr. Price misled Mr. Mayopoulos as the forecasted loss at this time had now grown to more than $10 billion.
The Bank of America vote occurred on Dec. 5 without its shareholders knowing about this gigantic looming Merrill loss, which was now about $11 billion.
Mr. Mayopoulos has testified he was surprised at this higher number when he learned of it at a Dec. 9 board meeting. Mr. Mayopoulos sought to meet with Mr. Price about the new loss. The next day, Mr. Mayopoulos was fired and escorted out of the building.
The Merrill acquisition was completed on Jan. 1, 2009.
Two weeks later, Bank of America disclosed for the first time that Merrill had suffered an after-tax net loss of $15.31 billion.
Bank of America has argued in its defense that the exact amount of the loss was uncertain during this time. Moreover, this disclosure was not necessary because Merrill's losses were within the range of previous losses and included a good will write-off of about $2 billion that was previously disclosed. The total loss was not material.
But if it is true that Mr. Price, with Mr. Lewis's assent, kept this information from Mr. Mayopoulos in order to avoid disclosure, this is a prima facie case of securities fraud. Would Bank of America shareholders have voted to approve this transaction? If the answer is no, then it is hard to see this as anything other than material information.
Plaintiffs in this private case have the additional benefit that this claim is related to a shareholder vote. It is easier to prove securities fraud related to a shareholder vote than more typical securities fraud claims like accounting fraud. Shareholder vote claims do not require that the plaintiffs prove that the person committing securities fraud did so with awareness that the statement was wrong or otherwise recklessly made. You only need to show that the person should have acted with care.
This case is not only easier to establish, but the potential damages could also be enormous. Damages in a claim like this are calculated by looking at the amount lost as a result of the securities fraud. A court will most likely calculate this by referencing the amount that Bank of America stock dropped after the loss was announced; this is as much as $50 billion. It is a plaintiff's lawyer's dream.
Bank of America is facing a huge liability from this claim. It is also facing even more liability for those who bought and sold stock during this period up until Jan. 15. In a ruling on July 29, the judge in this case allowed these claims to proceed against Bank of America, Mr. Price and Mr. Lewis. The judge had already ruled that the disclosure claim related to the proxy vote could proceed.
This case is on a relatively fast track, with an October 2012 trial date.
Given the $50 billion claim looming over it, Bank of America will most likely try to settle this litigation. The settlement value appears to be in the billions. Firing your main witness - Mr. Mayopoulos - and escorting him out the door no doubt only increases the cost.
The case shows how regulators' actions can be supplemented by private actions. And if the plaintiffs win, this case may be the exceedingly rare event of directors and officers, particularly Mr. Lewis and Mr. Price, actually having to pay money personally to settle a securities fraud claim. If so, the two men would join the relatively few executives from the financial crisis who have been personally penalized.
Whatever the outcome of this case, it appears that Bank of America shareholders were sacrificed in December 2008 so that the Merrill deal could be completed. The bill may now be coming due for Bank of America.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Seizing Populist Mantle, Obama Pushes Jobs Bill

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
DENVER -- After two days of energetically raising money in the rarefied precincts of Hollywood and Silicon Valley, President Obama stopped at a big-city high school here on Tuesday to push for new ways to spend money.
Promoting his $450 billion jobs bill, Mr. Obama said the $25 billion in the legislation for repairing and renovating schools would allow Abraham Lincoln High School, a well-kept but aging institution, to update science laboratories of a 1960s vintage. 
''My question to Congress is: What on earth are we waiting for? Let's get to work,'' Mr. Obama said to a boisterous crowd of students. Speaking in shirtsleeves under a baking sun, he asked: ''Why should our students be allowed to study in crumbling, outdated schools? How does that give them the sense that education is important?''
Neither Mr. Obama's choice of Colorado, nor of this heavily Latino high school in a struggling part of Denver, were remotely accidental. He carried Colorado in 2008, and with his support wobbling in other swing states like Ohio, analysts believe he will need to hold on to it next year to put together a winning electoral map.
But Colorado, as much as any state, symbolizes the ebb tide in Mr. Obama's political fortunes. He accepted the Democratic nomination in this state and signed the $787 billion stimulus package here. But with the jobless rate here rising to 8.5 percent from 7.4 percent since then, even Democrats here say Colorado could be an uphill battle.
The Lincoln High speech also enabled Mr. Obama to reach out to Latino voters, who helped elect him. More than 95 percent of the students here receive federal meal benefits, local officials said -- a measure of the depth of poverty in the surrounding neighborhoods.
Reprising the populist themes of recent speeches in Ohio, North Carolina and Virginia, Mr. Obama repeatedly challenged Republicans to pass the jobs bill. Extending the cut in payroll taxes would put $1,700 into the pockets of a typical Colorado working family, Mr. Obama said, and refusing to do so would amount to hitting them with a tax increase. Cries of ''pass the bill'' competed with chants of ''four more years.''
Far from rejecting the Republican accusation that he is waging class warfare, Mr. Obama now seems to revel in it.
''If asking a millionaire to pay the same tax rate as a plumber or a teacher makes me a class warrior, a warrior for the middle class, I will accept that; I'll wear that as a badge of honor,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Because the only class warfare I've seen is the battle that's been waged against the middle class in this country for a decade now.''
For all the populist fire on display, Colorado may be kinder to Mr. Obama than the traditional battlegrounds of the Midwest because of its more affluent and educated independent voters.
While Mr. Obama has lost support among independents generally, he retains a narrow approval rating -- 50 percent to 43 percent -- among those who earn more than $100,000 a year, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. A senior adviser to Mr. Obama said his message of innovating to keep America competitive would also resonate with the technology workers sprinkled through Denver's suburbs.
If approved, the American Jobs Act would modernize at least 35,000 schools nationwide, according to the White House. But Republicans in Congress are unlikely to approve this provision, or any other spending that could be construed as fiscal stimulus.
White House officials said they expected the House to go along with a few elements of the package, like the extension of the cut in the payroll tax and the expansion of unemployment insurance. Mr. Obama has not ruled out accepting this piecemeal approach.
Mr. Obama's brief stop in Denver wound up a hectic three-day West Coast tour that served mainly to fortify his campaign coffers after a fallow summer in which he was stuck in Washington, bickering with Republicans over the debt ceiling.
In Los Angeles, at a slick West Hollywood restaurant, the president basked in the love of an entertainment-industry crowd that included the actress Eva Longoria; the director Judd Apatow; the music producer Quincy Jones; and Jeffrey Katzenberg, a DreamWorks studio executive.
''I have a dependency on President Obama,'' Mr. Katzenberg said, slipping into the argot of his industry. ''He inherited a crashing economy and two wars. Yet he kept us moving forward. We must keep fighting for him so he can keep fighting for us.''
Thanking Mr. Katzenberg, the president joked that some people in the room, each of whom paid $17,900 for the privilege of being there, knew him before he had gray hair. ''You don't have gray hair,'' cried one, proving that Hollywood is, as ever, the land of make-believe.

HEADLINE: Short-Term Fixes That Take Time And Resolve Little

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It was a telling moment Monday night when Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, called a deal to keep the government open for a few more weeks ''a win for everyone.''
That a convoluted agreement to finance the entire government on what amounts to an installment plan could be hailed as a big victory underscores, if unintentionally, the broader institutional failure now bedeviling Congress: Short-term spending legislation, cobbled together with an eye toward passing a divided Congress rather than achieving a higher civic goal, is the new normal. 
From this year's series of short-term deals to keep the government's lights on, to another set to keep the doors of the Federal Aviation Administration open, to the dozen laws that temporarily block cuts in Medicare payments to doctors until ''fixed,'' Congress sometimes feels less like a legislative branch than a beauty shop, where everything gets prettied up, but only temporarily.
Short-term spending bills and expiring tax provisions have existed almost as long as government, but the sheer volume of such measures has been increasing every year, and with them, fiscal policy experts say, government uncertainty and the related partisan imbroglios that are contributing to America's ever dimmer view of Congress.
''From a public policy viewpoint,'' said Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University, short-term deals ''eat up a lot of legislators' time. They can't focus on any bigger issues because they keep spending all their time on these extensions. They create a lot of economic uncertainly, and feed into the public's discontent and cynicism about the process because there is so much brinkmanship involved in these deals.''
While the fight over short-term spending deals -- run-of-the-mill extenders that have twice this year led the country to the brink of a government shutdown -- have gotten the most attention, it is actually the constantly expiring tax provisions that create more economic uncertainty.
A practice that began to take hold in the late 1970s, the idea of making some tax cuts temporary has become a way of letting lawmakers test out a program, as in the case of a credit for research and development that has been renewed numerous times for decades, so they can do away with it later, or at least threaten to. Congress also keeps the official cost of the programs down, distorting their true impact on the budget.
At a recent hearing before the bipartisan Congressional committee to reduce the deficit, Thomas A. Barthold, the chief of staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation, lamented the growing number of such provisions, which he said numbered around 150 expiring provisions every two years. ''It certainly creates uncertainty, said Mr. Barthold, ''both at the individual level and at the business level, of what's the law going to be next year.''
Such short-term extenders have also distracted Mr. Reid from doing what President Obama has been imploring Congress to do for weeks, which is to bring his jobs bill to the floor. (Of course, it is just as likely that Mr. Reid does not want to embarrass fellow Democrats into having to vote for a bill many of them find fatally flawed, so instead he busies himself with expiring budget bills, with House Republicans as his willing adversary.)
''Short-term extensions make it possible to not have to come up with long-term solutions,'' said J. D. Foster, a senior fellow in the Economics of Fiscal Policy at the Heritage Foundation.
In normal years, Congress falls behind on its appropriations bills toward the end of the fiscal year, on Sept 30, and is forced to turn to short-term provisions, called continuing resolutions, to finance the government for a few months. Now, those resolutions tend to be serial, and under divided government, have become a source for parties to fight over spending, and, this year, even social policy measures that become attached to the bills, leading to nail-biting impasses that have almost caused the government to shut down.
The Senate acted Monday to pass a one-week spending bill, which is set for approval by the House on Thursday in a brief pro forma session, provided no lawmakers, who are currently on recess, show up to protest it. Next week, the House will debate the Senate-approved measure to finance the government though mid-November.
There have been other, smaller-scale showdowns. Because of partisan disagreements over various provisions of a humdrum extension of a bill to keep the Federal Aviation Administration financed, thousands of F.A.A. employees were furloughed and airport safety inspectors worked without pay in a partial shutdown of the agency this summer.
Further, there are several tax provisions that expire at the end of 2011 that are known as the ''traditional'' extenders package, which include individual and business provisions like the teacher expense deduction, state and local sales tax deduction, and the research and development tax credit. Those types of extenders used to sail through the Senate with a convincing majority of votes, but are now all subject to filibusters and elaborate negotiations in the Senate and resistance in the Republican-controlled House.
The mother of all extenders are the so-called Bush tax cuts, which were renewed last year for two more years and sit at the white-hot center of the debate between Republicans and Democrats over tax policy and the role of government in American life.
The constant extending often creates anxiety for those affected by the laws.
''These short-term extensions are the definition of instability for the families, seniors and small businesses that need them most,'' said Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. ''Short-term extensions simply don't encourage job creation or provide the certainty that families and businesses need in these tough economic times.''

HEADLINE: Nagging Fears on Europe Slow a Wall Street Rally

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and LIZ ALDERMAN; Joshua Brustein contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Is the rally in the markets showing signs of ending?
Stocks rose on Tuesday, extending a global rally into a third consecutive day, as investors anticipated a more ambitious plan by European leaders to deal with the euro zone debt crisis. But they were unable to hold on to their sharpest gains.
After jumping 2.5 percent on Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average added 1.33 percent Tuesday, rising 146.83 points, to 11,190.69. Earlier in the day, the Dow was up as much as 325 points. But the markets lost steam in late trading on concerns that a second bailout for Greece could be scuttled by countries that wanted banks to shoulder more of the burden. 
The euphoria at the start of the week centered on talk of a plan to give extra firepower to Europe's proposed 440 billion euro (about $600 million) bailout fund for troubled nations and banks. Under a possible new plan, the fund could be enhanced to insure as much as a couple of trillion euros in loans.
Even if leaders manage to eventually expand the war chest, it is far from certain that the larger crisis in Europe will be contained. For one thing, the money might not be enough if the already weakened European economy falls into a prolonged recession. Recent data show that manufacturing and services activity there are sliding toward contraction, and that the region's economy probably stagnated in the third quarter.
As it is, Greece, Portugal and Spain are looking at lengthy economic downturns as a result of harsh austerity measures adopted to straighten their finances. In Italy, economists are increasingly worried that that a 45 billion euro ($61 billion) austerity package recently rushed through Parliament could tip the economy into a downturn.
Germany and France also have started to show signs of a slowdown, a more worrisome development since they are considered engines of the European economy.
''They are buying time,'' said Jens Nordvig, an economist at Nomura in New York. ''But it only postpones the problem. Growth is slowing in countries like Italy. They may be too late.''
The immediate hurdle for each of the 17 countries in the euro currency zone is to approve the 440 billion euro fund proposed in July. So far only seven have done so. Slovenia signed off on Tuesday and there are critical votes set for Wednesday in Finland and in Germany on Thursday.
European leaders say the process should be completed by mid-October but already investors judge it insufficient to cope with the scale of problems in Greece and other troubled nations.
As a result, a new plan is emerging in Europe that would let the European Central Bank or another European institution, like the European Investment Bank, buy troubled sovereign debt or loans from euro zone banks with the backing of the fund.
Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, turned up the heat on Europe in the last few days to expand the war chest exponentially by leveraging its resources, possibly by running it like a bank that could borrow additional money.
The governor of Canada's central bank, Mark Carney, said last week that Europe should make about one trillion euros available to ''overwhelm'' the crisis.
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, offered cautious backing to the idea on Tuesday, saying leaders ''need to look at possible leverage.'' The bank's support would probably be essential to such a plan.
But critics said that using it to buy distressed government debt held by banks would only shift the problem to Europe's taxpayers. That would worsen the region's sovereign debt crisis and potentially compromise even relatively strong nations like Germany and France.
Other Europeans are grumbling that the United States is hardly in a position to lecture them on how to manage a crisis, and it is not clear how quickly or easily the fund could be expanded. Germany, for one, does not want the independent central bank to be involved in the fund's operations.
Still, no politician wants to pump even more taxpayer money directly into the fund, which would anger voters and put the AAA ratings of Germany and France at risk. Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, on Tuesday derided the idea as ''silly.''
The prospect of a new plan, which emerged during a weekend of meetings of world leaders in Washington and after some urging by the United States, seemed to represent a realization that Europe had to do something to bring itself back from the brink. For weeks, global markets had lurched downward and investors had become increasingly concerned that Europe's failure to act was disrupting confidence and growth around the world.
On Tuesday in Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, closed up 5.3 percent.
Later, the United States markets gave up some of their gains after The Financial Times reported that some countries were demanding that banks take a bigger hit in Greece's debt restructuring and that Greece needed deeper financing than was thought two months ago. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.07 percent, or 12.43 points, to 1,175.38, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 1.2 percent, to 2,546.83.
Earlier Tuesday, Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive of Pimco, who has long been pessimistic about Europe's efforts to solve its crisis, expressed optimism for a solution. ''They recognize they have deep problems and they recognize they need to do something about it,'' he said in a Bloomberg radio interview. ''This was a very important wake-up call for Europe.'' He added that European leaders ''finally get it.''
But skepticism remained.
''It is not clear to me that, though they may have 'got it,' anything has actually happened,'' said Carl Weinberg, an economist at High Frequency Economics. ''At this point, you have got to show me the money.''

HEADLINE: Health Insurers Push Premiums Sharply Higher

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON and NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Major health insurance companies have been charging sharply higher premiums this year, outstripping any growth in workers' wages and creating more uncertainty for the Obama administration and employers who are struggling to drive down an unrelenting rise in medical costs.
A study released on Tuesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a research group, showed that the average annual premium for family coverage through an employer reached $15,073 in 2011 -- 9 percent higher than in the previous year. And even higher premiums could be on the way, particularly in New York, where some companies are asking for double-digit increases for about 1.3 million New Yorkers in individual or small-group plans, setting up a battle with state regulators.
The higher premiums are particularly unwelcome at a time when the economy is sputtering and unemployment is hovering at about 9 percent. Many businesses cite the cost of coverage as a factor in their decision not to hire, and health insurance has become increasingly unaffordable for more Americans. The cost of family coverage has about doubled since 2001, compared with a 34 percent gain in wages.
Aetna and United Health/Oxford said their requested rate increases in New York largely reflected actual hospital, physician and pharmacy costs. ''Our rate requests are simply keeping pace,'' said Maria Gordon Shydlo, a spokeswoman. 
How much the new federal health care legislation pushed by President Obama is affecting rates remains a point of debate, with some consumer advocates and others suggesting that insurers have raised prices in anticipation of new rules that would, in 2012, require them to justify any increase of more than 10 percent. Kaiser pointed out that the increase this year could be an anomaly, after several years of 3 percent to 5 percent increases during the recession.
Kaiser estimates that one to two percentage points of the increase this year is related to provisions of the law already in effect, like coverage for children up to 26 years old and for prevention services like mammograms.
New York, along with states including California, Connecticut and North Carolina, has been exercising its regulatory muscle to try to tamp down some of the increases. The Obama administration this month funneled a total of $109 million to many states, in part to help fight against ''unreasonable'' increases.
The increases now under consideration in New York would affect 1.3 million of the 3 million residents in individual and small-group plans; the amounts vary considerably depending on the type of policy. The increases requested by Aetna, for example, range from 8.9 percent to 53.6 percent, while those from United Health Group/Oxford range from 13 percent to 34 percent, according to the State Insurance Department.
The state's power to deny increases does not extend to rates for large employers; the Kaiser survey included large and small company policies, which cover about 60 percent of working-age Americans with insurance. Employers, on average, pay the bulk of premiums and absorb some of the increase each year while passing the rest onto workers.
The increase in premiums was striking because in a poor economy, many people put off going to doctors, to avoid co-payments and higher deductibles. Despite a decrease in the use of medical services, companies have defended higher premiums -- and their high profits -- reasoning that their costs would rebound once the economy recovered.
Insurers also say that the use and price of medical services have continued to rise in individual and small-group plans, in part because those policies tend to have a higher proportion of people with serious illnesses. If the health care law survives legal challenges and goes into full effect in 2014, increased competition will make it tougher for companies to charge those customers more, the administration says.
In New York, consumer advocates contend that the latest requests exceed any documented rise in costs, with some companies enjoying three years of record profits and paying millions of dollars in dividends and executive compensation.
''We're at a watershed moment,'' said Elisabeth Benjamin, who represents Health Care for All New York, a group of 100 organizations advocating affordable care. ''The Cuomo administration has to decide, will the Department of Insurance stand up for the little guy, John Q. Public, or let the insurance companies get away with this nonsense?''
Since last year, the Insurance Department has posted more than 4,000 policyholder objections online. In one typical letter, a small businessman, citing six years of annual increases of more than 15 percent, raged, ''There are no words to express how utterly greedy and unconscionable another double-digit increase in health care costs are to the world of small companies and those employed by them.''
Such messages are not lost on Benjamin M. Lawsky, the state's superintendent of financial services, who oversees the department. ''We get it,'' he said. ''These increases are often hitting people who just can't afford it.''
''At the same time,'' he added, ''we have to make sure these companies stay healthy. What keeps us up at night is the need to strike a responsible balance.''
Decisions are expected in October. In the first round of reviews late last year, on premiums that took effect Jan. 1, the department approved a 10 percent increase, on the average, reduced from requests averaging 14 percent. Mr. Lawsky said the result showed the system was working.
But to Leslie Moran, senior vice president of the New York Health Plan Association, an industry group, the result confirms that under the new law, the process bows to political pressure, not actuarial reality.
''There was an effort to somewhat artificially suppress premiums to prove that the prior approval system was working,'' she said, noting that New York requires at least 82 percent of premium revenue be spent on paying medical claims. (Nationwide, under the new health care law, the minimum is 80 percent.)
One company, MVP Health Care -- asked about its highest rate increase requests: 40 percent, 55 percent and 56.8 percent in three plans in Rochester -- said the requests had been made in error and were withdrawn last week. Gary Hughes, a company spokesman, said the plans had 805 policyholders and MVP intended to drop them at the end of the year. It was not clear what those customers would do.
Such changes can leave regulators with little recourse. Allan Evans, a musicologist who was undergoing chemotherapy for lymphoma last year, was notified that his Emblem Health premium would increase 270 percent, to $2,293 a month for his family's $5,000-deductible policy, provided through his wife's business, a small Italian language school in Greenwich Village. Emblem had eliminated his family's category and offered a more expensive plan. That kind of increase is not reviewable by the state.
''We were in shock,'' Mr. Evans, 55, said. What saved him, he said, was a change in his part-time contract at the New School that made him eligible for coverage.
Ilene Margolin, a spokeswoman for Emblem, said she could not comment on an individual case, but added: ''We lost tens of millions on some of those products. For some people, we reviewed if they were in the right risk pool. I'm not saying this is pretty, but there were actuarially sound reasons.''
Although demand for care nationwide appears to be growing relatively slowly, insurers and benefit consultants also say prices for medical care continue to climb as drug makers and hospitals charge more. ''If they're a popular brand or anchor hospital, they're going to negotiate a significant increase if they can,'' said Edward A. Kaplan, a benefits expert with the Segal Company, which recently surveyed insurers about costs.
Some analysts and companies are already questioning the high increase found through Kaiser's survey, saying costs are slowing down and increases in premiums would probably be more moderate in 2012.
Some small business say they expect their premiums not to rise as sharply, only because younger, healthier employees are keeping claims low. ''Up until last year, we saw very hefty increases -- double digits,'' said Heather Gombos, an executive for R. M. Jones & Co. and affiliated businesses in New Britain, Conn., which insures about 50 of 80 employees.
Family coverage is now running $12,000 a year, Ms. Gombos said, and she is waiting to see what increases are proposed for the coming year. ''What it comes down to is good luck,'' she said.

HIGHLIGHT: If you pay attention to it. 

 BODY:
Kevin O'Rourke follows up on some of what I've been writing, and argues that doing good macroeconomics depends crucially on knowing a fair bit about economic history. Indeed.
By the way, he's right that Obstfeld, Rogoff, and yours truly all had the benefit of studying with Charles Kindleberger and Peter Temin. But that's not all. The late Rudi Dornbusch, who I'm pretty sure advised all of us, was big on the usefulness of studying history. 
I still remember his advice when I began searching for a thesis topic. He urged me (and presumably his other students) to take a break from reading recent economics literature, and looking for twiddles on the currently fashionable models. Better, he said, to read a lot of economic history for a few months, plus reading up on current events, in search of real issues and real experiences that needed explaining.
I'd also say that there's history and then there's history. Knowing the time-series properties of US quarterly data since 1947 isn't what I mean. In macro, in particular, you need to know about drastic events. I don't have it in front of me, but in his book on the German hyperinflation Frank Graham said roughly this: "Disorder is, for the social sciences, the sole substitute for the controlled experiments of the natural sciences." That means knowing about prewar experience; it also means knowing about international experience -- for there have been numerous crises even since World War II, just not in the United States.
Indeed, my sense is that international macroeconomists -- people who followed the ERM crises of the early 1990s, the Latin American debt crisis, the Asian crisis of the late 90s, and so on -- were caught much less flat-footed than economists who limited most of their interest to the United States. The now-infamous 2003 Lucas remark about how the problem of depression-prevention has been solved was not something you would have heard from an economist who had paid attention to Mexico, Indonesia, Argentina etc..
Unfortunately, many economists have not learned from the past. And that's at least part of the reason we are apparently condemned to repeat it.

HEADLINE: Think Globally, Deal Locally

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Private equity firms, corporate suitors and investment bankers are increasingly venturing overseas, touching down in far-flung locales like Uganda, Malaysia and Chile. 

 BODY:
When it comes to deal-making, a global perspective matters.
As economic engines stall in the United States and Western Europe, private equity firms, corporate suitors and investment bankers are increasingly venturing overseas, touching down in far-flung locales like Uganda, Malaysia and Chile.
 While mergers and acquisitions in such markets are still small compared to those in developed countries, international deal-making is on the rise. The 20 most active countries in the emerging and frontier markets - nations found in Latin America, the Middle East, Asia and sub-Saharan Africa - have notched nearly $377 billion of deals this year, up roughly 3 percent from the same period in 2010, according to Thomson Reuters.
The countries share a common characteristic: a growing economy. China's gross domestic product increased by an estimated 10.3 percent last year, India's by 10.4 percent and Peru's by 8.8 percent. In contrast, the United States economy rose 2.8 percent.
But forging deals in developing regions comes with a unique set of uncertainties, including political, economic and regulatory risks. Wal-Mart Stores pulled out of Moscow late last year, citing an inhospitable climate for acquisitions. Ikea, fed up with corruption in Russia, suspended further investments there in 2009.
In Brazil, rising inflation has spooked investors, contributing to a 26 percent decline this year in the MSCI Brazil index. As the market wobbles, merger activity has declined by nearly a third from 2010.
China, however, has shown no signs of slowing. Deal volume in the country has already passed the $100 billion mark this year, up 15 percent from the same period in 2010. The transactions represent a range of industries, including industrials, finance, technology and retail.
Deal activity also has soared in Indonesia. But with a less developed and robust economy, the acquisitions have been focused on mining, reflecting the country's rich resources. In June, Vallar Investments agreed to pay $2 billion for Bumi Resources Minerals of Indonesia.
"There is this image of a frontier, and you think of someone getting hungry in Africa," said Marko Dimitrijevic, founder of Everest Capital, a hedge fund investing abroad. "The reality is some of the fastest-growing economies in the world are in the frontier area."

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund Manager Gets 60 Years for Fraud

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Adley H. Abdulwahab was convicted of defrauding 800 investors in a scheme that involved buying life insurance policies. 

 BODY:
A hedge fund manager convicted of running a $100 million scheme that preyed on retired investors was sentenced on Wednesday to 60 years in prison, the latest eye-popping penalty to come from a federal white collar case. 
Adley H. Abdulwahab, 36, was part owner of A&O Resource Management, which ran a family of hedge funds accused of cheating some 800 investors out of their savings. Earlier this week, his co-defendant and a founder of the firm, Christian Allmendinger, 40, received a 45-year sentence. 
"Having wiped out the life savings of many of their victims and stolen funds marked for retirement, Mr. Abdulwahab and Mr. Allmendinger appropriately now face significant prison terms," Lanny A. Breuer, assistant attorney general of the Justice department's criminal division, said in a statement. 
The penalties, handed down by Judge Robert E. Payne of the Federal District Court in Richmond, Va., underscored the growing severity in white collar sentencing. Gone are the days of "'Club Fed,"' a reference to the minimum-security federal facilities where corporate criminals would serve short stints in relatively comfortable quarters. 
Indeed, over the last year, federal judges have imposed decades-long sentences on a string of nonviolent criminals. Lee B. Farkas, a former mortgage company executive, received a 30-year sentence earlier this year for a fraud scheme. Lawrence Duran fared even worse, getting a 50-year sentence for his role in a $205 million fraud. 
On Wednesday, Mr. Abdulwahab's bid for leniency was overshadowed by several of his victims, who lined up to testify against the former hedge fund manager. 
After spending 23 years as a school teacher in Texas, Paula Higdon Whitaker invested $1 million with A&O, hoping to set aside enough money to support her son, who suffered from mental disabilities. She lost her entire investment in the scheme. 
"My life is like a train wreck," she said in court on Wednesday. "It's demolished and will never run again."
The nature of A&O's scheme, prosecutors say, was to buy life insurance policies with funding from investors like Ms. Whitaker. When the policy holders died, investors were expected to reap some of the payout. 
But A&O executives, according to prosecutors, siphoned off the funds to cover personal expenses -- items like luxury houses, cars and a 15-karat diamond ring. The company was also accused of inflating its past returns and misrepresenting the risks of the investment. For his part, prosecutors say Mr. Abdulwahab, who was convicted in June, misled investors into thinking he had an economics degree.
The investors, many of them elderly, had expected easy returns. 
"The victims of A&O's scam were looking for a conservative investment, and they were manipulated into believing A&O was a safe, secure, no-risk investment," Neil H. MacBride, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement. "It was all a big, fat lie."

HEADLINE: At Seton Hall, Sharp Cuts in Tuition for Those With Good Grades and SATs

BYLINE: JACQUES STEINBERG


HIGHLIGHT: In tough economic times, a New Jersey college hopes to woo top high school seniors with an across-the-board tuition discount. 

 BODY:
My colleague Richard Perez-Pena reports in an article just posted on The Times's Web site that beginning next year, Seton Hall University, a private institution in New Jersey, will reduce its regular sticker price by two-thirds, or $21,000, for those early applicants "with strong academic credentials.''
Mr. Perez-Pena writes that "for New Jersey residents, who comprise about 70 percent of Seton Hall's undergraduates, that would make the cost equivalent to that of Rutgers University, the state's flagship public university.'' For those applying from out of state, Seton Hall would be "much cheaper" than Rutgers.
How would one qualify for this discount, which Mr. Perez-Pena describes as equal to about two-thirds of this year's $31,440 tuition? (Room, board and other fees add about $13,000, for a total annual bill of nearly $42,000.) Writes Mr. Perez-Pena:
Students must graduate in the top 10 percent of their high school classes and have a combined score of at least 1,200 on their math and reading SATs - but no less than 550 on each - or an ACT score of 27.
Mr. Perez-Pena says that the experts on admissions and financial aid whom he consulted "knew of no other college providing such a blanket discount for top-flight students.''
Have readers of The Choice stumbled across any other arrangement like this? Is Seton Hall on the new frontier of merit aid?
And would the potential applicants in our readership be tempted to apply to a college offering such an arrangement?

HEADLINE: Nowhere to Go but Up? Analyzing Economic Measures in a Downturn

BYLINE: PATRICK HONNER and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Creating graphs of key economic indicators and performing qualitative and quantitative analysis. 

 BODY:
Overview | How do we know when the economy is in a recession? How do key economic indicators perform in a downturn? In this lesson, students create graphs of various economic measurements, using quantitative and qualitative reasoning skills to compare, contrast and correlate the performance of measures like gross domestic product, unemployment and personal income. 
Materials | Student notebooks, graph paper, computers with Internet access, spreadsheet software like Excel (optional), graphing calculators (optional).
Warm-Up | In their notebooks, students write down some words and phrases they associate with the term . After a few minutes, have students pair up to share ideas, and then hold a brief whole-group discussion to identify some common responses.
Ask, how do we know if we are in a recession? Suggest that they consider the question from the perspective of an economist, a politician, a business person, or an average citizen. Ask, what kinds of might be important in determining if an economy is in recession?
Generate a list of key indicators through a short discussion and jot ideas on the board, making sure the list includes measurements like gross domestic product (G.D.P.), personal income, unemployment, home prices, business profits, stock prices and poverty rates. Have students identify which of these measurements might rise during a recession, which might fall, and which might remain steady. They might also generate ideas for some unconventional, creative or informal economic indicators.
At this point, you might share with the class parts of the overview on the Times Topics page about recession, like these three paragraphs:
There is no official definition of recession, and no official body to decree that one has begun or ended. Indeed, a clear picture of the state of the economy usually comes months or even years later. Recessions are commonly described as two or more quarters of a declining gross domestic product.
That definition is not used by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private, non-partisan group based in Cambridge, Mass., whose findings on swings in the business cycle have come to be generally accepted as the definitive dates for recessions and expansions. Its definition of recession is: "a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales."
A recession is a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales. A recession begins just after the economy reaches a peak of activity and ends as the economy reaches its trough. Between trough and peak, the economy is in an expansion. Expansion is the normal state of the economy; most recessions are brief and they have been rare in recent decades. The postwar average, excluding the 2001 recession, is eleven months.
Show the class the infographic "Change in G.D.P. Since 1999," and ask them to speculate as to what the other measurements might look like over the same time period. Tell them that they will soon graph that data, after reading a New York Times article about a new report about the level of poverty in the United States.
Related | The article "Poor Are Still Getting Poorer, but Downturn's Punch Varies, Census Data Show" discusses the findings of the United States Census Bureau's poverty report:
The discouraging numbers spilling from the Census Bureau's poverty report this week were a disquieting reminder that a weak economy continues to spread broad and deep pain.
And so it does. But not evenly.
The Midwest is battered, but the Northeast escaped with a lighter knock. The incomes of young adults have plunged - but those of older Americans have actually risen. On the whole, immigrants have weathered the storm a bit better than people born here. In rural areas, poverty remained unchanged last year, while in suburbs it reached the highest level since 1967, when the Census Bureau first tracked it.
Yet one old problem has not changed: the poor have rapidly gotten poorer.
Read the entire article with your class, using the questions below.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension:

        
Which segment of the American population has been least affected by the recent downturn? Why?
        
In which regions has household income been falling the past three years?
        
What is one reason immigrants with citizenship have seen their income decrease less than natural-born Americans?
        
How many Americans are currently living below the poverty line?
        
According to the accompanying infographic, "Who Suffered the Most," who really did suffer the most?
Activity | Tell students they will work in pairs or small groups to find data and graph data on economic indicators.
Assign or allow each group to choose one or more of the following economic measurements: Real G.D.P.; personal income; unemployment; corporate profits; poverty; home prices; wages. Have all groups work with the same time period, like the past 10 years, and have them use NYTimes.com and other reliable resources to find data on their measures.
For each measure, students create two graphs, showing the following information, as well as performing the associated analysis:

        
The actual value of the measurement over time. They then compared these graphs , looking at the shapes of graphs to see how closely their movements are aligned, thereby exploring the question "Which economic indicators move similarly during a recession?"
        
The percentage change in that measurement over time. Percentage change from month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, or year-to-year can be calculated with the following formula: Percent Change = ( Old Value - New Value ) /Old Value. They then compare these graphs by identifying which indicators move up or down in synch, and whether the magnitude of their change is also similar. For example, students can investigate if a 1% drop in Real G.D.P. means there will also be a 1% drop in corporate profits. Students can also explore the inverse relationship between, say, Real G.D.P. and unemployment, investigating how a decrease in G.D.P. is related to an increase in the unemployment rate.
Furthermore, students can explore relationships between quantity and rate-of-change by considering the two graphs for a given measure. A positive percentage change means a positive slope in the original graph, and higher (or lower) percent change translates into steeper graphs.
For data, students can visit the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, including its page on the state of nation's economy and its index of interactive data tables.
For example, students can look at Real G.D.P. from 2005 to 2011. Using the bureau's interactive table system, students can select the desired years, choose their indicators and even graph and compare multiple measures simultaneously.
Students can find unemployment data at the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, data on personal income at the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and home price data at the Federal Housing Finance Agency. In addition, internet resources such as Google's Public Data Explorer and Wolfram Alpha can be used to search, collect, and represent economic data.
After creating their sets of graphs, have students compare their results with those of classmates who looked at different economic indicators. Have students summarize their findings by identifying which economic factors move in a similar fashion, and which have an inverse relationship.
Going Further | Once a picture of the country's economy has been created through the above analysis, students explore regional and local economic indicators by performing the same kind of analyses. As a start, state-by-state G.D.P. data is available here.
Are we in a recession? Is it U-shaped? Is it V-shaped? Is it a double-dip recession? Students check out the various recession shapes and compare them with their graphs. For an example of a double-dip recession, use Wolfram Alpha to look at US Real G.D.P. between 1978 and 1983.
Play pundit by looking at President Obama's deficit reduction plan and writing a letter to the editor or Op-Ed about how you think measures like G.D.P., unemployment and poverty will be affected by the new budget.

HEADLINE: Mapping the Cotton Kingdom

BYLINE: SUSAN SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Before he designed Central Park, Frederick Law Olmsted created one of the Civil War's most important maps. 

 BODY:
We've grown used to seeing our lives mapped. The 2010 Census has provided material for a host of new maps that profile Americans in myriad ways, from population dynamics to social and economic patterns. But the role of maps in visualizing United States Census results is actually a practice that originated 150 years ago, in the crisis between North and South.
An earlier post in this series described the efforts of the Coast Survey to map the distribution of slavery across the South in the summer of 1861. At about the same time, another pathbreaking effort was underway to "measure" the productivity of Southern slavery. The map is not well known, but its creator was none other than Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of New York's Central Park and one of the pioneers of American landscape architecture.
Olmsted was already an accomplished journalist when he met Henry Raymond, the editor of the newly established New-York Daily Times (later The New York Times) in the early 1850s. After just five minutes of conversation, Raymond was so impressed that he made Olmsted a special correspondent, and sent him to observe and write about Southern life. For the next several years Olmsted sent back voluminous reports - published in three volumes - of disorder, poverty, inefficiency, backwardness and chaos. We might dismiss these as hopelessly biased Northern observations, yet the accounts gained a wide audience, and challenged the contemporary picture of the cotton south as an economic powerhouse.
With the onset of secession, Olmsted decided to reissue his observations in a single publication. He was motivated by the possibility that the British might formally recognize the Confederacy, or - worse yet - directly intervene in the crisis. To help him edit the manuscript Olmsted hired Daniel Goodloe, a well-known abolitionist and editor who had written his own extensive critiques of slavery. Finding the returns of the 1860 Census insufficiently organized, they relied on the 1850 Census to make their case.
Olmsted and Goodloe identified slave labor as the single most damaging influence on the southern economy: it was inefficient, absorbed capital away from reinvestment, and required substantial overhead. Worst of all, the price of slaves drove cotton production - rather than the other way around - and was immune to competition from free labor. Such a system could never generate real prosperity. Even Olmsted's title, "The Cotton Kingdom," turned the South Carolina politician James Henry Hammond's famous phrase - "Cotton is King" - on its head. Instead of a place of wealth and economic superiority, Olmsted found a closed society imprisoned by the crop, unable to advance, diversify or feed its own people. This was entirely an economic - rather than a moral or humanitarian - case against slavery, for the authors were tailoring their case for a British public concerned about their cotton supply. 
As the secession crisis worsened in the spring of 1861, Goodloe and Olmsted raced to complete the project. On May 13 the Queen declared a policy of neutrality, which amounted to a recognition of the rebellion (though not an acknowledgement of its sovereignty). This diplomatic crisis probably motivated Goodloe and Olmsted to map the productivity of cotton. Olmsted made his case against slavery in 800 pages of narrative detail, but the map conveyed the same message in a single image: slavery was not worth defending.
Like the Coast Survey's map of slavery in the Southern states, the map used Census data to illuminate Southern strengths and resources. Olmsted and Goodloe identified two variables on the map: the relationship of the free and slave population and the production of cotton. They separated areas where slaves outnumbered freemen, and the reverse. Then they classed regions according to high, medium and low output, shrewdly leaving readers to conclude just how inefficient slave labor really was. In most cases, the areas of high production had relatively low slave populations. Those areas shaded as highly productive but without corresponding slave populations were, in their view, direct evidence against slavery. 
By June, Olmsted's manuscript was on its way to England, where it was rushed to print by October (the American edition appeared the following month). It was heavily discussed in the British press, and sold well enough to prompt a reprint in 1862. Olmsted and Goodloe weren't the first to say that slavery was a doomed system, but they were the first to use cartography to make their case, first to the British, and then to their fellow Americans.

HEADLINE: Safety Nets and Their Cost

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Safety nets can save lives, but they also can encourage dangerous behavior, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
 
The United States Coast Guard's search-and-rescue division is considering some of the same trade-offs that are found in better-known safety-net programs related to unemployment and health care.
Among other duties, the Coast Guard rescues people in, on and near United States waters. In addition to having highly trained life-saving personnel, the Coast Guard has ships, helicopters, planes and some of the world's most modern life-saving equipment.
Taxpayer financed, the Coast Guard every day offers its services free of charge to the people it rescues. In that regard, the search-and-rescue part of the Coast Guard is a kind of safety net -- taxpayers pay so that people can have help on the rare occasions when they need it.

In fact, these search-and-rescue activities predate Medicaid and unemployment insurance; the Coast Guard can be traced back more than 200 years to a private search-and-rescue organization in Massachusetts called the Humane Society.
Safety-net programs have what economists call "moral hazard" as an unfortunate byproduct: recognizing that the government is standing by to help, some people do too little to take care of themselves. For example, a significant fraction of unemployed people delay finding a new job until their benefits run out. This may not be a choice we condone, but because unemployment insurance makes unemployment a little less painful, some people will respond by doing less to exit unemployment.
In their marine rescue efforts, the Coast Guard has noticed that many boaters do not wear life jackets that can prevent or delay drowning, and a number of boats venture miles offshore without a radio beacon that can help rescuers find troubled boaters.
Unfortunately, some boaters' imprudent actions may actually be the result of the Coast Guard's life-saving proficiency. Boaters know that they can call the Coast Guard when their boat takes on water, catches fire or otherwise becomes disabled, and many times help will arrive before the boaters have to leave their vessel and jump in the water. The Coast Guard even has ways of locating people who do not have radio beacons.
President Obama signed a health care law that will require Americans to get health insurance. Although less known, President Obama also authorized the Coast Guard to consider mandating radio beacons for boats venturing offshore and mandating that boaters wear life jacket in many situations (the Coast Guard has long required boaters to have life jackets on board, even if they are not worn).
Although it is sometimes asserted that the federal government has limited legal power to mandate citizens' purchases, there can be a good economic case for mandates. While economists are often not inclined to interfere when a person knowingly risks his life for thrills or any other reason, the fact is that our government is in the safety net business, so individuals may take risks without recognizing the costs they create for rescuers.
A boat owner may save himself a few dollars by forgoing the purchase of a radio beacon, and that can ultimately cost the Coast Guard -- and thereby American taxpayers -- a great deal of money in search-and-rescue resources. Over all, it might be cheaper if the owner were forced to make the purchase.
On the other hand, it is possible (although not logically necessary) that mandating marine safety equipment may encourage dangerous activities on the water, because the safety equipment reduces the costs of dangerous activities. Years ago, Prof. Sam Peltzman of the University of Chicago found that mandating the wearing of seat belts in automobiles resulted in more dangerous driving and more accidents, because, thanks to the seat belts, the average accident was less deadly.
As always, helping people has its side effects, and some rescues are necessary because the safety net exists.

HEADLINE: New Skirmishes Among Metropolitan Museum Vendors

BYLINE: COREY KILGANNON


HIGHLIGHT: The sidewalk in front of the museum has again become a battleground with the arrival of two new vendors who cite a state law giving space to disabled veterans. 

 BODY:
In the continuing hot dog wars in front of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the military men have returned the sidewalk.
The two men, Armando Crescenzi and Harold Dalton, are former soldiers who now hold a position on the museum's plaza, brandishing veteran vending permits that they say give them the right to sell hot dogs to the throngs of hungry tourists and visitors in front of the entrance to the museum.
Their arrival has upset a peaceful period there during which three other vendors operated in relative harmony: a hot dog cart, a gourmet pretzel stand and an upscale seller of cupcakes and milkshakes.
The pretzel and cupcake carts pay the city about $100,000 each to operate there, but the hot dog operator pays nothing. He is a former Marine, Dan Rossi, who invokes a 19th-century state law that allows disabled veterans to sell in some areas of the city where other vendors must pay to occupy.
Since 2007, Mr. Rossi has been battling city authorities and clinging to a spot directly in front of the museum steps at Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street. It is regarded as perhaps the most lucrative location for selling hot dogs in Manhattan. It is so coveted that the city once charged more than half a million dollars a year for vending rights there.
But now two additional veteran carts have arrived, invoking the same state law. They have set up on either side of the broad steps. The new cluster of carts is frustrating museum and city officials, and creating competition and bickering among the vendors. 
Mr. Rossi argues that he owns his cart and employs several needy veterans as grill men. The other carts are owned by nonveterans whom Mr. Rossi accuses of simply "renting" veterans to make them legal. 
"They're rent-a-vets," said Mr. Rossi, 62, referring to Mr. Crescenzi and Mr. Dalton. 
The museum is on Parks Department property, and department officials say state law allows disabled veterans to sell near the curb, but not on the museum plaza. Since much of the curb in front of the museum is designated as bus stops and taxi stands, department officials have allowed only two spots for veteran vendors, one directly in front of the museum steps and one south of the steps.
For the past four years, Mr. Rossi has occupied the spot, selling $2 hot dogs and $1 bottles of water. 
Mr. Rossi said that in July, when the two carts appeared, he filed a complaint with the city's Department of Investigation contending that Mr. Crescenzi and Mr. Dalton were misusing the veteran law.
He said the complaint was referred to the Health Department and no action was taken.
"They have a scam," he said. "One guy owns the cart and hires the vet to sit there with his permit, and that's not how it's supposed to work."
A spokeswoman with the city's Law Department said that the vending space directly in front of the museum steps - the one where Mr. Rossi sets up - is available on a "first come first served" basis. 
When a reporter visited the location on Sunday, Mr. Crescenzi was napping in a portable chair next to a food cart. Mr. Crescenzi was hardly dressed for grill work: he wore loafers, slacks, a blazer and a fedora. 
But he offered no apologies. The food cart was a partnership between him and an operator, he said. The operator - whom he would not name - oversees the food sales, while his own duties involve handling the licensing and administrative issues, including the daily summonses they receive from the Parks Department for vending there. By law, he has to stay with the cart with his permit when it is open for business, he said.
"They got the cart, I got the permit: it's a partnership," he said. "I'm 50 percent of this operation, even if I show up and take a nap."
Mr. Dalton described a similar partnership behind his food cart.
The two said they were disabled veterans who have been forced out of other spots around the park by city authorities and have started a coalition of military veterans who work as vendors, called Veterans First.
Both men said they have gotten tickets every day since they arrived in front of the museum and intended to fight the citations in court.
When a Parks Department enforcement sergeant approached on Sunday, the men exchanged cheerful pleasantries and the veterans handed over their identifications and received citations for "failure to comply" with an officer's directions.
Mr. Crescenzi said Mr. Rossi was still making the lion's share of profits at the location. He pointed to Mr. Rossi's cart with its long line of customers.
"He's the real rent-a-vet," he said. "He's a millionaire who wants this whole area for himself."
Derek Hunt, one of the owners of the Cake and Shake cart, said that he agreed to pay roughly $9,000 a month for the spot, with the understanding that only the pretzel cart and Mr. Rossi would sell there.
Since the arrival of the additional two veteran carts, Mr. Hunt said, "My revenue has been driven down 40 percent."
He said that for the past year Parks Department enforcement officers would escort any additional vendors away from the museum, but this has stopped.
"I got hundreds of thousands of dollars tied up in my cart and these guys could put me out of business," he said. "Everyone I ask to enforce the law says they don't want to be the one who kicks a veteran out. This law was created to help veterans who want to work. Not to make them straw vets, set up next to a cart like they're inflatable."
The competition shows no sign of abating. On Saturday, another veteran started selling in front of the museum.

HEADLINE: History Roolz

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: If you pay attention to it. 

 BODY:
Kevin O'Rourke follows up on some of what I've been writing, and argues that doing good macroeconomics depends crucially on knowing a fair bit about economic history. Indeed.
By the way, he's right that Obstfeld, Rogoff, and yours truly all had the benefit of studying with Charles Kindleberger and Peter Temin. But that's not all. The late Rudi Dornbusch, who I'm pretty sure advised all of us, was big on the usefulness of studying history. 
I still remember his advice when I began searching for a thesis topic. He urged me (and presumably his other students) to take a break from reading recent economics literature, and looking for twiddles on the currently fashionable models. Better, he said, to read a lot of economic history for a few months, plus reading up on current events, in search of real issues and real experiences that needed explaining.
I'd also say that there's history and then there's history. Knowing the time-series properties of US quarterly data since 1947 isn't what I mean. In macro, in particular, you need to know about drastic events. I don't have it in front of me, but in his book on the German hyperinflation Frank Graham said roughly this: "Disorder is, for the social sciences, the sole substitute for the controlled experiments of the natural sciences." That means knowing about prewar experience; it also means knowing about international experience -- for there have been numerous crises even since World War II, just not in the United States.
Indeed, my sense is that international macroeconomists -- people who followed the ERM crises of the early 1990s, the Latin American debt crisis, the Asian crisis of the late 90s, and so on -- were caught much less flat-footed than economists who limited most of their interest to the United States. The now-infamous 2003 Lucas remark about how the problem of depression-prevention has been solved was not something you would have heard from an economist who had paid attention to Mexico, Indonesia, Argentina etc..
Unfortunately, many economists have not learned from the past. And that's at least part of the reason we are apparently condemned to repeat it.

HEADLINE: Think Globally, Deal Locally

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Private equity firms, corporate suitors and investment bankers are increasingly venturing overseas, touching down in far-flung locales like Uganda, Malaysia and Chile. 

 BODY:
When it comes to deal-making, a global perspective matters.
As economic engines stall in the United States and Western Europe, private equity firms, corporate suitors and investment bankers are increasingly venturing overseas, touching down in far-flung locales like Uganda, Malaysia and Chile.
 While mergers and acquisitions in such markets are still small compared to those in developed countries, international deal-making is on the rise. The 20 most active countries in the emerging and frontier markets - nations found in Latin America, the Middle East, Asia and sub-Saharan Africa - have notched nearly $377 billion of deals this year, up roughly 3 percent from the same period in 2010, according to Thomson Reuters.
The countries share a common characteristic: a growing economy. China's gross domestic product increased by an estimated 10.3 percent last year, India's by 10.4 percent and Peru's by 8.8 percent. In contrast, the United States economy rose 2.8 percent.
But forging deals in developing regions comes with a unique set of uncertainties, including political, economic and regulatory risks. Wal-Mart Stores pulled out of Moscow late last year, citing an inhospitable climate for acquisitions. Ikea, fed up with corruption in Russia, suspended further investments there in 2009.
In Brazil, rising inflation has spooked investors, contributing to a 26 percent decline this year in the MSCI Brazil index. As the market wobbles, merger activity has declined by nearly a third from 2010.
China, however, has shown no signs of slowing. Deal volume in the country has already passed the $100 billion mark this year, up 15 percent from the same period in 2010. The transactions represent a range of industries, including industrials, finance, technology and retail.
Deal activity also has soared in Indonesia. But with a less developed and robust economy, the acquisitions have been focused on mining, reflecting the country's rich resources. In June, Vallar Investments agreed to pay $2 billion for Bumi Resources Minerals of Indonesia.
"There is this image of a frontier, and you think of someone getting hungry in Africa," said Marko Dimitrijevic, founder of Everest Capital, a hedge fund investing abroad. "The reality is some of the fastest-growing economies in the world are in the frontier area."

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund Manager Gets 60 Years for Fraud

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Adley H. Abdulwahab was convicted of defrauding 800 investors in a scheme that involved buying life insurance policies. 

 BODY:
A hedge fund manager convicted of running a $100 million scheme that preyed on retired investors was sentenced on Wednesday to 60 years in prison, the latest eye-popping penalty to come from a federal white collar case. 
Adley H. Abdulwahab, 36, was part owner of A&O Resource Management, which ran a family of hedge funds accused of cheating some 800 investors out of their savings. Earlier this week, his co-defendant and a founder of the firm, Christian Allmendinger, 40, received a 45-year sentence. 
"Having wiped out the life savings of many of their victims and stolen funds marked for retirement, Mr. Abdulwahab and Mr. Allmendinger appropriately now face significant prison terms," Lanny A. Breuer, assistant attorney general of the Justice department's criminal division, said in a statement. 
The penalties, handed down by Judge Robert E. Payne of the Federal District Court in Richmond, Va., underscored the growing severity in white collar sentencing. Gone are the days of "'Club Fed,"' a reference to the minimum-security federal facilities where corporate criminals would serve short stints in relatively comfortable quarters. 
Indeed, over the last year, federal judges have imposed decades-long sentences on a string of nonviolent criminals. Lee B. Farkas, a former mortgage company executive, received a 30-year sentence earlier this year for a fraud scheme. Lawrence Duran fared even worse, getting a 50-year sentence for his role in a $205 million fraud. 
On Wednesday, Mr. Abdulwahab's bid for leniency was overshadowed by several of his victims, who lined up to testify against the former hedge fund manager. 
After spending 23 years as a school teacher in Texas, Paula Higdon Whitaker invested $1 million with A&O, hoping to set aside enough money to support her son, who suffered from mental disabilities. She lost her entire investment in the scheme. 
"My life is like a train wreck," she said in court on Wednesday. "It's demolished and will never run again."
The nature of A&O's scheme, prosecutors say, was to buy life insurance policies with funding from investors like Ms. Whitaker. When the policy holders died, investors were expected to reap some of the payout. 
But A&O executives, according to prosecutors, siphoned off the funds to cover personal expenses -- items like luxury houses, cars and a 15-karat diamond ring. The company was also accused of inflating its past returns and misrepresenting the risks of the investment. For his part, prosecutors say Mr. Abdulwahab, who was convicted in June, misled investors into thinking he had an economics degree.
The investors, many of them elderly, had expected easy returns. 
"The victims of A&O's scam were looking for a conservative investment, and they were manipulated into believing A&O was a safe, secure, no-risk investment," Neil H. MacBride, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement. "It was all a big, fat lie."

HEADLINE: At Seton Hall, Sharp Cuts in Tuition for Those With Good Grades and SATs

BYLINE: JACQUES STEINBERG


HIGHLIGHT: In tough economic times, a New Jersey college hopes to woo top high school seniors with an across-the-board tuition discount. 

 BODY:
My colleague Richard Perez-Pena reports in an article just posted on The Times's Web site that beginning next year, Seton Hall University, a private institution in New Jersey, will reduce its regular sticker price by two-thirds, or $21,000, for those early applicants "with strong academic credentials.''
Mr. Perez-Pena writes that "for New Jersey residents, who comprise about 70 percent of Seton Hall's undergraduates, that would make the cost equivalent to that of Rutgers University, the state's flagship public university.'' For those applying from out of state, Seton Hall would be "much cheaper" than Rutgers.
How would one qualify for this discount, which Mr. Perez-Pena describes as equal to about two-thirds of this year's $31,440 tuition? (Room, board and other fees add about $13,000, for a total annual bill of nearly $42,000.) Writes Mr. Perez-Pena:
Students must graduate in the top 10 percent of their high school classes and have a combined score of at least 1,200 on their math and reading SATs - but no less than 550 on each - or an ACT score of 27.
Mr. Perez-Pena says that the experts on admissions and financial aid whom he consulted "knew of no other college providing such a blanket discount for top-flight students.''
Have readers of The Choice stumbled across any other arrangement like this? Is Seton Hall on the new frontier of merit aid?
And would the potential applicants in our readership be tempted to apply to a college offering such an arrangement?

HEADLINE: Nowhere to Go but Up? Analyzing Economic Measures in a Downturn

BYLINE: PATRICK HONNER and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Creating graphs of key economic indicators and performing qualitative and quantitative analysis. 

 BODY:
Overview | How do we know when the economy is in a recession? How do key economic indicators perform in a downturn? In this lesson, students create graphs of various economic measurements, using quantitative and qualitative reasoning skills to compare, contrast and correlate the performance of measures like gross domestic product, unemployment and personal income. 
Materials | Student notebooks, graph paper, computers with Internet access, spreadsheet software like Excel (optional), graphing calculators (optional).
Warm-Up | In their notebooks, students write down some words and phrases they associate with the term . After a few minutes, have students pair up to share ideas, and then hold a brief whole-group discussion to identify some common responses.
Ask, how do we know if we are in a recession? Suggest that they consider the question from the perspective of an economist, a politician, a business person, or an average citizen. Ask, what kinds of might be important in determining if an economy is in recession?
Generate a list of key indicators through a short discussion and jot ideas on the board, making sure the list includes measurements like gross domestic product (G.D.P.), personal income, unemployment, home prices, business profits, stock prices and poverty rates. Have students identify which of these measurements might rise during a recession, which might fall, and which might remain steady. They might also generate ideas for some unconventional, creative or informal economic indicators.
At this point, you might share with the class parts of the overview on the Times Topics page about recession, like these three paragraphs:
There is no official definition of recession, and no official body to decree that one has begun or ended. Indeed, a clear picture of the state of the economy usually comes months or even years later. Recessions are commonly described as two or more quarters of a declining gross domestic product.
That definition is not used by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private, non-partisan group based in Cambridge, Mass., whose findings on swings in the business cycle have come to be generally accepted as the definitive dates for recessions and expansions. Its definition of recession is: "a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales."
A recession is a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales. A recession begins just after the economy reaches a peak of activity and ends as the economy reaches its trough. Between trough and peak, the economy is in an expansion. Expansion is the normal state of the economy; most recessions are brief and they have been rare in recent decades. The postwar average, excluding the 2001 recession, is eleven months.
Show the class the infographic "Change in G.D.P. Since 1999," and ask them to speculate as to what the other measurements might look like over the same time period. Tell them that they will soon graph that data, after reading a New York Times article about a new report about the level of poverty in the United States.
Related | The article "Poor Are Still Getting Poorer, but Downturn's Punch Varies, Census Data Show" discusses the findings of the United States Census Bureau's poverty report:
The discouraging numbers spilling from the Census Bureau's poverty report this week were a disquieting reminder that a weak economy continues to spread broad and deep pain.
And so it does. But not evenly.
The Midwest is battered, but the Northeast escaped with a lighter knock. The incomes of young adults have plunged - but those of older Americans have actually risen. On the whole, immigrants have weathered the storm a bit better than people born here. In rural areas, poverty remained unchanged last year, while in suburbs it reached the highest level since 1967, when the Census Bureau first tracked it.
Yet one old problem has not changed: the poor have rapidly gotten poorer.
Read the entire article with your class, using the questions below.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension:

        
Which segment of the American population has been least affected by the recent downturn? Why?
        
In which regions has household income been falling the past three years?
        
What is one reason immigrants with citizenship have seen their income decrease less than natural-born Americans?
        
How many Americans are currently living below the poverty line?
        
According to the accompanying infographic, "Who Suffered the Most," who really did suffer the most?
Activity | Tell students they will work in pairs or small groups to find data and graph data on economic indicators.
Assign or allow each group to choose one or more of the following economic measurements: Real G.D.P.; personal income; unemployment; corporate profits; poverty; home prices; wages. Have all groups work with the same time period, like the past 10 years, and have them use NYTimes.com and other reliable resources to find data on their measures.
For each measure, students create two graphs, showing the following information, as well as performing the associated analysis:

        
The actual value of the measurement over time. They then compared these graphs , looking at the shapes of graphs to see how closely their movements are aligned, thereby exploring the question "Which economic indicators move similarly during a recession?"
        
The percentage change in that measurement over time. Percentage change from month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, or year-to-year can be calculated with the following formula: Percent Change = ( Old Value - New Value ) /Old Value. They then compare these graphs by identifying which indicators move up or down in synch, and whether the magnitude of their change is also similar. For example, students can investigate if a 1% drop in Real G.D.P. means there will also be a 1% drop in corporate profits. Students can also explore the inverse relationship between, say, Real G.D.P. and unemployment, investigating how a decrease in G.D.P. is related to an increase in the unemployment rate.
Furthermore, students can explore relationships between quantity and rate-of-change by considering the two graphs for a given measure. A positive percentage change means a positive slope in the original graph, and higher (or lower) percent change translates into steeper graphs.
For data, students can visit the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, including its page on the state of nation's economy and its index of interactive data tables.
For example, students can look at Real G.D.P. from 2005 to 2011. Using the bureau's interactive table system, students can select the desired years, choose their indicators and even graph and compare multiple measures simultaneously.
Students can find unemployment data at the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, data on personal income at the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and home price data at the Federal Housing Finance Agency. In addition, internet resources such as Google's Public Data Explorer and Wolfram Alpha can be used to search, collect, and represent economic data.
After creating their sets of graphs, have students compare their results with those of classmates who looked at different economic indicators. Have students summarize their findings by identifying which economic factors move in a similar fashion, and which have an inverse relationship.
Going Further | Once a picture of the country's economy has been created through the above analysis, students explore regional and local economic indicators by performing the same kind of analyses. As a start, state-by-state G.D.P. data is available here.
Are we in a recession? Is it U-shaped? Is it V-shaped? Is it a double-dip recession? Students check out the various recession shapes and compare them with their graphs. For an example of a double-dip recession, use Wolfram Alpha to look at US Real G.D.P. between 1978 and 1983.
Play pundit by looking at President Obama's deficit reduction plan and writing a letter to the editor or Op-Ed about how you think measures like G.D.P., unemployment and poverty will be affected by the new budget.

HEADLINE: Mapping the Cotton Kingdom

BYLINE: SUSAN SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Before he designed Central Park, Frederick Law Olmsted created one of the Civil War's most important maps. 

 BODY:
We've grown used to seeing our lives mapped. The 2010 Census has provided material for a host of new maps that profile Americans in myriad ways, from population dynamics to social and economic patterns. But the role of maps in visualizing United States Census results is actually a practice that originated 150 years ago, in the crisis between North and South.
An earlier post in this series described the efforts of the Coast Survey to map the distribution of slavery across the South in the summer of 1861. At about the same time, another pathbreaking effort was underway to "measure" the productivity of Southern slavery. The map is not well known, but its creator was none other than Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of New York's Central Park and one of the pioneers of American landscape architecture.
Olmsted was already an accomplished journalist when he met Henry Raymond, the editor of the newly established New-York Daily Times (later The New York Times) in the early 1850s. After just five minutes of conversation, Raymond was so impressed that he made Olmsted a special correspondent, and sent him to observe and write about Southern life. For the next several years Olmsted sent back voluminous reports - published in three volumes - of disorder, poverty, inefficiency, backwardness and chaos. We might dismiss these as hopelessly biased Northern observations, yet the accounts gained a wide audience, and challenged the contemporary picture of the cotton south as an economic powerhouse.
With the onset of secession, Olmsted decided to reissue his observations in a single publication. He was motivated by the possibility that the British might formally recognize the Confederacy, or - worse yet - directly intervene in the crisis. To help him edit the manuscript Olmsted hired Daniel Goodloe, a well-known abolitionist and editor who had written his own extensive critiques of slavery. Finding the returns of the 1860 Census insufficiently organized, they relied on the 1850 Census to make their case.
Olmsted and Goodloe identified slave labor as the single most damaging influence on the southern economy: it was inefficient, absorbed capital away from reinvestment, and required substantial overhead. Worst of all, the price of slaves drove cotton production - rather than the other way around - and was immune to competition from free labor. Such a system could never generate real prosperity. Even Olmsted's title, "The Cotton Kingdom," turned the South Carolina politician James Henry Hammond's famous phrase - "Cotton is King" - on its head. Instead of a place of wealth and economic superiority, Olmsted found a closed society imprisoned by the crop, unable to advance, diversify or feed its own people. This was entirely an economic - rather than a moral or humanitarian - case against slavery, for the authors were tailoring their case for a British public concerned about their cotton supply. 
As the secession crisis worsened in the spring of 1861, Goodloe and Olmsted raced to complete the project. On May 13 the Queen declared a policy of neutrality, which amounted to a recognition of the rebellion (though not an acknowledgement of its sovereignty). This diplomatic crisis probably motivated Goodloe and Olmsted to map the productivity of cotton. Olmsted made his case against slavery in 800 pages of narrative detail, but the map conveyed the same message in a single image: slavery was not worth defending.
Like the Coast Survey's map of slavery in the Southern states, the map used Census data to illuminate Southern strengths and resources. Olmsted and Goodloe identified two variables on the map: the relationship of the free and slave population and the production of cotton. They separated areas where slaves outnumbered freemen, and the reverse. Then they classed regions according to high, medium and low output, shrewdly leaving readers to conclude just how inefficient slave labor really was. In most cases, the areas of high production had relatively low slave populations. Those areas shaded as highly productive but without corresponding slave populations were, in their view, direct evidence against slavery. 
By June, Olmsted's manuscript was on its way to England, where it was rushed to print by October (the American edition appeared the following month). It was heavily discussed in the British press, and sold well enough to prompt a reprint in 1862. Olmsted and Goodloe weren't the first to say that slavery was a doomed system, but they were the first to use cartography to make their case, first to the British, and then to their fellow Americans.

HEADLINE: Safety Nets and Their Cost

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Safety nets can save lives, but they also can encourage dangerous behavior, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
 
The United States Coast Guard's search-and-rescue division is considering some of the same trade-offs that are found in better-known safety-net programs related to unemployment and health care.
Among other duties, the Coast Guard rescues people in, on and near United States waters. In addition to having highly trained life-saving personnel, the Coast Guard has ships, helicopters, planes and some of the world's most modern life-saving equipment.
Taxpayer financed, the Coast Guard every day offers its services free of charge to the people it rescues. In that regard, the search-and-rescue part of the Coast Guard is a kind of safety net -- taxpayers pay so that people can have help on the rare occasions when they need it.

In fact, these search-and-rescue activities predate Medicaid and unemployment insurance; the Coast Guard can be traced back more than 200 years to a private search-and-rescue organization in Massachusetts called the Humane Society.
Safety-net programs have what economists call "moral hazard" as an unfortunate byproduct: recognizing that the government is standing by to help, some people do too little to take care of themselves. For example, a significant fraction of unemployed people delay finding a new job until their benefits run out. This may not be a choice we condone, but because unemployment insurance makes unemployment a little less painful, some people will respond by doing less to exit unemployment.
In their marine rescue efforts, the Coast Guard has noticed that many boaters do not wear life jackets that can prevent or delay drowning, and a number of boats venture miles offshore without a radio beacon that can help rescuers find troubled boaters.
Unfortunately, some boaters' imprudent actions may actually be the result of the Coast Guard's life-saving proficiency. Boaters know that they can call the Coast Guard when their boat takes on water, catches fire or otherwise becomes disabled, and many times help will arrive before the boaters have to leave their vessel and jump in the water. The Coast Guard even has ways of locating people who do not have radio beacons.
President Obama signed a health care law that will require Americans to get health insurance. Although less known, President Obama also authorized the Coast Guard to consider mandating radio beacons for boats venturing offshore and mandating that boaters wear life jacket in many situations (the Coast Guard has long required boaters to have life jackets on board, even if they are not worn).
Although it is sometimes asserted that the federal government has limited legal power to mandate citizens' purchases, there can be a good economic case for mandates. While economists are often not inclined to interfere when a person knowingly risks his life for thrills or any other reason, the fact is that our government is in the safety net business, so individuals may take risks without recognizing the costs they create for rescuers.
A boat owner may save himself a few dollars by forgoing the purchase of a radio beacon, and that can ultimately cost the Coast Guard -- and thereby American taxpayers -- a great deal of money in search-and-rescue resources. Over all, it might be cheaper if the owner were forced to make the purchase.
On the other hand, it is possible (although not logically necessary) that mandating marine safety equipment may encourage dangerous activities on the water, because the safety equipment reduces the costs of dangerous activities. Years ago, Prof. Sam Peltzman of the University of Chicago found that mandating the wearing of seat belts in automobiles resulted in more dangerous driving and more accidents, because, thanks to the seat belts, the average accident was less deadly.
As always, helping people has its side effects, and some rescues are necessary because the safety net exists.

HEADLINE: New Skirmishes Among Metropolitan Museum Vendors

BYLINE: COREY KILGANNON


HIGHLIGHT: The sidewalk in front of the museum has again become a battleground with the arrival of two new vendors who cite a state law giving space to disabled veterans. 

 BODY:
In the continuing hot dog wars in front of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the military men have returned the sidewalk.
The two men, Armando Crescenzi and Harold Dalton, are former soldiers who now hold a position on the museum's plaza, brandishing veteran vending permits that they say give them the right to sell hot dogs to the throngs of hungry tourists and visitors in front of the entrance to the museum.
Their arrival has upset a peaceful period there during which three other vendors operated in relative harmony: a hot dog cart, a gourmet pretzel stand and an upscale seller of cupcakes and milkshakes.
The pretzel and cupcake carts pay the city about $100,000 each to operate there, but the hot dog operator pays nothing. He is a former Marine, Dan Rossi, who invokes a 19th-century state law that allows disabled veterans to sell in some areas of the city where other vendors must pay to occupy.
Since 2007, Mr. Rossi has been battling city authorities and clinging to a spot directly in front of the museum steps at Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street. It is regarded as perhaps the most lucrative location for selling hot dogs in Manhattan. It is so coveted that the city once charged more than half a million dollars a year for vending rights there.
But now two additional veteran carts have arrived, invoking the same state law. They have set up on either side of the broad steps. The new cluster of carts is frustrating museum and city officials, and creating competition and bickering among the vendors. 
Mr. Rossi argues that he owns his cart and employs several needy veterans as grill men. The other carts are owned by nonveterans whom Mr. Rossi accuses of simply "renting" veterans to make them legal. 
"They're rent-a-vets," said Mr. Rossi, 62, referring to Mr. Crescenzi and Mr. Dalton. 
The museum is on Parks Department property, and department officials say state law allows disabled veterans to sell near the curb, but not on the museum plaza. Since much of the curb in front of the museum is designated as bus stops and taxi stands, department officials have allowed only two spots for veteran vendors, one directly in front of the museum steps and one south of the steps.
For the past four years, Mr. Rossi has occupied the spot, selling $2 hot dogs and $1 bottles of water. 
Mr. Rossi said that in July, when the two carts appeared, he filed a complaint with the city's Department of Investigation contending that Mr. Crescenzi and Mr. Dalton were misusing the veteran law.
He said the complaint was referred to the Health Department and no action was taken.
"They have a scam," he said. "One guy owns the cart and hires the vet to sit there with his permit, and that's not how it's supposed to work."
A spokeswoman with the city's Law Department said that the vending space directly in front of the museum steps - the one where Mr. Rossi sets up - is available on a "first come first served" basis. 
When a reporter visited the location on Sunday, Mr. Crescenzi was napping in a portable chair next to a food cart. Mr. Crescenzi was hardly dressed for grill work: he wore loafers, slacks, a blazer and a fedora. 
But he offered no apologies. The food cart was a partnership between him and an operator, he said. The operator - whom he would not name - oversees the food sales, while his own duties involve handling the licensing and administrative issues, including the daily summonses they receive from the Parks Department for vending there. By law, he has to stay with the cart with his permit when it is open for business, he said.
"They got the cart, I got the permit: it's a partnership," he said. "I'm 50 percent of this operation, even if I show up and take a nap."
Mr. Dalton described a similar partnership behind his food cart.
The two said they were disabled veterans who have been forced out of other spots around the park by city authorities and have started a coalition of military veterans who work as vendors, called Veterans First.
Both men said they have gotten tickets every day since they arrived in front of the museum and intended to fight the citations in court.
When a Parks Department enforcement sergeant approached on Sunday, the men exchanged cheerful pleasantries and the veterans handed over their identifications and received citations for "failure to comply" with an officer's directions.
Mr. Crescenzi said Mr. Rossi was still making the lion's share of profits at the location. He pointed to Mr. Rossi's cart with its long line of customers.
"He's the real rent-a-vet," he said. "He's a millionaire who wants this whole area for himself."
Derek Hunt, one of the owners of the Cake and Shake cart, said that he agreed to pay roughly $9,000 a month for the spot, with the understanding that only the pretzel cart and Mr. Rossi would sell there.
Since the arrival of the additional two veteran carts, Mr. Hunt said, "My revenue has been driven down 40 percent."
He said that for the past year Parks Department enforcement officers would escort any additional vendors away from the museum, but this has stopped.
"I got hundreds of thousands of dollars tied up in my cart and these guys could put me out of business," he said. "Everyone I ask to enforce the law says they don't want to be the one who kicks a veteran out. This law was created to help veterans who want to work. Not to make them straw vets, set up next to a cart like they're inflatable."
The competition shows no sign of abating. On Saturday, another veteran started selling in front of the museum.

HEADLINE: DST Global, Hoping to Grow Across Asia, Puts Down Roots

BYLINE: EVELYN M. RUSLI


HIGHLIGHT: The investment firm run by the Russian billionaire Yuri Milner is dedicating more resources in China and other emerging markets. 

 BODY:
The 67th floor of Two International Finance Center, a soaring silver tower in Hong Kong, has a new resident.
DST Global, the Russian multibillion-dollar investment firm, quietly opened its China headquarters here in August. The office, with four investment professionals, is DST's largest single team - a telling sign of its founder Yuri Milner's growing ambitions for the region.
 "China really stands out in the Internet world," said John Lindfors, a former Goldman Sachs banker who heads DST's Hong Kong office. "It has one-quarter of the world's Internet users, and it has its own separate ecosystem."
While Mr. Milner achieved international fame by way of Silicon Valley, as a major investor in Web companies like Facebook and Groupon, the Moscow-born billionaire's roots are in emerging markets, to which DST is dedicating more resources. From its new perch, the team is studying opportunities across Asia, including China, India, Indonesia and South Korea. Over the next five years, DST expects to devote 40 percent of its capital to the region.
The firm has already started to write checks, buying a $500 million stake in the Chinese e-commerce company 360buy in March. It is also part of an investor consortium making a $1.6 billion tender offer for shares in the Alibaba Group, another Chinese Internet giant.
Mr. Milner, once an aspiring physicist, pivoted to finance in 1990, becoming the first Soviet student at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. From there, he landed posts at the World Bank and Bank Menatep, a Russian financial firm.
In 1999, he stumbled across a seminal report on the state of the Web, written by Mary Meeker, the Morgan Stanley analyst once called Queen of the Net. The analysis inspired Mr. Milner to start his own technology investment firm, NetBridge.
Following a private equity model, he bought Russian companies that resembled popular American start-ups, like 24x7, an e-commerce company akin to Amazon, and Molotok, an auction site. The biggest coup came in 2001, when NetBridge merged with Port.ru, Russia's largest e-mail service, to form Digital Sky Technologies. The business, a mix of Russian Internet companies and United States investments, was broken up last year into DST Global and Mail.ru, which went public in November with a market value of $5.7 billion based on its offer price. At the time, Mail.ru was described as the largest publicly held Internet company in Europe.
Mr. Milner's early observations on the Russian and Silicon Valley start-up scenes have formed the foundation of his investment strategy. According to his colleagues, he subscribes to a philosophy of pattern recognition, fixating on the qualities of top Internet companies and founders, and then identifying those characteristics in other start-ups.
Mr. Milner, who savors data and statistics, has also been fascinated by the emergence of global Internet companies and their ability to gain traction in disparate markets. He noticed that European local sites often struggled against worldwide players. But he identified exceptions: China and Russia, where robust engineering talent pools and unique cultural and regulatory features give local businesses the edge.
The team started to visit China in earnest three years ago. Mr. Milner's surveys led him to Tencent, a sprawling Shenzhen conglomerate of instant messaging, social networking and gaming businesses. He was impressed by how the start-up merged gaming with communications and monetized virtual goods. The success of Tencent, which later invested $300 million in DST, persuaded Mr. Milner to take a chance on a similar company in late 2009: Zynga.
The team operates as a kind of investors sans frontieres. Although every professional has a base, everyone logs considerable miles. Mr. Lindfors, for example, is on the road 150 days a year. Mr. Milner travels at least 200 days.
"If you want to be successful in China or Latin America, you have to understand what's going on in Silicon Valley, but it's also not sufficient to just be in Silicon Valley," Mr. Lindfors said. "Because of our reach, we can also offer companies our global perspective and relationships."
Connections have always been central to DST's success. The soft-spoken Mr. Milner has become something of a rock star in Silicon Valley, where he owns a palatial $100 million estate in Los Altos Hills. Within a year, he transitioned from mysterious moneyman to trusted insider by charming the elite with his Russian experiences and his wry sense of humor.
Since 2009, the investor has co-founded an angel fund with Ron Conway, one of Google's earliest backers, and has made several co-investments with the venture capital firm Accel Partners. He frequently brainstorms with Accel's James W. Breyer, who praises Mr. Milner for his "fearlessness when it comes to superb companies at high valuations." Mr. Breyer introduced him to Groupon. Earlier this year, DST helped Accel invest in Spotify, the London-based streaming music service.
Mr. Milner has been busy building similar relationships in China. His typical day starts with a breakfast meeting at 7:30 a.m. and wraps up about 11:30 p.m. One venture capitalist, Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google China and the founder of Innovation Works, a Chinese incubator and investment firm, said he was often struck by Mr. Milner's dogged efficiency. Describing him as "very to the point," Mr. Lee said the investor often comes to meetings with a long list of questions on local entrepreneurs and companies.
And as in Silicon Valley, Mr. Milner is also using his personal checkbook to solidify ties. Earlier this year, he put money into Innovation Works. The firm, which had initially expected to raise $150 million, noticed a "Yuri bump," and the financing round was ultimately capped at $180 million.
In China, DST is especially focused on e-commerce. The Chinese retail industry is highly fragmented; the largest homegrown, brick-and-mortar company accounts for less than 1 percent of the market. Given that and the rapid development of the country's infrastructure, especially its broadband lines, DST foresees a golden age for China's online retailers as money shifts to the Web at a dizzying speed.
Still, the country presents challenges. Internet investments come with considerable regulatory risk, given China's record with online censorship. And Mr. Milner - who has personally invested in dozens of early-stage Silicon Valley start-ups - would be hard pressed to do the same here without teaming up with a domestic firm, because of restrictions on foreign ownership.
"Yuri has a tremendous reputation," Mr. Lee said. But "even he would struggle to get into earlier financing stages."
The newly transplanted team is aware of the slog ahead. In Hong Kong, there was no Champagne toast to celebrate the office opening. Mr. Lindfors has been jamming his schedule with appointments. Of the hundreds of founders the team will meet, only a handful will receive investments.
"You don't move your family and take your kids out of school for a short-term plan," said Mr. Lindfors, a London transplant. "We plan to be here for a long time."

HEADLINE: A Warning as Wall Street Moves Into Emerging Markets

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: The United States has stepped up enforcement of laws against bribery in foreign business transactions, which Wall Street firms would do well to remember. 

 BODY:
Wall Street's headlong rush into emerging markets could collide with the government's push to fight corruption overseas.
The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been increasing their enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in an effort to police bribery by American companies in other countries. Since 2008, the government has brought more than 150 cases under the law, dwarfing the total number filed in the previous 30 years the law was in place.
"We are in a new era of F.C.P.A. enforcement," Lanny A. Breuer, the assistant attorney general for the criminal division, said last year, "and we are here to stay."
Wall Street, which depends on personal connections and business relationships to land deals, could be a natural target of investigators.
Under the corrupt practices law, companies are prohibited from providing bribes or other benefits to a foreign official to "obtain or retain" business in a country. It does not matter if the payments are considered routine and expected by local authorities, or if overseas competitors are paying bribes to gain business.
At one time, overseas bribery cases largely involved companies that regularly dealt with foreign ministries, like mineral extraction firms and equipment suppliers that ranged from makers of small parts to intricate defense systems. But the scope has expanded in recent years as the Justice Department and S.E.C. focus on a range of multinational firms. 
In 2009, the Justice Department disclosed that it was looking at pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers that supplied government-controlled health care systems. They are continuing to look at how companies pay doctors to consult and market their products. Such arrangements can be legal in the United States, but they may violate the corrupt practices law in foreign countries if the doctor is also a government employee.
The criminal and civil penalties assessed for a violation of the law can be enormous. The German conglomerate Siemens paid $800 million in fines in 2008 and disgorgement for having dispensed nearly $1.4 billion in bribes across the world. Siemens is subject to the law because it operates subsidiaries in the United States and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The American construction company Kellogg, Brown & Root paid $579 million to settle criminal and civil cases in 2009.
With the heightened focus on the law, companies that discover problems are expected to conduct intensive internal inquiries to determine the scope of possible overseas bribes and to report them to the government. To show they are complying, companies will sometimes spend more on the investigation than any fines or civil penalties.
In its inquiry, Siemens spent an estimated $1 billion on lawyers, accountants and other experts. Avon Products, which initiated an internal investigation of possible bribery in China in 2008, has since spent roughly $150 million reviewing its worldwide operations, according to quarterly filings with the S.E.C. 
A company's disclosure of possible violations of the law also leads to private shareholder class-action claims, raising the potential costs. Avon, for example, is defending against six lawsuits filed in federal and state courts.
While companies usually report bribery to the government on their own, the S.E.C.'s recently opened whistle-blower office provides a new avenue to gather information about improper corporate conduct. The Dodd-Frank Act created a powerful incentive to disclose potential wrongdoing; employees can receive at least 10 percent and as much as 30 percent of any penalties assessed over $1 million. 
Potential violations will be a likely source of tips because illicit payments are rarely isolated events, and corporate employees know that certain countries are particularly prone to corruption, so they will look with particular care at expenditures there. A pattern of suspicious payments will in all likelihood come to the surface because public corporations must account for the funds in their regular financial reports. So someone is bound to notice.
Wall Street may be especially vulnerable to overseas corruption questions as it moves into emerging markets. Financial firms, all of which offer essentially the same services, have to woo potential clients, usually relying on personal connections rather than products to land investment banking deals. 
Some countries even have a tradition of gift-giving, as part of the usual wining-and-dining process. In China, building "guanxi," or business relationships, involves providing gifts and favors to a network of contacts.
Such conduct can quickly run afoul of the law. The statute applies to payments made to foreign government officials like bureaucrats in a ministry, but it also covers anyone who works for an "instrumentality" of a foreign government, like a state-owned utility looking to go private or a sovereign wealth fund seeking advice on new investments. And in many emerging markets, broad swaths of the economy include state-owned or government-controlled entities.
Wall Street's activities are already raising red flags with investigators. In January, the S.E.C. sent letters to a number of firms asking them to preserve documents related to their dealings with sovereign wealth funds. The funds are a prime area for possible corruption because of the close ties between many of their officials and their government sponsors. 
With the federal government cracking down on corrupt practices overseas, Wall Street will have to walk a fine line. In emerging markets, financial firms must regularly interact with foreign governments. But they must be vigilant, using rigorous controls and warning systems to comply with the law. Otherwise, the ultimate cost of a deal could be greater than the benefit of the new business.

HEADLINE: Hedge Funds Appeal Ruling on WaMu Lawsuit

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A bankruptcy judge ruled Washington Mutual shareholders could pursue a lawsuit that accused four hedge funds of insider trading in the collapsed bank's debt securities. 

 BODY:
7:49 p.m. | Updated 
Earlier this month, a federal bankruptcy judge authorized shareholders of Washington Mutual to pursue a lawsuit that accused four hedge funds of insider trading in the collapsed bank's debt securities.
Those hedge funds have now appealed the ruling, criticizing the judge's decision. The opinion, said one of the funds in its court filing, "radically distorts securities law and bankruptcy law and inflicts a gross injustice."
Judge Mary F. Walrath, a United States bankruptcy judge in Wilmington, Del., rejected the reorganization plan of Washington Mutual, the largest bank failure in the country's history. She also ruled that the Washington Mutual's shareholders had stated a viable claim that the hedge funds traded on confidential information about the bank that they had learned during restructuring talks.
The pitched bankruptcy battle has shined a spotlight on the hedge funds trading in the debt of distressed companies. These funds buy companies' bonds and loans at a discount in the hope of obtaining profits when the companies emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Critics of hedge funds' tactics complain that the sharp-elbowed investors hijack the reorganization process for their own gain.
The four hedge funds - Appaloosa Management, Aurelius Capital Management, Centerbridge Partners and Owl Creek Asset Management - have denied the shareholders' accusations of insider trading, and said that the court's ruling has caused them "significant reputational harm." The funds said that they followed well-established bankruptcy court rules that set forth when they can and cannot trade during a company's restructuring.
Aurelius said Judge Walrath's ruling "set off shock waves" in the bankruptcy world because it premised insider trading liability on procedures that it says are "relied on and used in virtually all large bankruptcy cases."
Lawyers for three of the hedge funds also said that the court's ruling would allow and encourage bankruptcy courts to become a forum for frivolous lawsuits.
"The decision below, unless promptly reversed, also would allow and encourage the types of 'abusive practices committed in private securities litigation' that Congress intended to avoid by enacting" securities litigation reform, the hedge funds said.
Washington Mutual filed for bankruptcy at the peak of the global financial crisis in September 2008. Federal bank regulators seized the savings and loan, which had excessive exposure to subprime loans, and sold it off to JPMorgan Chase.
Judge Walrath has asked Washington Mutual's shareholders and the hedge funds to attend mediation to resolve the dispute.

HEADLINE: DST Global, Hoping to Grow Across Asia, Puts Down Roots

BYLINE: EVELYN M. RUSLI


HIGHLIGHT: The investment firm run by the Russian billionaire Yuri Milner is dedicating more resources in China and other emerging markets. 

 BODY:
The 67th floor of Two International Finance Center, a soaring silver tower in Hong Kong, has a new resident.
DST Global, the Russian multibillion-dollar investment firm, quietly opened its China headquarters here in August. The office, with four investment professionals, is DST's largest single team - a telling sign of its founder Yuri Milner's growing ambitions for the region.
 "China really stands out in the Internet world," said John Lindfors, a former Goldman Sachs banker who heads DST's Hong Kong office. "It has one-quarter of the world's Internet users, and it has its own separate ecosystem."
While Mr. Milner achieved international fame by way of Silicon Valley, as a major investor in Web companies like Facebook and Groupon, the Moscow-born billionaire's roots are in emerging markets, to which DST is dedicating more resources. From its new perch, the team is studying opportunities across Asia, including China, India, Indonesia and South Korea.

Since 2008, the government has brought more than 150 cases under the law, dwarfing the total number filed in the previous 30 years the law was in place.
"We are in a new era of F.C.P.A. enforcement," Lanny A. Breuer, the assistant attorney general for the criminal division, said last year, "and we are here to stay."
Wall Street, which depends on personal connections and business relationships to land deals, could be a natural target of investigators.
Under the corrupt practices law, companies are prohibited from providing bribes or other benefits to a foreign official to "obtain or retain" business in a country. It does not matter if the payments are considered routine and expected by local authorities, or if overseas competitors are paying bribes to gain business.
At one time, overseas bribery cases largely involved companies that regularly dealt with foreign ministries, like mineral extraction firms and equipment suppliers that ranged from makers of small parts to intricate defense systems. But the scope has expanded in recent years as the Justice Department and S.E.C. focus on a range of multinational firms. 
In 2009, the Justice Department disclosed that it was looking at pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers that supplied government-controlled health care systems. They are continuing to look at how companies pay doctors to consult and market their products. Such arrangements can be legal in the United States, but they may violate the corrupt practices law in foreign countries if the doctor is also a government employee.
The criminal and civil penalties assessed for a violation of the law can be enormous. The German conglomerate Siemens paid $800 million in fines in 2008 and disgorgement for having dispensed nearly $1.4 billion in bribes across the world. Siemens is subject to the law because it operates subsidiaries in the United States and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The American construction company Kellogg, Brown & Root paid $579 million to settle criminal and civil cases in 2009.
With the heightened focus on the law, companies that discover problems are expected to conduct intensive internal inquiries to determine the scope of possible overseas bribes and to report them to the government. To show they are complying, companies will sometimes spend more on the investigation than any fines or civil penalties.
In its inquiry, Siemens spent an estimated $1 billion on lawyers, accountants and other experts. Avon Products, which initiated an internal investigation of possible bribery in China in 2008, has since spent roughly $150 million reviewing its worldwide operations, according to quarterly filings with the S.E.C. 
A company's disclosure of possible violations of the law also leads to private shareholder class-action claims, raising the potential costs. Avon, for example, is defending against six lawsuits filed in federal and state courts.
While companies usually report bribery to the government on their own, the S.E.C.'s recently opened whistle-blower office provides a new avenue to gather information about improper corporate conduct. The Dodd-Frank Act created a powerful incentive to disclose potential wrongdoing; employees can receive at least 10 percent and as much as 30 percent of any penalties assessed over $1 million. 
Potential violations will be a likely source of tips because illicit payments are rarely isolated events, and corporate employees know that certain countries are particularly prone to corruption, so they will look with particular care at expenditures there. A pattern of suspicious payments will in all likelihood come to the surface because public corporations must account for the funds in their regular financial reports. So someone is bound to notice.
Wall Street may be especially vulnerable to overseas corruption questions as it moves into emerging markets. Financial firms, all of which offer essentially the same services, have to woo potential clients, usually relying on personal connections rather than products to land investment banking deals. 
Some countries even have a tradition of gift-giving, as part of the usual wining-and-dining process. In China, building "guanxi," or business relationships, involves providing gifts and favors to a network of contacts.
Such conduct can quickly run afoul of the law. The statute applies to payments made to foreign government officials like bureaucrats in a ministry, but it also covers anyone who works for an "instrumentality" of a foreign government, like a state-owned utility looking to go private or a sovereign wealth fund seeking advice on new investments. And in many emerging markets, broad swaths of the economy include state-owned or government-controlled entities.
Wall Street's activities are already raising red flags with investigators. In January, the S.E.C. sent letters to a number of firms asking them to preserve documents related to their dealings with sovereign wealth funds. The funds are a prime area for possible corruption because of the close ties between many of their officials and their government sponsors. 
With the federal government cracking down on corrupt practices overseas, Wall Street will have to walk a fine line. In emerging markets, financial firms must regularly interact with foreign governments. But they must be vigilant, using rigorous controls and warning systems to comply with the law. Otherwise, the ultimate cost of a deal could be greater than the benefit of the new business.

HEADLINE: Hedge Funds Appeal Ruling on WaMu Lawsuit

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A bankruptcy judge ruled Washington Mutual shareholders could pursue a lawsuit that accused four hedge funds of insider trading in the collapsed bank's debt securities. 

 BODY:
7:49 p.m. | Updated 
Earlier this month, a federal bankruptcy judge authorized shareholders of Washington Mutual to pursue a lawsuit that accused four hedge funds of insider trading in the collapsed bank's debt securities.
Those hedge funds have now appealed the ruling, criticizing the judge's decision. The opinion, said one of the funds in its court filing, "radically distorts securities law and bankruptcy law and inflicts a gross injustice."
Judge Mary F. Walrath, a United States bankruptcy judge in Wilmington, Del., rejected the reorganization plan of Washington Mutual, the largest bank failure in the country's history. She also ruled that the Washington Mutual's shareholders had stated a viable claim that the hedge funds traded on confidential information about the bank that they had learned during restructuring talks.
The pitched bankruptcy battle has shined a spotlight on the hedge funds trading in the debt of distressed companies. These funds buy companies' bonds and loans at a discount in the hope of obtaining profits when the companies emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Critics of hedge funds' tactics complain that the sharp-elbowed investors hijack the reorganization process for their own gain.
The four hedge funds - Appaloosa Management, Aurelius Capital Management, Centerbridge Partners and Owl Creek Asset Management - have denied the shareholders' accusations of insider trading, and said that the court's ruling has caused them "significant reputational harm." The funds said that they followed well-established bankruptcy court rules that set forth when they can and cannot trade during a company's restructuring.
Aurelius said Judge Walrath's ruling "set off shock waves" in the bankruptcy world because it premised insider trading liability on procedures that it says are "relied on and used in virtually all large bankruptcy cases."
Lawyers for three of the hedge funds also said that the court's ruling would allow and encourage bankruptcy courts to become a forum for frivolous lawsuits.
"The decision below, unless promptly reversed, also would allow and encourage the types of 'abusive practices committed in private securities litigation' that Congress intended to avoid by enacting" securities litigation reform, the hedge funds said.
Washington Mutual filed for bankruptcy at the peak of the global financial crisis in September 2008. Federal bank regulators seized the savings and loan, which had excessive exposure to subprime loans, and sold it off to JPMorgan Chase.
Judge Walrath has asked Washington Mutual's shareholders and the hedge funds to attend mediation to resolve the dispute.

HEADLINE: Emerging Markets Offer Banks Profits, but Headaches Too

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Banks like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are chasing the potential payoff abroad. But there's a quiet truth to success in those risky markets: the path to profits is often filled with mistakes and setbacks. 

 BODY:
Wall Street loves to crow about its overseas conquests.
Vikram S. Pandit, the head of Citigroup, boldly promised in 2009 that "we will be the single largest emerging markets financial services company." Goldman Sachs's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, said at a conference last year that one of his firm's big goals was "to be Goldman Sachs in more places."
 But there's a quiet truth to success in those risky markets: the path to profits is often filled with mistakes and setbacks.
"A lot of big banks are looking to developing markets, but historically it's tended to be a volatile move," said James Sinegal, a bank analyst at the research firm Morningstar. "It might not be as easy as they expect."
Banks like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are chasing the potential payoff abroad. The economies of countries like China, India and Brazil are growing faster than that of the United States. Such places also represent an untapped client base, with a growing middle class and a large number of wealthy individuals.
As profits wane on the home front, Wall Street firms are increasingly dependent on the emerging markets to bolster their bottom lines. Citicorp, a division of Citigroup, draws about half of its revenue from emerging countries, up from roughly 25 percent in 2005. International markets account for 47 percent of Goldman's profits. Morgan Stanley generated nearly a third of its net revenue from outside the Americas.
"With the United States slowing down, it is not surprising that institutions are looking in the emerging markets," said Hamid Biglari, a Citicorp vice chairman and chief of emerging markets. 
But the perils can be plentiful, with economic, political and regulatory challenges. Foreign regulators have scolded banks, fined them and even banned their activities in various countries. Citigroup twice ran into problems with Japanese authorities. In turn, Wall Street says it has cleaned house at overseas offices, taken greater control of foreign ventures and tapped local bankers to lead new projects.
Local knowledge is especially critical, as firms try to navigate the regulatory and political environment that is crucial to a bank's business.
Earlier this year, Citigroup found itself in hot water with Indonesian regulators. After an investigation into suspected embezzlement by an employee and the death of a client after meetings with the bank's outside debt collectors, the country's central bank imposed sanctions on Citigroup, including a one-year ban on opening new branches.
In June, the bank removed its top country officer, replacing him with a native Indonesian, Tigor M. Siahaan, a seasoned banker experienced in dealing with local regulators and government officials. Now, the bank is tweaking its internal controls, bringing its debt collecting in-house and regularly rotating back-office personnel. The bank said it was also working closely with Indonesian authorities.
"How to behave responsibly in these markets comes with experience," Mr. Biglari said. "You have to figure out how to work with the cultural norms."
Financial firms have also realized that they need to commit to a market, because it can take years if not decades to build up local relationships and understand the country's customs.
While Goldman says on its Web site that it has had a presence in Russia since 1998, the firm has had its troubles in the country. Not long after opening in Russia, Goldman downsized its operations, concerned about the financial crisis that prompted the government to devalue the ruble. It closed the Moscow office and reassigned staff members.
Christopher Barter, co-chief executive for Goldman's Russia business, said the investment bank should not have left the country. "We missed out on years of a footprint there," he said. "When you go into a country, you have to maintain your commitment."
It took years to build up the business in Russia again. Goldman reopened the Moscow location in 2001, but it didn't fully ramp up there until 2006, when it obtained a brokerage license. Today, the firm has 140 employees in Russia, up from 30 people five years ago.
The company has established stronger ties in the country since it has returned. In 2008, Goldman held a board meeting in Russia, a nod to its re-emergence there. Michael Sherwood, vice chairman at Goldman Sachs, now visits Russia several times a year. And Mr. Blankfein, along with other Wall Street chiefs like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, has joined a committee set up by the Russian government to help bring more foreign money to the country. 
Firms have also realized they need more management oversight of overseas investments.
Morgan Stanley was one of the first investment banks to establish a joint venture in China. In 1995, it teamed up with China Construction Bank to form the China International Capital Corporation. But the Wall Street bank was a passive investor, owning just one-third of the business, the limit for foreign securities firms under Chinese rules. It also ceded management control to its partners. In 2010, Morgan Stanley sold the stake to a group of private equity firms. 
Since then, Morgan Stanley has forged a new relationship with Huaxin Securities. While it still owns a one-third stake in the venture, called Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities, it has seats on the firm's board and plays a role in the day-to-day management of the firm. A Morgan Stanley managing director, Yang Kai, is the chief executive of the company. 
While foreign business is hardly a guaranteed win, financial firms are willing to take the risks. It's one of the industry's few options as banks deal with costly new regulations, sluggish economic growth in their home markets and a volatile market - all of which are weighing on profits.
"These guys are hurting and it gets worse by the day," said Michael J. Driscoll, a professor at Adelphi University's business school and former senior trader at Bear Stearns. "You can only squeeze so much till you go looking elsewhere for a return."

HEADLINE: Is This Man the G.O.P.'s Best Bet for 2012?

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS AND GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: A look at who's out there and whether any new Republican candidate is as well prepared as Mitt Romney. 

 BODY:
Gail Collins: David, are you reconciled to the fact that Mitt Romney is going to be the Republican presidential nominee?
David Brooks: Oh, I went through that phase a few weeks ago after the debate at the Reagan library. That's the night I noticed Romney was the best candidate in the field. Since then I've noticed that he has given three debate performances that are better than any Barack Obama has given in his life. (Obama's a better speechmaker, but Romney's a better debater.) So now I'm settling into the idea that Romney might well be president. This will be interesting because he has a tendency to hire people who look vaguely like him, so I'm picturing a White House filled with tall, well-groomed brunettes. 
Gail Collins: Romney is both intelligent and sane, which I guess is saying quite a lot this year. But the man would change his position on the rotation of the earth around the sun if he thought it would get him a win in South Carolina. 
David Brooks: That's why you should love the guy. Let me put it this way: Would you rather have someone who authentically agrees with Michele Bachmann or someone who is just faking it? It seems to me that from your point of view you should be praying for inauthenticity. The more, the better.
I spend a lot of time looking at whom the candidates are choosing as their advisers. Romney clearly has the best group. He's harvested some of the best brains in the G.O.P. He released an economic plan the other week that was a pretty serious document, at least by the standards of politics these days.
As for the overall field, I think it is decent enough: four current or former governors, a former House Speaker, a business magnate. There are a few oddballs, but I thought the quality of the Reagan debate, in particular, was as good as any I'd seen in either party for at least a decade. Rick Perry can't keep up because the quality of the other participants is reasonably high. 
Gail Collins: I don't see anybody else in the field who could conceivably be a serious national candidate. The Tea Party has so energized the far-right side of the Republican base that it's hard for anyone electable to make his or her way through the primaries. But what does that say about what's going on in Washington? Right now, while the presidential selection process is showing how out to lunch the Tea Party segment is, Congress is held hostage to its demands.
David Brooks: I take that as a personal insult against the Herminator! Herman Cain. I feel compelled to rise in his defense. Unlike the current president he at least knows that this is the perfect moment for fundamental tax reform. He's got his 9-9-9 plan (the virtues of which he has not hid under a barrel). He may be wacky in every other respect and offensive in some, but he at least understands the scope of the problems the country faces, and so I have sympathy for him. I wish President Obama had at least some of his vision. 
Gail Collins: He lost me somewhere around the no-Muslims-in-my-cabinet incarnation. Seriously, is there anybody in the rest of the field you'd trust with the nuclear arsenal? Don't say Jon Huntsman unless you honestly believe he could win the New Hampshire primary, even if Mitt Romney and Rick Perry both got lost while campaigning in the White Mountains, and were trapped in the Polar Caves with no hope of rescue until the post-primary thaw.
David Brooks: Huntsman has been my biggest disappointment so far. I went up to watch him campaign in Exeter, N.H., a few weeks ago, and I've watched him debate. He has no theme, no narrative. His campaign seems to be a patchwork of positions that he rotates through. He doesn't tie his policy vision to his personal story and abilities. He needs some emotional and intellectual coherence and a single energizing theme. I hope he finds it.
Gail Collins: Pardon me. I'm ready to move on but I can't quite get past the vision of Mitt Romney and Rick Perry stuck together in the Polar Caves until next spring. What do you think they'd talk about? 
David Brooks: Personally I think they'd lounge around in animal skins drawing beautiful paintings of wild animals on the cave walls, like those early cave dwellers did in France thousands of years ago. Perry would draw elegant mastodons, which he shot while jogging. Romney would paint saber-tooth tigers, riding in cages on the top of his car. (There, got that in.)
Gail Collins: Thanks, I was wondering where I could fit in the dog on the roof. But about the Mitt alternatives. Are you one of the people waiting for Chris Christie? Or is there another savior lurking offstage? Brad Pitt and George Clooney are Democrats, but I don't think Pat Sajak is completely booked up for 2012.
David Brooks: Some of my friends are pining for Christie. I personally do not believe any new candidate is going to be as well prepared as Romney, so I would not advise them getting in to take him on. Except Chuck Norris, of course.

HEADLINE: Stealth Democracy

BYLINE: JOHN SIDES


HIGHLIGHT: Peter R. Orszag, President Obama's former budget director, argues for taking power away froma gridlocked government and giving it to "independent institutions." 

 BODY:
Americans' frustration with the federal government is at or near all-time highs. Peter R. Orszag, President Obama's former budget director, expresses a similar sentiment. In a article for The New Republic, he argues for taking power away from a gridlocked government and giving it to "independent institutions" that will make decisions without undue pressure from politicians or voters.
As Mr. Orszag is well aware, this approach is hardly foolproof. See Catherine Rampell's response for a good critique.
But I want to note how the plan is. It might be less unpopular than you would think.
In their book "Stealth Democracy," the political scientists John R. Hibbing and Elizabeth Theiss-Morse argue that many scholars and commentators overestimate Americans' willingness to participate in politics and commitment to certain democratic ideals. In fact, many Americans are notably willing to endorse proposals like Mr. Orszag's.
In a 1998 survey, respondents were confronted with this statement:
Our government would run better if decisions were left up to nonelected, independent experts rather than politicians or the people.
Almost a third (31 percent) of respondents agreed with this statement. A similar number agreed that government would run better "if decisions were left up to successful business people." Altogether, almost half (48 percent) of respondents agreed with one or both of these ideas. And this was in an era, unlike today, where trust in government was relatively high.
These ideas are tempting, Mr. Hibbing and Ms. Theiss-Morse say, because the public largely agrees on fundamental goals, like economic prosperity, and sees the achievement of those goals as a "management problem." The public does not understand why politicians cannot simply overcome their differences and work toward those goals - a belief evident in recent polls that find the majority of Americans want politicians to compromise instead of sticking to their beliefs.
When politicians cannot compromise, at least some Americans are willing to look elsewhere -- even to a system of "stealth democracy" where decision-making is carried out largely outside of the public's view and by people that the public did not elect.

HEADLINE: Announcement of 2017-25 Federal Fuel Efficiency Standards Delayed Until November

BYLINE: JONATHAN SCHULTZ


HIGHLIGHT: The Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday evening that the standards, which were expected to be unveiled this week, would not be released until mid-November. 

 BODY:
The federal government has delayed its release of 2017-25 targets for Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, until mid-November, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The news marks a delay from the Obama administration's original intention to have the standards out by the end of September.
In July, President Obama announced that the government and the majority of major automakers operating in the United States had reached a tentative agreement to raise fleetwide fuel-economy averages to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, doubling the current average. The administration was expected to make that proposal official by the end of September. But the E.P.A. said it needed more time to coordinate its efforts with the State of California, which agreed not to issue its own fuel-economy standards independent of the federal government.
The administration is still expected to issue the rules next July on schedule, five years before the 2017-25 CAFE standards take effect.
"Given the historic nature of this joint rule between EPA and DOT, as well as the necessary coordination with California, it was recently determined that additional time was needed and we expect to issue a proposal for MY 2017-2025 vehicles by mid-November," said a statement issued by the E.P.A. on Tuesday evening.

HEADLINE: Emerging Markets Offer Banks Profits, but Headaches Too

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Banks like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are chasing the potential payoff abroad. But there's a quiet truth to success in those risky markets: the path to profits is often filled with mistakes and setbacks. 

 BODY:
Wall Street loves to crow about its overseas conquests.
Vikram S. Pandit, the head of Citigroup, boldly promised in 2009 that "we will be the single largest emerging markets financial services company." Goldman Sachs's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, said at a conference last year that one of his firm's big goals was "to be Goldman Sachs in more places."
 But there's a quiet truth to success in those risky markets: the path to profits is often filled with mistakes and setbacks.
"A lot of big banks are looking to developing markets, but historically it's tended to be a volatile move," said James Sinegal, a bank analyst at the research firm Morningstar. "It might not be as easy as they expect."
Banks like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are chasing the potential payoff abroad. The economies of countries like China, India and Brazil are growing faster than that of the United States. Such places also represent an untapped client base, with a growing middle class and a large number of wealthy individuals.
As profits wane on the home front, Wall Street firms are increasingly dependent on the emerging markets to bolster their bottom lines. Citicorp, a division of Citigroup, draws about half of its revenue from emerging countries, up from roughly 25 percent in 2005. International markets account for 47 percent of Goldman's profits. Morgan Stanley generated nearly a third of its net revenue from outside the Americas.
"With the United States slowing down, it is not surprising that institutions are looking in the emerging markets," said Hamid Biglari, a Citicorp vice chairman and chief of emerging markets. 
But the perils can be plentiful, with economic, political and regulatory challenges. Foreign regulators have scolded banks, fined them and even banned their activities in various countries. Citigroup twice ran into problems with Japanese authorities. In turn, Wall Street says it has cleaned house at overseas offices, taken greater control of foreign ventures and tapped local bankers to lead new projects.
Local knowledge is especially critical, as firms try to navigate the regulatory and political environment that is crucial to a bank's business.
Earlier this year, Citigroup found itself in hot water with Indonesian regulators. After an investigation into suspected embezzlement by an employee and the death of a client after meetings with the bank's outside debt collectors, the country's central bank imposed sanctions on Citigroup, including a one-year ban on opening new branches.
In June, the bank removed its top country officer, replacing him with a native Indonesian, Tigor M. Siahaan, a seasoned banker experienced in dealing with local regulators and government officials. Now, the bank is tweaking its internal controls, bringing its debt collecting in-house and regularly rotating back-office personnel. The bank said it was also working closely with Indonesian authorities.
"How to behave responsibly in these markets comes with experience," Mr. Biglari said. "You have to figure out how to work with the cultural norms."
Financial firms have also realized that they need to commit to a market, because it can take years if not decades to build up local relationships and understand the country's customs.
While Goldman says on its Web site that it has had a presence in Russia since 1998, the firm has had its troubles in the country. Not long after opening in Russia, Goldman downsized its operations, concerned about the financial crisis that prompted the government to devalue the ruble. It closed the Moscow office and reassigned staff members.
Christopher Barter, co-chief executive for Goldman's Russia business, said the investment bank should not have left the country. "We missed out on years of a footprint there," he said. "When you go into a country, you have to maintain your commitment."
It took years to build up the business in Russia again. Goldman reopened the Moscow location in 2001, but it didn't fully ramp up there until 2006, when it obtained a brokerage license. Today, the firm has 140 employees in Russia, up from 30 people five years ago.
The company has established stronger ties in the country since it has returned. In 2008, Goldman held a board meeting in Russia, a nod to its re-emergence there. Michael Sherwood, vice chairman at Goldman Sachs, now visits Russia several times a year. And Mr. Blankfein, along with other Wall Street chiefs like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, has joined a committee set up by the Russian government to help bring more foreign money to the country. 
Firms have also realized they need more management oversight of overseas investments.
Morgan Stanley was one of the first investment banks to establish a joint venture in China. In 1995, it teamed up with China Construction Bank to form the China International Capital Corporation. But the Wall Street bank was a passive investor, owning just one-third of the business, the limit for foreign securities firms under Chinese rules. It also ceded management control to its partners. In 2010, Morgan Stanley sold the stake to a group of private equity firms. 
Since then, Morgan Stanley has forged a new relationship with Huaxin Securities. While it still owns a one-third stake in the venture, called Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities, it has seats on the firm's board and plays a role in the day-to-day management of the firm. A Morgan Stanley managing director, Yang Kai, is the chief executive of the company. 
While foreign business is hardly a guaranteed win, financial firms are willing to take the risks. It's one of the industry's few options as banks deal with costly new regulations, sluggish economic growth in their home markets and a volatile market - all of which are weighing on profits.
"These guys are hurting and it gets worse by the day," said Michael J. Driscoll, a professor at Adelphi University's business school and former senior trader at Bear Stearns. "You can only squeeze so much till you go looking elsewhere for a return."

HEADLINE: Is This Man the G.O.P.'s Best Bet for 2012?

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS AND GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: A look at who's out there and whether any new Republican candidate is as well prepared as Mitt Romney. 

 BODY:
Gail Collins: David, are you reconciled to the fact that Mitt Romney is going to be the Republican presidential nominee?
David Brooks: Oh, I went through that phase a few weeks ago after the debate at the Reagan library. That's the night I noticed Romney was the best candidate in the field. Since then I've noticed that he has given three debate performances that are better than any Barack Obama has given in his life. (Obama's a better speechmaker, but Romney's a better debater.) So now I'm settling into the idea that Romney might well be president. This will be interesting because he has a tendency to hire people who look vaguely like him, so I'm picturing a White House filled with tall, well-groomed brunettes. 
Gail Collins: Romney is both intelligent and sane, which I guess is saying quite a lot this year. But the man would change his position on the rotation of the earth around the sun if he thought it would get him a win in South Carolina. 
David Brooks: That's why you should love the guy. Let me put it this way: Would you rather have someone who authentically agrees with Michele Bachmann or someone who is just faking it? It seems to me that from your point of view you should be praying for inauthenticity. The more, the better.
I spend a lot of time looking at whom the candidates are choosing as their advisers. Romney clearly has the best group. He's harvested some of the best brains in the G.O.P. He released an economic plan the other week that was a pretty serious document, at least by the standards of politics these days.
As for the overall field, I think it is decent enough: four current or former governors, a former House Speaker, a business magnate. There are a few oddballs, but I thought the quality of the Reagan debate, in particular, was as good as any I'd seen in either party for at least a decade. Rick Perry can't keep up because the quality of the other participants is reasonably high. 
Gail Collins: I don't see anybody else in the field who could conceivably be a serious national candidate. The Tea Party has so energized the far-right side of the Republican base that it's hard for anyone electable to make his or her way through the primaries. But what does that say about what's going on in Washington? Right now, while the presidential selection process is showing how out to lunch the Tea Party segment is, Congress is held hostage to its demands.
David Brooks: I take that as a personal insult against the Herminator! Herman Cain. I feel compelled to rise in his defense. Unlike the current president he at least knows that this is the perfect moment for fundamental tax reform. He's got his 9-9-9 plan (the virtues of which he has not hid under a barrel). He may be wacky in every other respect and offensive in some, but he at least understands the scope of the problems the country faces, and so I have sympathy for him. I wish President Obama had at least some of his vision. 
Gail Collins: He lost me somewhere around the no-Muslims-in-my-cabinet incarnation. Seriously, is there anybody in the rest of the field you'd trust with the nuclear arsenal? Don't say Jon Huntsman unless you honestly believe he could win the New Hampshire primary, even if Mitt Romney and Rick Perry both got lost while campaigning in the White Mountains, and were trapped in the Polar Caves with no hope of rescue until the post-primary thaw.
David Brooks: Huntsman has been my biggest disappointment so far. I went up to watch him campaign in Exeter, N.H., a few weeks ago, and I've watched him debate. He has no theme, no narrative. His campaign seems to be a patchwork of positions that he rotates through. He doesn't tie his policy vision to his personal story and abilities. He needs some emotional and intellectual coherence and a single energizing theme. I hope he finds it.
Gail Collins: Pardon me. I'm ready to move on but I can't quite get past the vision of Mitt Romney and Rick Perry stuck together in the Polar Caves until next spring. What do you think they'd talk about? 
David Brooks: Personally I think they'd lounge around in animal skins drawing beautiful paintings of wild animals on the cave walls, like those early cave dwellers did in France thousands of years ago. Perry would draw elegant mastodons, which he shot while jogging. Romney would paint saber-tooth tigers, riding in cages on the top of his car. (There, got that in.)
Gail Collins: Thanks, I was wondering where I could fit in the dog on the roof. But about the Mitt alternatives. Are you one of the people waiting for Chris Christie? Or is there another savior lurking offstage? Brad Pitt and George Clooney are Democrats, but I don't think Pat Sajak is completely booked up for 2012.
David Brooks: Some of my friends are pining for Christie. I personally do not believe any new candidate is going to be as well prepared as Romney, so I would not advise them getting in to take him on. Except Chuck Norris, of course.

HEADLINE: Stealth Democracy

BYLINE: JOHN SIDES


HIGHLIGHT: Peter R. Orszag, President Obama's former budget director, argues for taking power away froma gridlocked government and giving it to "independent institutions." 

 BODY:
Americans' frustration with the federal government is at or near all-time highs. Peter R. Orszag, President Obama's former budget director, expresses a similar sentiment. In a article for The New Republic, he argues for taking power away from a gridlocked government and giving it to "independent institutions" that will make decisions without undue pressure from politicians or voters.
As Mr. Orszag is well aware, this approach is hardly foolproof. See Catherine Rampell's response for a good critique.
But I want to note how the plan is. It might be less unpopular than you would think.
In their book "Stealth Democracy," the political scientists John R. Hibbing and Elizabeth Theiss-Morse argue that many scholars and commentators overestimate Americans' willingness to participate in politics and commitment to certain democratic ideals. In fact, many Americans are notably willing to endorse proposals like Mr. Orszag's.
In a 1998 survey, respondents were confronted with this statement:
Our government would run better if decisions were left up to nonelected, independent experts rather than politicians or the people.
Almost a third (31 percent) of respondents agreed with this statement. A similar number agreed that government would run better "if decisions were left up to successful business people." Altogether, almost half (48 percent) of respondents agreed with one or both of these ideas. And this was in an era, unlike today, where trust in government was relatively high.
These ideas are tempting, Mr. Hibbing and Ms. Theiss-Morse say, because the public largely agrees on fundamental goals, like economic prosperity, and sees the achievement of those goals as a "management problem." The public does not understand why politicians cannot simply overcome their differences and work toward those goals - a belief evident in recent polls that find the majority of Americans want politicians to compromise instead of sticking to their beliefs.
When politicians cannot compromise, at least some Americans are willing to look elsewhere -- even to a system of "stealth democracy" where decision-making is carried out largely outside of the public's view and by people that the public did not elect.

HEADLINE: Announcement of 2017-25 Federal Fuel Efficiency Standards Delayed Until November

BYLINE: JONATHAN SCHULTZ


HIGHLIGHT: The Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday evening that the standards, which were expected to be unveiled this week, would not be released until mid-November.

HEADLINE: DST Global, Hoping to Grow Across Asia, Puts Down Roots

BYLINE: By EVELYN M. RUSLI

 BODY:
The 67th floor of Two International Finance Center, a soaring silver tower in Hong Kong, has a new resident.
DST Global, the Russian multibillion-dollar investment firm, quietly opened its China headquarters here in August. The office, with four investment professionals, is DST's largest single team - a telling sign of its founder Yuri Milner's growing ambitions for the region.
''China really stands out in the Internet world,'' said John Lindfors, a former Goldman Sachs banker who heads DST's Hong Kong office. ''It has one-quarter of the world's Internet users, and it has its own separate ecosystem.''
While Mr. Milner achieved international fame by way of Silicon Valley, as a major investor in Web companies like Facebook and Groupon, the Moscow-born billionaire's roots are in emerging markets, to which DST is dedicating more resources. From its new perch, the team is studying opportunities across Asia, including China, India, Indonesia and South Korea. Over the next five years, DST expects to devote 40 percent of its capital to the region. 
The firm has already started to write checks, buying a $500 million stake in the Chinese e-commerce company 360buy in March. It is also part of an investor consortium making a $1.6 billion tender offer for shares in the Alibaba Group, another Chinese Internet giant.
Mr. Milner, once an aspiring physicist, pivoted to finance in 1990, becoming the first Soviet student at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. From there, he landed posts at the World Bank and Bank Menatep, a Russian financial firm.
In 1999, he stumbled across a seminal report on the state of the Web, written by Mary Meeker, the Morgan Stanley analyst once called Queen of the Net. The analysis inspired Mr. Milner to start his own technology investment firm, NetBridge.
Following a private equity model, he bought Russian companies that resembled popular American start-ups, like 24x7, an e-commerce company akin to Amazon, and Molotok, an auction site. The biggest coup came in 2001, when NetBridge merged with Port.ru, Russia's largest e-mail service, to form Digital Sky Technologies. The business, a mix of Russian Internet companies and United States investments, was broken up last year into DST Global and Mail.ru, which went public in November with a market value of $5.7 billion based on its offer price. At the time, Mail.ru was described as the largest publicly held Internet company in Europe.
Mr. Milner's early observations on the Russian and Silicon Valley start-up scenes have formed the foundation of his investment strategy. According to his colleagues, he subscribes to a philosophy of pattern recognition, fixating on the qualities of top Internet companies and founders, and then identifying those characteristics in other start-ups.
Mr. Milner, who savors data and statistics, has also been fascinated by the emergence of global Internet companies and their ability to gain traction in disparate markets. He noticed that European local sites often struggled against worldwide players. But he identified exceptions: China and Russia, where robust engineering talent pools and unique cultural and regulatory features give local businesses the edge.
The team started to visit China in earnest three years ago. Mr. Milner's surveys led him to Tencent, a sprawling Shenzhen conglomerate of instant messaging, social networking and gaming businesses. He was impressed by how the start-up merged gaming with communications and monetized virtual goods. The success of Tencent, which later invested $300 million in DST, persuaded Mr. Milner to take a chance on a similar company in late 2009: Zynga.
The team operates as a kind of investors sans frontieres. Although every professional has a base, everyone logs considerable miles. Mr. Lindfors, for example, is on the road 150 days a year. Mr. Milner travels at least 200 days.
''If you want to be successful in China or Latin America, you have to understand what's going on in Silicon Valley, but it's also not sufficient to just be in Silicon Valley,'' Mr. Lindfors said. ''Because of our reach, we can also offer companies our global perspective and relationships.''
Connections have always been central to DST's success. The soft-spoken Mr. Milner has become something of a rock star in Silicon Valley, where he owns a palatial $100 million estate in Los Altos Hills. Within a year, he transitioned from mysterious moneyman to trusted insider by charming the elite with his Russian experiences and his wry sense of humor.
Since 2009, the investor has co-founded an angel fund with Ron Conway, one of Google's earliest backers, and has made several co-investments with the venture capital firm Accel Partners. He frequently brainstorms with Accel's James W. Breyer, who praises Mr. Milner for his ''fearlessness when it comes to superb companies at high valuations.'' Mr. Breyer introduced him to Groupon. Earlier this year, DST helped Accel invest in Spotify, the London-based streaming music service.
Mr. Milner has been busy building similar relationships in China. His typical day starts with a breakfast meeting at 7:30 a.m. and wraps up about 11:30 p.m. One venture capitalist, Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google China and the founder of Innovation Works, a Chinese incubator and investment firm, said he was often struck by Mr. Milner's dogged efficiency. Describing him as ''very to the point,'' Mr. Lee said the investor often comes to meetings with a long list of questions on local entrepreneurs and companies.
And as in Silicon Valley, Mr. Milner is also using his personal checkbook to solidify ties. Earlier this year, he put money into Innovation Works. The firm, which had initially expected to raise $150 million, noticed a ''Yuri bump,'' and the financing round was ultimately capped at $180 million.
In China, DST is especially focused on e-commerce. The Chinese retail industry is highly fragmented; the largest homegrown, brick-and-mortar company accounts for less than 1 percent of the market. Given that and the rapid development of the country's infrastructure, especially its broadband lines, DST foresees a golden age for China's online retailers as money shifts to the Web at a dizzying speed.
Still, the country presents challenges. Internet investments come with considerable regulatory risk, given China's record with online censorship. And Mr. Milner - who has personally invested in dozens of early-stage Silicon Valley start-ups - would be hard pressed to do the same here without teaming up with a domestic firm, because of restrictions on foreign ownership.
''Yuri has a tremendous reputation,'' Mr. Lee said. But ''even he would struggle to get into earlier financing stages.''
The newly transplanted team is aware of the slog ahead. In Hong Kong, there was no Champagne toast to celebrate the office opening. Mr. Lindfors has been jamming his schedule with appointments. Of the hundreds of founders the team will meet, only a handful will receive investments.
''You don't move your family and take your kids out of school for a short-term plan,'' said Mr. Lindfors, a London transplant. ''We plan to be here for a long time.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Hispanic Children in Poverty Exceed Whites, Study Finds

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Hispanic children living in poverty in the United States outnumber poor white children for the first time, a demographic shift that was hastened by the recession, according to a report released Wednesday by the Pew Hispanic Center. 
The number of Hispanic children in poverty jumped by 36 percent from 2007 to 2010, to a total of 6.1 million, compared with 5 million non-Hispanic white children who are poor, said the report, which analyzed recent data from the Census Bureau.
The recession drove the rise, the report found. But demographics also contributed. The Hispanic population has grown by more than 40 percent over the past decade.
Hispanics make up 16 percent of the overall American population, but they are a quarter of the country's children.
''Who they become will be important for the future of the nation,'' said Mark Hugo Lopez, the associate director of the Pew Hispanic Center and the principal author of the report.
Hispanics suffered in the recession in part because they were heavily employed in industries like housing that experienced sharp declines. It sliced 7 percent off their median income and bumped their unemployment rate up to 11 percent, from 5.7 percent before the recession began. In comparison, the national rate is 9 percent.
Children of immigrant parents were far more likely to be poor. Of the 6.1 million Latino children living in poverty, more than two-thirds had immigrant parents, according to the Pew report. Most of those children were born in the United States. The other two million had parents born in the United States.
While the number of Hispanic children in poverty is the highest ever, the poverty rate -- 35 percent in 2010 -- is well under its 1994 peak of 41 percent.
Nor do Hispanics have the largest share in poverty of all racial and ethnic groups. In 2010, 39.1 percent of black children -- 4.3 million -- lived in poverty, as did 12.4 percent of white children.
There were some bright spots in the report. Mr. Lopez said that most young Hispanics believe they will be better off than their parents, citing surveys the center has conducted. College enrollment has been rising significantly among young Hispanics.
And Hispanic children in poverty are more likely to live in married couple families than either non-Hispanic whites or African-Americans, according to the report, a pattern that can help cushion an economic fall. Forty-six percent of Hispanic children lived in married couple families in 2010, compared with 41 percent of whites and 16 percent of African-Americans.

HEADLINE: Modernist Landmark Behind a Court Battle

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
The thorny dilemmas that can be posed by efforts at architectural preservation are rearing their heads again in New York City in the case of a landmark building on Fifth Avenue that is considered to be the very model of Modernism.
Almost 60 years ago, when the glass corner structure at 43rd Street was designed for the Manufacturers Hanover Trust, it broke all molds for bank architecture. No more shuttered fortresses with tight doorways and pillars of formidable stone.
It would be an airy, transparent building. A wisp. A luminous box with an unbroken glass facade that positioned its escalators and its impressive steel vault so that they would be prominent and visible through the windows.
Designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and completed in 1954, 510 Fifth Avenue came to be seen as an important, historic building in the same league as modern architectural legends like Lever House and the Seagram Building. 
But now preservationists and the city are battling in court over the building's future. Preservationists say the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission has abandoned its role as a protector of history and aesthetics to accommodate a powerful real estate interest. The commission says it has made reasonable accommodations for a new owner who wants to renovate the building.
The owner, Vornado Realty Trust, has, among other things, received permission to cut new doorways into the Fifth Avenue facade, to rotate the prized escalators and move them farther away from the windows and to reduce the vault wall. The plan is to create a space that can accommodate two new stores on Fifth Avenue.
''The resulting alteration totally obliterates the quality of this iconic structure,'' said Roberta Brandes Gratz, a former landmarks commissioner who said she was asked to leave the panel last year to serve on a mayoral sustainability panel. ''The interior is totally one piece with the exterior, both visually from the street and architecturally within. That has been totally compromised.''
Landmarks panels across the country have long wrestled with the delicate balance between preserving architectural history and fostering economic development, particularly during financial downturns when new projects can mean jobs. In New York, preservation groups have continually criticized the Bloomberg administration as favoring developers.
But in the case of this Fifth Avenue landmark, some say the building must be allowed to evolve.
The landmarks commission's role is not to lock New York's architectural history in aspic, said Stephen F. Byrns, an architect who left the commission last year after completing his term. Rather, he said, ''It's trying to be reasonable and flexible in allowing a property to adapt.
''This is no longer a bank and there's no longer a vault there,'' he continued. ''You can make doors out of glass that are almost seamless.''
Though renovation has begun, preservationists have secured a stop-work order from the Manhattan Supreme Court judge who is hearing the case. They charge in the suit that the developer, abetted by the landmarks commission, has ignored restrictions set by the city to preserve the building's interior character. Work is continuing, however, on the condition that any change must be reversible should the preservationists prevail in court.
Feeding the dispute are the preservationists' concerns that the commission's dealings with Vornado, whose many tenants in buildings across the city include Bloomberg L.P., the mayor's company, have been too cozy.
Vornado hired a former landmarks commissioner, Meredith Kane, to be its lawyer before the commission. She was allowed to see and suggest changes to the report that the commission used to give the interior of the building landmark status earlier this year. And in a round of e-mails that the preservationists secured as part of their lawsuit, filed in July, they found one in which Ms. Kane asked that a hearing on designating the interior ''be deferred until Vornado had its tenants in place'' and another in which she asked the commission's chairman, Robert B. Tierney, to reassure Vornado's chairman, Steven Roth, that the commission would not block efforts to convert the property into retail space.
''I just had a call from Steve Roth, who is facing a drop-dead deadline of next week in his deal to buy the property,'' Ms. Kane said in an e-mail in April 2010. ''What I think he'd most like is a little bit of hand-holding directly from you -- he won't believe it when it comes from me! -- that even though we have a lot of detail to work through, and you will need staff and the commissioners to be satisfied with the proposals, that we are going to 'get through' this project.''
Theodore Grunewald, the founder of the Coalition to Save Manufacturers Hanover Trust and a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said: ''The ability for a real-estate industry to reach inside the operations of our city government to suit their own purposes is appalling. It brings up a larger question of why a large corporation like Vornado is given special treatment above the law and behind the scenes.''
But the landmarks commission said building owners are routinely allowed to see draft landmark-designation reports and to confer with staff members on how to submit an application that will meet the commission's restrictions. These contacts, Mr. Tierney said, are designed to provide insight into the process, not to offer any guarantees. ''Since the commissioners, not the staff, make the ultimate decisions, staff cannot give any such assurances,'' he said. And he said he never made the requested call to Mr. Roth.
''The proposed changes were consistent with and showed immense respect for the interior and exterior of this building,'' Mr. Tierney said. ''They not only complement the beauty of the building but are also almost fully reversible for future potential owners.''
The building's exterior was made a landmark in 1997. The interior, which had come to public attention after a signature metal screen by the sculptor Harry Bertoia was removed, was not given landmark status until February. Two months after the interior landmark designation, the commission granted the new owner, Vornado, permission to make changes to the building.
The preservationists contend these changes are significant reconfigurations that violate the protections that had been put in place. But Vornado hired the original architects, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (S.O.M.), to make the changes and it has argued that the renovation is in keeping with the original design.
''This is one of the great projects in our portfolio that helped contribute to the reputation of S.O.M.,'' said Roger Duffy, a design partner at Skidmore, Owings. ''So we wanted to make sure we would do this in the right way and to the highest level of quality.''
When the bank president originally approached Skidmore, Owings in the 1950s, Mr. Duffy said, he had asked that the building be adaptable in case it failed as a bank. ''That was always a part of the building,'' Mr. Duffy said, ''the adaptability of the project.''
Mr. Tierney agreed. ''Ultimately, the building was originally designed for a specific use -- banking -- which was no longer practical,'' he said.
Given that the building's previous owners had made some alterations to the interior, the architects also made the point that they would be restoring a few original elements, like the luminous ceiling.
Perhaps the most noticeable change in the interior is the reconfiguration of the escalators. In public hearings, commissioners had objected to the idea of changing the escalators, which were positioned about 15 feet from the street and ran north-south. In designating the interior as a landmark, the commission spoke of how the escalators had been ''positioned to maximize visibility from Fifth Avenue'' but noted that in recent years, before Vornado's purchase, A.T.M.'s had blocked the sightlines from the street.
Under the approved changes, new escalators will be installed that will be set back farther from the street and run east-west. ''It was an important diagonal element in the composition,'' Mr. Grunewald, an architect and archivist, said. Other architects say such changes represent a slippery slope; allow escalators to be moved and eventually a landmark isn't a landmark anymore.
''Since the building is one of the most transparent in New York and it's an iconic structure, it's almost as if the interior is more significant than the facade,'' the architect Richard Gluckman said. ''If things are designated, they should be rigorously protected.''

HEADLINE: Seattle Firm Struggles In the Biggest Market

BYLINE: By JULIE WEED

 BODY:
Glassybaby is a creator and purveyor of small hand-blown glass cups used as decoration, vases and candleholders. Founded in 2001 by Lee Rhodes, the 97-employee company runs three stores and a glass-blowing studio in Seattle, as well as a store in New York City (the cups are also sold online). Ms. Rhodes projects that revenue for the company this year will be $6 million.
THE CHALLENGE Make the New York store profitable. Thinking it was ready to expand beyond Seattle, Glassybaby opened a store on Hudson Street in the West Village in the fall of 2009.
THE BACKGROUND In 1998 Ms. Rhodes, the mother of three young children, was fighting a rare form of lung cancer. One evening, her husband at the time came home with a small glass cup he had created in an art class that Ms. Rhodes had encouraged him to take. ''We weren't sure what to do with it at first, but when we put a candle in the cup and lit it, the effect was so peaceful and so healing,'' Ms. Rhodes said. Her husband made more of the soothing little votives for her and soon friends were asking for them, too. 
Spending time at the hospital receiving chemotherapy alongside other patients, Ms. Rhodes was struck by the struggles some encountered finding transportation to their appointments or paying for child care. When Ms. Rhodes's cancer went into remission, she started the business of making and selling the votives she calls Glassybaby. To help patients like those she had met, Ms. Rhodes set a goal of donating 10 percent of all revenue to charity, primarily for cancer care that is not covered by insurance.
The first Glassybaby store and glass-blowing studio opened in 2003 and became profitable after four years. Along with selling the votives, the company rents them out for parties or lends them to serve as charity-event centerpieces. Today, Glassybaby sells 459 different colors of the $44 hand-blown glass containers.
In the last few years, the company has been on a steep trajectory. In 2009, sales increased 25 percent, and Glassybaby caught the eye of Jeffrey Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com -- also located in Seattle -- who bought 20 percent of the company. In 2010, Glassybaby sales increased 50 percent. Ms. Rhodes says she has given away more than $600,000 to charity.
With the success of Glassybaby in Seattle and the infusion of cash from Mr. Bezos, Ms. Rhodes decided in 2009 to expand to a new location. She quickly concluded that the country's biggest market offered the best opportunity -- despite the inevitable competition of other specialty stores.
In Manhattan, Ms. Rhodes believed she would be able to sell to millions of apartment dwellers in homes ranging from small studio apartments all the way up to multimillion-dollar condos. The city also had strong philanthropic traditions, so there would be plenty of nonprofit partners to work with, and she felt the story of her work as a cancer survivor creating something to help others would resonate.
The final factor in the expansion was the poor economy. At the time, Ms. Rhodes said, few other retailers were expanding into the city. She said she believed that New Yorkers still liked discovering new things -- but there were not as many new things happening because of the recession.
The Glassybaby shop opened in the West Village in the fall of 2009. Last year, the store had $290,000 in revenue, but with rent of $9,000 a month, along with salaries and other expenses, it lost money.
Ms. Rhodes acknowledged some missteps. She said she believed that an attractive display of Glassybabys would draw people into the store and that, at $44 each, the price was right for an impulse buy, but the West Village location got far fewer passers-by than she had expected. ''We didn't pay to have a foot-traffic study done of the store location,'' she said, ''and that was a big mistake.''
She also realized too late that people wouldn't be inclined to buy a dozen Glassybabys, the way they do in Seattle, because they would have to carry them home. ''In Seattle, everyone had cars so we never thought about it,'' Ms. Rhodes said.
Another misstep has been in training the sales staff. ''We need to sell the story as well as the product,'' she said, ''and we didn't really train our first set of New York staff to interact with the customer at that level.'' She recently sent one of her Seattle-based managers to live in New York, manage the store and train the sales clerks.
THE OPTIONS Ms. Rhodes considered a variety of strategies to improve sales and become profitable. One option was to move the store to a location with more foot traffic from shoppers, commuters and tourists -- an obvious but expensive solution. Moving would involve paying for a location study and the cost of preparing a new space. She is also considering opening a glass-blowing studio in New York to avoid the freight charges she incurs shipping the votives from Seattle.
Another option would be to try to build awareness of Glassybaby. For example, Ms. Rhodes considered approaching more restaurants: ''Most restaurants can use lighting that is beautiful but isn't overwhelming on their tables, and it's a great way for customers to be introduced to our product.''
Another way to seed the product among potential buyers would be to lend Glassybabys to charity organizations for events -- along with a small table card introducing the company and its philanthropic story. ''We've done this in Seattle, and it's a way to help make the function special,'' she said. ''It saves money for the charity and people see our products.''
In addition, Glassybaby could pursue a public relations campaign to try to place the product in more fashion and home magazines or local publications that would review or publicize the store to make it more of a destination and less reliant on passers-by.
WHAT OTHERS SAY Dan Levitan, a founder of Maveron, a venture capital firm based in Seattle: ''Glassybaby is selling a concept, not just a physical product. The New York City store manager needs to get that concept outside of the four walls of the stores and into fashion and charity circles in New York City. The staff in the new store need to learn the company culture so they can become a mirror image of the store experience in Seattle.''
Christina Norsig , chief executive of PopUpInsider, a Manhattan group that matches companies with empty retail space for temporary leases: ''I recommend moving the New York store to an area with more foot traffic. They could use temporary retail spaces to find the right geographic locations and boost brand awareness through public relations events. Glassybaby is a perfect concept that also lends itself for wholesale distribution to department and specialty shops.''
Emeric Harney , general manager of the Harney & Sons SoHo store, an expansion of Harney & Sons tea company, which is based in Millerton, N.Y.: ''Glassybaby might also take advantage of social media platforms, expanding its business with Facebook check-ins, Foursquare deals, etc., in an effort to reach a younger demographic which makes up a large portion of New York City. Using these platforms, they might be able to organize brand outreach events or partner with other businesses to pool their client bases together.''
THE RESULTS Offer your thoughts on Glassybaby's decision on the You're the Boss blog at nytimes.com/boss. Next week, on the blog and in this space, we will explain how the company is doing.

HEADLINE: Hedge Funds Appeal Ruling on a Bank Shareholder Suit

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
7:49 p.m. Updated
Earlier this month, a federal bankruptcy judge authorized shareholders of Washington Mutual to pursue a lawsuit that accused four hedge funds of insider trading in the collapsed bank's debt securities. 
Those hedge funds have now appealed the ruling, criticizing the judge's decision. The opinion, said one of the funds in its court filing, ''radically distorts securities law and bankruptcy law and inflicts a gross injustice.''
Judge Mary F. Walrath, a United States bankruptcy judge in Wilmington, Del., rejected the reorganization plan of Washington Mutual, the largest bank failure in the country's history. She also ruled that the Washington Mutual's shareholders had stated a viable claim that the hedge funds traded on confidential information about the bank that they had learned during restructuring talks.
The pitched bankruptcy battle has shined a spotlight on the hedge funds trading in the debt of distressed companies. These funds buy companies' bonds and loans at a discount in the hope of obtaining profits when the companies emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Critics of hedge funds' tactics complain that the sharp-elbowed investors hijack the reorganization process for their own gain.
The four hedge funds - Appaloosa Management, Aurelius Capital Management, Centerbridge Partners and Owl Creek Asset Management - have denied the shareholders' accusations of insider trading, and said that the court's ruling has caused them ''significant reputational harm.'' The funds said that they followed well-established bankruptcy court rules that set forth when they can and cannot trade during a company's restructuring.
Aurelius said Judge Walrath's ruling ''set off shock waves'' in the bankruptcy world because it premised insider trading liability on procedures that it says are ''relied on and used in virtually all large bankruptcy cases.''
Lawyers for three of the hedge funds also said that the court's ruling would allow and encourage bankruptcy courts to become a forum for frivolous lawsuits.
''The decision below, unless promptly reversed, also would allow and encourage the types of 'abusive practices committed in private securities litigation' that Congress intended to avoid by enacting'' securities litigation reform, the hedge funds said.
Washington Mutual filed for bankruptcy at the peak of the global financial crisis in September 2008. Federal bank regulators seized the savings and loan, which had excessive exposure to subprime loans, and sold it off to JPMorgan Chase.
Judge Walrath has asked Washington Mutual's shareholders and the hedge funds to attend mediation to resolve the dispute.

HEADLINE: Businesses Increase Investment Spending

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
American businesses stepped up investment spending in August despite the upheaval caused by bitter political fighting in Washington, and some economists raised their forecast for economic growth for this quarter. 
The Commerce Department said Wednesday that orders for capital goods outside of the military sector and excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending, increased 1.1 percent after falling 0.2 percent in July.
That was well above economists' expectations for a 0.3 percent rise and suggested that businesses, sitting on about $2 trillion in cash, had not responded to the recent financial market volatility by curtailing investment.
''If we were in a recession we would expect to see business orders for capital goods plummeting and they are not,'' said Richard DeKaser, an economist at the Parthenon Group in Boston.
The solid rise in investment spending, which was accompanied by a 2.8 percent rise in shipments of capital goods, prompted some economists to raise forecasts for third-quarter economic growth.
J.P. Morgan lifted its growth forecast for the economy to an annual rate of 1.5 percent from 1.0 percent, while the forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers raised their projection to 2.1 percent from 1.7 percent.
''While we don't yet know the split between how much went to domestic versus foreign buyers, this almost certainly implies another solid quarter for capital equipment spending,'' said Michael Feroli, an economist at J.P. Morgan in New York.
Extreme volatility in financial markets, as politicians in Washington fought over budget policy and Europe struggled to come to grips with its debt crisis, has knocked confidence and raised the risk of a new recession.
But businesses are showing some confidence in the recovery.
Although business spending plans point to continued growth, the report also confirmed a slowing trend in manufacturing.
Overall orders for durable goods -- items meant to last three years or more, like toasters and aircraft -- dipped 0.1 percent after a 4.1 percent jump in July.
The orders, which are volatile from month to month, dropped despite a 23.5 percent rise in orders for civilian aircraft.
Boeing received 127 orders for aircraft, according to the plane maker's Web site, up from 115 in July, with Delta Airlines placing an order for 100 planes.
Excluding transportation, orders also slipped 0.1 percent after rising 0.7 percent in July.

HEADLINE: Signs of a Crash, Not a Recession

BYLINE: By MARTIN HUTCHINSON and ROB COX

 BODY:
The stock market may be ahead of the economy. That suggests a crash is more likely than a second recession.
There are many ways to value equity markets. A simple one is to compare an index to nominal gross domestic product. What ratio counts as high is a matter of debate, but 1995 is a good starting point. The Dow Jones industrial average first climbed above 4,000 in February 1995, which was then almost 50 percent above its 1987 peak. It was 38 percent below the level of December 1996, when Alan Greenspan warned of irrational exuberance.
If the market's value had increased in line with nominal G.D.P. since 1995, the Dow would be 105 percent higher, at 8,200 today. If that sounds low, consider that inflating the Dow's bear market low of 777 points in August 1982 gives it a current level of 3,600. 
Even after its recent decline, the market remains far above these levels. The performance certainly owes nothing to superior economic prospects. Rather, ultralow interest rates together with increased leverage inflated corporate profits over the years.
In addition, modern communications technology has enabled multinationals to profit from low-cost global sourcing of labor. Finally, money-supply expansion, with the St. Louis Fed's broad money-supply measure up 262 percent since 1995 compared with the G.D.P.'s 105 percent increase, has inflated all asset prices.
Interest rates must eventually rise, to prevent inflation and the decapitalization of the United States through low savings and capital outflow. This will raise the cost of capital compared with labor, which would put millions back to work. Normalization need not cause a recession, although it may slow growth in some emerging economies.
But the return to conventional monetary policy would deflate the asset bubble and reduce corporate profits. That's almost bound to cause a major bear market in stocks, with the Dow heading toward 3,600. Investors, both individual and institutional, will squawk, but those newly restored to employment may rejoice to see, in Churchill's words, ''finance less proud and industry more content.''
Education Battle
Spring is in the air in Santiago, but the Chilean winter is still in season. Huge street protests over education are expected to resume on Thursday. As easy as it may seem to lump these with unrest elsewhere, Chile's unrest is different. Fundamentally, it is a test of the economic model that has made the nation Latin America's shining star.
Chile's educational system reflects the country's philosophical preference for private, market-based -- rather than public -- solutions to social and economic problems. After the brutal dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Chile embarked on a free-market path unlike any of its neighbors'.
This has mostly served Chile well. In 1990, per capita G.D.P. stood at $5,000 a year, on a purchasing power parity basis, in line with the rest of Latin America. Today it's close to $20,000, some 50 percent ahead of the region, calculates Banchile, a brokerage firm. In that sense, the education debate is a developed world problem. The question isn't whether Chileans go to school, but rather the quality of instruction they receive.
Yet here the Chilean model hasn't delivered, in ways that could hamper future growth. The country ranks well below the average of members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in reading, math and science scores, despite households shouldering more of the cost of education than in any other nation. Growth in productivity has been declining for years. Anecdotally, employers complain of a work force unsuited to their needs.
It's hard not to see Chile's application of free-market principles to learning as part of the problem. It has created a stratified system where fewer than half of high school students attend public schools because of their low quality. And despite Chile's financial gains in the post-Pinochet era, the government has been slow to add new public universities.
As a result, protesters want to abolish the profit motive entirely from education. For the center-right government of Sebastian Pinera, the country's billionaire president, that would be a repudiation of the laissez faire principles on which Chile's success is based.
But polls show most Chileans favor educational overhaul -- and that Mr. Pinera is the least popular Chilean leader since Pinochet. Put it all together, and the price of thawing the Chilean winter looks evident: sacrificing a wee bit of free-market ideology.

HEADLINE: Think Globally, Deal Locally

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
When it comes to deal-making, a global perspective matters.
As economic engines stall in the United States and Western Europe, private equity firms, corporate suitors and investment bankers are increasingly venturing overseas, touching down in far-flung locales like Uganda, Malaysia and Chile. 
While mergers and acquisitions in such markets are still small compared to those in developed countries, international deal-making is on the rise. The 20 most active countries in the emerging and frontier markets - nations found in Latin America, the Middle East, Asia and sub-Saharan Africa - have notched nearly $377 billion of deals this year, up roughly 3 percent from the same period in 2010, according to Thomson Reuters.
The countries share a common characteristic: a growing economy. China's gross domestic product increased by an estimated 10.3 percent last year, India's by 10.4 percent and Peru's by 8.8 percent. In contrast, the United States economy rose 2.8 percent.
But forging deals in developing regions comes with a unique set of uncertainties, including political, economic and regulatory risks. Wal-Mart Stores pulled out of Moscow late last year, citing an inhospitable climate for acquisitions. Ikea, fed up with corruption in Russia, suspended further investments there in 2009.
In Brazil, rising inflation has spooked investors, contributing to a 26 percent decline this year in the MSCI Brazil index. As the market wobbles, merger activity has declined by nearly a third from 2010.
China, however, has shown no signs of slowing. Deal volume in the country has already passed the $100 billion mark this year, up 15 percent from the same period in 2010. The transactions represent a range of industries, including industrials, finance, technology and retail.
Deal activity also has soared in Indonesia. But with a less developed and robust economy, the acquisitions have been focused on mining, reflecting the country's rich resources. In June, Vallar Investments agreed to pay $2 billion for Bumi Resources Minerals of Indonesia.
''There is this image of a frontier, and you think of someone getting hungry in Africa,'' said Marko Dimitrijevic, founder of Everest Capital, a hedge fund investing abroad. ''The reality is some of the fastest-growing economies in the world are in the frontier area.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

In one of the largest acquisitions, Embotelladoras Arca, which distributes Coca-Cola products, bought its rival Grupo Continental for $2.1 billion. The dynamic is different from other strong deal-making markets in Latin America, where foreign buyers account for much of the activity. Nondomestic companies represent more than 80 percent of the acquirers in Argentina and Peru. In Brazil, it's a roughly 50-50 split.
CASE IN POINT TURKEY: The fast-growing economy is undergoing a housing boom, a trend reflected in the equity markets. Over the last year, the five largest public offerings in the country have been for companies operating in the real estate sector
the Emlak Konut Real Estate Investment Trust, which builds commercial and residential complexes in Turkey, raised $791 million in December.
CASE IN POINT CHINA: Local investment banks and joint ventures with domestic players account for half of the 10 top deal-makers in the country, which has been the most active place for mergers and acquisitions among emerging and frontier markets this year. In one of the country's biggest deals, Nestle moved to buy a majority stake in the candy maker Hsu Fu Chi in July.
CASE IN POINT UGANDA: In March, the Chinese oil giant Cnooc and Total of France agreed to pay $2.9 billion for a two-thirds stake in the country's Tullow Oil -- the largest deal in Uganda since 2000. In all, Cnooc has made seven deals outside its borders over the last year. It agreed to buy the rest of Argentina's Pan American Energy for $7.1 billion through Bridas Corporation, a related oil exploration company in which Cnooc has a 50 percent stake.

HEADLINE: Critical Weekend for N.B.A. Labor Talks

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
After two years of posturing, threats and toilsome labor talks, the N.B.A. has reached its moment of truth, with nothing less than the season at stake.
About two dozen owners and players are expected in Manhattan on Friday for a bargaining meeting that will set the course for the next several months. If they make progress, there will be more talks on Saturday and Sunday. If the weekend ends without at least the framework of a deal, regular-season games will almost certainly be lost.
''There are enormous consequences at play here on the basis of the weekend,'' Commissioner David Stern said Wednesday after a four-hour meeting among the lead negotiators for both sides. 
For the first time, Stern also hinted publicly at a threat that he has, until now, only made privately to the players union: that owners will cancel the season rather than continue under the current system.
Referring to this weekend's talks, Stern said: ''It won't be a question of just starting the season on time; it will be a lot at risk from the absence of progress.'' He said the parties would be working to determine ''whether they can either have a season or not have a season.''
It remains to be seen whether N.B.A. owners would follow through on that threat, or would simply play a delayed, truncated season, as they did in 1998-99. But there is no question that opening night, scheduled for Nov. 1, will soon be in jeopardy.
The league needs three to four weeks to draft an agreement, sign free agents, hold training camps and play a preseason game or two before starting the season. That means a deal needs to be in place sometime next week -- a reality that union officials readily acknowledge.
Last week, the N.B.A. postponed camps indefinitely and canceled 43 preseason games. The players have been locked out since July 1.
''We realize that the calendar, the clock, the watch, whatever you want to say, is running out in terms of starting our regular season on time,'' said Derek Fisher, the players union president.
Fisher said the decision to reserve the whole weekend for negotiations was not a sign of progress, but an admission that time has nearly run out.
''I can't say that common ground is evident, but our desire to try and get there I think is there,'' he said. ''We still have a great deal of issues to work through.''
Despite recent movement on both sides, the parties remain ''very far apart on the economics'' of a deal, according to one person monitoring the talks.
All of the recent progress has come in small-group sessions, with three to four people on each side. Talks sputtered this month when the full negotiating committees were in the room, because of the strident positions taken by individual owners and players. But no deal can be approved without the owners' labor committee and the union's executive board, so everyone will be invited this weekend.
In addition, the union chief Billy Hunter has invited several star players -- including LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Dwyane Wade -- to join the talks, though it is not clear which of them will make it.
The owners on Thursday dropped their insistence on a hard salary cap in favor of a more punitive luxury-tax system. Penalties would range from a dollar-for-dollar tax at the lower end to a four-for-one tax on the highest-spending teams.
The proposal also called for the elimination of some salary-cap exceptions and severe limits on cap exceptions for tax-paying teams. The proposal was deemed too restrictive, although one union official called it ''a move in the right direction.''

HEADLINE: A Warning as Wall Street Moves Into Emerging Markets

BYLINE: By PETER J. HENNING. 
Peter J. Henning, who writes White Collar Watch for DealBook, is a professor at Wayne State University Law School.

 BODY:
Wall Street's headlong rush into emerging markets could collide with the government's push to fight corruption overseas.
The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been increasing their enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in an effort to police bribery by American companies in other countries. Since 2008, the government has brought more than 150 cases under the law, dwarfing the total number filed in the previous 30 years the law was in place.
''We are in a new era of F.C.P.A. enforcement,'' Lanny A. Breuer, the assistant attorney general for the criminal division, said last year, ''and we are here to stay.'' 
Wall Street, which depends on personal connections and business relationships to land deals, could be a natural target of investigators.
Under the corrupt practices law, companies are prohibited from providing bribes or other benefits to a foreign official to ''obtain or retain'' business in a country. It does not matter if the payments are considered routine and expected by local authorities, or if overseas competitors are paying bribes to gain business.
At one time, overseas bribery cases largely involved companies that regularly dealt with foreign ministries, like mineral extraction firms and equipment suppliers that ranged from makers of small parts to intricate defense systems. But the scope has expanded in recent years as the Justice Department and S.E.C. focus on a range of multinational firms.
In 2009, the Justice Department disclosed that it was looking at pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers that supplied government-controlled health care systems. They are continuing to look at how companies pay doctors to consult and market their products. Such arrangements can be legal in the United States, but they may violate the corrupt practices law in foreign countries if the doctor is also a government employee.
The criminal and civil penalties assessed for a violation of the law can be enormous. The German conglomerate Siemens paid $800 million in fines in 2008 and disgorgement for having dispensed nearly $1.4 billion in bribes across the world. Siemens is subject to the law because it operates subsidiaries in the United States and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The American construction company Kellogg, Brown & Root paid $579 million to settle criminal and civil cases in 2009.
With the heightened focus on the law, companies that discover problems are expected to conduct intensive internal inquiries to determine the scope of possible overseas bribes and to report them to the government. To show they are complying, companies will sometimes spend more on the investigation than any fines or civil penalties.
In its inquiry, Siemens spent an estimated $1 billion on lawyers, accountants and other experts. Avon Products, which initiated an internal investigation of possible bribery in China in 2008, has since spent roughly $150 million reviewing its worldwide operations, according to quarterly filings with the S.E.C. A company's disclosure of possible violations of the law also leads to private shareholder class-action claims, raising the potential costs. Avon, for example, is defending against six lawsuits filed in federal and state courts.
While companies usually report bribery to the government on their own, the S.E.C.'s recently opened whistle-blower office provides a new avenue to gather information about improper corporate conduct. The Dodd-Frank Act created a powerful incentive to disclose potential wrongdoing; employees can receive at least 10 percent and as much as 30 percent of any penalties assessed over $1 million.
Potential violations will be a likely source of tips because illicit payments are rarely isolated events, and corporate employees know that certain countries are particularly prone to corruption, so they will look with particular care at expenditures there. A pattern of suspicious payments will in all likelihood come to the surface because public corporations must account for the funds in their regular financial reports. So someone is bound to notice.
Wall Street may be especially vulnerable to overseas corruption questions as it moves into emerging markets. Financial firms, all of which offer essentially the same services, have to woo potential clients, usually relying on personal connections rather than products to land investment banking deals.
Some countries even have a tradition of gift-giving, as part of the usual wining-and-dining process. In China, building ''guanxi,'' or business relationships, involves providing gifts and favors to a network of contacts.
Such conduct can quickly run afoul of the law. The statute applies to payments made to foreign government officials like bureaucrats in a ministry, but it also covers anyone who works for an ''instrumentality'' of a foreign government, like a state-owned utility looking to go private or a sovereign wealth fund seeking advice on new investments. And in many emerging markets, broad swaths of the economy include state-owned or government-controlled entities.
Wall Street's activities are already raising red flags with investigators. In January 2011, the S.E.C. sent letters to a number of firms asking them to preserve documents related to their dealings with sovereign wealth funds. The funds are a prime area for possible corruption because of the close ties between many of their officials and their government sponsors.
With the federal government cracking down on corrupt practices overseas, Wall Street will have to walk a fine line. In emerging markets, financial firms must regularly interact with foreign governments. But they must be vigilant, using rigorous controls and warning systems to comply with the law. Otherwise, the ultimate cost of a deal could be greater than the benefit of the new business.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Beijing Gallery Puts a Focus on Global Warming

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
BEIJING -- When George Mallory made a reconnaissance trip to the gargantuan glaciers at the foot of Mount Everest in Tibet before his ill-fated attempt to climb the mountain, he took photographs and noted the splendor: ''Here is a pure beauty of form, a kind of ultimate harmony,'' he wrote.
Nearly 90 years later another mountaineer and photographer, David Breashears, traveled to the same remote Himalayan landscape and found something that might have made Mallory think again: more than 330 vertical feet of the Rongbuk Glacier had melted in the intervening decades, leaving stubs of ice where grand pinnacles had once been. The photographs that Mr. Breashears brought back as evidence of climate change are at the heart of a multimedia exhibition that opened here last weekend at a prestigious photography gallery in China, Three Shadows.
In the same room as Mr. Breashears's glacier photos from eight recent expeditions, which are projected on a wall in a sweeping 10-foot-by-45-foot panoramic video, are smaller projections of images by Chinese photographers that document what many scientists say is a leading cause of climate change. These were taken in coal mines thousands of miles east of the glaciers and they show miners covered in soot and toiling away in the bowels of the earth. 
The show, titled ''Coal + Ice'' and produced by the Asia Society in New York, is an ambitious attempt to call attention to the long-range impact of humanity's unrelenting thirst for energy. The melting of glaciers on the Tibetan plateau, at the headwaters of Asia's great rivers, threatens the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people downstream. Scientists say climate change is also responsible for the increasing unpredictability and strength of storms around the globe, and that impact is shown here in photographs by the American artist Clifford Ross of towering waves off the coast of Long Island during hurricane season.
''I like this idea of putting ice and fire together,'' said one of the photographers, Yu Haibo, 49, of Shenzhen Economic Daily, whose recent work documents the lives of coal miners. ''We all know that coal-burning causes global warming,'' he said, adding that the approach of showing both cause and effect ''makes the works so much more convincing and delivers the message so much more effectively.''
The show is the first in recent memory to take up the entire space of Three Shadows, which was designed by the outspoken artist Ai Weiwei and opened in 2007 by Rong Rong and Inri, two stalwarts of the Beijing art scene. Viewers first enter a section with prints documenting coal mining, mostly in China. Then come video projections of some of those prints and the huge projection of Mr. Breashears's glacier photographs, which he took across the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges from the exact vantage points that mountaineers and surveyors had shot from decades earlier. Finally there is a room with Mr. Ross's Long Island wave photos and images of Chinese landscapes ravaged by climate change that were shot by other photographers, including Ian Teh and Jonas Bendiksen.
Moving through the gallery, with its 161 works by more than 30 photographers, the viewer goes on a journey from the roots of climate change to its impact.
''Susan and I tried to weave together a narrative in which the photographs speak for themselves,'' said Jeroen de Vries, co-curator of the show with Susan Meiselas, a Magnum photographer. ''We did not want to use them as illustrations of a story.''
China and the United States are the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases, and both nations have been struggling to formulate policies to slow or limit the use of carbon-based energy. Though many of the images in the show depict China's dependence on coal, the curators were careful to include vintage photographs from the West, taken by Robert Capa, Lewis W. Hine and others, that show the historic prevalence of coal mining in the United States and Europe. In classic photos by Hine, boys with blackened faces gaze at the camera while standing outside mines in West Virginia. There are also photos by Bruce Davidson of Welsh miners in 1965, and industrial photos of present-day mining in Italy and Greece.
''We did not want the show to be an underhanded way of blaming China,'' said Orville Schell, the author and journalist who oversaw the show at the Asia Society, ''but simply to have it help call attention to the fact that China, and all of Asia, was going to be profoundly affected over the next century by the effects of climate change on the Tibetan plateau.''
Three Shadows is an independent gallery, and the show was not submitted to Chinese officials for review or approval. The central government has talked openly in recent years about climate change and the dangers of carbon-dioxide emissions, so the subject is not taboo.
''Chinese officials, too, have started to become very concerned that China is being affected by forces beyond them,'' Mr. Schell said.
Many of the photographs of Chinese miners taken in the 1970s are in classic propaganda style. One shows a group of miners inside a tunnel posing around a large portrait of Mao and holding up copies of Mao's Little Red Book. The overall message is that miners, like other elements of the proletariat, are building a new China.
''It's not that different than the heroic ways in which miners are portrayed in the West,'' Ms. Meiselas said. ''Think of all the attention paid to mining accidents.''
Such documentation in China was mostly left to photojournalists at state news organizations. Even in the early 2000s few independent photographers had turned their attention to coal mining, despite its central role in China's economic boom. A notable exception was Song Chao, whose striking portraits of miners set against stark white backdrops, similar in style to Richard Avedon's work, were promoted by Western curators.
Now there are several Chinese artists who seek to capture the conditions of the mines and the way of life of those working in them.
''I first came into contact with the lives of miners in 1995, when I stumbled upon the homes of miners in a rural village in Henan Province,'' said another photographer in the show, Geng Yunsheng, 57. ''They lived in such poverty that regular people couldn't even imagine it. I thought to myself: 'No one should ever live like this. No one.' ''
This collection of coal photographs had an earlier incarnation. Ms. Meiselas organized a show for the Asia Society, called Mined in China, that opened in Houston in 2008. At that time Mr. Breashears, who was a director of the 1998 Imax film ''Everest,'' had begun his project of documenting the melting of glaciers and in the process had unearthed some early photos by explorers that had never been widely seen. Mr. Schell helped pull the two projects together into one show. Along the way, he said, the curators added Mr. Ross's wave photos ''so our story would end up ultimately where all water ends up, namely, the ocean.''
Appropriately enough for a show about a global phenomenon, the organizers hope to bring the exhibition to Berlin, Brazil and New York, among other places. Rong Rong, of Three Shadows, has proposed having it travel it around China.
Last Sunday morning the organizers and several of the photographers walked through the show to reflect quietly on their work a day after the opening, which drew 200 people. Mr. Breashears explained his work to a prominent Chinese journalist, Hu Shuli, in front of the projection of his photographs. The group then moved on to the final room.
There, Mr. Ross gazed at his own black-and-white images of waves crashing down on a beach, and asked, ''What have we done to nature that could have increased its fury?''

A three-day winning streak in the stock market ended Wednesday as investors worried about Europe's ability to contain its debt crisis.
Raw materials companies helped depress the major indexes after prices for commodities like copper and oil plunged.
Traders focused on remarks by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany suggesting that the second bailout package for Greece might have to be renegotiated. Several European leaders want banks to take bigger losses on Greek bonds, but France and the European Central Bank oppose the idea. 
Germany's Parliament is set to vote Thursday on a measure that would give a European rescue fund more powers to fight the region's debt crisis. Finland's Parliament approved the proposal Wednesday, lifting some uncertainty over the crisis, which has dogged financial markets since late July.
''This is a market that has been fluctuating and is thoroughly susceptible to any news, any rumors, any innuendos'' about Europe, said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 179.79 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 11,010.90. It had gained 413 points over the last two days. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 24.32, or 2.1 percent, to 1,151.06. The Nasdaq composite index fell 55.25, or 2.2 percent, to 2,491.58.
Declines were broad. Only 17 of the 500 stocks in the S.& P. 500 rose.
Raw materials stocks were down 4.5 percent. Investors fear that Europe's problems could cause another global recession, weakening demand for basic materials like copper. The price of copper plunged 5.6 percent; crude oil fell 3.8 percent, to $81.21 a barrel..
The mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold declined 7.2 percent, and Cliffs Natural Resources fell 8.4 percent. The coal producer Alpha Natural Resources was down 11 percent, the most of any company in the S.& P.
Orders for durable goods slipped 0.1 percent last month. The modest decline was largely a result of an 8.5 percent drop in orders for automobiles and automobile parts.
Economists looked past the total figure and focused on a 1.1 percent increase in a crucial category that measures business investment plans. That is core capital goods that are not used for defense or transportation.
Shipments of those goods rose 2.8 percent, the fourth consecutive gain in the category. The government looks closely at shipment figures when calculating economic growth.
Economists said the fact that businesses kept expanding and modernizing during the turbulent month suggested many were confident about the future.
''Business capital spending is rising,'' said Christopher Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. ''There is no recession.''
The Dow jumped 126 points minutes after the opening bell on that report. But those gains were gone within an hour, and the selling intensified in the last half-hour of trading.
The decline followed three days of gains. Stocks rose earlier this week on hopes that Europe was moving closer to resolving its debt problems. The Dow soared 272 points on Monday, its fourth-largest increase this year, and 147 points more on Tuesday.
''The market got ahead of itself,'' said Joseph Saluzzi, co-head of stock trading at Themis Trading. Investors ''assumed some kind of deal would be structured, and that was so far away from happening.''
Technology companies fared better than the overall market. The online retailer Amazon.com shot up 2.5 percent after it unveiled the Kindle Fire, a tablet device that will cost $199 and will compete with Apple's hugely successful iPad.
Jabil Circuit, an electronics parts maker, rose 8.4 percent. The company reported strong earnings and a fourth-quarter earnings forecast that was better than analysts had expected.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 2/32 to 101 8/32, pushing its yield to 1.99 percent, down from 1.98 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Preaching to the Heavy-Metal Choir

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
RIO DE JANEIRO -- ''I'm a missionary of God.''
Amid the death growls and mock-opera shrieks resonating from the stage in the so-called City of Rock on the western edge of Rio's sprawl, those weren't exactly the first words I expected to hear from a jovial man in an orange uniform at Rock in Rio, the huge music festival that kicked off here last weekend.
But there was Antonio Candido da Silva, 48, an evangelical Christian employed by Comlurb, Rio de Janeiro's municipal cleaning company, approaching the black-clad heavy-metal fans to disseminate the gospel. Mr. da Silva stayed on message even as the metal band Angra, from Sao Paulo, Brazil, performed with Tarja Turunen, the Finnish singer and former vocalist of the symphonic hard-rock band Nightwish. 
''I'm not for this music, but I'm not against it either,'' Mr. da Silva said in melodious Portuguese as Ms. Turunen broke into an Andrew Lloyd Webber-invoking rendition of ''Phantom of the Opera.'' ''What I do know is that Jesus loves you and every soul who is attending this festival of sin.''
Affably making that point to one festivalgoer after another, Mr. da Silva then disappeared into the crowd while also attending to his day job, picking up the many thousands of discarded Heineken cups and wrappers that once held Bob's hamburgers. He had his work cut out for him.
The seven-day Rock in Rio, among the world's largest music festivals, sold out all its 600,000 tickets in just four days in May. (Responding to demand, organizers added an extra day, for which tickets quickly sold out as well.) Illustrating Brazil's strong economy and the resilience of its currency, the real, fans paid the equivalent of more than $100 each (and four times that amount for black-market tickets) to see acts including Coldplay, Shakira and Stevie Wonder.
I opted to have my first Rock in Rio experience on Sunday, when Metallica, Motorhead and Coheed and Cambria were performing.
I must confess that I haven't listened to much metal since the mid-1980s, when I used to convince my dad to drive me and some friends all the way from rural Ribera, N.M., to the Tingley Coliseum in Albuquerque for Iron Maiden, Def Leppard and Judas Priest concerts. But here in Rio, some nice surprises were waiting.
The most rewarding performance was that of the Brazilian heavy-metal band Sepultura with Les Tambours du Bronx, a French percussion group. They started about an hour late on the relatively small Sunset Stage, but still managed to draw fans away from the bigger World Stage, where the Sao Paulo band Gloria was emitting guttural screams.
When robots go to war against drones on the scorched battlefields of a dying planet, they might do so to the sounds of ''Roots Bloody Roots,'' the Sepultura concert staple as performed in Rio with the unrelenting drumbeat of Les Tambours du Bronx.
Paired with Sepultura's musicians, including Derrick Green, the band's explosive Cleveland-born frontman, the drummers of Les Tambours ferociously pounded their beechwood mallets into metal barrels to produce a spectacle that made Japan's Kodo drummers seem a little quaint.
There was something visceral in the music that night that transcended the festival's corporate trappings. The oil-barrel-smashing Frenchmen seemed to outshine the zip line, roller coaster and shopping district in the City of Rock, a complex to be used again here for the 2016 Olympic Games.
I took the long road back to Rio's central districts, past the evangelists outside holding placards proclaiming, ''For a better world, only Jesus!'' It made sense that Rock in Rio's return to its place of origin after a decade-long absence would feel intimidating to some. SIMON ROMERO

HEADLINE: A Pipeline Divides Along Old Lines: Jobs Versus the Environment

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON and DAN FROSCH; Kirk Johnson reported from Glendive, Mont., and Dan Frosch from Denver.

 BODY:
GLENDIVE, Mont. -- The final days of rancorous public debate over a $7 billion oil pipeline that would snake from Canada through the midsection of the United States have taken on an unexpected urgency this week, as the economic and environmental stakes of the massive project snap into focus at a time of festering anxiety about the nation's future.
The round of public hearings by the State Department -- stretching along the proposed pipeline route from a community college gymnasium here on Tuesday in eastern Montana, through Nebraska and Oklahoma to the Texas Gulf Coast -- is ostensibly meant to focus on a single question: Is the pipe in the national interest?
Addressing that question, though -- especially in the sprawling sweep of six huge states through which the pipeline or its pump stations would run like a spine -- takes in a universe of conflicting, interlocking issues, from short-term economics to global climate, from the discontent of a rural belt losing population to issues of national energy security, joblessness, corporate power and prices at the corner pump. 
Many of the hundreds of people who have attended the meetings -- one on Thursday night in remote Atkinson, Neb., is expected to double the town's population of about 1,200 -- said they felt they were making a kind of last stand.
''We need the jobs, it's that simple,'' said Bret Marshall, 53, a laborer's union worker who said he hoped to get work on the line and drove more than 700 miles across Montana to be here for Tuesday night's hearing.
The State Department concluded last month that the project, Keystone XL, would cause minimal environmental impact if it was operated according to regulations, and the operator, TransCanada, has said the nearly 2,000-mile line would create 20,000 jobs in the United States. Opposition groups around the country, though, said the federal study did not consider the effects of a major spill, while supporters said the nation's economy had continued to worsen, making Keystone XL all the more crucial.
The politics has fractured along unexpected lines. Here in Montana, Gov. Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat, strongly supports the project, while in Nebraska, Gov. Dave Heineman, a Republican, and both United States senators, one a Democrat, the other a Republican, have called for the line to be rerouted because of concerns about the Ogallala Aquifer, a crucial water source beneath the Great Plains.
The public meetings along the pipeline route end this week and come on the heels of a summer's worth of protests against Keystone XL in front of the White House, which led to the arrests of more than 1,000 people.
Groups like the National Wildlife Federation, while conceding that the Obama administration seemed to be leaning toward approval, gathered local organizations to speak out this week -- from conservationists to ranchers -- hoping their impassioned concerns would give Washington pause. The State Department is expected to decide by year's end whether to give the project its final approval, allowing it to proceed.
''The whole policy debate has dramatically increased in stature from a year ago,'' said Anthony Swift, a policy analyst for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which is against the pipeline. ''People would not be protesting, let alone getting arrested, for something that is a foregone conclusion.''
In Nebraska, controversy over Keystone XL has even managed to envelop the state's beloved college football team.
This month the University of Nebraska's athletic director, Tom Osborne, who is a former Republican congressman, pulled TransCanada's sponsorship of a video that ran on big screens during two home games. The video paid homage to a former Cornhusker offensive line known as ''the Pipeline,'' and featured TransCanada's logo.
Mr. Osborne said the athletic department took no position on Keystone XL, but sought to avoid political advertisements. ''Over the last two or three months, the pipeline issue has been increasingly politicized,'' he said in a statement.
One of the main contentions expressed by Keystone XL's opponents this week is that a pipeline of this size and scope is simply too risky to operate.
Keystone XL will carry a coarse mixture that includes bitumen drawn from the oil sands of Alberta. Environmental groups have long contended that oil sands crude is more corrosive to pipelines and more difficult to clean when spilled. Oil sands, harder to extract and refine, they say, will also put more carbon in the air, accelerating climate change.
A TransCanada spokesman, Terry Cunha, pointed out that the company had agreed to adhere to 57 special conditions outlined in the State Department study to keep the pipeline especially secure. Mr. Cunha said that Keystone XL would be built with thicker material in especially sensitive regions -- called ''high-consequence areas'' in federal regulations -- and monitored with thousands of sensors, making it, he said, the safest pipeline in North America.
''We believe it is important that the decision on this presidential permit is based on facts and not on the mistruths that many of these groups continue to share,'' Mr. Cunha said.
But some pipeline safety experts and environmentalists said that lax regulations and a raft of recent oil spills had raised concerns that the tiny federal agency overseeing the nation's network of pipelines, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, may be unable to handle a project of Keystone's magnitude.
And people in rural areas like eastern Montana say they also know that the dry and mostly empty ranchlands where they live are not, and never have been, places of high consequence.
''Nobody wants to be told they're of low consequence,'' said Tim Hess, 65, a wheat farmer and cattle rancher born and raised here in Montana who would have about 1.5 miles of pipe cross his land but still did not know how much he would be paid for it.
Keystone XL's opponents also point to a Enbridge Energy spill of 843,000 gallons of oil sands crude near Marshall, Mich., as an example of what can go wrong.
A little over a year after the spill, a 35-mile stretch of the Kalamazoo River remains closed. And just this week, Enbridge stated in federal filings that the cost associated with the spill, originally estimated at $585 million, might now increase by 20 percent.
Pipeline supporters at the public hearings, though, have hammered two main points over and over: that America desperately needs jobs, and that the oil would be coming from a friendly nation. The Keystone pipeline would also allow oil from new fields in the Dakotas, Montana and elsewhere to be shipped south to Texas refineries, boosting the local economic appeal.
''All I ask is that you treat the 50,000 people in these six counties with respect and dignity,'' Glendive's mayor, Jerry Jimison, said Tuesday in comments that supported the pipeline but also hinted at a veiled threat. ''That will affect the long-term relationship into the future,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Emerging Markets Offer Banks Profits, but Headaches Too

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG and BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Wall Street loves to crow about its overseas conquests.
Vikram S. Pandit, the head of Citigroup, boldly promised in 2009 that ''we will be the single largest emerging markets financial services company.'' Goldman Sachs's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, said at a conference last year that one of his firm's big goals was ''to be Goldman Sachs in more places.''
But there's a quiet truth to success in those risky markets: the path to profits is often filled with mistakes and setbacks. 
''A lot of big banks are looking to developing markets, but historically it's tended to be a volatile move,'' said James Sinegal, a bank analyst at the research firm Morningstar. ''It might not be as easy as they expect.''
Banks like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are chasing the potential payoff abroad. The economies of countries like China, India and Brazil are growing faster than that of the United States. Such places also represent an untapped client base, with a growing middle class and a large number of wealthy individuals.
As profits wane on the home front, Wall Street firms are increasingly dependent on the emerging markets to bolster their bottom lines. Citicorp, a division of Citigroup, draws about half of its revenue from emerging countries, up from roughly 25 percent in 2005. International markets account for 47 percent of Goldman's profits. Morgan Stanley generated nearly a third of its net revenue from outside the Americas.
''With the United States slowing down, it is not surprising that institutions are looking in the emerging markets,'' said Hamid Biglari, a Citicorp vice chairman and chief of emerging markets.
But the perils can be plentiful, with economic, political and regulatory challenges. Foreign regulators have scolded banks, fined them and even banned their activities in various countries. Citigroup twice ran into problems with Japanese authorities. In turn, Wall Street says it has cleaned house at overseas offices, taken greater control of foreign ventures and tapped local bankers to lead new projects.
Local knowledge is especially critical, as firms try to navigate the regulatory and political environment that is crucial to a bank's business.
Earlier this year, Citigroup found itself in hot water with Indonesian regulators. After an investigation into suspected embezzlement by an employee and the death of a client after meetings with the bank's outside debt collectors, the country's central bank imposed sanctions on Citigroup, including a one-year ban on opening new branches.
In June, the bank removed its top country officer, replacing him with a native Indonesian, Tigor M. Siahaan, a seasoned banker experienced in dealing with local regulators and government officials. Now, the bank is tweaking its internal controls, bringing its debt collecting in-house and regularly rotating back-office personnel. The bank said it was also working closely with Indonesian authorities.
''How to behave responsibly in these markets comes with experience,'' Mr. Biglari said. ''You have to figure out how to work with the cultural norms.''
Financial firms have also realized that they need to commit to a market, because it can take years if not decades to build up local relationships and understand the country's customs.
While Goldman says on its Web site that it has had a presence in Russia since 1998, the firm has had its troubles in the country. Not long after opening in Russia, Goldman downsized its operations, concerned about the financial crisis that prompted the government to devalue the ruble. It closed the Moscow office and reassigned staff members.
Christopher Barter, co-chief executive for Goldman's Russia business, said the investment bank should not have left the country. ''We missed out on years of a footprint there,'' he said. ''When you go into a country, you have to maintain your commitment.''
It took years to build up the business in Russia again. Goldman reopened the Moscow location in 2001, but it didn't fully ramp up there until 2006, when it obtained a brokerage license. Today, the firm has 140 employees in Russia, up from 30 people five years ago.
The company has established stronger ties in the country since it has returned. In 2008, Goldman held a board meeting in Russia, a nod to its re-emergence there. Michael Sherwood, vice chairman at Goldman Sachs, now visits Russia several times a year. And Mr. Blankfein, along with other Wall Street chiefs like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, has joined a committee set up by the Russian government to help bring more foreign money to the country.
Firms have also realized they need more management oversight of overseas investments.
Morgan Stanley was one of the first investment banks to establish a joint venture in China. In 1995, it teamed up with China Construction Bank to form the China International Capital Corporation. But the Wall Street bank was a passive investor, owning just one-third of the business, the limit for foreign securities firms under Chinese rules. It also ceded management control to its partners. In 2010, Morgan Stanley sold the stake to a group of private equity firms.
Since then, Morgan Stanley has forged a new relationship with Huaxin Securities. While it still owns a one-third stake in the venture, called Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities, it has seats on the firm's board and plays a role in the day-to-day management of the firm. A Morgan Stanley managing director, Yang Kai, is the chief executive of the company.
While foreign business is hardly a guaranteed win, financial firms are willing to take the risks. It's one of the industry's few options as banks deal with costly new regulations, sluggish economic growth in their home markets and a volatile market - all of which are weighing on profits.
''These guys are hurting and it gets worse by the day,'' said Michael J. Driscoll, a professor at Adelphi University's business school and former senior trader at Bear Stearns. ''You can only squeeze so much till you go looking elsewhere for a return.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Europe's Bailout Fund Advances in Finland

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and STEPHEN CASTLE; Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt and Stephen Castle from Brussels. Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Europe took another step Wednesday toward approval of a broader bailout fund for overly indebted countries after Finland's Parliament agreed to contribute its share despite an unresolved dispute over its demand for collateral from Greece.
The vote, which was 103 to 66, with 30 legislators absent, still leaves seven countries that have not yet ratified the bailout fund. Even after it is approved, the fund, despite expanded resources and power, is considered much too small to fend off further market attacks on Greece and other indebted countries. 
The laborious approval process, which can be held up by objections from any one of the 17 countries in the euro zone, has highlighted deep flaws in the bloc's decision-making. Every initiative must traverse an obstacle course, and each hurdle can jostle financial markets anew.
On Wednesday, the top stock market indexes in Europe fell after three consecutive sessions of gains.
Though Finland can now be checked off the list, the next holdout may prove to be Slovakia, where there was talk that a vote on the bailout fund might be delayed until late October, past the unofficial midmonth deadline set by Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs. Many Slovakians resent having to help bail out Greece, which, despite its problems, is wealthier.
Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, warned Wednesday that countries in the euro zone must move toward greater unity for the alliance to survive.
''We are today faced with the greatest challenge our union has known in all its history,'' Mr. Barroso said in his annual State of the Union address at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. ''If we don't move forward with more integration, we will suffer more fragmentation. This will be a baptism of fire for a whole generation.''
Leaders in Germany and elsewhere played down speculation that they were working on bolder responses to the crisis, like a mechanism that would multiply the borrowing power of the bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility. Officials said they were preoccupied with gaining parliamentary approval for existing measures.
But the euro zone countries face intense pressure from the United States, China and other countries to more forcefully address the sovereign debt problem before the meeting of the Group of 20 leading economies that begins Nov. 3 in Cannes, France.
''The euro area has been given an ultimatum to put its crisis once and for all behind its back over the coming six weeks,'' Jacques Cailloux, chief European economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, wrote in a note to clients.
In an initial effort to impose more spending discipline on euro zone members and to prevent future crises, members of the European Parliament voted Wednesday in favor of rules that would impose fines on countries that broke budget and deficit rules.
Members of the euro zone are supposed to hold their budget deficits below 3 percent of gross domestic product, and total debt below 60 percent of G.D.P., but few do.
Under the new rules, countries that exceed those limits will be pressed to make a cash deposit -- in an account that pays no interest -- equal to 0.2 percent of G.D.P. If they still fail to rein in spending, they will forfeit the deposit.
While finance ministers would still need to agree to punish countries, the voting system has been adjusted to make it significantly more difficult to block sanctions.
In addition, national budget plans will come under greater scrutiny, and there will be an alert system to try to detect looming problems like the housing bubbles that helped create the debt crises in Spain and Ireland.
The German Parliament is scheduled to vote Thursday on the bailout fund, in what is seen as a crucial test for Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Austria is scheduled to vote Friday. Still to vote are Cyprus, Estonia, Malta, the Netherlands and Slovakia.
There were indications that Slovakia's Parliament might not vote until Oct. 25, although Beata Skyvova, a spokeswoman for the Slovak Parliament, said that one party in the governing coalition was pressing for an earlier vote and that more negotiations would take place before a final date was decided.
That would be about three months after euro zone representatives agreed to give the rescue fund more money and power. The expanded fund will be able to lend up to 440 billion euros, or about $600 billion, and issue guarantees for 780 billion euros.
Mr. Cailloux said that the fund needed about 2 trillion euros to be effective.
Finland continues to demand that it receive collateral from Greece in return for aid to that country. But Finnish leaders argued that approval for the rescue fund, which will also provide aid to Ireland, Portugal and other countries, was a separate issue.
That reasoning cleared the way for the Finnish Parliament to approve the bill Wednesday.
Finland is still negotiating with its European partners on the collateral issue, and officials in Helsinki have expressed optimism that a solution will be found to address Finnish sensibilities without undermining the aid package.
Meanwhile, Greece moved closer to receiving the next installment of aid it needs to avoid bankruptcy.
Officials from the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank were traveling to Athens to assess whether to recommend release of the aid, said Amadeu Altafaj Tardio, a European Commission spokesman.
During his speech to the European Parliament, Mr. Barroso said that changes needed to secure the euro's future might require reopening the Union's governing treaty. He reiterated that Greece would stay in the euro zone.
Mr. Barroso confirmed that the European Commission, the union's executive branch, would speed up a feasibility study on issuing euro bonds -- common debt that would be guaranteed by all members of the euro zone. He gave his clearest support to the idea yet.
''Once the euro area is fully equipped with the instruments necessary to ensure both integration and discipline, the issuance of joint debt will be seen as a natural and advantageous step for all,'' he said.
''We need to complete our monetary union with an economic union,'' Mr. Barroso argued. ''It is an illusion to think we could have a single currency and a single market with national economic approaches.''
Mr. Barroso also announced a proposal for a European tax on financial transactions, a move that Germany and France support strongly but that countries like Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden say they would back only if it were agreed to at a global level. That is unlikely, given opposition from the United States.

HEADLINE: Israelis Happy at Home But Glum About Peace

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- With the start of the Jewish New Year at sunset on Wednesday, a traditional time for stock-taking in Israel, the public mood seemed paradoxical: a growing disillusionment with the prospect of Middle East peace yet a marked sense of satisfaction with life here.
That gap, reflected and discussed in news media commentaries, was evident in a survey of Israeli Jews published on Wednesday in the newspaper Yediot Aharonot. Two-thirds of the respondents said there was no chance -- ever -- of achieving peace with the Palestinians. But asked if Israel was a good place to live, 88 percent said yes.
In an article accompanying the poll results, the survey's director, Mina Zemach of the Dahaf Institute, was quoted as saying that she could not remember a time when skepticism about the possibility of peace ran so high. 
She also noted that in response to another question, 45 percent said they feared for the survival of Israel as a Jewish state. As Sima Kadmon, a political columnist at the newspaper, wrote, ''In other words, nearly half of the Jewish public lives with a feeling of existential threat, doesn't believe there will ever be peace, and despite that, is feeling good.'' The poll, in which 500 adults were surveyed by telephone, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.
The contradiction may partly reflect a momentary sense of relief. For months Israelis were told that September would be catastrophic: the Palestinians would achieve statehood recognition at the United Nations, leaving Israel isolated and under tremendous international and legal pressure. Some spoke of a ''diplomatic tsunami,'' others of a ''train wreck.''
Instead, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned from New York on Monday to a country that believed that it had dodged a bullet. The Palestinians did request full United Nations membership through the 15-member Security Council. But not only has the United States promised to veto the bid, Israeli officials also say that the Palestinians may not have the nine votes needed to even prompt such a move.
''It turns out that the tsunami predicted to hit Israel in the month of September went the way of so many other predictions that have been made about the Middle East in recent years,'' Moshe Arens, a former defense minister who is on the right of Mr. Netanyahu's Likud party, wrote in the newspaper Haaretz.
Moreover, the sense over the past two years that President Obama was growing angry with Israel and steering American policy away from its interests subsided last week. The parts of Mr. Obama's United Nations speech about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict could have been written by any official here. It said nothing about Israeli settlements, the 1967 lines, occupation or Palestinian suffering, focusing instead on Israel's defense needs.
Avigdor Lieberman, the hawkish foreign minister, said afterward that he would be happy to sign Mr. Obama's speech ''with both hands.''
A Jerusalem Post online poll published on Wednesday showed the turnaround in the public mood about the president. The survey found that 54 percent of Israelis considered Mr. Obama to be pro-Israel compared with 19 percent who said he was pro-Palestinian. While the results could not be directly compared with earlier surveys because the poll was conducted online and was not a telephone survey, the reversal was unmistakable. Four months ago, when The Post asked a similar question in a telephone survey, 12 percent of Israelis considered Mr. Obama to be pro-Israel and 40 percent saw him as pro-Palestinian.
The fact that Mr. Obama's re-election prospects seem threatened by Republican candidates whose views of the conflict mirror those of the governing Likud party is also much discussed.
Mr. Netanyahu's aides suggested to reporters that the isolation that Israel was said to be suffering after the attack on its Cairo embassy and Turkey's expulsion of its ambassador was less than met the eye.
They noted that the statement issued last week by the so-called quartet -- the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations -- was a far closer reflection of Israeli goals than of Palestinian desires. It called on the two sides to resume negotiations without preconditions, which is Israel's official policy. The Palestinians say that such talks are pointless without a freeze in Israeli settlements on the land captured in the 1967 war.
The Palestinian leadership is scheduled to meet in the coming days and is expected to reject the quartet's statement and restate its demand for an end to settlement construction before talks can resume. A recent survey by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research shows that the Palestinian public also has little faith in negotiations.
Both Israelis and Palestinians seem to believe that time is on their side.
The Israeli left continues to warn that such a belief is a dangerous illusion. Haaretz, which serves as a leftist forum, published an editorial with the headline ''This new year, the clouds are gathering.''
''Curled up in our justice and our justifications,'' it said, ''isolated as we never were before, shedding one ally after another, devoid of any hope and vision aside from ensuring the continued growth of West Bank settlements, the 'state of the Jews' under the leadership of Netanyahu and Avigdor Lieberman is striding toward a new year that will also not be simple from an objective standpoint: The global economic crisis is not letting up, the Iranian nuclear threat continues to hover over us, the 'Arab Spring of Nations' is darkening into a radical Islamist storm, and a hostile Palestinian state is being born, without peace, to the sound of the world's applause.''
The editorial said the one bright spot was the social and economic protests in Israel over the summer. What began as concern over high prices could turn into a revival of the political left, starting with social issues, the Haaretz editorial argued.
Polling data certainly suggest that the protests have revived the prospects of the much diminished Labor Party, especially under its new leader, Shelly Yachimovich, a former journalist and crusader for economic and social equality.
Several recent polls suggest that if elections were held today Labor would gain the most votes after Likud, and that issues of socioeconomic equality would edge out security concerns.
In Yediot, the commentator Raanan Shaked summed up the feelings of many Israelis after the protests, in which ordinary voices took on a new significance and the issues of war and peace were largely ignored.
''Upon the new year's arrival,'' he wrote, ''let's wish for the pie to be divided into shares that are a little more equal, a little more humane, and mostly, for a change, a little more satisfying.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Mortgage-Aid Program Is Shutting Down, With Up to $500 Million Unspent

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
In summer 2010, Congress set aside $1 billion for a program intended to bail out people in danger of losing their homes to foreclosure. It was estimated that the program, administered by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, would help as many as 30,000 households.
But the program is now ending after achieving lackluster results and stirring widespread recrimination. 
Fewer than 15,000 households are expected to receive help despite enormous demand, and perhaps half of the money will go unspent.
The department attributed the program's performance to the way it was set up by Congress. But Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, an author of the legislation, said the program's failings were a result of poor administration and the department's late start in rolling it out.
''They dragged and dragged their feet,'' Mr. Frank said in an interview. ''I believe it was not one of their priorities.''
The program, called the Emergency Homeowners' Loan Program, or EHLP, was signed into law in July 2010 as part of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. It offered people who were unemployed or underemployed up to $50,000 in zero-interest loans to pay their mortgage debts. HUD has until Friday to mete out the funds or lose the balance.
Yet the department did not begin the program until this June, and set an original application cutoff date of late July. Across the country, nonprofit housing groups and mortgage counselors who had been chosen to work with applicants rushed to meet the deadline, which ended up being extended several times.
The counselors also found the eligibility criteria complicated and overly restrictive.
Under the stipulations, applicants had to be at least 90 days behind on their mortgage payments. They also had to be earning at least 15 percent less than their 2009 income due to unemployment, underemployment or serious illness. The program subsidized mortgage payments for up to two years. But if the cost of the subsidies and the repayment of a homeowner's mortgage debt exceeded $50,000, the applicant would be ineligible.
The combination of these rules, housing counselors said, disqualified a large number of people who had gone through their savings and fallen behind on mortgage payments. Nor have all of the applicants who met the qualifications been approved for the loan.
And with the Friday deadline, the clock is ticking.
At the Twin Cities Community Development Corporation of Fitchburg and Leominster, Mass., 31 of the 250 applicants who sought help met the program's requirements, and by Wednesday, six had been approved.
The National Community Reinvestment Coalition, in Washington, took applications from 506 people. Of those, 49 met the eligibility guidelines, and 26 had been approved as of Wednesday.
Operation Hope, a nonprofit based in California, fielded queries from 1,200 people seeking help; of those, 25 were found to be qualified, and by Wednesday, five had been approved.
''It's been a very discouraging process,'' said Laurel Miller, director of homeownership at the Twin Cities agency. ''It was almost like in order to qualify for this, it had to be the perfect storm.''
In states where housing costs are high, like New York, bitterness about the program was compounded by the fact that many homeowners were deeper in arrears than the program allowed. Of the 1,000 people who sought help through the nonprofit Neighborhood Housing Services of New York City, only 74 qualified.
''It's been a frustrating program,'' said Bernell K. Grier, chief executive of the organization. ''We wish we could have done more.''
HUD officials cited many reasons for the program's slow rollout, saying the agency had to build the infrastructure to do direct lending, hire organizations to put the program into effect and create regulations for its operation.
Housing officials also said that nearly all of the eligibility guidelines came from a 1975 act through which the new money had been appropriated, and that they had interpreted the guidelines accordingly, leading to restrictions like the one involving the 15 percent income drop.
''No one could have anticipated how difficult the statutory requirements would make it to qualify homeowners, causing us to overestimate the number of people who could meet the eligibility criteria,'' said Todd M. Richardson, director of the emergency loan program.
Yet Representative Frank said he never heard the agency complain about the statue guidelines' being overly stringent. ''They're just trying to cover up their embarrassment,'' he said.
John Dodds, director of the Philadelphia Unemployment Project, which also processed applications, said the agency could have been nimbler, modeling its program on an existing one rather than creating its own and eliminating stringent requirements, when it became clear that hundreds of millions of dollars would not be spent.
Housing counselors had also been pushing to secure money for people who met the program's qualifications yet might not be approved by Friday. Last week, Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, introduced a bill to extend the deadline, but it was not voted on.

HEADLINE: G.M. Contract Approved, With Bonus for Workers

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- A new four-year contract between General Motors and the United Automobile Workers union will increase the company's labor costs by only 1 percent annually and protect its strong balance sheet, G.M. executives told analysts Wednesday.
G.M. said the contract, ratified earlier Wednesday by the U.A.W., will have a minimal impact on profitability while allowing workers to share in the company's financial success. It projected that added expenses would be $175 million this year and $20 million in each of the following two years for a total of $215 million. G.M. spent $5 billion on hourly labor in 2010, less than one-third of its costs in 2005. 
''It is a win-win for both membership and the company,'' G.M.'s chief executive, Daniel F. Akerson, said during a conference call with analysts and reporters. ''This new agreement is further evidence that this is really a new G.M.''
Mr. Akerson spoke shortly after the union said 65 percent of G.M. production workers and 63 percent of skilled-trades workers who had voted on the contract approved the deal, the first new labor agreement with one of the Detroit carmakers since the government's $82 billion auto industry bailout in 2009.
The contract calls for G.M. to create 6,400 jobs at American plants, move some work to the United States from Mexico and raise its entry-level pay scale.
''In these uncertain economic times, we were able to win an agreement with G.M. that guarantees good American jobs at a good American company,'' Joe Ashton, the union vice president in charge of negotiations with G.M., said in a statement. ''When G.M. was down, our members sacrificed and saved G.M. Now that G.M. is posting strong profits, our members, as a result of this agreement, are going to share in the company's success.''
As a result, the 48,500 G.M. workers covered by the contract will each receive bonuses of $5,000 later this fall. They also will get $1,000 annual bonuses starting in 2013 and larger profit-sharing checks than the old contract provided.
The deal offers a retirement incentive of $75,000 to skilled-trade workers and $10,000 to other workers. G.M.'s chief financial officer, Daniel Ammann, said the company expects about 10 percent of its 10,000 skilled-trade workers to accept the offer and retire. He said those workers would not be replaced, saving the company $30 million after accounting for the cost of the buyout payments.
G.M. said the bonuses and entry-level wage increase will cost $585 million through 2013. But it expects to save $340 million by eliminating a program that provided free legal services to workers.
''Now we believe we have the tools in place that will further improve our competitiveness going forward, which is important both for the U.A.W. and for G.M.,'' Mr. Ammann said.
Among the workers who voted, a majority supported the deal at nearly all G.M. plants across the United States. The contract, which was reached Sept. 16, was rejected by only two U.A.W. chapters: Local 602, which represents 3,400 workers who build crossover vehicles near Lansing, Mich., and Local 23, which represents a small number of workers at a metal-stamping plant in Indianapolis that is shutting down this year.
At several large plants, fewer than 40 percent of eligible workers made the effort to vote, based on results posted online, evidence of considerable apathy toward the agreement. Most U.A.W. locals publicly report only the percentage who favored the deal and not actual vote totals, so the overall turnout was not clear.
Meanwhile, the union is closing in on a tentative agreement with Ford, although negotiations have not advanced to the long, late-night sessions that usually occur in the final days.
On Wednesday, some U.A.W. and Ford committees assigned to focus on certain portions of the contract finalized new contract language, according to a recorded message the union made available through a telephone hot line. In the message, Tony Vultaggio, the president of U.A.W. Local 228 in Sterling Heights, Mich., played down reports that a deal could be reached Thursday.
On Monday, the hot line message said the union was optimistic that it would have ''good news for our membership by the end of the week.''
U.A.W. President Bob King has been involved in this week's sessions, which have been adjourning in the early evening.
Union negotiators want the Ford contract to follow the same framework as the G.M. deal, but they are seeking a more lucrative deal from Ford, which did not go through bankruptcy. The negotiators have told organizers at Ford plants to prepare for the possibility of a strike, even though there were no signs that a labor stoppage would occur.
G.M. and Chrysler workers gave up their right to strike through 2015 as part of those companies' 2009 bankruptcies.
Talks with Chrysler were continuing but were not expected to pick up until after the union had a deal with Ford. The U.A.W.'s contract with Chrysler has been extended through Oct. 19.

HEADLINE: Obama Urges Students to Set Their Sights on College

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama welcomed the nation's students back to school on Wednesday with a simple appeal: Keep going to school.
''I want all of you to set a goal to continue your education after you graduate,'' Mr. Obama said to students at Benjamin Banneker Academic High School in Washington. ''And if that means college for you, just getting into college isn't enough. You also have to graduate. 
''Our country used to have the world's highest proportion of young people with a college degree,'' the president said. ''We now rank 16th. I don't like being 16th; I like being No. 1.''
It was the second day in a row that Mr. Obama had spoken at a school; on Tuesday, he campaigned for passage of his jobs bill at Abraham Lincoln High School in Denver. The legislation would earmark $25 billion to repair and renovate up to 35,000 public schools across the country.
But while that speech was a partisan appeal, pitched to voters in the crucial swing state of Colorado, Wednesday's talk was more ecumenical, focusing on values like perseverance and hard work. Mr. Obama has delivered a back-to-school speech each year since becoming president.
Benjamin Banneker High, named for a colonial-era African-American mathematician, astronomer and surveyor, is one of Washington's elite public schools, with a rigorous curriculum based on college prep and International Baccalaureate courses.
Mr. Obama, recalling his own less-than-stellar grade school days, described an ethics class he took in eighth grade, when he was more interested in basketball than studying. The questions raised -- ''What matters in life?'' ''What does it mean to treat people with respect and dignity?'' ''What does it mean to live in a diverse nation?'' -- are ones that still preoccupy him, he said.
Paying tribute to parents, Mr. Obama said, ''Don't give them a hard time when they ask you to turn off the video games, turn off the TV and do some homework.'' He said he does that with his own daughters, Malia and Sasha.
Mr. Obama acknowledged that growing up is more complicated in the digital age. ''Issues that used to stay confined to hallways or locker rooms now find their way onto Facebook and Twitter,'' he said, adding that he also understood that the economy was putting strains on families, with adolescents having to baby-sit for siblings while their parents work extra shifts.

HEADLINE: The Not-So-Green Mountains

BYLINE: By STEVE E. WRIGHT. 
Steve E. Wright, an aquatic biologist, is a former commissioner of the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department.

 BODY:
Craftsbury, Vt.BULLDOZERS arrived a couple of weeks ago at the base of the nearby Lowell Mountains and began clawing their way through the forest to the ridgeline, where Green Mountain Power plans to erect 21 wind turbines, each rising to 459 feet from the ground to the tip of the blades.
This desecration, in the name of ''green'' energy, is taking place in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom on one of the largest tracts of private wild land in the state. Here and in other places -- in Maine and off Cape Cod, for instance -- the allure of wind power threatens to destroy environmentally sensitive landscapes. 
Erecting those turbines along more than three miles of ridgeline requires building roads -- with segments of the ridgeline road itself nearly half as wide as one of Vermont's interstate highways -- in places where the travel lanes are now made by bear, moose, bobcat and deer.
It requires changing the profile of the ridgeline to provide access to cranes and service vehicles. This is being accomplished with approximately 700,000 pounds of explosives that will reduce parts of the mountaintops to rubble that will be used to build the access roads.
It also requires the clear-cutting on steep slopes of 134 acres of healthy forest, now ablaze in autumn colors. Studies have shown that clear-cutting can lead to an increase in erosion to high-quality headwater streams, robbing them of life and fouling the water for downstream residents, wild and human.
The electricity generated by this project will not appreciably reduce Vermont's greenhouse gas emissions. Only 4 percent of those emissions now result from electricity generation. (Nearly half come from cars and trucks, and another third from the burning of heating oil.)
Wind doesn't blow all the time, or at an optimum speed, so the actual output of the turbines -- the ''capacity factor'' -- is closer to about one-third of the rated capacity of 63 megawatts. At best, this project will produce enough electricity to power about 24,000 homes per year, according to the utility.
Still, wind does blow across Vermont's ridgelines. The Vermont Public Interest Research Group, for instance, has suggested that wind power could provide as much as 25 percent of the state's electricity needs, which would require turbines on 29 miles of ridgeline. Other wind advocates, notably David Blittersdorf, the chief executive of a wind and solar power company in Williston, Vt., has urged that wind turbines be placed along 200 miles of ridgeline in the state.
But it is those same Green Mountain ridgelines that attracted nearly 14 million visitors to Vermont in 2009, generating $1.4 billion in tourism spending. The mountains are integral to our identity as the Green Mountain State, and provide us with clean air and water and healthy wildlife populations.
Vermont's proud history of leadership in developing innovative, effective environmental protection is being tossed aside. This project will set an ominous precedent by ripping apart a healthy, intact ecosystem in the guise of doing something about climate change. In return, Green Mountain Power will receive $44 million in federal production tax credits over 10 years.
Ironically, most of the state's environmental groups have not taken a stand on this ecologically disastrous project. Apparently, they are unwilling to stand in the way of ''green'' energy development, no matter how much destruction it wreaks upon Vermont's core asset: the landscape that has made us who we are.
The pursuit of large-scale, ridgeline wind power in Vermont represents a terrible error of vision and planning and a misunderstanding of what a responsible society must do to slow the warming of our planet. It also represents a profound failure to understand the value of our landscape to our souls and our economic future in Vermont.

HEADLINE: States Putting Hopes in 'Bottoms Up' to Help the Bottom Line

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON; Robbie Brown contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- Drink up, America. The government needs the money.
With cities across the country facing their fifth straight year of declining revenues and states cutting services and laying off workers, raising money from people who enjoy a cocktail is becoming an increasingly attractive option.
Since the recession started in earnest in 2008, dozens of states and cities have tinkered with laws that regulate alcohol sales as a way to build up their budgets.
Twelve states have raised taxes on alcohol or changed alcohol laws to increase revenue, including Maryland, which in July pushed the sales tax on alcohol to 9 percent, from 6 percent -- the first such increase in 38 years and one that is expected to bring in $85 million a year.
In November, voters in Atlanta and elsewhere in Georgia will decide whether to repeal colonial-era laws that ban alcohol sales on Sunday. 
People touring the Jack Daniel's distillery in Lynchburg, Tenn., may finally be able to have a sip now that the state has loosened laws to allow tastings as part of a package of changes intended to attract more alcohol-related business to the state.
Even universities are hoping alcohol will raise revenue. Fans of the Louisiana State University Tigers will soon be drinking Bandit Blonde, a beer whose name refers to a famous 1950s football defense. Made by a local brewery under a special licensing agreement, it puts money into the university coffers with every swig.
The beer will be sold on tap and in gold-and-purple cans at bars, restaurants and stores around Louisiana. The university will get royalties of between 6 and 8 percent, said Charles D'Agostino, executive director of the university's Louisiana Business and Technology Center.
Although some drinkers and government budget writers might like the changes, not everyone is happy.
''Lawmakers are taking a very short-sided view,'' said David Jernigan, director of the Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ''What they gain in short-term tax revenue they are losing in long-term police costs, emergency room costs and work-force readiness costs in terms of the Monday morning effect.''
Like many public health officials, Mr. Jernigan does not support government efforts that increase the availability of alcohol, but he does support raising sales tax as a way to make people drink less.
Taxes do not always slow things down at happy hour, however. Because there is not a good substitute for alcohol, state officials are banking on the fact that people will simply pay more or drink cheaper brands.
''These are kind of antitax times, so it's tough to raise any kind of tax, but this is one they might have more success with,'' said Mark Stehr, an associate professor of economics at Drexel University in Philadelphia who has studied the effects of taxes and other regulations on cigarettes and alcohol.
''Legislators can say it's to protect health and reduce drunk driving, and that's what can draw support, but the real motivation is revenue,'' he said.
The nation's states and local governments take in $17 billion year from alcohol taxes. And although the number has been rising steadily, the recession has slowed that growth, said David Ozgo, chief economist at the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States.
Still, states keep adding them. Illinois raised alcohol taxes in 2009 specifically for roads, schools and other projects, adding about $100 million a year to the capital fund. In 2010, Washington State installed a temporary excise tax on certain beers that adds about 28 cents a six-pack. In three years, it should bring in about $180 million.
Although a study from the distilled spirits council predicts that Sunday sales in Georgia could generate as much as $4.8 million, analysts are less certain that allowing them will bring in much new money because drinkers are likely simply to shift the days they buy alcohol.
Georgia is one of only three states left (Connecticut and Indiana are the others) that prohibit selling any kind of alcohol on Sunday. Although a thirsty patron could buy a drink at a restaurant or a ballgame in some communities, stores cannot sell it.
The roots of the ban are religious, and the law was defended for years by Gov. Sonny Perdue, who vowed to veto any legislation that tried to change it. When Gov. Nathan Deal took office this year, lawmakers overrode opposition by religious groups and some rural legislators and wrote a law allowing local governments to put the question of Sunday sales to a vote.
On Nov. 8, nearly 100 Georgia cities and counties will hold referendums on the issue. For Atlanta, expanding liquor laws is about economic stimulation and modernity, said Kwanza Hall, a member of the City Council who is also trying to get the hours one can pour drinks extended to 4 a.m.
''It's kind of neat to get with the program down here,'' he said.
In smaller communities like Snellville, a town of about 20,000 people in a stretch of busy suburbs outside of Atlanta, allowing Sunday sales should keep grocery stores from leaving for neighboring communities, supporters of the change say.
''We're not doing it to raise taxes,'' said Jerry Oberholtzer, the mayor. ''We're just doing it be competitive.''
Still, more sales will mean more revenue, and every little bit helps in a town that went from more a million dollars in revenue from development in 2003 to about $100,000 this year.
Plus, the mayor said, there's simply the anachronistic nature of the law: ''The younger generation just thinks it's kind of dumb.''
Although opposition has traditionally been on religious grounds, people here who plan to fight the Sunday sales initiatives will argue that it is an issue of local control and safety for smaller communities.
''God knows -- and I say that reverently -- you can't prove anything with religion anymore,'' said Jerry Luquire, president of the Georgia Christian Coalition. ''So we're saying, 'Please vote no to save a life.' You can live without alcohol on Sunday, but you may not be able to live with it.''
In Tennessee, changes to the alcohol laws were intended as economic stimulus, but of a different sort. In an effort to attract a large out-of-state brewer and as a way to help local makers of craft-style beers, the state now allows high-alcohol beers like stouts and barley wines to be produced under certain circumstances.
The new law also made it legal for microbreweries and stores that sell alcohol to offer samples. That is good news for fans of Jack Daniel's, who now might be able to actually taste the state's famous whiskey when they tour the plant, which is located in a dry county.
Tennessee is the eighth state to pass legislation allowing liquor tastings since 2009.
The theory is that customers who sample new wines or a new cocktail are likely to buy more, said Bard Quillman, a former banker who a decade ago opened Red Dog Wine and Spirits near Nashville.
''If we are doing a mixed-drink promotion, we are trying to sell the mixer as an add-on,'' he said. ''Say that's a $20 dollar ring. At 9 percent, the state just picked up a couple bucks on top of whatever the customer was going to buy anyway.''

HEADLINE: College Offers Top Applicants Two-Thirds Off

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
For students with their sights set on a private college, the anxiety comes as a one-two punch: first from competing with thousands of others for a precious few spots, then from trying to scrape together up to $50,000 a year to foot the bill.
Starting next year, Seton Hall University will try to ease that follow-up blow for early applicants with strong academic credentials, giving them two-thirds off the regular sticker price for tuition, a discount of some $21,000. For New Jersey residents, who constitute about 70 percent of Seton Hall's undergraduates, that would make the cost equivalent to that of Rutgers University, the state's flagship public institution; for those from out of state, the private school would be much cheaper than the public one. 
National experts on admissions and financial aid said the policy was the first of its kind. Seton Hall officials said they hoped it would provide clarity and certainty up front to the most desirable applicants, easing the weeks and months of stress that admitted students face as they wait to hear how much financial aid they might get from different campuses.
''The primary motivation has been that as we go through what looks like a double-dip recession, we wanted to help our students,'' Seton Hall's president, Gabriel Esteban, said of the new approach. But in addition, he said, ''it probably will help us in attracting a certain quality of students.''
To qualify for the discount, which would equal about two-thirds of this year's $31,440 tuition (room, board and other fees add about $13,000 to the total annual bill), students must graduate in the top 10 percent of their high school classes and have a combined score of at least 1,200 on their math and reading SATs -- but no less than 550 on either -- or an ACT score of 27 or above.
Though experts said they knew of no college providing such a blanket discount for top-flight students, other institutions have similarly tried to distinguish themselves in this ailing economy by appealing to students' bottom lines.
Sewanee, a liberal arts college in Tennessee, this fall cut its total annual bill for students by 10 percent. Many Ivy League schools have lately made a ''no loan'' commitment to families earning as much as $100,000 per year, promising to cover students' entire assessed financial need with grants. Albright College, in Reading, Pa., decided in 2009 to give out more in merit aid than in need-based aid, and to send details of financial aid awards out with admissions letters, not as follow-ups.
And the State of Georgia has for a decade been granting residents with A and B averages full scholarships to its public colleges, though that program was scaled back this spring for budgetary reasons.
Like many colleges, Seton Hall, a Catholic university in South Orange, N.J., has need-blind admissions: that is, it accepts or rejects students without regard to their ability to pay. But also like many of its peers, it offers more generous financial support to the students it most wants -- a practice generally known as merit aid.
Studies by the National Association for College Admission Counseling showed that in the mid-1990s, a large majority of colleges provided financial aid based only on need; but that by 2007, nearly as many provided aid based on perceived merit, academic or otherwise.
''The most elite institutions in the United States have historically had policies that they would not give aid for any reason other than financial need,'' said Jerome Sullivan, executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. ''But there were always exceptions, and since the '80s, you've seen more and more schools shift away from that. It's all about competing for the best students.''
Rutgers, a public university with more than 40,000 undergraduates on three campuses, charges $10,104 in tuition to in-state undergraduates and $22,766 to out-of-state students, plus room, board and fees that, like Seton Hall's, amount to about $13,000 a year.
Next fall, Seton Hall's discounted tuition will match what Rutgers now charges New Jersey residents. Going forward, Seton Hall officials said, the price would be subject to annual increases and would not necessarily be pegged to its much larger public neighbor's. To be eligible for the lower price, students must apply by the Dec. 15 ''early action'' deadline, thereby indicating a strong, but nonbinding, preference for Seton Hall over others.
Applicants to most colleges, including Seton Hall, fill out a financial aid form provided by the federal Education Department, which estimates what families should be expected to be able to pay and determines eligibility for federal grant and loan programs. But many colleges provide less financial aid than the federal government says a family needs.
Seton Hall, founded in 1859, has more than 5,000 undergraduate students, with 82 percent of them living on its suburban campus 14 miles west of Manhattan. It has nearly as many students in its graduate schools of law, business, health sciences and other fields; the new discount policy will not apply to the graduate students.
Eighty-five percent of Seton Hall undergraduates received some financial aid this year, at a cost to the university of about $60 million. For those who would have received aid under the existing system, the savings from the discounted tuition would be less than the full $21,000.
Seton Hall's vice president for enrollment management, Alyssa McCloud, said that after students were admitted, ''there's a lot of confusion among families about the bottom-line cost'' as they waited to hear from various schools about their aid packages, as well as about any independent scholarships they might be competing for. The discounted tuition for top students, she said, would let ''families know right up front what the bottom line will be.''
If the new policy had been in effect this year, Ms. McCloud said, 16 percent of the school's freshmen would have had the high school academic credentials to qualify for the lower price. But that percentage could rise if the policy helps the school draw more top-notch applicants.
Online Correction: September 28, 2011, Wednesday

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Is Asked to Rule On Health Care

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to hear a case concerning the 2010 health care overhaul law. The development, which came unexpectedly fast, makes it all but certain that the court will soon agree to hear one or more cases involving challenges to the law, with arguments by the spring and a decision by June, in time to land in the middle of the 2012 presidential campaign.
The Justice Department said the justices should hear its appeal of a decision by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, that struck down the centerpiece of the law by a 2-to-1 vote.
''The department has consistently and successfully defended this law in several courts of appeals, and only the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled it unconstitutional,'' the Justice Department said in a statement. ''We believe the question is appropriate for review by the Supreme Court. 
''Throughout history, there have been similar challenges to other landmark legislation, such as the Social Security Act, the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, and all of those challenges failed,'' the statement continued. ''We believe the challenges to the Affordable Care Act -- like the one in the 11th Circuit -- will also ultimately fail and that the Supreme Court will uphold the law.''
On Monday, the administration announced that it would not seek review from the full 11th Circuit. Its Supreme Court petition was not due until November.
The administration did not explain why it did not take routine litigation steps that might have slowed the progress of the challenges enough to avoid a decision in the current Supreme Court term. It did say in its brief that the 11th Circuit's decision striking down the central piece of a comprehensive regulatory scheme created ''a matter of grave national importance.''
The political calculus is complicated. A decision striking down President Obama's signature legislative achievement only months before the election would doubtless be a blow. But a decision from a court divided along ideological lines could further energize voters already critical of last year's 5-to-4 campaign finance decision, Citizens United.
A decision upholding the law might also both help and hurt Mr. Obama's chances. It would represent vindication, but it could also spur some voters to redouble their efforts to elect candidates committed to repealing it.
The three federal courts of appeal that have issued decisions on the law so far have all reached different conclusions, with one upholding it, a second -- the 11th Circuit-- striking it down in part, and a third saying that threshold legal issues barred an immediate ruling. A fourth challenge to the law was heard last week by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
The views of the appeals court judges have not uniformly tracked the presumed views of the presidents who appointed them. Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton, appointed by President George W. Bush, joined the majority in a 2-to-1 decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, which upheld the law. Judge Frank M. Hull of the 11th Circuit was appointed by President Bill Clinton and was an author of its majority opinion.
Also on Wednesday, two sets of plaintiffs who had won on the core issue in the 11th Circuit filed their own requests for Supreme Court review.
''Time is of the essence,'' wrote Paul D. Clement, a former United States solicitor general who represents 26 states that are challenging the law. ''The grave constitutional questions surrounding the A.C.A. and its novel exercise of federal power will not subside until this court resolves them.''
The 11th Circuit, in a decision issued in August, ruled that a part of law requiring the purchase of insurance -- the so-called individual mandate -- was an unconstitutional exercise of Congressional power.
The majority decision, written by Chief Judge Joel F. Dubina and Judge Hull, said, ''We have not found any generally applicable, judicially enforceable limiting principle that would permit us to uphold the mandate without obliterating the boundaries inherent in the system of enumerated Congressional powers.''
The United States solicitor general, Donald B. Verrilli Jr., disputed that analysis in the administration's brief. The law, he wrote, requires most people to buy insurance ''rather than rely on a combination of attempted self-insurance and the back-stop of care paid for by other market participants.'' The individual mandate, he went on, ''like the act as a whole, thus regulates economic conduct that substantially affects interstate commerce.''
The 11th Circuit ruled against the 26 states and the other plaintiffs on two points. It said its ruling on the individual mandate did not require ''wholesale invalidation'' of the law, and it upheld the law's expansion of the Medicaid program.
The petition from the 26 states and a second one, from the National Federation of Independent Business and two individuals, sought review on the issues they had lost in the 11th Circuit. The administration's brief and those of the plaintiffs mostly addressed different questions and talked past one another. Each side now has a chance to respond and tell the court its views about whether the issues identified by its adversaries warrant review.
But almost all of the usual signs indicate that the court will agree to hear at least one challenge to the law: a federal appeals court has struck down a major piece of federal legislation, the lower courts are divided about its constitutionality, and all sides, including the federal government itself, agree that review is warranted.
It is less clear which case the justices will agree to hear. Also pending before the justices is a petition from several individuals and the Thomas More Law Center, which describes itself as a defender of ''America's Christian heritage and moral values,'' seeking review of the Sixth Circuit decision.
Nor is it clear which issues the justices will focus on. Simply agreeing to hear a case does not guarantee that the Supreme Court will decide whether Congress had the power under the Constitution's commerce clause to enact the individual mandate, the question at the heart of the challenges.
The court could agree with some lower courts that some or all of the plaintiffs lack standing to sue or that the central issue is not yet ripe for decision. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., for instance, ruled this month that it was premature to decide the central question, citing a federal law allowing suits only after certain taxes and penalties are due. The administration found itself in an awkward position on this question before the Supreme Court, as it had initially pressed but later abandoned the argument.
In Wednesday's brief, Mr. Verrilli said the administration did not think it should win on the Fourth Circuit's theory. It nonetheless suggested that the court consider the issue and perhaps appoint a lawyer to present arguments in favor of it, as the court occasionally does when the parties agree on a significant issue that could alter the outcome of the eventual decision.

HEADLINE: President Putin Redux: His decision to run for the presidency is bad news for Russia and everyone else

 BODY:
Russia's next presidential election is not until March but -- barring an unexpected turn -- the winner is pretty much decided.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, a former president and Russia's main power player, announced last Saturday that he would run for another presidential term. President Dmitri Medvedev, the protege Mr. Putin installed in 2008, has agreed to lead the United Russia party slate in the December parliamentary elections and to take the lesser post of prime minister after the presidential vote. 
Mr. Medvedev, more liberal and Western-oriented, tried to step out of Mr. Putin's shadow with a push for judicial and political reforms that would break the Kremlin's iron grip. He never succeeded. Only a few months ago, he seemed eager to run again for president, but Mr. Putin proved again that he is really the one in charge.
Russia's Constitution permits only two consecutive presidential terms. If Mr. Putin wins a six-year presidential term, he could run again in 2018 and stay in power until 2024. A truly chilling prospect.
Elections alone do not make a democracy, and Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer, has made clear his disdain for democratic rights. His Russia is a place where journalists and human rights activists are murdered with impunity, political and business opponents are thrown in jail, and media outlets are controlled by or intimidated by the government. Mr. Putin has ridden high on an oil-fueled economic boom. But production levels are leveling off. The country needs to expand its revenue base by reducing the dependency on oil and gas, encouraging business competition and increasing foreign investment. To be successful, that will require cracking down on corruption, strengthening the rule of law and building an independent judiciary -- reforms that Mr. Medvedev talked about but did not deliver.
The Obama administration has generally done a good job of ''resetting'' and managing the relationship with Moscow, working productively on Iran and Libya, concluding a new nuclear weapons agreement and increasing Russian logistical support to American forces in Afghanistan. Those interests will continue.
That means President Obama will have to find ways to continue working with Mr. Putin. He will also have to be ready to speak out, clearly and forcefully, when Mr. Putin bullies his own citizens or his neighbors. There can be no illusions about who Mr. Putin really is.

HEADLINE: An Overlooked Way to Create Jobs

BYLINE: By C. FRED BERGSTEN. 
C. Fred Bergsten, an assistant Treasury secretary from 1977 to 1981, is director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

 BODY:
Washington
BY virtually ignoring trade, President Obama and Congressional Republicans are missing a major opportunity to create jobs. The United States runs an annual trade deficit of about $600 billion, or 4 percent of our entire economy. Eliminating that imbalance would create three million to four million jobs, according to Commerce Department estimates, at no cost to the budget.
It is clear that our economy can no longer rely on consumer borrowing, housing bubbles, government deficits and super-low interest rates. The United States must start selling much more to other countries, especially China and other emerging markets that are growing at 6 percent or more per year. 
Mr. Obama has set a goal of doubling the nation's exports over five years. But his administration has done little to achieve that goal, which is inadequate to begin with. For one thing, the focus should not be the level of exports but the overall deficit -- the difference between what we import from abroad and what we sell overseas.
This will of course require us to get our house in order: balancing the budget over time; investing in education, infrastructure and scientific research; and making taxation and regulation more efficient. But there are three steps we can take that would pay off more quickly.
First, the United States must, in effect, weaken the dollar by 10 to 20 percent. This step alone would produce one million to three million jobs. It's been done before: In 1971, President Richard M. Nixon ended the dollar's convertibility in gold, and in 1985, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III reached an agreement with foreign countries to devalue the dollar relative to the yen and the Deutsche mark.
The bulk of our current misalignment is vis-a-vis the Chinese currency, the renminbi, and a small group of other Asian currencies. Partly in response to pressure from the United States and other countries, China has let its currency rise modestly over the past year, but it continues to intervene in foreign exchange markets, purchasing one billion to two billion United States dollars every day to prevent the value of the renminbi from rising more quickly.
The artificially low value of the renminbi -- it is 20 to 30 percent less than what it should be -- amounts to a subsidy on Chinese exports and a tariff on imports from the United States and other countries. The United States should take China to the World Trade Organization in Geneva for engaging in illegal competitive currency devaluation, and retaliate if China does not cease this protectionist policy. Many members of Congress have urged such action, but Mr. Obama, like President George W. Bush before him, has been too timid to take this step.
Along with pressuring the Chinese, Congress and Mr. Obama should reduce the budget deficit, the Federal Reserve should continue to pursue an expansionary monetary policy and politicians should drop the ''strong dollar'' rhetoric of the past. An overvalued dollar only exacerbates the trade imbalance.
Second, the United States must negotiate a reduction in foreign regulations, monopoly practices and other barriers to the export of American services. Work done by American architects, engineers, lawyers and accountants for foreign customers is an export, just like Boeing planes and Caterpillar tractors. We run a $750 billion trade deficit in goods but a $150 billion trade surplus in services.
Services make up 80 percent of our economy, and we have a huge opportunity to serve emerging markets like Brazil, China and India. We could expand services exports by at least $200 billion a year by completing a free-trade agreement with South Korea; pursuing a trade agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership; and reviving the Doha round of global trade talks, with a focus on services. The administration has not pursued these steps with enough vigor.
Third, we must get serious about defending the intellectual property rights of our companies against theft by foreign companies and governments. A recent study by the International Trade Commission suggested that Chinese companies alone, with support or at least acquiescence from their government, are stealing $50 billion to $100 billion in United States products each year. The global total is probably at least twice as large.
The theft of intellectual property cuts across such highly competitive products as Microsoft Windows, Apple iPads, groundbreaking pharmaceuticals and award-winning films. Negotiations have failed to achieve significant progress. We must take many more intellectual property cases to the W.T.O. and credibly threaten unilateral retaliation if the foreign piracy continues.
These steps are no doubt aggressive. They would require taking tough initiatives with some of our main trading partners, especially China, and giving trade a more prominent, even central, role in our overall foreign policy. To be sure, some American corporations will fret that these actions would needlessly antagonize the Chinese and threaten a trade war. Some economists worry that a weaker dollar would invite inflation and endanger the dollar's status as the dominant global currency. I believe these fears are overblown. The real threat to the world trading system is, in fact, the protectionist policies, including undervalued currencies, of other countries and the vast trade imbalances that result.
Not every country can expand its economy through exports, because one nation's smaller deficit is another's smaller surplus. But the United States has a unique claim now to pursue such a strategy, because it has run large deficits for most of the last three decades, become the largest debtor country and accommodated other countries' desire for export-led prosperity. If we want to avoid bankruptcy and raise growth, we have got to attack the trade deficit.

HEADLINE: Romney Waits As G.O.P. Flirts With Alternates

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Ashley Parker contributed reporting from Goffstown, N.H.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Republican who may have the strongest shot of winning the White House, at least in the eyes of President Obama and his advisers, is Mitt Romney. Now, if Mr. Romney could only persuade Republican voters.
After a summer spent skillfully navigating the obstacles of an unpredictable race, and after consistently rising above his rivals during three debates, Mr. Romney still faces one central question: Will he ever be able to satisfy Republicans?
The latest drumbeat of adoration aimed at luring someone new into the race -- this time, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey -- is also a slap at Mr. Romney, whose effort to consolidate support from donors and party activists is impeded every time another potential candidate surfaces. 
''Who knows, maybe he'll get in,'' Mr. Romney said in New Hampshire on Wednesday, smiling when asked about the speculation surrounding Mr. Christie. ''It'd be fun if he got in.''
The time has long passed for Mr. Romney to be the first choice in the hearts of many Republicans. So his strategy, by necessity, has evolved into being the last choice, an eat-your-vegetables candidate who may only be seen as more appealing when he is matched up alongside his rivals.
No candidate in the Republican field has spent more time preparing to be president than Mr. Romney. (That, some supporters believe, is not entirely a positive attribute.) He relentlessly studied what went wrong with his 2008 race and has unquestionably become a better candidate, as he showed during back-to-back debates in September.
He has managed, so far, to finesse his way around the concerns of ideological shape-shifting that once seemed a deal breaker to many conservatives. Questions about the health care plan he signed into law as governor of Massachusetts have not overshadowed his candidacy. And he has not been pushed to address his Mormon faith, which created a stir four years ago and prompted him to give a speech seeking to explain his beliefs.
Now, just when it seemed that Mr. Romney might finally reap the rewards of his work, as conservative leaders openly groused about the unsteady performance of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, another week in his campaign has been spent watching donors, party establishment figures, the news media and voters flirt with Mr. Christie. And the month of September is ending just as it began, with a contingent of Republicans still searching for a fresh candidate to challenge Mr. Obama next year.
''It's human nature to think the grass is always greener somewhere else,'' said Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, whose presidential candidacy ended when he was overtaken by the rise of Representative Michele Bachmann. He endorsed Mr. Romney and predicted that other Republicans would too, saying, ''He's the most capable, most knowledgeable and most electable candidate.''
In the case of Mr. Christie, a contingent of prominent Republican donors has been leading the effort to enlist him. The high-profile effort has warned away many contributors from signing on with Mr. Romney or Mr. Perry until they have a clear sense of the field.
''There is enough chatter and phone calls and static -- whatever you call it in the spy business -- that everyone is just sitting around,'' said Ray Washburne, a Dallas businessman and top donor to Mr. Pawlenty who has not realigned with a candidate. ''There is confusion among the main donors. No one has signed up with either major campaign in the last three weeks.''
Several Republican contributors in New York and elsewhere said they found Mr. Christie more appealing, even though their business experience is similar to that of Mr. Romney, who spent years working at a private equity firm. They view Mr. Christie as having the credibility to unite the establishment and Tea Party enthusiasts.
There are still some factors working in Mr. Romney's favor.
A renewed focus on fiscal matters, rather than social issues, has helped Mr. Romney avoid what had been persistent questions about his previous support for abortion rights. It also has allowed him to keep his message focused on the economy.
Still, the passion surrounding Mr. Romney's candidacy has failed to match the fervor of the moment for Republicans, many of whom are angry, hungry and determined to defeat Mr. Obama. The next phase of the campaign, where Mr. Romney is likely to be the subject of attacks from his rivals, will help answer whether voters are willing to be pragmatic and support a candidate who has a stronger general election appeal.
As Mr. Romney campaigned at a town-hall-style meeting in New Hampshire on Wednesday, he was praised by a questioner for becoming a better candidate, a comment that drew applause from his audience. But several other voters suggested they retained a level of ambivalence about his candidacy.
''That piece of magic that got Barack Obama elected, I don't know if Romney has that,'' said Susan Bertrand, a nurse from Massachusetts, who came to see Mr. Romney in Goffstown.
A friend, Sherry Boudreau, a nurse from Salem, N.H., added, ''If you could only combine Mitt Romney with Herman Cain.''
The rapid rise of Mr. Perry's candidacy initially worried many Romney supporters. They feared that the authenticity that oozes from the Texas governor could reinforce the notion that the former Massachusetts governor adapts his positions and persona to the needs of the moment.
That has become the central theme of criticism from Mr. Perry, who has steadily increased his attacks on Mr. Romney's credibility as a conservative. He has urged Republicans to select a nominee who has the sharpest distinctions with the president. He has referred to Mr. Romney as ''Obama-lite.''
At the end of a meeting with voters on Wednesday at St. Anselm College, where he directed nearly all of his attention to the president and not his Republican rivals, Mr. Romney brushed aside questions about whether he was insulted that some were not pleased with his candidacy.
''I've got a lot of people in this country who are pleased with my candidacy,'' Mr. Romney said, ''and my job is to make that even larger.''

HEADLINE: Killing the Recovery: A global fixation on austerity is exactly the wrong course

 BODY:
The world has barely dug out of recession and the global economy is again slowing dangerously. Most leaders seem eager to make things even worse.
Instead of looking for ways to reignite growth, Europe's leaders -- and Republicans on Capitol Hill -- are determined to slash public spending. Europe's fixation on austerity is also compounding its debt crisis, bringing the Continent even closer to the brink. Meanwhile, China's government, which is struggling to contain inflation without letting its currency rise, has been trying to slow domestic demand, allowing its trade surplus to balloon.
Each of these policies is wrong. In combination, they are likely to tip the world into a deep recession. 
The International Monetary Fund has cut its forecast for global growth this year to 4 percent, from the 4.3 percent it had forecast in April. It expects rich countries to grow by only 1.6 percent. That may be too optimistic.
The I.M.F. forecasts that the United States will grow by 1.5 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2012. But that assumes Congress will continue payroll tax cuts and extended unemployment insurance, as President Obama has called for. Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com warns that if Congress fails to do so, the country will probably slip into recession.
Europe is in even worse shape. Rich nations that could afford to spend more to increase growth, like Germany and Britain, are instead slashing spending. Germany and its rich neighbors are also insisting that Greece, Portugal and other debtor countries accept even stiffer doses of austerity to regain the confidence of investors. Sending these economies into near collapse means that they will never be able to dig out or pay off their creditors.
While the German Parliament is expected to approve a new $600 billion bailout fund on Thursday, many European leaders already admit it is too small to deal with turmoil that now also threatens Spain and Italy.
It is true that many countries do not have the money to pay for policies to promote employment and growth. The United States, Britain, Germany and China could boost global demand by spending more at home and buying more from weaker countries that cannot stimulate their own economies.
The United States government must cut its budget deficit, but the economy must recover first. According to Mr. Zandi, President Obama's $450 billion jobs plan could add 1.9 million jobs in 2012 and cut the unemployment rate by a percentage point. With interest rates so low, the government could easily pay for a bigger program.
The British government has similar room to maneuver. And its stubborn insistence on fiscal austerity is already causing havoc. But the countries that could do most to assist global growth are China and Germany.
China today makes 14 percent of the world's economic product but consumes only 6 percent of it. Allowing its currency to rise would help combat inflation by lowering the domestic price of imports, while increasing the spending power of the Chinese people.
Germany's export model is also failing, producing little growth while sucking demand from its neighbors. Germany could easily raise money at low cost to stimulate its own consumption. Yet not only has it refused stimulus spending, it is imposing austerity on the rest of Europe -- forcing weak countries to contract their economies in exchange for its aid.
Economic policy makers have made similar mistakes before. That is what caused the Great Depression. There is not a lot of time left to get this right.

HEADLINE: Making Change Happen, on a Deadline

BYLINE: TINA ROSENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Rapid Results, a strategy designed for corporations, is helping communities in Africa set goals and solve problems in 100 days or less. 

 BODY:
The PreFabricated Building Parts Production Enterprise in Addis Ababa is a state-owned company that makes concrete walls and other structures, mainly for the Ethiopian government's low-cost housing program. Public-sector construction companies in the third world are not generally known for energy, flexibility, risk-taking or creative thinking. PreFabricated, in other words, does not seem like the kind of business that would or could do astonishing things in a hurry.
Like many companies in AIDS-wracked Ethiopia, PreFabricated had an AIDS policy, which included extra pay for its H.I.V. positive workers so they could buy more food. In March, 2008, the company decided to do more. It set a goal of persuading 70 percent of its employees - 700 people - to get tested for H.I.V. in 100 days.
This was a startling idea. "Employees do not like to get tested at work because of privacy concerns," said Seife Mergia, the company's head of planning and information. Most of the employees did not work at headquarters, but were scattered around various construction sites. They were mostly contract day laborers - a workforce few companies invest in. Yet by day 40 the company had built a clinic. It set up a lab and hired a technician. It gave people credible evidence that their H.I.V. status would be confidential. At the 120-day mark, 900 people had been tested for H.I.V.
PreFabricated surpassed its goal using a strategy called Rapid Results, in which a group of people choose a project and carry it out in 100 days. Companies in Addis that used Rapid Results got their H.I.V. testing rates up to about 75 percent - triple the norm. The same method has been used in Nicaragua to help pig farmers raise fatter pigs and to improve dairy farms' milk quality. In Rwanda, two villages doubled the number of attended births in less than 100 days, and the Rapid Results team went on to work on other projects to protect mothers' health. In Madagascar, four districts quintupled the use of family planning services in 50 days, and the Health Ministry then began the program on a national scale. Kenya is using Rapid Results in virtually all its ministries; one campaign in the province of Nyanza circumcised 40,000 men in two months - a crucial achievement for AIDS prevention. Rapid Results has made Kenya by far the leader in Africa in scaling up circumcision. Villages in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Eritrea and other countries have used Rapid Results to improve local infrastructure as well - digging wells, constructing bridges and roads, building schools.
Rapid Results is an eccentric idea. Nadim Matta, a management consultant who is president of the Rapid Results Institute in Stamford, Conn., likes to say that what's missing to turn poor places into rich places isn't more information, money, technology, workshops, programs, evaluation or any of the other things that development organizations normally provide. What's missing are motivation and confidence.
At first glance, this seems crazy - can we cheerlead our way into the middle class?
What Matta means is that usually the obstacle to development is not that we don't have the tools, but that we don't use the tools we have. People drag their feet. The next step is someone else's problem. Budget approval takes forever. The money disappears. People won't try because it never works. The goal is too pie-in-the-sky. The parts aren't available. The bricks get stolen. The project gets started and then the leadership changes and it sits, abandoned. Every villager fumes: nothing gets around here.
"The biggest issue is that people don't actually mobilize," said Matta. "The last mile is where solutions need to come together in specific ways. We think we have part of the answer to the last mile problem."
That list of complaints may sound familiar to anyone who manages a business, and in fact, Rapid Results was designed to help large corporations. It was invented about 40 years ago by Robert Schaffer, a management consultant. Five years ago, Schaffer's company spun off a group as a nonprofit to train people all around the world to use the same method. Rapid Results has spread, well, rapidly, because it has a champion in the World Bank, which is teaching people to use the method in various countries. So are other groups, such as the African Capacity Building Foundation.
It works like this: A trained facilitator sits down with people in a business, organization or village to decide on what to do. They vote. Now, if we had some money from the government or the World Bank - say, $5,000 or perhaps $30,000 - how could we spend it to accomplish that goal in just 100 days? The village chooses its goal and how to get it done. The facilitator only talks about what villages have accomplished in 100 days.
To build confidence, before they make decisions the teams play a pass-the-tennis-ball game. The first time through, a team of eight will pass the balls in about 15 seconds. "Then we share with them that we've done it hundreds of times with different groups around the world, and every one manages to do it in under three seconds," said Ronnie Hammad, a World Bank senior operations officer who has been using Rapid Results programs for 10 years. "At first they try to do the same thing faster. Then they begin to question the rules. Inevitably, after seven or eight tries, they get it. It happens with senior managers at the World Bank and with commercial sex workers in Eritrea. Leadership emerges. It unleashes creativity and innovation. It's an experience of what might be possible for them."
At first, the 100 days seems ridiculous. Groups that turn to Rapid Results have usually had the repeated experience of nothing happening in three years. Who can accomplish something significant in three months? But this is exactly the point - it takes a project out of the realm of business as usual.
With the facilitator offering coaching - for example, she will require that by the halfway point in the project, the team have a plan for how to sustain it - the team members meet, often weekly, to talk about how to get around setbacks and what worked elsewhere.
Frannie Leautier, the executive secretary of the African Capacity Building Foundation, wrote in an e-mail that Rapid Results initiatives are a "bite-sized approach to complex problem-solving. Communities will get confidence to tackle problems that may seem insurmountable." The tight deadline "forces a degree of prioritization and focus which leads to results, avoiding white elephant projects which tend to be grandiose but not implementable."
The deadline creates an ethos of doing whatever it takes. People aren't sitting and waiting for the district official to come out. They go buy the materials themselves. Women sleep on the bulk cement bags to make sure no one steals them. A village in Sudan needed bricks for a school, and the contractor wasn't producing enough. So the Rapid Results team organized a competition in the community to make bricks, and the project stayed on schedule. "You can't control what happens 10 years down the road," says Mats Karlsson, a senior World Bank official who used Rapid Results in several West African countries when he was country director in Ghana. "But 100 days everyone can control."
Hammad said that when he arrived in Eritrea and surveyed World Bank activity, "there were lots of workshops, lots of ground being prepared - but nothing you could put your hands on to demonstrate real results." With Rapid Results, he said, "you saw the same people, the same resources, the same conditions - and an order of magnitude difference in terms of performance."
While Rapid Results can produce dramatic changes in 100 days, questions remain about day 101. Sustainability has always been the weak point of development work, whose symbol might well be the lonely water pump, abandoned for lack of a $3 part. Even a successful Rapid Results team is going to move on to other priorities after 100 days, and it will always be tempting to cut corners - or whole sides - to make the deadline. Next week, I'll respond to reader comments and discuss how Rapid Results' architects are grappling with the challenge of not just achieving results, but making them last.

HEADLINE: Job Losses Across the Developed World

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The sectors hardest hit in the 2008-9 downturn were mining, manufacturing and utilities, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 

 BODY:
Across the developed world, the biggest job losses in the 2008-9 downturn were in mining, manufacturing and utilities, according to new data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Here's a chart showing job losses and gains by sector for a selection of developed countries. Bars above the horizontal axis show industries that added jobs, and bars below the axis show industries that lost jobs. The red bars refer to jobs lost in mining, manufacturing and utilities:
Across the entire O.E.C.D., job losses in this sector equaled 35.3 percent of total employment changes in 2008 and 2009.
The biggest gains, by contrast, were in community, personal and social services (the light blue bars).
This is probably no surprise to people who have been following job trends in the United States, where the health industry has been going gangbusters in both good and bad economies. But actually growth across the broader sector has been smaller in the United States than elsewhere in the developed world.
In the United States, growth in community, personal and social services totaled 8.2 percent of overall employment changes in 2008-9, whereas across all O.E.C.D. member countries this supersector added jobs that equaled 18.3 percent of total job changes during the same period.

HEADLINE: In Fast-Gentrifying Bed-Stuy, a Celebration of Early Black Settlers

BYLINE: ALEXIS OKEOWO


HIGHLIGHT: A heritage center celebrates Weeksville, a 19th-century settlement in Brooklyn established by free blacks that was rediscovered only in 1968. 

 BODY:
On a clear spring day in 1968, residents of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, including retirees and Boy Scouts, were on their hands and knees, digging underneath the intersection of Troy Avenue and Dean Street in what would become a major neighborhood archaeological excavation. 
What they found were the remnants of a village called Weeksville, one of the country's first free-black communities where blacks owned property and ran businesses, a hospital and a school as nearby states like New Jersey continued to sanction slavery. 
Many of the houses were torn down by the New York City Housing Authority to make way for public housing. But a remaining few were restored by a group called the Society for the Preservation of Weeksville and Bedford-Stuyvesant History that worked to unearth and preserve the village. The society later became the Weeksville Heritage Center, an organization that promotes African-American history.
The traces of a place that has been largely forgotten are finally resurfacing as the center prepares to display artifacts from over 50 years of excavations. The objects, most of which have been in storage for decades, will be on permanent rotation at the heritage center's new $30 million extension, a building that will have space for more arts and educational offerings when it opens next year. 
"This was a history that was lost, and part of our mission is to make sure that doesn't happen again," said Jennifer Scott, research director at the Weeksville Heritage Center. 
The original Weeksville was discovered when a community-survey class at the nearby Pratt Institute studied old maps and directories of New York, and noticed the existence of a black colony. They decided to see if physical vestiges remained. An instructor for the class, Jim Hurley, had been researching Bedford-Stuyvesant and wanted to investigate a cluster of houses in the neighborhood that he suspected were from the 19th century, when Weeksville was established. He met Joseph Haines, a Metropolitan Transportation Authority engineer and pilot who was interested in his effort, and they rented a propeller plane to fly over the area looking for architectural evidence. 
Within the cluster, they discovered four houses that were not aligned with the street, an oddity that suggested to Mr. Hurley that the houses' construction predated the modern street grid. Mr. Hurley verified through property deeds and tax documents that the houses were part of the historic village. After learning that the city was going to tear down the houses, he and neighborhood residents mounted a successful campaign to save what became known as the Hunterfly Road Houses.
The history of Weeksville stretches back to 1838, when a black longshoreman, James Weeks, who was a well-known leader in the black-suffrage movement, bought property from a black landowner to gain citizenship and voting rights. 
At the time, black men could not become citizens or vote without owning at least $250 worth of property. Mr. Weeks bought $1,500 in land, and a few other other free black men did so as well and founded Weeksville. Mr. Weeks and his partners divided the land into plots and sold them to other black families, many of whom had come from the South. They placed ads in several newspapers recruiting new residents. At its height, Weeksville was home to 700 families.
Some of the artifacts from Weeksville are already on display at the Hunterfly Road Houses, including photographs from the late 1800s of well-dressed residents at social clubs, playing cards, sports and music. Other items, including remarkably intact China, glass inkwells, tintypes of nattily attired men and women, and illustrated dance cards, will be shown when the center opens. There will also be recorded oral histories, film clips and newspaper articles.
The heritage center's ambitious campaign to preserve the neighborhood's history has inspired residents who are working to protect the neighborhood from gentrification. 
"We get a lot of calls for advice on how to get where we are today from people who want to landmark other sites in Bed-Stuy," Ms. Scott said.
In recent months, residents have petitioned the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission to expand the existing Stuyvesant Heights Historic District and to establish new ones, including a district called Bedford Corners. 
"These blocks are a catalog of fine architecture through the 19th century," said Claudette Brady, the chairwoman of the Bedford Corners Historic District Joint Block Association, as she walked down a block of Hancock Street on a recent day. Elegant, neo-brick brownstones in browns, lavenders, creams and reds were adorned with stone carvings, glimmering metalwork, terra cotta tiles, wrought-iron railings and stained glass. 
An amateur architectural historian, Daniel Thompson - Ms. Brady joked that he was "possessed by the ghost of a little old Victorian woman who used to live in his house" - accompanied her. "What's surprising is that these buildings have remained so intact through the years with no protection, but development is much more aggressive now," said Mr. Thompson, who has lived in Bed-Stuy for 11 years. "Some of this architecture, you won't find in Manhattan. So if it's lost here, it's lost forever."
The Weeksville Heritage Center is also applying to have two churches, a school and a public art sculpture that fall within the historical boundaries of the original Weeksville community declared landmarks. 
Residents want to hold on to the past because the story of Weeksville and many parts of Bedford-Stuyvesant is "really rare," said Elissa Blount-Moorhead, director of programs and exhibitions at the Weeksville Heritage Center. "There's no other narrative like this."

HEADLINE: Keeping (Weaker) Eyes on the Road

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: The elimination of eye tests from the driver's license renewal process has a board member and past president of the New York State Ophthalmological Society shaking his head. Also, what City Room is reading in other papers and blogs. 

 BODY:
Dr. Paul N. Orloff has been examining eyes for three decades, and a verity he has learned is that people are often the worst judges of their own vision. "Everybody says they have normal eyes," said Dr. Orloff, an ophthalmologist in Manhattan. "Their vision gets worse, and they don't even know it because the change is subtle."
 So a new edict from the state's Department of Motor Vehicles has the doctor, a board member and past president of the New York State Ophthalmological Society, shaking his head. It's not that he finds it hard to understand. He finds it impossible to understand.
 "I think it puts the public at considerable risk," he said, adding: "From a safety standpoint, it's an enormous issue." 
 As of Wednesday, New York drivers seeking to renew their licenses no longer had to pass an eye test. Now, all they need to do is "self-certify" that they see just fine. Motor Vehicles will take their word for it, without knowing if they can put eagles to shame or if they are slipping into Magoo territory.
 All too often, Dr. Orloff said, "people deny their visual needs." If objects start to become blurred, many simply accept that as a new normal. Some older men and women are tempted to shade the truth about fading vision out of fear of being isolated at home if denied the right to drive.
 The department says its new policy was a response to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's call for "streamlined" government. But what may be streamlining for some is cutting corners for others.
 "This is inconceivable to us, and so penny-wise and pound-foolish," said Dr. Orloff, who was speaking on behalf of the ophthalmological society.
 To qualify for a driver's license, a New Yorker must have 20-40 vision or better, with or without corrective lenses. First-time drivers and those holding commercial licenses will still have to take eye tests.
 For a license renewal, ensuring that an applicant meets minimum standards has involved nothing more complex than reading a few lines on an eye chart. In my experience, that takes all of five seconds at the nearest motor vehicles bureau, which may have once qualified as a synonym for purgatory but is admirably efficient these days.
 The new policy has made for some interesting allies. Advocates for motorists and for bicyclists share a distaste for the change. "We were taken by surprise," said John A. Corelett, who is chairman of the legislative committee for AAA New York State.
 Charles Komanoff, an economist who has long championed cycling, was no less unhappy. "How often do we hear drivers at crash scenes say, 'I didn't see him,' about the bicyclist they plowed into," he said.
 With the self-certification, the department says that anyone caught lying could face criminal prosecution. And it points out that eight other states have similar systems.
 Dr. Orloff, for one, takes little comfort in that. "New York has always been a state that's protected its citizens," he said.
 In effect, the new rules return the department to the 1990s, another era of tightened belts, when Albany imposed a similar policy to save some money. There was "no negative impact on traffic safety," said Barbara J. Fiala, the motor vehicles commissioner.
 But even then, eye doctors and others said that skimping on eye tests was risky. Under pressure, officialdom restored the exams in 2000.
 I talked in 2000 with Dr. Robert Kennedy, who was then president of the ophthalmological society. He allowed that doctors in his group had told him that "some people who were legally blind were out there driving." Asked if anyone had died as a consequence, Dr. Kennedy replied, "No comment."
 With a gulp, I took that as a yes.

HEADLINE: Making Change Happen, on a Deadline

BYLINE: TINA ROSENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Rapid Results, a strategy designed for corporations, is helping communities in Africa set goals and solve problems in 100 days or less. 

 BODY:
The PreFabricated Building Parts Production Enterprise in Addis Ababa is a state-owned company that makes concrete walls and other structures, mainly for the Ethiopian government's low-cost housing program. Public-sector construction companies in the third world are not generally known for energy, flexibility, risk-taking or creative thinking. PreFabricated, in other words, does not seem like the kind of business that would or could do astonishing things in a hurry.
Like many companies in AIDS-wracked Ethiopia, PreFabricated had an AIDS policy, which included extra pay for its H.I.V. positive workers so they could buy more food. In March, 2008, the company decided to do more. It set a goal of persuading 70 percent of its employees - 700 people - to get tested for H.I.V. in 100 days.
This was a startling idea. "Employees do not like to get tested at work because of privacy concerns," said Seife Mergia, the company's head of planning and information. Most of the employees did not work at headquarters, but were scattered around various construction sites. They were mostly contract day laborers - a workforce few companies invest in. Yet by day 40 the company had built a clinic. It set up a lab and hired a technician. It gave people credible evidence that their H.I.V. status would be confidential. At the 120-day mark, 900 people had been tested for H.I.V.
PreFabricated surpassed its goal using a strategy called Rapid Results, in which a group of people choose a project and carry it out in 100 days. Companies in Addis that used Rapid Results got their H.I.V. testing rates up to about 75 percent - triple the norm. The same method has been used in Nicaragua to help pig farmers raise fatter pigs and to improve dairy farms' milk quality. In Rwanda, two villages doubled the number of attended births in less than 100 days, and the Rapid Results team went on to work on other projects to protect mothers' health. In Madagascar, four districts quintupled the use of family planning services in 50 days, and the Health Ministry then began the program on a national scale. Kenya is using Rapid Results in virtually all its ministries; one campaign in the province of Nyanza circumcised 40,000 men in two months - a crucial achievement for AIDS prevention. Rapid Results has made Kenya by far the leader in Africa in scaling up circumcision. Villages in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Eritrea and other countries have used Rapid Results to improve local infrastructure as well - digging wells, constructing bridges and roads, building schools.
Rapid Results is an eccentric idea. Nadim Matta, a management consultant who is president of the Rapid Results Institute in Stamford, Conn., likes to say that what's missing to turn poor places into rich places isn't more information, money, technology, workshops, programs, evaluation or any of the other things that development organizations normally provide. What's missing are motivation and confidence.
At first glance, this seems crazy - can we cheerlead our way into the middle class?
What Matta means is that usually the obstacle to development is not that we don't have the tools, but that we don't use the tools we have. People drag their feet. The next step is someone else's problem. Budget approval takes forever. The money disappears. People won't try because it never works. The goal is too pie-in-the-sky. The parts aren't available. The bricks get stolen. The project gets started and then the leadership changes and it sits, abandoned. Every villager fumes: nothing gets around here.
"The biggest issue is that people don't actually mobilize," said Matta. "The last mile is where solutions need to come together in specific ways. We think we have part of the answer to the last mile problem."
That list of complaints may sound familiar to anyone who manages a business, and in fact, Rapid Results was designed to help large corporations. It was invented about 40 years ago by Robert Schaffer, a management consultant. Five years ago, Schaffer's company spun off a group as a nonprofit to train people all around the world to use the same method. Rapid Results has spread, well, rapidly, because it has a champion in the World Bank, which is teaching people to use the method in various countries. So are other groups, such as the African Capacity Building Foundation.
It works like this: A trained facilitator sits down with people in a business, organization or village to decide on what to do. They vote. Now, if we had some money from the government or the World Bank - say, $5,000 or perhaps $30,000 - how could we spend it to accomplish that goal in just 100 days? The village chooses its goal and how to get it done. The facilitator only talks about what villages have accomplished in 100 days.
To build confidence, before they make decisions the teams play a pass-the-tennis-ball game. The first time through, a team of eight will pass the balls in about 15 seconds. "Then we share with them that we've done it hundreds of times with different groups around the world, and every one manages to do it in under three seconds," said Ronnie Hammad, a World Bank senior operations officer who has been using Rapid Results programs for 10 years. "At first they try to do the same thing faster. Then they begin to question the rules. Inevitably, after seven or eight tries, they get it. It happens with senior managers at the World Bank and with commercial sex workers in Eritrea. Leadership emerges. It unleashes creativity and innovation. It's an experience of what might be possible for them."
At first, the 100 days seems ridiculous. Groups that turn to Rapid Results have usually had the repeated experience of nothing happening in three years. Who can accomplish something significant in three months? But this is exactly the point - it takes a project out of the realm of business as usual.
With the facilitator offering coaching - for example, she will require that by the halfway point in the project, the team have a plan for how to sustain it - the team members meet, often weekly, to talk about how to get around setbacks and what worked elsewhere.
Frannie Leautier, the executive secretary of the African Capacity Building Foundation, wrote in an e-mail that Rapid Results initiatives are a "bite-sized approach to complex problem-solving. Communities will get confidence to tackle problems that may seem insurmountable." The tight deadline "forces a degree of prioritization and focus which leads to results, avoiding white elephant projects which tend to be grandiose but not implementable."
The deadline creates an ethos of doing whatever it takes. People aren't sitting and waiting for the district official to come out. They go buy the materials themselves. Women sleep on the bulk cement bags to make sure no one steals them. A village in Sudan needed bricks for a school, and the contractor wasn't producing enough. So the Rapid Results team organized a competition in the community to make bricks, and the project stayed on schedule. "You can't control what happens 10 years down the road," says Mats Karlsson, a senior World Bank official who used Rapid Results in several West African countries when he was country director in Ghana. "But 100 days everyone can control."
Hammad said that when he arrived in Eritrea and surveyed World Bank activity, "there were lots of workshops, lots of ground being prepared - but nothing you could put your hands on to demonstrate real results." With Rapid Results, he said, "you saw the same people, the same resources, the same conditions - and an order of magnitude difference in terms of performance."
While Rapid Results can produce dramatic changes in 100 days, questions remain about day 101. Sustainability has always been the weak point of development work, whose symbol might well be the lonely water pump, abandoned for lack of a $3 part. Even a successful Rapid Results team is going to move on to other priorities after 100 days, and it will always be tempting to cut corners - or whole sides - to make the deadline. Next week, I'll respond to reader comments and discuss how Rapid Results' architects are grappling with the challenge of not just achieving results, but making them last.

HEADLINE: Job Losses Across the Developed World

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The sectors hardest hit in the 2008-9 downturn were mining, manufacturing and utilities, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 

 BODY:
Across the developed world, the biggest job losses in the 2008-9 downturn were in mining, manufacturing and utilities, according to new data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Here's a chart showing job losses and gains by sector for a selection of developed countries. Bars above the horizontal axis show industries that added jobs, and bars below the axis show industries that lost jobs. The red bars refer to jobs lost in mining, manufacturing and utilities:
Across the entire O.E.C.D., job losses in this sector equaled 35.3 percent of total employment changes in 2008 and 2009.
The biggest gains, by contrast, were in community, personal and social services (the light blue bars).
This is probably no surprise to people who have been following job trends in the United States, where the health industry has been going gangbusters in both good and bad economies. But actually growth across the broader sector has been smaller in the United States than elsewhere in the developed world.
In the United States, growth in community, personal and social services totaled 8.2 percent of overall employment changes in 2008-9, whereas across all O.E.C.D. member countries this supersector added jobs that equaled 18.3 percent of total job changes during the same period.

HEADLINE: In Fast-Gentrifying Bed-Stuy, a Celebration of Early Black Settlers

BYLINE: ALEXIS OKEOWO


HIGHLIGHT: A heritage center celebrates Weeksville, a 19th-century settlement in Brooklyn established by free blacks that was rediscovered only in 1968. 

 BODY:
On a clear spring day in 1968, residents of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, including retirees and Boy Scouts, were on their hands and knees, digging underneath the intersection of Troy Avenue and Dean Street in what would become a major neighborhood archaeological excavation. 
What they found were the remnants of a village called Weeksville, one of the country's first free-black communities where blacks owned property and ran businesses, a hospital and a school as nearby states like New Jersey continued to sanction slavery. 
Many of the houses were torn down by the New York City Housing Authority to make way for public housing. But a remaining few were restored by a group called the Society for the Preservation of Weeksville and Bedford-Stuyvesant History that worked to unearth and preserve the village. The society later became the Weeksville Heritage Center, an organization that promotes African-American history.
The traces of a place that has been largely forgotten are finally resurfacing as the center prepares to display artifacts from over 50 years of excavations. The objects, most of which have been in storage for decades, will be on permanent rotation at the heritage center's new $30 million extension, a building that will have space for more arts and educational offerings when it opens next year. 
"This was a history that was lost, and part of our mission is to make sure that doesn't happen again," said Jennifer Scott, research director at the Weeksville Heritage Center. 
The original Weeksville was discovered when a community-survey class at the nearby Pratt Institute studied old maps and directories of New York, and noticed the existence of a black colony. They decided to see if physical vestiges remained. An instructor for the class, Jim Hurley, had been researching Bedford-Stuyvesant and wanted to investigate a cluster of houses in the neighborhood that he suspected were from the 19th century, when Weeksville was established. He met Joseph Haines, a Metropolitan Transportation Authority engineer and pilot who was interested in his effort, and they rented a propeller plane to fly over the area looking for architectural evidence. 
Within the cluster, they discovered four houses that were not aligned with the street, an oddity that suggested to Mr. Hurley that the houses' construction predated the modern street grid. Mr. Hurley verified through property deeds and tax documents that the houses were part of the historic village. After learning that the city was going to tear down the houses, he and neighborhood residents mounted a successful campaign to save what became known as the Hunterfly Road Houses.
The history of Weeksville stretches back to 1838, when a black longshoreman, James Weeks, who was a well-known leader in the black-suffrage movement, bought property from a black landowner to gain citizenship and voting rights. 
At the time, black men could not become citizens or vote without owning at least $250 worth of property. Mr. Weeks bought $1,500 in land, and a few other other free black men did so as well and founded Weeksville. Mr. Weeks and his partners divided the land into plots and sold them to other black families, many of whom had come from the South. They placed ads in several newspapers recruiting new residents. At its height, Weeksville was home to 700 families.
Some of the artifacts from Weeksville are already on display at the Hunterfly Road Houses, including photographs from the late 1800s of well-dressed residents at social clubs, playing cards, sports and music. Other items, including remarkably intact China, glass inkwells, tintypes of nattily attired men and women, and illustrated dance cards, will be shown when the center opens. There will also be recorded oral histories, film clips and newspaper articles.
The heritage center's ambitious campaign to preserve the neighborhood's history has inspired residents who are working to protect the neighborhood from gentrification. 
"We get a lot of calls for advice on how to get where we are today from people who want to landmark other sites in Bed-Stuy," Ms. Scott said.
In recent months, residents have petitioned the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission to expand the existing Stuyvesant Heights Historic District and to establish new ones, including a district called Bedford Corners. 
"These blocks are a catalog of fine architecture through the 19th century," said Claudette Brady, the chairwoman of the Bedford Corners Historic District Joint Block Association, as she walked down a block of Hancock Street on a recent day. Elegant, neo-brick brownstones in browns, lavenders, creams and reds were adorned with stone carvings, glimmering metalwork, terra cotta tiles, wrought-iron railings and stained glass. 
An amateur architectural historian, Daniel Thompson - Ms. Brady joked that he was "possessed by the ghost of a little old Victorian woman who used to live in his house" - accompanied her. "What's surprising is that these buildings have remained so intact through the years with no protection, but development is much more aggressive now," said Mr. Thompson, who has lived in Bed-Stuy for 11 years. "Some of this architecture, you won't find in Manhattan. So if it's lost here, it's lost forever."
The Weeksville Heritage Center is also applying to have two churches, a school and a public art sculpture that fall within the historical boundaries of the original Weeksville community declared landmarks. 
Residents want to hold on to the past because the story of Weeksville and many parts of Bedford-Stuyvesant is "really rare," said Elissa Blount-Moorhead, director of programs and exhibitions at the Weeksville Heritage Center. "There's no other narrative like this."

HEADLINE: Keeping (Weaker) Eyes on the Road

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: The elimination of eye tests from the driver's license renewal process has a board member and past president of the New York State Ophthalmological Society shaking his head. Also, what City Room is reading in other papers and blogs. 

 BODY:
Dr. Paul N. Orloff has been examining eyes for three decades, and a verity he has learned is that people are often the worst judges of their own vision. "Everybody says they have normal eyes," said Dr. Orloff, an ophthalmologist in Manhattan. "Their vision gets worse, and they don't even know it because the change is subtle."
 So a new edict from the state's Department of Motor Vehicles has the doctor, a board member and past president of the New York State Ophthalmological Society, shaking his head. It's not that he finds it hard to understand. He finds it impossible to understand.
 "I think it puts the public at considerable risk," he said, adding: "From a safety standpoint, it's an enormous issue." 
 As of Wednesday, New York drivers seeking to renew their licenses no longer had to pass an eye test. Now, all they need to do is "self-certify" that they see just fine. Motor Vehicles will take their word for it, without knowing if they can put eagles to shame or if they are slipping into Magoo territory.
 All too often, Dr. Orloff said, "people deny their visual needs." If objects start to become blurred, many simply accept that as a new normal. Some older men and women are tempted to shade the truth about fading vision out of fear of being isolated at home if denied the right to drive.
 The department says its new policy was a response to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's call for "streamlined" government. But what may be streamlining for some is cutting corners for others.
 "This is inconceivable to us, and so penny-wise and pound-foolish," said Dr. Orloff, who was speaking on behalf of the ophthalmological society.
 To qualify for a driver's license, a New Yorker must have 20-40 vision or better, with or without corrective lenses. First-time drivers and those holding commercial licenses will still have to take eye tests.
 For a license renewal, ensuring that an applicant meets minimum standards has involved nothing more complex than reading a few lines on an eye chart. In my experience, that takes all of five seconds at the nearest motor vehicles bureau, which may have once qualified as a synonym for purgatory but is admirably efficient these days.
 The new policy has made for some interesting allies. Advocates for motorists and for bicyclists share a distaste for the change. "We were taken by surprise," said John A. Corelett, who is chairman of the legislative committee for AAA New York State.
 Charles Komanoff, an economist who has long championed cycling, was no less unhappy. "How often do we hear drivers at crash scenes say, 'I didn't see him,' about the bicyclist they plowed into," he said.
 With the self-certification, the department says that anyone caught lying could face criminal prosecution. And it points out that eight other states have similar systems.
 Dr. Orloff, for one, takes little comfort in that. "New York has always been a state that's protected its citizens," he said.
 In effect, the new rules return the department to the 1990s, another era of tightened belts, when Albany imposed a similar policy to save some money. There was "no negative impact on traffic safety," said Barbara J. Fiala, the motor vehicles commissioner.
 But even then, eye doctors and others said that skimping on eye tests was risky. Under pressure, officialdom restored the exams in 2000.
 I talked in 2000 with Dr. Robert Kennedy, who was then president of the ophthalmological society. He allowed that doctors in his group had told him that "some people who were legally blind were out there driving." Asked if anyone had died as a consequence, Dr. Kennedy replied, "No comment."
 With a gulp, I took that as a yes.

HEADLINE: Peoria Got a Raise

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: In the first quarter, the average weekly wage increased by 5.2 percent compared to the same period in 2010. But in Peoria County, Ill., workers received an average raise of 18.9 percent, to $944. 

 BODY:
In the first quarter of this year, the average weekly wage in the United States increased by 5.2 percent, to $935, compared to the same period last year. But in Peoria County, Ill., workers received an average raise of 18.9 percent, to $944.
That's according to a report released Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on employment and pay for the 322 largest counties.
The county with the biggest cut in average weekly wages was Williamson County, Tex., where wages fell 3.8 percent, to $953.
In raw dollar figures, New York County (Manhattan) once again had the highest average weekly wage, at $2,634, and the biggest raise, at $222 (9.2 percent).
The county with the biggest increase in employment was also in the Midwest: Elkhart County, Ind., which gained 6.2 percent more jobs over the year, compared to the national average of 1.2 percent job growth. Elkhart County was primarily buoyed by manufacturing, which added 5,125 jobs over the year (12.4 percent).
Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics
On the other hand, Sacramento County, Calif., lost the highest percentage of jobs of all the major counties. Its employment fell by 1.6 percent year over year.

HEADLINE: Chinese Stocks Plummet on News of Justice Department Inquiry

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: Robert Khuzami, the S.E.C. enforcement chief, says that federal prosecutors are looking into accounting irregularities at Chinese companies. 

 BODY:
Shares of some Chinese companies listed on exchanges in the United States tumbled on Thursday after a top American regulator said that the Justice Department was reviewing accounting irregularities at various companies based in China.
Chinese Internet companies were particularly hard hit, including Youku and Tudou, Chinese video posting sites, as well as Baidu, Sohu and Sina, also Internet stocks. The drop in share prices came afterReuters published an interview with Robert Khuzami, the enforcement chief at the Securities and Exchange Commission, who indicated that federal prosecutors were looking into possible accounting frauds.
 "There are parts of the Justice Department that are actively engaged in this area," Mr. Khuzami said, according to Reuters. 
The S.E.C. confirmed his comments. The Justice Department declined to comment.
Youku's American depository receipts closed down 18 percent, Tudou ended down 10 percent, Baidu fell 9 percent, Sohu dropped almost 5 percent and Sina fell nearly 10 percent. 
Not all United States-listed Chinese companies suffered - some stocks rose during the session, including LDK Solar's American depository receipts, which rose more than 1 percent.
An area of particular interest for regulators has been so-called reverse merger companies. These go public by purchasing the shares of defunct public companies and assuming their tickers. In recent months, such companies have been criticized by researchers who claim to have found repeated instances of fraud in their accounting. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission has halted trading in more than a dozen such stocks this year, often after auditors have resigned over accounting irregularities. While some Chinese companies have fired auditors, others have restated earnings or owned up to lying about assets. These admissions have cost billions of dollars in market value and harmed other reverse-merger companies that have not been accused of any wrongdoing. 
The share prices of a number of reverse merger companies fell sharply on Thursday, including AgFeed Industries and China Auto Logistics.
The steep losses in stocks have also prompted a wave of shareholder lawsuits against companies, auditors and even the banks that ushered these companies to market. One in every four federal securities class-action lawsuits filed this year relates to such firms, according to a study published this summer by the Securities Class Action Clearinghouse at Stanford Law School and Cornerstone Research in Boston.
One recent high profile example is Sino-Forest, whose share price was decimated after Muddy Waters Research charged that it was falsely claiming assets and that it amounted to a Ponzi scheme. China MediaExpress and Duoyuan Global Water are other reverse-merger companies whose stock prices have tumbled this year after accusations of fraud.
Reverse mergers have enabled companies to tap the American capital markets without having to undergo the arduous process of an initial offering. 
But as more and more of these companies come under fire from bloggers and investors betting against their share prices, the government has started to take a closer look at them. 
The S.E.C. has sent a steady stream of warnings to investors about the risks associated with investing in such companies. Exchanges have delisted the companies that have fallen under scrutiny or failed to file disclosures and statements in a timely manner.
But while the S.E.C. has been vocal about its investigation of these firms, it was unclear until the interview with Mr. Khuzami whether the Justice Department was looking into these allegations as well.

HEADLINE: Why Lehman May Be a Long, Slow Train Ride

BYLINE: STEPHEN J. LUBBEN


HIGHLIGHT: As in the giant bankruptcy of Penn Central four decades ago, litigation stemming from Lehman's bankruptcy could go on for years and years. 

 BODY:
In 1970 the Penn Central railroad unexpectedly filed for bankruptcy, nearly taking down the money market in the process. It was the biggest bankruptcy case of its time, and litigation surrounding the case continued well past the turn of the century.
Penn Central might give us some insight into the fate that awaits Lehman Brothers, even as it nears approval of its Chapter 11 plan.
Take Lehman's important litigation against JPMorgan Chase. On the eve of Lehman's collapse, JPMorgan demanded several different types of special protection, including liens and guarantees. Normally this would be a slam-dunk win for Lehman. The bankruptcy code is premised on the notion of creditor equality, and in an effort to avert gaming of that system it includes a rule that looks back 90 days before the case is filed. Creditors who improve their position during that time lose the benefit of that improvement. This protects the equality principle, and helps to make "runs" on the debtor company pointless.
The reason that this is not an easy case turns on the "safe harbor" provisions of the bankruptcy code, which exempt several broad classes of financial transactions from the normal rules of bankruptcy, especially with regard to derivative contracts. JPMorgan essentially argues that these provisions blow a giant, C.D.S.-sized hole in Lehman's case.
So where do things stand in the case?
First off, the parties are fighting over which judge can hear the case. As I predicted in an earlier DealBook column, the Supreme Court's opinion in Stern v. Marshall has created an opportunity for defendants to argue that their case can't be heard in bankruptcy court anymore. JPMorgan has taken up that opportunity, arguing in a 45-page brief that the case must move to the Federal District Court in Manhattan.
Of course that court has other things to do besides hearing bankruptcy cases, and some of those tasks, like criminal trials, get priority. If the case does move to the district court - and even the fight over moving the case might not be short - we can expect an already lengthy trial to take even longer.
JPMorgan has argued that its move to invoke Stern is not about preferring one forum over another. Maybe, but it could have waived the Stern argument and it didn't.
The news is pretty much the same in other cases coming out of the financial crisis. In Washington Mutual, the second attempt at a plan has been rejected by the bankruptcy court, the hedge funds who got dinged in the judge's opinion are appealing, and the shareholders have just hired Frank Partnoy, a well-known law professor and finance expert, to examine the claims they might have regarding the entire WaMu mess. 
Penn Central may seem speedy compared with these cases.

HEADLINE: McGraw-Hill in Talks to Lead Stock Indexes Joint Venture

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: If consummated, the new joint venture would operate both McGraw-Hill's venerable Standard &#038; Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average. 

 BODY:
Two of the best-known stock market gauges in the world - the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 - may share the same home under a deal being discussed. 
McGraw-Hill, the owner of Standard & Poor's, is in advanced talks with the CME Group Inc., which owns Dow Jones Indexes, about forming a joint venture, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. 
Under the current terms of the talks, McGraw-Hill would own about 75 percent of the joint venture, while CME would own about 25 percent, one of these people said. Dow Jones, which owns about 10 percent of the Dow Jones index business and must approve any transaction, would receive a minimal stake in the new entity.
 A deal could be reached within a few weeks, though the discussions may still fall apart, this person cautioned.
Spokeswomen for McGraw-Hill and CME declined to comment. A representative for Dow Jones, which is owned by the News Corporation, was not immediately available for comment.
If consummated, such a joint venture would be the first time the S.&P. 500 and the Dow lived under one roof. Since their creation - the Dow in 1896, the S.&P. 500 in 1957 - both market measures have become permanent fixtures in the American economy and the most popular representations of the ups and downs of the stock market. 
For many of America's biggest corporations, there are few more potent signs of dominance than being included in either index, and falling out of either imparts something of a stigma. 
Those two benchmarks, however, are just the tip of a huge business. The companies own hundreds of thousands of indexes that track stocks, commodities and more exotic investments. Dow Jones Indexes alone has more than 130,000 indexes. Licensing these indexes for financial products can be a lucrative business.
The joint venture deal has been taking shape as McGraw-Hill has sought to revamp its operations to bolster its stock price. Earlier this month, the publisher said it would split into two publicly traded businesses by spinning off its education unit. The remaining operations - including the Standard & Poor's index unit and its credit ratings arm - would live on as McGraw-Hill Markets.
It is that company that is expected to house the expanded stock indexes business, the person briefed on the matter said.
By combining the two operations, the three companies are hoping to create a robust leader in market index products, including derivatives of their flagship products. It would also harness the growth in exchange-traded funds, many of which are built on permutations of major indexes.
It is unclear how the two activist investors pushing for greater changes at McGraw-Hill - the hedge fund Jana Partners and Canada's Ontario Teachers Pension Plan - view the potential joint venture. This summer, Jana and Ontario Teachers had called for a bigger breakup of McGraw-Hill.
But the company has resisted that push. While it agreed that its education unit would be better off as a separate business - it began preparing for that in March - McGraw-Hill has argued that keeping the rest of its businesses together, including its indexes operation, would make for a stronger company.
Representatives for Jana and Ontario Teachers were not immediately available for comment.
Shares in McGraw-Hill rose about 1.4 percent in after-hours trading after The Wall Street Journal reported the talks. They closed on Thursday at $42.31.

Shares of some Chinese companies listed on exchanges in the United States tumbled on Thursday after a top American regulator said that the Justice Department was reviewing accounting irregularities at various companies based in China.
Chinese Internet companies were particularly hard hit, including Youku and Tudou, Chinese video posting sites, as well as Baidu, Sohu and Sina, also Internet stocks. The drop in share prices came afterReuters published an interview with Robert Khuzami, the enforcement chief at the Securities and Exchange Commission, who indicated that federal prosecutors were looking into possible accounting frauds.
 "There are parts of the Justice Department that are actively engaged in this area," Mr. Khuzami said, according to Reuters. 
The S.E.C. confirmed his comments. The Justice Department declined to comment.
Youku's American depository receipts closed down 18 percent, Tudou ended down 10 percent, Baidu fell 9 percent, Sohu dropped almost 5 percent and Sina fell nearly 10 percent. 
Not all United States-listed Chinese companies suffered - some stocks rose during the session, including LDK Solar's American depository receipts, which rose more than 1 percent.
An area of particular interest for regulators has been so-called reverse merger companies. These go public by purchasing the shares of defunct public companies and assuming their tickers. In recent months, such companies have been criticized by researchers who claim to have found repeated instances of fraud in their accounting. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission has halted trading in more than a dozen such stocks this year, often after auditors have resigned over accounting irregularities. While some Chinese companies have fired auditors, others have restated earnings or owned up to lying about assets. These admissions have cost billions of dollars in market value and harmed other reverse-merger companies that have not been accused of any wrongdoing. 
The share prices of a number of reverse merger companies fell sharply on Thursday, including AgFeed Industries and China Auto Logistics.
The steep losses in stocks have also prompted a wave of shareholder lawsuits against companies, auditors and even the banks that ushered these companies to market. One in every four federal securities class-action lawsuits filed this year relates to such firms, according to a study published this summer by the Securities Class Action Clearinghouse at Stanford Law School and Cornerstone Research in Boston.
One recent high profile example is Sino-Forest, whose share price was decimated after Muddy Waters Research charged that it was falsely claiming assets and that it amounted to a Ponzi scheme. China MediaExpress and Duoyuan Global Water are other reverse-merger companies whose stock prices have tumbled this year after accusations of fraud.
Reverse mergers have enabled companies to tap the American capital markets without having to undergo the arduous process of an initial offering. 
But as more and more of these companies come under fire from bloggers and investors betting against their share prices, the government has started to take a closer look at them. 
The S.E.C. has sent a steady stream of warnings to investors about the risks associated with investing in such companies. Exchanges have delisted the companies that have fallen under scrutiny or failed to file disclosures and statements in a timely manner.
But while the S.E.C. has been vocal about its investigation of these firms, it was unclear until the interview with Mr. Khuzami whether the Justice Department was looking into these allegations as well.

HEADLINE: Why Lehman May Be a Long, Slow Train Ride

BYLINE: STEPHEN J. LUBBEN


HIGHLIGHT: As in the giant bankruptcy of Penn Central four decades ago, litigation stemming from Lehman's bankruptcy could go on for years and years. 

 BODY:
In 1970 the Penn Central railroad unexpectedly filed for bankruptcy, nearly taking down the money market in the process. It was the biggest bankruptcy case of its time, and litigation surrounding the case continued well past the turn of the century.
Penn Central might give us some insight into the fate that awaits Lehman Brothers, even as it nears approval of its Chapter 11 plan.
Take Lehman's important litigation against JPMorgan Chase. On the eve of Lehman's collapse, JPMorgan demanded several different types of special protection, including liens and guarantees. Normally this would be a slam-dunk win for Lehman. The bankruptcy code is premised on the notion of creditor equality, and in an effort to avert gaming of that system it includes a rule that looks back 90 days before the case is filed. Creditors who improve their position during that time lose the benefit of that improvement. This protects the equality principle, and helps to make "runs" on the debtor company pointless.
The reason that this is not an easy case turns on the "safe harbor" provisions of the bankruptcy code, which exempt several broad classes of financial transactions from the normal rules of bankruptcy, especially with regard to derivative contracts. JPMorgan essentially argues that these provisions blow a giant, C.D.S.-sized hole in Lehman's case.
So where do things stand in the case?
First off, the parties are fighting over which judge can hear the case. As I predicted in an earlier DealBook column, the Supreme Court's opinion in Stern v. Marshall has created an opportunity for defendants to argue that their case can't be heard in bankruptcy court anymore. JPMorgan has taken up that opportunity, arguing in a 45-page brief that the case must move to the Federal District Court in Manhattan.
Of course that court has other things to do besides hearing bankruptcy cases, and some of those tasks, like criminal trials, get priority. If the case does move to the district court - and even the fight over moving the case might not be short - we can expect an already lengthy trial to take even longer.
JPMorgan has argued that its move to invoke Stern is not about preferring one forum over another. Maybe, but it could have waived the Stern argument and it didn't.
The news is pretty much the same in other cases coming out of the financial crisis. In Washington Mutual, the second attempt at a plan has been rejected by the bankruptcy court, the hedge funds who got dinged in the judge's opinion are appealing, and the shareholders have just hired Frank Partnoy, a well-known law professor and finance expert, to examine the claims they might have regarding the entire WaMu mess. 
Penn Central may seem speedy compared with these cases.

HEADLINE: McGraw-Hill in Talks to Lead Stock Indexes Joint Venture

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: If consummated, the new joint venture would operate both McGraw-Hill's venerable Standard &#038; Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average. 

 BODY:
Two of the best-known stock market gauges in the world - the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 - may share the same home under a deal being discussed. 
McGraw-Hill, the owner of Standard & Poor's, is in advanced talks with the CME Group Inc., which owns Dow Jones Indexes, about forming a joint venture, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. 
Under the current terms of the talks, McGraw-Hill would own about 75 percent of the joint venture, while CME would own about 25 percent, one of these people said. Dow Jones, which owns about 10 percent of the Dow Jones index business and must approve any transaction, would receive a minimal stake in the new entity.
 A deal could be reached within a few weeks, though the discussions may still fall apart, this person cautioned.
Spokeswomen for McGraw-Hill and CME declined to comment. A representative for Dow Jones, which is owned by the News Corporation, was not immediately available for comment.
If consummated, such a joint venture would be the first time the S.&P. 500 and the Dow lived under one roof. Since their creation - the Dow in 1896, the S.&P. 500 in 1957 - both market measures have become permanent fixtures in the American economy and the most popular representations of the ups and downs of the stock market. 
For many of America's biggest corporations, there are few more potent signs of dominance than being included in either index, and falling out of either imparts something of a stigma. 
Those two benchmarks, however, are just the tip of a huge business. The companies own hundreds of thousands of indexes that track stocks, commodities and more exotic investments. Dow Jones Indexes alone has more than 130,000 indexes. Licensing these indexes for financial products can be a lucrative business.
The joint venture deal has been taking shape as McGraw-Hill has sought to revamp its operations to bolster its stock price. Earlier this month, the publisher said it would split into two publicly traded businesses by spinning off its education unit. The remaining operations - including the Standard & Poor's index unit and its credit ratings arm - would live on as McGraw-Hill Markets.
It is that company that is expected to house the expanded stock indexes business, the person briefed on the matter said.
By combining the two operations, the three companies are hoping to create a robust leader in market index products, including derivatives of their flagship products. It would also harness the growth in exchange-traded funds, many of which are built on permutations of major indexes.
It is unclear how the two activist investors pushing for greater changes at McGraw-Hill - the hedge fund Jana Partners and Canada's Ontario Teachers Pension Plan - view the potential joint venture. This summer, Jana and Ontario Teachers had called for a bigger breakup of McGraw-Hill.
But the company has resisted that push. While it agreed that its education unit would be better off as a separate business - it began preparing for that in March - McGraw-Hill has argued that keeping the rest of its businesses together, including its indexes operation, would make for a stronger company.
Representatives for Jana and Ontario Teachers were not immediately available for comment.
Shares in McGraw-Hill rose about 1.4 percent in after-hours trading after The Wall Street Journal reported the talks. They closed on Thursday at $42.31.

HEADLINE: Sept. 29, 1957 | New York Giants Play Last Baseball Game

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On Sept. 29, 1957, the New York Giants baseball team played its final game at the Polo Grounds in Manhattan. 

 BODY:
On Sept. 29, 1957, the New York Giants baseball team played its final game in Manhattan. The Giants moved to San Francisco the following year, while its National League rivals, the Brooklyn Dodgers, moved to Los Angeles.
The Sept. 30 New York Times reported: "Thousands of fans responded to the final melancholy out by chasing their California-bound idols to the clubhouse - and carrying away everything on the field that could be moved. The mass pursuit was touched off by affection, excitement, nostalgia, curiosity and annoyance at the fact the team next year will represent San Francisco."

The New York Giants had once been a prosperous club with stars like Willie Mays on the roster, but attendance sagged as many New Yorkers moved to the suburbs and the stadium, called the Polo Grounds, at West 155th Street and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, became increasingly outdated and dilapidated. In the Giants' final seasons in New York, fans were drawn to the more successful Yankees -- and their newer stadium just across the Harlem River in the South Bronx.
The move to California was driven by the Brooklyn Dodgers' owner Walter O'Malley, who wanted a new stadium but clashed with the New York City parks commissioner, Robert Moses, over where to build it. To move the Dodgers to Los Angeles, Mr. O'Malley needed a second team on the West Coast to ease travel for the National League's other teams, none of whom were situated west of St. Louis. Mr. O'Malley persuaded the Giants' owner Horace Stoneham, who was flirting with the idea of moving the team to Minnesota, to choose San Francisco instead.
The Giants' existence in San Francisco has been somewhat tenuous over the years, partly because of the cold temperatures, high winds and fog at the team's Candlestick Park on San Francisco Bay from 1960 until 2000. The team has prospered since moving to the stadium currently known as AT&T Park in 2000. Last year, the Giants won their first World Series championship as a California team.
The legacy of the Giants' and Dodgers' moves still elicit mixed views. While Mr. O'Malley, and to a much lesser extent Mr. Stoneham, remains reviled in New York, he is heralded as a visionary who proved that baseball could thrive in the western states.

Professional teams often use the threat of moving to force cities to finance new stadiums. Nearly all large sporting sites built in the last 20 years have been financed primarily by taxpayers -- the San Francisco Giants' AT&T Park is one of the few exceptions. Despite claims by teams that new stadiums promote economic growth, stadium deals often leave cities with large debts and little economic benefit.
After years of contentious debate and protest, an arena at Atlantic Yards near downtown Brooklyn is under now construction. It will be the new home of the National Basketball Association's New Jersey Nets, who will be officially renamed the Brooklyn Nets. Just this past summer, Nassau County voters rejected a proposal to finance a new arena for the National Hockey League's Islanders.
Should taxpayers be expected to finance stadiums for professional teams? Do you believe the potential economic benefits or the prestige in having pro teams justifies the cost for a city in building a stadium? If your favorite team's owner was threatening to move, would you support a plan for taxpayers' money to fund a new stadium or arena, even with the risk of financial burden on your city or county? Why?

HEADLINE: What Would It Take to Save Europe?

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: European leaders need to find a way to address the weaknesses of several nations beyond providing huge sums to stabilize the region, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Official Washington was gripped last weekend by euphoria, at least briefly, as people attending the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund began to talk about how much money it would take to stabilize the situation in Europe. At least one eminence grise suggested that 1.5 trillion euros should do the trick; others were more inclined to err on the side of caution, and their estimates ran as high as four trillion euros.
This is a lot of money. Germany's annual gross domestic product is only about 2.5 trillion euros, and the combined G.D.P. of the entire euro zone is about 9.5 trillion euros. The idea is that providing a huge package of financial support would awe the markets into submission -- meaning that people would stop selling their holdings of Italian or Spanish debt, and thus stop pushing up interest rates. 
Ideally, investors would also give Greece and Portugal some time to find their way to back to growth. 
But this is the wrong way to think about the problem. The issue is not money in the form of external financial support, whether provided by the I.M.F. or other countries to parts of the European Union. The real questions are whether Italy will get complete and unfettered access to the European Central Bank, and when we will know.

The big-package approach to economic stabilization was most famously demonstrated in the 1994-95 Mexican crisis. With Mexico's currency under great pressure, President Ernesto Zedillo and Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz arranged a $45 billion loan, a large part of which came from the United States. 
This may look small today, but it was then seen as a large amount of support. President Zedillo famously remarked that when markets overreact, policy should in turn overreact -- meaning, in this context, put more money on the table than is needed. When the financial firepower made available is overwhelming, as it was in the Mexican case, it does not have to be used -- in fact, the Mexican loan was repaid in about a year.
But this version of Mexican events skips an important detail. While the external financial support helped prevent the complete collapse of the currency, the Mexican peso did depreciate significantly, which helped immensely. Before the crisis, Mexico had a large current account deficit: it was importing more than it was exporting, and the difference was covered by capital inflows (mostly foreigners willing to lend to the Mexican government). 
When the peso fell in value, exporting from Mexico became much more attractive; an export boom of this kind always helps close the current account deficit and stimulate the economy in a sensible manner.
Important parts of the euro zone, like Portugal, Greece and perhaps Italy, badly need a reduction in their real costs of production. If their currencies were independent, this could be achieved by a depreciation of their market value. But this is not an option within the euro zone, and it is within the zone that they need to become more competitive.
These countries could cut nominal wages -- a course of action being pursued, for example, in Latvia. But Latvia is a special case for many reasons, including its desire to become much closer with the euro zone, which it aspires to join. It is unlikely that any Western European government making such a proposal would last long. 
Unable to move the exchange rate and unwilling to cut wages, the Portuguese government is embarked on an innovative course of "fiscal devaluation," meaning it will cut payroll taxes, to reduce the cost of labor, while increasing the value added tax, or VAT (a tax on consumption), as a way to maintain fiscal revenues. 
Unfortunately, "innovative" in the context of stabilization policies often means "unlikely to succeed" -- and the precise implementation of this plan, with some very complex details, seems fraught with danger.
Europe needs a new fiscal governance mechanism, to be sure. Why would Germany -- or anyone else -- trust Italy under Silvio Berlusconi with a big loan or unlimited access to credit at the European Central Bank?
Greece and some other countries have serious budget difficulties. Most of the European periphery also faces a current account crisis, and something must be done to increase exports or reduce imports, or both. 
If the exchange rate can't depreciate, wages won't be cut and "fiscal devaluation" proves unworkable, activity in these economies will need to slow a great deal in order to reduce imports and bring the current account closer to balance - unless you (or the Germans) are willing to extend these countries large amounts of unconditional credit for the indefinite future.
And if these economies slow, their ability to pay their government debts will increasingly be called into question. Last week the I.M.F. cut the growth forecast for Italy in 2012 to 0.3 percent. With interest rates rising toward 6 percent, it is easy to imagine Italy's debt relative to G.D.P. climbing even further than in the still-benign official projections.
If Italy or any other euro-zone country were in good shape and could pay its debts, the European Central Bank could provide ample short-term support, through buying up bonds to prevent interest rates from reaching unreasonable levels. 
The euro is a reserve currency -- meaning investors around the world hold it as part of their rainy-day funds -- and all European debt is denominated in euros. In Mexico in 1994, for example, much of its debt was in dollars; in such a situation, a foreign loan can help stabilize a crisis, because it provides reserves to the central bank, and this removes the fear that the exchange rate will depreciate excessively. But even in such a case the right policies have to be put in place."
If Italy cannot pay its debt, then the European Central Bank has no business lending to it. The Europeans have to decide for themselves: Is Italy's fiscal policy reasonable and responsible? If yes, provide full support as needed -- from within the euro zone. If not, then find another way forward. 
But please get a move on with this decision.

HEADLINE: Dimon's Bathroom Gets a Diner Double

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: "Power Toilet," an art project that claims to be an exact replica of the executive bathroom at JPMorgan Chase's New York headquarters, has been installed at the Greek-owned Olympic Restaurant on Delancey Street. 

 BODY:
A commode fit for a Wall Street C-suite has made its way to the unlikeliest of places: a greasy-spoon diner on Manhattan's Lower East Side.
"Power Toilet," an art project that claims to be an exact replica of the executive bathroom at JPMorgan Chase's New York headquarters, has been installed at the Greek-owned Olympic Restaurant on Delancey Street. The installation is the work of SuperFlex, an art group from Denmark, in conjunction with Creative Time, a non-profit that arranges public art projects around New York City.
"It's a political project," said Ann Pasternak, the president of Creative Time. "It's about making private spaces public. And it's about the excesses of Wall Street, and saying, 'enough is enough.'"
It's not clear how accurate Olympic's loo look-alike is. (For one thing, there is no designated restroom for executives at JPMorgan's New York headquarters, according to one person familiar with the bank's floorplan.) But one art blog wrote that Superflex was able to mimic every detail of the bank's bathroom thanks to an "anonymous inside source who was able to take camera phone photos and make measurements of the space."
To get to the gilded bathroom at the decidedly unpretentious Olympic Restaurant, visitors must walk past Olympic's 13-seat lunch counter to a faded red door marked with a sign. A dingy concrete staircase lit with a single bare bulb leads to the restroom, which is marked with a small sign about the project.
The bathroom itself features a Kohler sink, Crane toilet, and quilted toilet paper, along with a framed print of a potted flower. Therenovation cost more than $10,000, Ms. Pasternak said.
The meaning of the piece, according to organizers, has to do with the dissolution of private space and the introduction of democratic public spaces in their place. SuperFlex did a similar project in the Netherlands, installing a replica of the United Nations Security Council's bathroom in a public park.
"All good art has multiple messages," said Ms. Pasternak. "You can trace this piece from Duchamp's urinal and use it as a chance to say, what is art?"
Ms. Pasternak said that while JPMorgan shared responsibility with other Wall Street banks for some issues of economic injustice, the installation wasn't directed specifically at the bank or its chief executive, Jamie Dimon.
"It's not about targeting JPMorgan," she said. "It could have been any bank."
A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment.
The "Power Toilet" show will close October 16, but the upgraded bathroom will remain in Olympic Restaurant indefinitely.
Standing behind the diner's 13-seat counter, Spiros Nakos, the 61-year-old owner of Olympic Restaurant, said he was approached by Creative Time at the end of June about placing the installation in his restaurant, which he has owned since 1980 and which is located near the non-profit's headquarters. Creative Time proposed refurbishing his run-down restroom to Wall Street specs at no cost, and Mr. Nakos quickly agreed.
The restroom has been good for foot traffic to the restaurant, Mr. Nakos said, and has given workers a morale boost.
"I used to feel embarrassed for people to use the bathroom," he said. "Now I'm very proud."
Mr. Nakos said he had only squabbled with the artists behind "Power Toilet" once, when he wanted to install a sign in the bathroom instructing employees to wash their hands - a requirement of the New York City Department of Health - but was told by the artists that since it wasn't in the plan for the piece, it would have to go outside the door instead.
He said that although SuperFlex intended for the gilded bathroom to be available for free public use, he had put his foot down on one key stipulation.
"You have to make a purchase to use it," he said.

HEADLINE: Perry Slumps in Polls, but Not to Romney's Gain

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney has little to cheer about from Rick Perry's decline in recent polls. 

 BODY:
There have been three scientific national polls released of Republican voters since the Sept. 22 debate: a CNN poll that was conducted over the last weekend, and polls by Fox News and Economist/YouGov released on Wednesday.
The polls suggest that Rick Perry's struggles in the debate -- amplified by a storm of skepticism among influential Republicans -- have taken a bite out of his numbers. But the spoils seem to have gone mainly to other conservative candidates in the race, rather than Mr. Romney.
I've taken an average of the polls, with one slight wrinkle. The YouGov poll included Chris Christie, Sarah Palin and Rudolph W. Giuliani as options, and they collectively received 29 percent of the vote. Since none of those candidates are especially likely to run, I have re-allocated their votes based on the distribution of second-place votes in the poll. (Before this adjustment, Mr. Romney and Mr. Christie shared the lead in the poll at 15 percent, with Mr. Perry also essentially tied at 14 percent.)
Mr. Perry led in the CNN poll, the first one released after the debate, but his numbers slumped in the Fox News and YouGov polls. He averages about 22 percent of the vote across the three surveys, down materially from 28 percent in polls conducted between his first debate on Sept. 7, and Sept. 19.
However, any gains for Mr. Romney -- in an absolute rather than relative sense -- are hard to perceive. He averages 22 percent in the surveys, up only nominally from 21 percent before.
Instead, the candidate making the largest gains is Herman Cain, the Georgia entrepreneur who won a straw poll in Florida over the weekend. He's up to 13 percent in the surveys, more than doubling the 6 percent that he had before.
The other candidate to make gains is Newt Gingrich -- up to 10 percent from 7 percent.
The numbers for Ron Paul and Michele Bachmann have slipped somewhat, however. Mrs. Bachmann in particular, who was in the double-digits in many polls at her peak, is now down to about 5 percent of the vote. And a separate poll of Iowa voters shows her having fallen behind Mr. Romney there. (Although I wouldn't put as much emphasis on that one because the pollster in question, American Research Group, has a dubioustrack record.)
Certainly, one way that Mr. Romney could win is if the support among the more conservative portion of the Republican electorate were divided among several different candidates. With the decline in Mr. Perry's numbers, the landscape has become more favorable for him.
Mr. Romney's odds of winning the nomination would improve, moreover, if his main opposition came from a candidate like Mr. Cain rather than Mr. Perry, since there is a much larger gap between the two in areas like fund-raising and establishment support. (Although I would not discount Mr. Cain's chances entirely.)
At the same time, you have a candidate in Mr. Romney who has run a very good campaign, who has performed well in the debates, and who leads in fund-raising and endorsements -- but who is still barely above 20 percent in surveys, and has made only marginal gains as a number of his rivals have stumbled.
Mr. Romney has emerged -- or re-emerged -- as the favorite; I'd give him roughly even odds of winning the nomination. But it's unlikely to be a smooth and linear path, and the alternate hypothesis that Republican voters are determined to pick someone more conservative than him has some support in this data.
That's not to paper over the problems of Mr. Perry, who entered the race in a strong strategic position and has failed to make much of it. It's possible, moreover, that the fallout of the Sept. 22 debate is not yet fully realized in the surveys; Mr. Perry performed somewhat worse in the Fox News and YouGov polls than in the CNN poll, which postdated it by a couple of days.
In general, however, I'd caution against using terms like "momentum" when discussing the nomination race (or polling results under most other circumstances). We'll be publishing a separate article on this shortly, but there's not much evidence of serial correlation in polling data: candidates who decline from one period to the next are just as likely to rebound as to see their numbers continue falling.
Note, for instance, that the candidates to have made the largest gains recently, Mr. Cain and Mr. Gingrich, had numbers that were going in the other direction before that. And at this point four years ago, there were plenty of negative stories circulating about the polling trajectory of Barack Obama and John McCain.

The Supreme Court is likely to decide the fate of the Obama administration's health care overhaul by June 2012 after the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to hear a case concerning the 2010 law. Adam Liptak writes that the development "came unexpectedly fast and makes it all but certain" that the court will hear and decide one or more cases involving the law in the middle of the 2012 presidential campaign.

        
In a back-to-school message on Wednesday, President Obama urged students to keep studying, Mark Landler reports. Acknowledging the strain that the recession had put on families as well as the rise of bullying on the Internet, the president told students at Benjamin Banneker High School in Washington to push themselves to finish high school and later, college.

        
Immigration officials in Washington said on Wednesday that they had swept up nearly 3,000 immigrants with criminal records since August, when the Obama administration adopted a policy emphasizing the deportation of individuals who may pose a public safety threat, Charlie Savage writes.

        
Elsewhere, a federal judge in Alabama upheld the state's far-reaching immigration law against a challenge by the Justice Department, raising the chances that cases concerning the law in Alabama and others in Arizona and Georgia will reach the United States Supreme Court, Campbell Robertson reports.

        
Mitt Romney appears to President Obama and his advisers to be the Republican who could take back the White House, but he has considerable difficulty convincing voters of the same, Jeff Zeleny writes. He looks at how Mr. Romney has struggled to woo supporters and donors who are looking for a fresh face to challenge Mr. Obama next year.

        
At the moment, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is the potential candidate that party operatives are trying to lure into the Republican race. Michael D. Shear and Richard Perez-Pena examine the combination of acrimony and agreement that has marked Mr. Christie's term at the helm of the Garden State's government.

Happening in Washington

        
Mr. Obama will meet on Wednesday with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. In between, he will do interviews with local news stations about his jobs bill, The American Jobs Act.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Ruling Could Revive Health Care for 2012 Campaign

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: On Wednesday, the administration agreed to seek a swift review of President Obama's health care law by the Supreme Court. 

 BODY:
The White House's decision to seek a quick ruling on President Obama's landmark health care law will inject the controversial issue back into the nation's political bloodstream at the height of the 2012 presidential campaign.
On Wednesday, the administration acceded to what had become a legal inevitability and welcomed a swift and final review of the law by the Supreme Court. But the political impact of the court's ruling next year may be just as significant.
"It returns the spotlight to an issue that really has faded," said Matt Bennett, a senior vice president at Third Way, a research group that pursues centrist policies. "It is no longer a top-of-mind issue for most voters. This just brings it right back to the surface."
The White House's decision means that the court is now almost certain to take up one or more of the cases involving a challenge to the health care law. It would then probably announce its decision in June, just weeks before the two political parties gather for their national nominating conventions and at the beginning of a final, intense dash to Election Day.
In practical terms, the court's decision - whichever way the justices decide - will set the stage for health care to once again become a dominant political issue in the presidential campaign and in the many Congressional contests around the country.
What is less obvious is how the two political parties would benefit or lose from a Supreme Court ruling.
* The court could decide to uphold the law completely, rejecting the claims by conservatives that the mandate requiring individuals to buy health insurance is unconstitutional.
Such a flat-out victory for Mr. Obama and his team would almost certainly become a new and angry rallying cry for Tea Party groups and other conservatives, who would argue that the only way to assure an end to what they call ObamaCare would be at the ballot box.
But Tea Party advocates are not lacking in enthusiasm, and so it is hard to see how much more motivated they could get. And there would be important public relations benefits for the president to be affirmed on his most ambitious agenda item by a decidedly conservative court.
Essentially, the court - led by conservatives like Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. - would be giving a kind of legal "Good Housekeeping" stamp of approval to the administration's entire health care approach.
A victory for Mr. Obama would make him look strong, rather than weak. And it could help the president make the argument that it is time to move on to other pressing issues, like jobs and the economy.
* The court could strike down the health care law, in part, or - as requested by some business and conservative groups in legal briefs this week - in total.
Such a ruling would no doubt fire up Mr. Obama's liberal base, which could use the ruling as motivation to push even harder for victory in the election. Given what is generally recognized as the lackluster energy among liberals, that would be a clear positive for the president.
Democratic activists and candidates could use the conservative court as their own rallying cry to keep Mr. Obama in office and to retake the House from Republicans.
But it would also make the president look like he was wrong all along about his approach to solving the nation's health care crisis. And it would lend credence to the president's most vocal critics who accuse him of pursuing an unconstitutional agenda.
It would also mean that the president and his Democratic rivals would be pressured to come up with an alternative solution to the dilemmas of spiraling health care costs and how to cover the uninsured.
Those are discussions that some Democrats, including the president, might not welcome as they prepare to face the voters.
* The court could also punt, using legal technicalities to defer a substantive decision on the merits of the case to a later time. 
If that happens, the health care law could recede a bit, becoming just one more in a series of important issues that will be debated by the candidates.
In a conference call with reporters, a senior Justice Department official said the decision by the administration to seek a rapid conclusion to the case was not influenced by political timing.
Rather, the official, who spoke to reporters on a background basis with no direct attribution, said Mr. Obama's advisers had concluded that the country needed the closure that would come by an end to the many legal cases and the uncertainty surrounding the huge health care law.
That may be. But as the president begins to ramp up his re-election campaign, his strategists - and those of his rivals - no doubt have June 2012 circled on their calendars.
Depending how the nine justices rule, it could be a very interesting month.

HEADLINE: Dimon's Bathroom Gets a Diner Double

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: "Power Toilet," an art project that claims to be an exact replica of the executive bathroom at JPMorgan Chase's New York headquarters, has been installed at the Greek-owned Olympic Restaurant on Delancey Street. 

 BODY:
A commode fit for a Wall Street C-suite has made its way to the unlikeliest of places: a greasy-spoon diner on Manhattan's Lower East Side.
"Power Toilet," an art project that claims to be an exact replica of the executive bathroom at JPMorgan Chase's New York headquarters, has been installed at the Greek-owned Olympic Restaurant on Delancey Street. The installation is the work of SuperFlex, an art group from Denmark, in conjunction with Creative Time, a non-profit that arranges public art projects around New York City.
"It's a political project," said Ann Pasternak, the president of Creative Time. "It's about making private spaces public. And it's about the excesses of Wall Street, and saying, 'enough is enough.'"
It's not clear how accurate Olympic's loo look-alike is. (For one thing, there is no designated restroom for executives at JPMorgan's New York headquarters, according to one person familiar with the bank's floorplan.) But one art blog wrote that Superflex was able to mimic every detail of the bank's bathroom thanks to an "anonymous inside source who was able to take camera phone photos and make measurements of the space."
To get to the gilded bathroom at the decidedly unpretentious Olympic Restaurant, visitors must walk past Olympic's 13-seat lunch counter to a faded red door marked with a sign. A dingy concrete staircase lit with a single bare bulb leads to the restroom, which is marked with a small sign about the project.
The bathroom itself features a Kohler sink, Crane toilet, and quilted toilet paper, along with a framed print of a potted flower. Therenovation cost more than $10,000, Ms. Pasternak said.
The meaning of the piece, according to organizers, has to do with the dissolution of private space and the introduction of democratic public spaces in their place. SuperFlex did a similar project in the Netherlands, installing a replica of the United Nations Security Council's bathroom in a public park.
"All good art has multiple messages," said Ms. Pasternak. "You can trace this piece from Duchamp's urinal and use it as a chance to say, what is art?"
Ms. Pasternak said that while JPMorgan shared responsibility with other Wall Street banks for some issues of economic injustice, the installation wasn't directed specifically at the bank or its chief executive, Jamie Dimon.
"It's not about targeting JPMorgan," she said. "It could have been any bank."
A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment.
The "Power Toilet" show will close October 16, but the upgraded bathroom will remain in Olympic Restaurant indefinitely.
Standing behind the diner's 13-seat counter, Spiros Nakos, the 61-year-old owner of Olympic Restaurant, said he was approached by Creative Time at the end of June about placing the installation in his restaurant, which he has owned since 1980 and which is located near the non-profit's headquarters. Creative Time proposed refurbishing his run-down restroom to Wall Street specs at no cost, and Mr. Nakos quickly agreed.
The restroom has been good for foot traffic to the restaurant, Mr. Nakos said, and has given workers a morale boost.
"I used to feel embarrassed for people to use the bathroom," he said. "Now I'm very proud."
Mr. Nakos said he had only squabbled with the artists behind "Power Toilet" once, when he wanted to install a sign in the bathroom instructing employees to wash their hands - a requirement of the New York City Department of Health - but was told by the artists that since it wasn't in the plan for the piece, it would have to go outside the door instead.
He said that although SuperFlex intended for the gilded bathroom to be available for free public use, he had put his foot down on one key stipulation.
"You have to make a purchase to use it," he said.

HEADLINE: Perry Slumps in Polls, but Not to Romney's Gain

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney has little to cheer about from Rick Perry's decline in recent polls. 

 BODY:
There have been three scientific national polls released of Republican voters since the Sept. 22 debate: a CNN poll that was conducted over the last weekend, and polls by Fox News and Economist/YouGov released on Wednesday.
The polls suggest that Rick Perry's struggles in the debate -- amplified by a storm of skepticism among influential Republicans -- have taken a bite out of his numbers. But the spoils seem to have gone mainly to other conservative candidates in the race, rather than Mr. Romney.
I've taken an average of the polls, with one slight wrinkle. The YouGov poll included Chris Christie, Sarah Palin and Rudolph W. Giuliani as options, and they collectively received 29 percent of the vote. Since none of those candidates are especially likely to run, I have re-allocated their votes based on the distribution of second-place votes in the poll. (Before this adjustment, Mr. Romney and Mr. Christie shared the lead in the poll at 15 percent, with Mr. Perry also essentially tied at 14 percent.)
Mr. Perry led in the CNN poll, the first one released after the debate, but his numbers slumped in the Fox News and YouGov polls. He averages about 22 percent of the vote across the three surveys, down materially from 28 percent in polls conducted between his first debate on Sept. 7, and Sept. 19.
However, any gains for Mr. Romney -- in an absolute rather than relative sense -- are hard to perceive. He averages 22 percent in the surveys, up only nominally from 21 percent before.
Instead, the candidate making the largest gains is Herman Cain, the Georgia entrepreneur who won a straw poll in Florida over the weekend. He's up to 13 percent in the surveys, more than doubling the 6 percent that he had before.
The other candidate to make gains is Newt Gingrich -- up to 10 percent from 7 percent.
The numbers for Ron Paul and Michele Bachmann have slipped somewhat, however. Mrs. Bachmann in particular, who was in the double-digits in many polls at her peak, is now down to about 5 percent of the vote. And a separate poll of Iowa voters shows her having fallen behind Mr. Romney there. (Although I wouldn't put as much emphasis on that one because the pollster in question, American Research Group, has a dubioustrack record.)
Certainly, one way that Mr. Romney could win is if the support among the more conservative portion of the Republican electorate were divided among several different candidates. With the decline in Mr. Perry's numbers, the landscape has become more favorable for him.
Mr. Romney's odds of winning the nomination would improve, moreover, if his main opposition came from a candidate like Mr. Cain rather than Mr. Perry, since there is a much larger gap between the two in areas like fund-raising and establishment support. (Although I would not discount Mr. Cain's chances entirely.)
At the same time, you have a candidate in Mr. Romney who has run a very good campaign, who has performed well in the debates, and who leads in fund-raising and endorsements -- but who is still barely above 20 percent in surveys, and has made only marginal gains as a number of his rivals have stumbled.
Mr. Romney has emerged -- or re-emerged -- as the favorite; I'd give him roughly even odds of winning the nomination. But it's unlikely to be a smooth and linear path, and the alternate hypothesis that Republican voters are determined to pick someone more conservative than him has some support in this data.
That's not to paper over the problems of Mr. Perry, who entered the race in a strong strategic position and has failed to make much of it. It's possible, moreover, that the fallout of the Sept. 22 debate is not yet fully realized in the surveys; Mr. Perry performed somewhat worse in the Fox News and YouGov polls than in the CNN poll, which postdated it by a couple of days.
In general, however, I'd caution against using terms like "momentum" when discussing the nomination race (or polling results under most other circumstances). We'll be publishing a separate article on this shortly, but there's not much evidence of serial correlation in polling data: candidates who decline from one period to the next are just as likely to rebound as to see their numbers continue falling.
Note, for instance, that the candidates to have made the largest gains recently, Mr. Cain and Mr. Gingrich, had numbers that were going in the other direction before that. And at this point four years ago, there were plenty of negative stories circulating about the polling trajectory of Barack Obama and John McCain.

HEADLINE: Chasing Suspicions Of an Enemy Within

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Nobody likes a naysayer. Until, of course, it becomes clear that yes was the wrong answer.
In his book ''The Big Short,'' Michael Lewis focused on the Wall Street misfits who bet against the subprime mortgage bubble. The White House counterterrorism coordinator Richard A. Clarke was an alarmist know-it-all in the Bush White House until Sept. 11 proved he had a point. Even ''60 Minutes'' spiked a 1995 interview with the obsessed tobacco industry whistle-blower, Jeffrey S. Wigand.
Cassandras are easy to dismiss because being around them is so hard. And there is nothing pleasant about Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison, a C.I.A. officer on ''Homeland,'' a Showtime series that begins on Sunday. Carrie has suspicions about Sgt. Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), a Marine who is rescued in Afghanistan after spending eight years in captivity. The show's ads put it this way: ''The nation sees a hero. She sees a threat.'' 
It's possible that he is not who he says he is, but Carrie is not the most reliable judge. ''Homeland'' is well made and gripping, and a lot of its allure lies in those uncertainties.
Comparisons to Jack Bauer are inevitable and even in some ways apt, given that some of the executive producers of ''Homeland'' also worked on the Fox hit series ''24.'' But this show, which has only 12 episodes its first season, is inspired by an Israeli series, ''Hatufim'' (''Prisoners of War''), and is more of a psychological thriller than an action-adventure yarn.
This series is not particularly high-tech, and it doesn't have a real-time ticking clock conceit, spectacular special effects or preposterous red herrings. ''Homeland'' is ''24'' for grown-ups.
Mr. Lewis, who played a steadfast American major in ''Band of Brothers'' and a priggish husband in ''The Forsyte Saga,'' brings a little of each of those traits to his portrait of Brody.
While he was a prisoner of war, Brody's friends and family believed he was dead. His beautiful wife, Jessica (Morena Baccarin), has moved on, and his children barely remember him. Brody was horribly tortured in captivity, but he keeps his experience and feelings to himself. He seems remarkably healthy, given his ordeal, but there are fissures just beneath the surface that suggest a deeper rupture. His attempts to reconnect with Jessica are awkward and painful to watch, and someone is peering into their bedroom: Carrie.
Those are the times when even the troubled and enigmatic former P.O.W. seems more trustworthy than the C.I.A. officer who suspects him. Carrie is so sure that she is right that she deceives her one remaining friend at Langley, her boss and mentor, Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin), in order to mount a ragtag rogue surveillance operation.
An American Marine turned Qaeda agent may not be the most imminent threat, but betrayal is a favorite theme in espionage dramas. John Le Carre's best villains were based on Kim Philby and the other real-life moles who charmed their way to the top of British intelligence. Especially in the wake of Sept. 11, television has been loath to stereotype Muslim characters as extremists: ''Sleeper Cell,'' a Showtime series, posited American and European converts to Islamic extremism. A recent study by the Norman Lear Center at the University of Southern California found that on dramas that focus on terrorism, like ''NCIS,'' 67 percent of the terror suspects are white; only 14 percent are identified as Middle Eastern or Muslim.
That kind of casting is only partly prompted by political correctness. An all-American hero who may have a secret agenda is more compelling than a foreign agent; the enemy within is always more sinister than the one lurking across the ocean.
Carrie has no trouble imagining the worst of her fellow citizens. Ms. Danes, who won an Emmy for her portrayal of an autistic animal scientist in the HBO movie ''Temple Grandin,'' is well suited to play an intelligent, high-strung woman who can be almost appealing one moment and despicable the next. Her character is not entirely new to thrillers: Annette Bening notably played a flinty and deceitful C.I.A. operative in the 1998 movie ''The Siege.''
Carrie is even more erratic; she suffers from a psychiatric condition that she has kept hidden from her bosses. She's a loner who picks up strangers for sex and keeps her family at bay. In that sense she is a lot more like Helen Mirren's character in the British series ''Prime Suspect'' than Maria Bello is in the NBC remake.
Ms. Bello softens the detective with warmth and sex appeal; Ms. Danes is better at preserving her character's selfish and self-destructive side.
That's not so easily done. Outcasts are shunned everywhere, except in fiction. Television in particular loves a flawed protagonist, be it the manipulative lawyer Glenn Close plays on ''Damages,'' the teacher turned drug dealer portrayed by Bryan Cranston on ''Breaking Bad'' or Michael C. Hall, who plays a serial killer with scruples on ''Dexter.'' Ms. Danes comes a lot closer to fulfilling the famously wrong prediction Jane Austen made about ''Emma,'' saying, ''I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.''
Carrie is hard to like, but ''Homeland'' is almost impossible to resist.

HEADLINE: Element of Indian Culture Feeds a Rising Crime Wave

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
sjames@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
A husband, wife and their 6-year-old son had just returned from the airport to their suburban home in Fremont. It was a sunny Sunday afternoon, Sept. 11, as they unloaded luggage from their car. Seemingly out of nowhere, two men appeared, one pointing a handgun.
''He said, 'You'll get hurt if you do anything,' '' the husband later said, asking that his family and their street not be identified for fear of being further victimized. ''They took us into the bedroom and made us kneel down. I was very scared that we might be shot.'' 
But the invaders were not there to kill -- they wanted gold. The men ripped chains off the wife's neck, tore at the husband's bracelet and then ransacked the home until they found the rest of the jewelry, worth as much as $25,000. The thieves have not been caught.
That the family had so much gold is not unusual. As immigrants from India, it is their tradition to own and wear gold. The precious metal indicates prosperity, is a means of savings, and some gold jewelry can signify a woman's marital status. It is a common wedding gift in many Indian cultures.
Thieves, it appears, have learned of these traditions, leading to a rash of robberies throughout Silicon Valley's Indian-American communities in recent months. Indian-Americans are one of the fastest-growing Bay Area populations, and in Santa Clara County alone their number nearly doubled, to 111,000, in the past decade, according to the United States census.
The exact number of gold thefts is difficult to determine because the crimes have happened in several jurisdictions and victims' ethnicity is not always made public. But interviews with the police, government and civic leaders, and representatives of the region's Indian-American community confirmed the trend and growing alarm.
''It increased significantly nine months ago,'' said Anu Natarajian, a Fremont city councilwoman. ''It's not a random thing that's happening. People are afraid. People are nervous about it.''
Sgt. Jeff Swadener of the Fremont Police Department said Indian-Americans were known for owning high-quality gold of 20 and 22 karats. With the price of gold surging since the recession began ($1,614 per ounce on Thursday), that makes them lucrative targets.
''You'll get just as much out of a house as you would robbing a bank,'' Sergeant Swadener said, adding that criminals also know that the criminal charges for burglarizing homes are lesser than those for robbing a bank.
Most of the thefts have happened while residents were not home, and had inadvertently advertised the fact through another tradition: they leave their shoes outside the home on stoops or in racks.
''No shoes, no one home,'' Sergeant Swadener said.
But the incident in Fremont has elevated the crimes to a new level of concern. The home invasion was ignored by mainstream news media, but the news that a family, including a young boy, was forced to kneel as if awaiting execution has swept through the Indian-American community.
''We got concerned when we heard the family was held at gunpoint,'' said Krati Rungta, co-founder of Bay Area Desi, a year-old Web site for Indians. Ms. Rungta said people worried that their traditions had made them ''easy targets.''
Tanuja Bahah, executive director of the Indian Community Center in Milpitas, said, ''In India, gold is seen as security.'' For women who did not work outside their home, Ms. Bahah said, gold represents a nest egg of reliable value.
Indeed, gold has taken on such meaning for many since the recent recession began, not just those of Indian heritage. With gold prices so high, the nation has seen a proliferation in businesses that buy jewelry for its gold value, often with no questions asked, allowing thieves to easily and quickly profit from stolen goods.
Robberies of gold jewelry have been reported throughout the Bay Area in recent months, including at BART stations, and on Sept. 18 a gold dealer in Hayward was shot to death at his home.
A sense of urgency about being singled out is emerging among Indian-Americans. There is talk of leaving old shoes outside the front door, so it would appear that a home was occupied. In the Fremont area where the family was robbed, residents have asked for more police patrols and are forming a neighborhood crime watch group.
That effort is helping the traumatized family recover, though slowly. ''Every time someone rings the doorbell, we feel a twitch of fear,'' the husband said.

HEADLINE: A Splintering Psyche Or Omens of Disaster?

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
''You've got a good life, Curtis,'' says Dewart, Curtis's best friend and co-worker. (Dewart is played by Shea Whigham, Curtis by the amazing Michael Shannon.) ''I think that's the best compliment you can give a man: take a look at his life and say, 'That's good.' ''
A sinister corollary to Dewart's homespun truism might be that the greatest fear a man can experience is that of losing the good life he has. It is this anxiety, which afflicts Curtis in especially virulent form, that defines the mood of ''Take Shelter,'' Jeff Nichols's remarkable new film. It is a quiet, relentless exploration of the latent (and not so latent) terrors that bedevil contemporary American life, a horror movie that will trouble your sleep not with visions of monsters but with a more familiar dread. 
We like to think that individually and collectively, we have it pretty good, but it is harder and harder to allay the suspicion that a looming disaster -- economic or environmental, human or divine -- might come along and destroy it all. Normalcy can feel awfully precarious, like a comforting dream blotting out a nightmarish reality.
What if everything that Curtis values were to be suddenly swept away? We are not talking about a life of luxury and ease, but about modest comforts and reasonable expectations: a decent job with health benefits and vacation time, a loving family, a house of your own. Curtis has all of this. He works in heavy construction and comes home to the tidy home he shares with his wife, Samantha (Jessica Chastain), and their daughter, Hannah (Tova Stewart), who is deaf.
Without being a hokey paragon of proletarian virtue -- Mr. Shannon's scarecrow frame and sharply angled features seem designed to repel sentimentality -- Curtis is clearly a dedicated employee, a loyal friend, a doting husband and a gentle father. This makes the intensity of his terror, and his helpless, potentially destructive reactions to it, all the more alarming.
Curtis, who lives in a stretch of northern Ohio susceptible to tornadoes, has recurring nightmares of a huge, apocalyptic storm. A viscous, brownish rain falls from the sky (''like fresh motor oil,'' he says), as funnel clouds gather on the horizon. Shadowy, zombielike figures appear at his windows and rattle his doors, and in one especially scary episode his living room furniture rises into the air and comes crashing to the ground, as he and Hannah cower against a wall.
Are these dreams projections or premonitions? If ''Take Shelter'' were ''Inception'' or an M. Night Shyamalan brainteaser, it might turn this question into a cinematic puzzle. But while Mr. Nichols employs a handful of tried-and-true (and therefore always persuasive) shock effects to blur the viewer's sense of reality, there is something at stake beyond formal cleverness. The ambiguity that is so unbearable to Curtis -- the sense that he might be losing his mind and also receiving omens of impending disaster -- is crucial to the film's logic.
Curtis is a practical, thoughtful type of guy, and his two-fold response to his bad dreams reflects this aspect of his temperament. (Dewart is much more of a hothead, and if you met them both at a bar, you would think he was the crazy one, not Curtis). Troubled by a family history of mental illness -- his mother (Kathy Baker) was institutionalized in her 30s and now lives in an assisted-living center -- Curtis checks psychology books out of the library and presents a therapist with a plausible self-diagnosis.
But at the same time, he goes to great expense to expand the storm shelter in his backyard, borrowing heavy equipment from work and a lot of money from the bank. Curtis believes that he is delusional, but he also believes in his visions. At a certain level of realism -- assuming, that is, that you interpret ''Take Shelter'' as a film about a man struggling with a psychological disorder -- this is an important insight into a painful paradox of mental illness that rarely shows up in movies. Curtis suspects that he is sick, and is both ashamed of his condition and determined to seek treatment. But at the same time he cannot shake the conviction that his fears have meaning.
He is hardly a wild-eyed prophet on the street corner, screaming that the end is near. His diffidence makes his desperation especially painful, and his increasingly strange behavior is made more unsettling by his generally calm demeanor. Mr. Shannon's taciturn, haunted performance manages to be both heartbreaking and terrifying. You feel sorry for this guy, even as you want to run in the other direction.
In trying to protect himself and his family from whatever it is that he believes is coming, Curtis risks making his fears come true, putting his job, his marriage and his daughter's well-being in jeopardy. And in showing the potential dispossession of a working-class family, Mr. Nichols, without banging a topical drum, points toward a social catastrophe that is all too real.
Is Curtis mad, or is he prescient? You can debate this question when the movie is over -- the brilliant final scene invites as much -- but you are unlikely to find a comfortable answer. The real question is what difference it makes. Mr. Nichols, who scrutinized a different kind of masculine anxiety in his first film, ''Shotgun Stories'' (also starring Mr. Shannon), is too smart and too sober a filmmaker for that, and in ''Take Shelter'' he has made a perfect allegory for a panicky time. There is no shortage of delusion and paranoia out there in the world. There is also a lot to be afraid of.
''Take Shelter'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Children will hear some bad words, while grown-ups confront their own deepest fears.

HEADLINE: An Unusual Group of Student Journalists Steps Up

BYLINE: By TREY BUNDY. 
tbundy@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
In a small second-floor office south of Market Street in San Francisco last week, Sandra Legler asked seven high school students how they thought people communicated before smartphones and the Internet. 
''Strings and cups,'' Mister, 17, said with a laugh.
''Messenger pigeons,'' added Leo, 15.
Ms. Legler, an artist at the Imagine Bus Project, a local arts education group, had assembled the students around a table covered in stacks of the day's newspapers. The students -- who attend Big Picture at the Principals' Center Collaborative, a public school in San Francisco for teenagers involved with the juvenile justice system, and who cannot be identified by their full names because of school confidentiality rules -- were beginning semester internships that will include starting a newsroom and producing hard-copy journalism from a youth perspective.
Ms. Legler's goal is to help her students explore issues that matter to them. But they have a secondary mission as well.
The Principals' Center Collaborative is preparing to move in January from its current campus -- several old bungalows on Judah Street -- to a building in the Inner Sunset district.
But some residents near the future site have criticized the proposed move. Members of the Inner Sunset Neighborhood Group, concerned about security because of the students' involvement in the juvenile justice system, have attended school board meetings to protest.
Ms. Legler wants to show the school's new neighbors that the students are community-minded citizens, not delinquents out to wreak havoc in the streets.
''We're going to use the newspaper as kind of a welcome piece to the neighborhood,'' she said.
Last week, before the fledgling editorial staff could begin reporting stories, Ms. Legler suggested an exercise to get them better acquainted with newspapers, a medium most of them consider a footnote in the age of digital news media. She asked them to cut out pictures from the papers, glue them to pages in their composition books, and then write headlines to go with the images and make up a short story, three to five sentences long.
''Trials and tribulations,'' said Patricia, 16, cutting out a black-and-white picture of an elderly woman praying. ''That's what you go through in life, right?''
Patricia has been appointed editor in chief of the still-unnamed newspaper, whose single issue will come out in January. Thinking aloud about how the recession has left communities like hers desperate and depressed, Patricia rattled off story ideas.
''What about people getting locked up in jail, dying, getting killed, little babies getting shot?'' she said. ''Can we cuss inside of the article?''
Ms. Legler replied: ''Let's censor a little bit. How about using just first and last letters of those words?''
Most of the students said they rarely read print newspapers, but their clippings revealed a variety of interests and concerns: technology, bullying, sex, money, urban violence, the environment, drugs and alcohol.
Quintasia, 16, will be the paper's science and environment reporter.
''I'm into that,'' she said. ''I don't like litter. Most of the time in my community, people don't know how to clean up after themselves.''

HEADLINE: More of the Same Won't Save Europe: Germany's vote to increase the bailout fund is only a stopgap

 BODY:
The German Parliament's move to expand the euro-zone bailout fund on Thursday is welcome, but the European debt crisis is no closer to resolution than it was two months ago. Even with Germany's roughly $287 billion increased contribution, the fund is still too small to provide more than a few days of calm to jittery markets. 
The big picture, in fact, has gotten much worse. Greece's indebtedness is growing, European bank balance sheets are shakier and investors are increasingly skeptical that Europe has the will to stabilize shaky credit and stock markets. Also conspicuously lacking is any clear plan for generating the economic growth needed to begin paying down those growing debts.
Instead, heavily indebted nations are yielding to pressure to embrace more of the austerity medicine that will only make them sicker. On Tuesday, Greece voted to impose a steep new property tax. On Wednesday, the European Parliament tightened the noose by approving new financial penalties for countries running high deficits.
Timothy Geithner, the Treasury secretary, and finance ministers from around the world were uniformly critical of European finance ministers at last weekend's annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington. They rightly fear that Europe's serial mismanagement of its debt problems has become a grave threat to global recovery.
Mr. Geithner asked for a more financially powerful bailout fund along with short-term stimulus from Europe's wealthier economies. But his ability to persuade has been undercut by House Republicans who insist on imposing untimely austerity on the United States.
Even if all remaining countries, which include Austria, Slovakia and the Netherlands vote to strengthen the bailout fund, it will still be limited to roughly $600 billion, not nearly enough to quiet the crises building over Italy's debt, France's weakened banks and looming trouble elsewhere. Europe needs a completely different approach, like increasing the bailout fund's lending capacity to $2 trillion or $3 trillion, either through direct contributions or leveraging its existing balances by borrowing against them.
A growth strategy would mean easing up on austerity for Greece and other weakened economies and enacting stimulus measures in every European Union country that can afford it -- chiefly Germany, France and Britain. Yet these three economies are going in the opposite direction.
This week's crisis-containment measures may steady the markets for a bit, but by failing to deal with the underlying problems they delay more realistic solutions.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 1, 2011

 CORRECTION:
An editorial on Friday on the European debt crisis incorrectly described Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's advice to European finance ministers. He urged them to assemble a more powerful European bailout fund but did not call on Europe's wealthier nations to adopt short-term stimulus plans.

HEADLINE: New Claims From Jobless Are Lowest In 5 Months

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- In positive signs for the nation's economy, claims for jobless benefits fell to a five-month low last week and growth was slightly stronger in the second quarter than previously estimated, according to government reports released on Thursday. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 37,000, to 391,000, the Labor Department said, well below economists' expectations of 420,000. But the department cautioned that the way it adjusted the data for seasonal fluctuations might have overstated the improvement.
Separately, the Commerce Department said the nation's gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the second quarter instead of the previously reported 1 percent. Consumer spending and export growth were both stronger than estimated.
''When you connect these data points together, they indicate a very tepid recovery. We are still experiencing positive growth, which is better than we feared a few months ago,'' said Paul D. Ballew, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.
The cautious optimism generated by Thursday's data was tempered somewhat by a report showing that the housing sector remained weak last month.
A survey of chief executives in the United States released on Thursday by the Business Roundtable showed that their views of the economy's prospects deteriorated in the third quarter, with the number who expected to cut jobs roughly doubling.
The drop in initial claims for unemployment benefits took them below 400,000 for the first time since early August. The department, however, said the labor market's weakness in recent years might have led the model it uses to seasonally adjust the data to overstate last week's drop.
The decline also reflected the fading impact of Hurricane Irene, which caused claims to spike in the week ended Sept. 10.
Still, the total number of unemployed continuing to claim benefits after an initial week of aid fell to 3.73 million in the week ended Sept. 17 from 3.75 million a week earlier.
The Sept. 17 week corresponds with the survey period for the Labor Department's household employment measure, which is used to construct the national unemployment rate.
In August, the jobless rate remained at 9.1 percent, and a separate survey of employers showed that hiring had ground to a halt, which increased recession fears.
Those worries are beginning to fade. Factory output continues to expand and businesses have maintained their appetite for spending on capital goods.
''Indications are that the third quarter is doing better than previously thought. We now anticipate third-quarter real G.D.P. growth of just above 2 percent,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Mass.
Housing, however, remains a weak spot.
The National Association of Realtors said its index of pending home sales, based on contracts signed in August, fell 1.2 percent, to 88.6, its lowest point since April. The association said contract signings, which usually precede actual closings by a month or two, were held back by tight credit and, in the Northeast, Hurricane Irene.
With millions of Americans locked into mortgages worth more than their homes, historically low interest rates are failing to lift sales. Freddie Mac said on Thursday that the average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to a record low of 4.01 percent this week.

HEADLINE: In Fruitvale, Merchants Are Armed and Wary

BYLINE: By GRACE RUBENSTEIN. 
grace@gracerubenstein.com

 BODY:
At Esparza's Jewelry in the Fruitvale section of Oakland, the owner, Rodolfo Perez, works the counter with a .38-caliber revolver strapped to his belt.
Mr. Perez acquired the weapon after thieves stole $20,000 in merchandise in May 2010. That August, with Mr. Perez elsewhere in the store, robbers took a $2,500 ring and beat up an employee. After the second incident, Mr. Perez said, the police waited five months to take a report.
Fruitvale merchants are increasingly arming themselves, concerned that Oakland's overburdened police force is unable to defend them against a wave of violent crime that has crippled the local economy and made them fear for their safety.
The Oakland Police Department lost 80 officers to budget cuts last year -- more than 10 percent of the force. Officials acknowledge that they are increasingly faced with hard choices over where to devote resources. 
Sgt. Holly Joshi, a spokeswoman, said the police did not object to residents' acquiring licensed weapons.
''We have to defend ourselves,'' said Hugo Guerrero, owner of Hugo's Tours travel agency and chief executive of a local merchants association. But for some residents, the preponderance of weapons, even if for protection, also creates fear.
On the Fruitvale stretch of International Boulevard, the commercial heart of East Oakland, Valentino Torres, owner of La Torta Loca sandwich shop, displays an arsenal of knives, clubs, swords, nun-chucks and machetes on the wall ''as a warning,'' he said. Across the street, Agustina Sugia, the owner of Taqueria 16 de Septiembre, keeps a metal bat under a supply of paper cups beneath the counter.
Another businessman, who would not allow his name to be used, opened his desk drawer to show off a silver-barreled revolver, boasting that it was loaded with bullets that expand on impact for maximum destruction. Even Gisela Jimenez, the owner of La Rosa candy store, said she owned a gun.
Still, when someone who Ms. Jimenez thinks looks suspicious walks in to her business, she said she walks out rather than risk a confrontation, because criminals in Fruitvale ''aren't afraid of the consequences.''
Like much of East Oakland, Fruitvale has long been plagued by crime. But merchants say their frustration is boiling over because of an increase in lawlessness, including shootings for money and armed robberies in broad daylight.
The crime wave includes a rash of highly publicized killings. On April 8, Jesus Campos, a past president of the local merchants group, was shot to death as he opened his popular Otaez Mexicatessen restaurant at 39th Avenue and International Boulevard. The crime remains unsolved. Elsewhere in East Oakland, on Aug. 8, 3-year-old Carlos Nava was struck by a stray bullet near his mother on International Boulevard. Three weeks later, Jose Esparza was shot to death in front of his 6-year-old son during a robbery.
One business owner, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, said he is so tired of the insecurity that he is recruiting fellow merchants to pool their money to hire a private security force. During business hours, the guards would carry loaded weapons, and they would patrol on foot the stretch of International Boulevard that runs through Fruitvale, he said.
''This will at least tell criminals: 'You come around here, you'll get caught,' '' the business owner said.
Sergeant Joshi, the police spokeswoman, said the department understood the merchants' exasperation.
But the race for merchants to arm themselves frightens Mr. Campos's widow, Socorro Campos, who now runs the restaurant on her own. Ms. Campos said she thought her husband, who carried a gun, was killed because he had fought back. She fears that more weapons will lead to more bloodshed.
''I always told him to be calm, to let robbers take his money,'' Ms. Campos said. ''But he was different. A lot of the merchants are different. They're angry.''
Ms. Campos said that when she told business owners not to take matters into their own hands, they replied, ''If the police won't do anything, we'll make justice.''
''It scares me,'' she said.
For decades, Fruitvale has been home to immigrants from various countries, and much of its vibrancy is still visible despite the violence. On International Boulevard, shoppers stroll and patronize Mexican restaurants and nail salons on most sunny afternoons. On side streets like leafy 34th Avenue, children buy popsicles from vendors and parishioners attend Spanish-language Mass at St. Elizabeth Church.
But merchants say they are tormented constantly by delinquency. Mr. Torres, the owner of La Torta Loca, recalled a drunk who bothered customers and broke the tip jar. Ms. Jimenez said a woman wearing tiny shorts and a bra entered her candy shop recently, swore at her and refused to leave. In both cases, the merchants said, the police arrived hours later.
Since the staffing cuts, Sergeant Joshi said, the police have had to focus their efforts on responding to violent crime, and responses to lesser incidents are not a priority.
The fear of crime keeps many customers away, merchants say. Many International Boulevard restaurants used to stay open until 9 or 10 p.m., with plenty of diners. Now, almost every storefront is shuttered by 7 p.m.
At Esparza's Jewelry, Mr. Perez said, sales have dropped 80 percent in the last two years. At El Huarache Azteca restaurant, two doors down from Otaez Mexicatessen, the co-owner Eva Saavedra said business is down 50 percent. Partly, merchants blame the economy. But, Ms. Saavedra said, when she sees once-regular patrons who have not been by in months, they tell her, ''I'm scared to come to Oakland.''
Local residents also tend to stay indoors after dark, and they share the merchants' exasperation.
Manuel, a St. Elizabeth parishioner who has lived in Fruitvale for nearly 50 years and did not want his last name given, wistfully recalled when he could walk the streets at all hours without fear.
These days, he said, ''if someone knocks on your door at 10 at night, to bring you a message or something, you don't know if the police are coming to tell you something happened to your grandchild, your son, your nephew. We're just waiting for bad news.''
Early this year, city and police officials began meeting quarterly with Fruitvale business owners to discuss possible solutions. A project to install 100 security cameras at local businesses, initiated after Mr. Campos's killing, is stalled while city officials try to gather permissions from property owners, some of whom live far away.
For merchants who live locally, the fear sometimes follows them home. Esperanza, a single mother of three, cleans houses and sells tamales on the street.
Months ago, she said she became frightened on three occasions when young men she recognized from the neighborhood and whom she believed to be gang members knocked on her door at 10 p.m. On one occasion, she said, she called the police, but officers did not arrive until midnight. Another time, the police contacted her by phone. On the third occasion, they arrived at 2 a.m., she said.
After that, she decided to arm herself. Now she stashes more than 15 metal and wooden bats around her home.
''I have them in the bathroom,'' she said. ''I have them in the kitchen, in the living room, under the couch, in the closet. You never know.''

HEADLINE: Land Deal With U.N. Would Fill a Big Gap in the Waterfront Greenway

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
For at least a decade, the United Nations has coveted a playground just south of its landmark tower, where it would like to construct a new building. For just as long, city and state officials have longed to fill in the largest remaining gap in the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway, from 38th to 60th Streets on the East River, but have not had the money.
Now, in a series of real-life Rubik's Cube moves, elected officials are on the verge of signing an agreement that would create a framework for both sides to get what they want. The United Nations would take part of Robert Moses Playground for its new building, while the city would end up with enough cash to finish an esplanade for the 32-mile Greenway -- and a replacement playground. In July, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed legislation that gave the city and state governments until Oct. 10 to agree to the terms of a deal. 
If the agreement, or memorandum of understanding, is signed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the heads of the Assembly and the Senate, as required, the United Nations Development Corporation could begin a land-use review for its new tower, which could be no taller than the 505-foot Secretariat Building. It would pay the city at least $65 million for the parkland, which, in technical terms, would be ''alienated.''
Once the new tower was built, the United Nations, which has been renting 1 and 2 United Nations Plaza from the city at below-market rates, would move its offices out of those buildings or begin paying market rents. Selling those buildings would provide the rest of the money for the esplanade.
Some residents of the area, especially those in Tudor City, have blasted the plan, saying a new skyscraper, at First Avenue and 41st Street, would wall them off from the East River. But for some officials and other East Side residents, the swap could help realize their long-held dream of waterfront access.
''It is a very rare occasion where I would ever find myself supporting the alienation of open space in my district,'' State Senator Liz Krueger said. ''But we think mathematically this is a win. It helps New York City make good on its commitment to a green ring around Manhattan. We're in bad economic times. I just don't see any money appearing on the horizon for something like this.''
The city would build the northern portion of the esplanade first, with the $65 million it would receive for Robert Moses Playground. That would allow it to take advantage of existing pilings in the water, saving tens of millions of dollars in construction costs. The portion of the esplanade from 41st to 53rd Street would be paid for by the sale of 1 and 2 United Nations Plaza, which could yield hundreds of millions of dollars, to be split between the city and the esplanade project.
Part of the proceeds from the sale of the playground would go toward improvements to St. Vartan Park, five blocks south of Robert Moses Playground. The agreement also secures money to stabilize Waterside Pier, a former Consolidated Edison site owned by the city, which runs from 38th to 41st Street. Design plans are under way for the rehabilitation of the pier, which would fill in the southernmost part of the gap and does not hinge on the United Nations' intentions.
At a series of forums to discuss the deal, the playground, a little more than an acre, was depicted alternately as a beloved park where children learn to ride their bikes and as a desolate patch of blacktop that will not be missed. The United Nations would build on the western half, which is now used by a roller hockey association, while a dog run and basketball courts to the east would be untouched.
The memorandum has identified a site 16 blocks to the south for a replacement park, turning Asser Levy Place, a two-block street that runs between 23rd and 25th Street east of First Avenue, into a playground.
Even if the memorandum is signed by Oct. 10, there is no guarantee that the United Nations will commit to the deal. Negotiations between elected officials have included the United Nations Development Corporation, a city-state public-benefit corporation that handles the United Nations' real estate needs. But while there is every expectation that the United Nations would want the playground site, the organization is not party to the memorandum.
''In the past decade, it has repeatedly expressed interest in consolidating its operations on this particular site,'' said Micah Lasher, the city's chief lobbyist in Albany.
Alternatively, the United Nations could build on its own campus. If it did so, however, it would be exempt from zoning laws and could avoid the city's uniform land-use review procedure, which puts major building projects under a microscope.
''The U.N. could decide to build on their North Lawn,'' Ms. Krueger said. ''The community gets another large building -- somebody other than Tudor City gets impacted -- but there's no funding at all for improvements to park space or a new esplanade.''
That is little consolation for residents of Tudor City, a cluster of neo-gothic apartment towers near the United Nations. A new United Nations tower would affect two buildings in particular: 2 and 5 Tudor City. ''It would feel smothering,'' said Muriel Gross, a retired teacher who has lived in the complex for 31 years. ''We've had it open all these years. Who gives away playgrounds?''
There is also opposition from groups critical of the United Nations, particularly the conservative Heritage Foundation. Anti-United Nations sentiment in the State Legislature helped quash a similar plan several years ago.
''We're not doing this deal for the benefit of the United Nations,'' said Brian Kavanagh, a state assemblyman who represents the East Side. ''We're doing this deal, if we do it, for the benefit of our community and New Yorkers.''
Community Board 6, whose 50 members will soon hold a nonbinding vote on the proposal, says that its district, from 14th to 59th Streets east of Lexington Avenue, has the lowest ratio of open space to office workers and residents in the city. And many there have felt more than a twinge of envy as they have watched Hudson River Park take shape across the island.
''We look at the West,'' said Mark P. Thompson, the community board's chairman, ''and think, 'Wow, we'd love to have something as wonderful as that, too.' ''

HEADLINE: An Ailing Asian Art Museum Adopts a New Attitude

BYLINE: By KEVIN BERGER. 
kevintberger@gmail.com

 BODY:
''It's kind of weird to be here,'' said Sanjay Patel, a Pixar animator, standing on a stage Tuesday inside the Asian Art Museum. ''Normally you would see Buzz or Woody or Mr. Incredible or Sulley or Carl from 'Up.' ''
Indeed, it was not apparent why the excitable Mr. Patel was reciting the names of his employer's famous movie characters at a news conference held by the Asian Art Museum to promote its new artistic mission. 
But nonconformity was just the impression the museum hoped to convey.
After 45 years of presenting mostly ancient art in understated settings, the museum, which teetered on the brink of bankruptcy less than a year ago, is now determined to ''stand out by being bold,'' said Jay Xu, 48, who became director three years ago and is the creative force behind the new direction.
The museum now welcomes contemporary art into its galleries, said Mr. Xu (pronounced shu) -- and not merely modern interpretations of classic ceramics, like those currently on display in its ''Poetry in Clay'' exhibition.
To hype its exhibition ''Maharaja,'' which opens Oct. 21 and explores the realm of India's legendary kings, the museum hired Mr. Patel to cover the museum's exterior with his effervescent Pop Art, transforming the stodgy gray neo-Classical-style building into a bright tableau of color and Hindu whimsy.
In November, the museum will hand Mr. Patel the keys to an interior gallery, where it will present his Disneyesque illustrations, a magical kingdom of mythic Indian characters, in a show called ''Deities, Demons and Dudes With 'Staches.''
''It's about time,'' said Marjorie Schwarzer, alluding to the museum's new embrace of pop culture. Ms. Schwarzer, from Oakland and the author of ''Riches, Rivals and Radicals: 100 Years of Museums in America,'' praised the Asian Art Museum for its ''exquisite collection'' but lamented its ''scholar-curator model.''
That it is now taking chances with contemporary art is ''great news'' for the museum, both artistically and financially, she said.
At the news conference, Mr. Xu and his young staff of curators, along with Mayor Ed Lee of San Francisco, unveiled the museum's new logo, an inverted A, modeled on the mathematic symbol ''for all.'' It represents ''Asian art for all,'' Mr. Xu said.
Nick O'Flaherty, strategy director for Wolff Olins, the brand consulting firm that created the logo, said the museum, with its new modern brand, was ''throwing out lifelines to visitors.''
The museum needs a lifeline. Its attendance of 187,000 for fiscal 2010-11 was no match for the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art or the de Young Museum, whose blockbuster exhibitions helped them draw, respectively, 636,000 and 1.8 million visitors in 2010-11.
The Asian Art Museum faced bankruptcy in 2010 largely because of its financial arrangement with the city. Like the de Young Museum and the Legion of Honor, the museum operates through a public-private financial arrangement. On the public side, the city owns the Asian Art Museum building and art collection and contributes, via a hotel-tax fund, about one-third of its operating budget, which has fluctuated between $17 million and $18 million in the past few years.
The private part, the Asian Art Museum Foundation, is responsible for the rest of the operating budget. Last year the foundation had a $120 million bond debt. It had obtained the bond to help convert the Beaux-Arts building, formerly the San Francisco Main Library, into a world-class museum.
The Asian Art Museum was sideswiped by the economic meltdown of 2008. The credit rating of its bond insurer, MBIA, nose-dived. It was forced to put up $20 million in collateral and obtain a letter of credit from JPMorgan Chase that, in 2010, Chase was not willing to renew. Also, the museum's operating budget has decreased over the past decade as a larger percentage of the hotel-tax fund was given to city departments rather than arts organizations, according to a 2006 task force that reported to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.
In late 2010, as the Asian Art Museum faced a huge repayment on its bond, San Francisco worked out a deal with MBIA and Chase, allowing the museum to regain ''sound financial footing,'' Mr. Xu said.
Sitting in his office, Mr. Xu said the timing was right to introduce the new $400,000 branding campaign. ''The purpose of rebranding is to engage a broader audience,'' Mr. Xu said. ''So of course that helps the financial side.''
In 2012, the museum will mount its most ambitious contemporary show, ''Phantoms of Asia: Contemporary Awakens the Past,'' featuring more than 30 living Pan-Asian artists exploring themes of spirituality.
The museum's leap into the Facebook age has jolted some of its longtime supporters, said Tony Sun, chairman of the Asian Art Commission, whose 27 members manage the museum's public affairs. Mr. Sun, who called himself ''old school,'' admitted he was among those whose initial reaction to the inverted-A logo was ''What is that?''
''But whether you like it or not, you won't forget it,'' he said.
And that was the whole point, Mr. Xu said. ''We want to offer new perspectives and open up more conversations. We want to be daring.''

HEADLINE: Accounting Investigation And German Euro Vote Leave Shares Mixed

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks were mostly higher in a volatile session on Thursday as stronger-than-expected economic data and German approval of a strengthened euro zone crisis fund relieved two of the worst fears hanging over the market. 
But the Nasdaq composite index slipped as the stocks of Chinese companies listed in the United States fell on the news of an investigation of accounting practices.
The Labor Department said initial applications for unemployment benefits fell to a five-month low last week.
Europe again averted disaster in its debt crisis when members of the German Parliament rallied behind Chancellor Angela Merkel to approve a stronger euro zone bailout fund on Thursday.
''The vote in Germany is obviously positive news and is exactly what is needed to give the region the go-ahead to recapitalize their banks,'' said Deirdre Dennehy, portfolio manager at the Rockland Trust in Rockland, Mass.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 143.08 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 11,153.98. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 9.34 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,160.40. But the Nasdaq composite index dropped 10.82 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,480.76.
The Chinese Internet search engine Baidu, whose American depository shares were down 9.2 percent at $110.29 on the Nasdaq, and other Chinese companies listed in the United States were among the biggest losers after a securities regulator told Reuters that the Justice Department was investigating accounting irregularities at Chinese companies listed on exchanges in the United States.
Kevin Kruszenski, head of listed trading at KeyBanc Capital Markets in Cleveland, said the news was especially bad because markets were already experiencing high levels of uncertainty and volatility.
High-tech shares pressured the Nasdaq, with Amazon.com off 3.2 percent at $222.44 after a sharp rally on Wednesday. Advanced Micro Devices sank 13.7 percent to $5.31 after it cut its third-quarter revenue outlook, prompting many analysts to downgrade their views on the stock.
Apple shares fell 1.6 percent to $390.57 on profit taking after gaining more than 16 percent during the quarter.
Other large-cap Internet names were also down. Netflix sank 11 percent to $113.19, while Yahoo lost 5.4 percent to $13.42.
A Merrill Lynch index of Internet stocks, which includes Amazon and Yahoo, fell 3.01 percent.
Market volatility is likely to remain high as traders react to European headlines and try to gauge the commitment of governments and institutions as they work to prevent a Greek default.
End-of-quarter repositioning will also influence market movement. Friday will be the last day of the third quarter.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 5/32, to 101 3/32, and the yield rose to 2.00 percent from 1.99 percent late Wednesday.
Volume was lower than usual as some bullion traders were off for the Jewish New Year holiday, Rosh Hashana.

HEADLINE: 3 From U.S. Skip Meeting With Mexican Governors

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
ENSENADA, Mexico -- The opening ceremony of a border governors forum here had it all: mariachi singers and a fireworks show entertained dignitaries who vowed to renew a spirit of cooperation between the states lining both sides of the United States-Mexico border.
There was only one thing missing from the 29th annual Border Governors Conference: Three United States governors. 
Only one of the four American governors whose states share a border with Mexico -- Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico -- attended the conference. The other three -- Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona and Gov. Jerry Brown of California -- said their schedules prevented them from attending. At the opening ceremony, Mexican governors shared a stage with Ms. Martinez and two state government officials from California and Arizona. Mr. Perry sent no representatives from his office.
The absence of the American governors complicated an already politically charged atmosphere. For years, the forum has been a kind of feel-good photo-op for governors and their aides, who gather to issue proclamations, improve coordination and set priorities on immigration, economic development, energy, tourism and other concerns. But last year, Arizona's crackdown on illegal immigration disrupted the conference and strained relations among the governors.
The conference was scheduled to be held in Phoenix last year, but all six Mexican border governors told Ms. Brewer that they intended to boycott it. They were protesting the state law she championed authorizing local police officers to inquire about the immigration status of anyone that they stop if they suspect that the person is an illegal immigrant. Ms. Brewer then canceled the conference, though an interim meeting was later held in Santa Fe. The governor of New Mexico at the time, Bill Richardson, was the only one of the four United States governors to attend.
Ms. Brewer had planned on attending this year's conference, but backed out suddenly the day before the opening ceremony on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for Ms. Brewer said she had to focus on issues concerning the state's child welfare agency and to meet with officials who completed a report on overhauling the system.
''She was really disappointed that she couldn't make it,'' said the spokeswoman, Tasya C. Peterson. ''She was really looking forward to coming. If there were any fences broken last year, I think that we've mended those fences, and we're mending those as we speak.''
Aides to Ms. Brewer and the two other absent governors stressed that their lack of attendance had nothing to do with the controversy over last year's conference and that they remained focused year-round on border issues and on maintaining relationships with their Mexican counterparts.
But Ms. Brewer's absence, in particular, was a topic of debate at the conference, held Wednesday and Thursday at a seaside hotel in Ensenada. Many believed that had she made an appearance, she would have been welcomed and praised by Mexican officials, while others said they suspected the political fallout from last year was at least in part to blame for her cancellation and the nonattendance of the two other governors.
''The signal sent by the three governors who are not here from the United States is that the relationship has suffered,'' said Rick Van Schoik, director of the North American Center for Transborder Studies at Arizona State University, one of several United States border scholars at the conference. ''Instead of last year being a hiccup, we now have a plateau, instead of solid progress on all the issues.''
Ms. Martinez, the governor of New Mexico, described the meeting as a success, and said it would be wrong to read too much into the lack of attendance. ''I just think it is what it is: It's just busy schedules,'' she said. ''I have had to, in the past nine months, cancel and reschedule other events that are extremely important. But you can't be everywhere all the time.''
Andrew Selee, the director of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Mexico Institute, said that the turnout from the American governors was more a statement about the vitality of the conference than the debate over illegal immigration.
''This is an organization that has enormous potential to have an influence on U.S.-Mexico relations and on the future of the border, but it hasn't really found its path yet,'' Mr. Selee said. ''U.S. governors, who are pulled in many directions, don't see it as a vital venue where they have to be, politically.''
The conference has neither an office nor a staff. Each of the 10 states that host the forum on a rotating basis -- next year's conference is scheduled for New Mexico -- serves as the principal organizer. ''There's not an umbrella organization, and there's no central staff, and that's one of the difficulties of trying to find coherence from year to year or issue to issue,'' Mr. Van Schoik said. ''It's not been a hugely successful 10-part dialogue over the years. It has been good photo-ops, good chances to talk, good chances to network among the work tables, but the amount actually accomplished is much less than it might imply.''
Though none of the Mexican governors publicly addressed the absence of the American governors, Mexican officials expressed their disappointment in private.
Guillermo Padres Elias, the governor of Sonora, said he did not think that a lack of interest in the conference was a factor.
''If it was, I think it's a mistake on their part,'' he said, adding that work must be done to strengthen the conference. ''I think it's the right path. It's always worked, and it has to keep on working, because the dependence between one state and the other, and one country and the other, it's not going to end.''

HEADLINE: Some Common Ground for Legal Adversaries on Health Care

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The 2010 health care overhaul law has provoked an unprecedented clash between the federal government and 26 states, dividing them on fundamental questions about the very structure of the federal system. But the two sides share a surprising amount of common ground, too, starting with their agreement in briefs, filed on Wednesday, that the Supreme Court should resolve the clash in its current term.
Until just days ago, it was hardly clear that the Obama administration would agree with the states on the need for prompt review, as there were good political reasons for moving slowly. The court's decision is now most likely to come just months before the 2012 presidential election. 
Their briefs also reflect agreement on matters of substance. The two sides, along with the judges in the majority in the appeals court decision most likely to be reviewed by the justices, all said the dispute is about means rather than ends. There are other ways, they said, for Congress to achieve near-universal health coverage, some of them more expansive than what was enacted.
''Both sides agree that Congress has the constitutional power to enact a national health care system that raised taxes to support a single government agency that pays all medical bills, just like Medicare,'' said Walter Dellinger, who served as acting solicitor general in the administration of President Bill Clinton and supports the law.
Randy E. Barnett, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs who on Wednesday sought Supreme Court review, made essentially the same point. ''What I've said from Day 1,'' he said, ''is that if Medicare is constitutional then Medicare-for-everyone is constitutional.''
Mr. Dellinger said there was irony in this harmony. ''The constitutional attack is focused on a mandate that was necessary if the new system was to utilize the existing private market, which had traditionally been a conservative and Republican proposal for how to deal with health care,'' he said.
To be sure, the two sides dispute whether Congress has the power under the Constitution's commerce clause to require people to buy insurance through what the federal government calls a minimum coverage provision and the plaintiffs call an individual mandate. But they agree that Congress could have achieved much the same thing through a slightly different mechanism, as Judge Stanley Marcus wrote in his dissent from the 2-to-1 decision issued in August by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta.
''The plaintiffs and, indeed, the majority have conceded, as they must, that Congress has the commerce power to impose precisely the same mandate compelling the same class of uninsured individuals to obtain the same kind of insurance, or otherwise pay a penalty, as a necessary condition to receiving health care services, at the time the uninsured seek these services,'' Judge Marcus wrote.
Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton, one judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in the majority in a 2-to-1 decision in June upholding the law, said the difference between the concededly proper approach and the disputed one was not enough to strike down a major piece of legislation.
''Requiring insurance today and requiring it at a future point of sale amount to policy differences in degree, not kind, and not the sort of policy differences removed from the political branches,'' Judge Sutton wrote.
Other judges have acknowledged the distinction but found it legally significant.
''Congress cannot require individuals who choose not to purchase health insurance or individuals who are not currently seeking or receiving services in the health care market to purchase health insurance in order to stabilize the health insurance market,'' Judge Christopher C. Conner of Federal District Court in Harrisburg, Pa., wrote this month. ''Congress cannot mandate or regulate in anticipation of conduct that may or may not occur in the future.''
The decision of the 11th Circuit is the one most likely to be reviewed by the Supreme Court, if only because it is the one that involves 26 states. It also helps that Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. on Wednesday urged the justices to grant a review of that decision rather than the one from the Sixth Circuit. It does not hurt, either, that the states are represented by Paul D. Clement, who served as solicitor general in the administration of President George W. Bush.
Mr. Verrilli and Mr. Clement appear to have areas of agreement about what should follow if the Supreme Court strikes down the requirement to purchase insurance. Both sides have questioned whether the court can surgically remove the heart of the current law without also killing parts of the rest of it.
The 11th Circuit majority, on the other hand, left in place every part of the law except the requirement to purchase insurance, even as it noted that Congress had found the requirement essential to the operation of two other provisions -- one forbidding insurers to turn away applicants, the other barring them from taking account of pre-existing conditions.
Lawyers for the federal government have called the three provisions ''absolutely intertwined.'' In his brief filed Wednesday, Mr. Clement wrote that the 11th Circuit's decision ''erroneously leaves the entire act in place -- even provisions that the federal government concedes cannot be divorced from the mandate -- notwithstanding compelling evidence that Congress intended the mandate to function as the act's essential lynchpin and would never have passed the act without it.''
There is agreement on some broader points, too, including that the law, the Affordable Care Act, is one of unusual sweep, ambition and complexity.
In his brief for the administration, Mr. Verrilli said the law was ''a comprehensive program of economic regulation and tax measures.''
Mr. Clement said much the same thing, but more vigorously. The law, he wrote, ''is a massive collection of sweeping changes that impose substantial new federal obligations on every corner of society and compel financial action from nearly every citizen of the United States.''
The two sides have a final point in common. Each seems quite confident that it will win in the Supreme Court.

HEADLINE: In Russia, Turning Back the Clock

BYLINE: By SAMUEL CHARAP. 
Samuel Charap is director for Russia and Eurasia at the Center for American Progress and a member of the Working Group on the Future of United States-Russia Relations.

 BODY:
Washington
On Saturday, the world learned that Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's current prime minister and former president, will return to the Kremlin in May 2012.
When Mr. Putin stepped down as president in 2008, handing the responsibilities of head of state to the newly elected Dmitri A. Medvedev, it did not diminish Mr. Putin's personal authority. But it did increase the chances that Russia would evolve into a stable democracy over time. His return in 2012 will drastically reduce those chances.
Mr. Medvedev's presidency, which began in May 2008, in many ways pushed the boundaries of Russia's political system, which maintains democratic procedures without true democratic practices and allows its citizens free exercise of some human rights while severely limiting others. 
First, despite the tradition among the Russian political elite of ignoring constitutionally established rules, the presidency was shown to be a robust institution. Mr. Medvedev went from Mr. Putin's right-hand man to semi-autonomous power center of his own upon taking office.
Second, the very existence of two senior leaders with different styles and demeanors inserted a healthy uncertainty into Russian politics. A wider range of voices could be heard in policy debates, and a sense that the status-quo ways of doing business for the past decade (which Mr. Putin seemed to embody, and Mr. Medvedev appeared to question) seemed to be subject to greater scrutiny.
Finally, the power transfer in 2008 demonstrated that Russia respected the 1993 Constitution's ban on three consecutive presidential terms. It created a perception in the West that Russian politics were at last becoming normal -- that despite all the warts of the Putin years, Russia would eventually adopt basic democratic practices, like the regular rotation of political leaders.
This perception of progress toward Western-style politics under Mr. Medvedev allowed engagement between Russia and the West to intensify. And the American-Russian ''reset'' has been about more than security cooperation; it entailed a new American push to bolster Russian civil society, increase government transparency in Russia, and expand contacts between the two societies. Unlike nuclear arms control, these less visible efforts don't generally make headlines, but they do help lay the foundations for pluralistic politics in the future.
Mr. Putin's return next year will reverse all of these positive trends. It will mark the complete personalization of Russian politics, and it will delegitimize both the presidency and political institutions more broadly. Russia's political system will therefore be all the more dependent on the man himself, raising the stakes surrounding the next transfer of power -- when Mr. Putin's next set of term limits expire in 2024 -- to potentially destabilizing proportions. (A presidential term will now be six years instead of four.)
Another Putin presidency is also a powerful signal to the ruling class that the change Russia so desperately needs is, in fact, unnecessary. But solutions to the multitude of chronic problems facing Russia, from a seemingly uncontrollable insurgency in the North Caucasus to an unhealthy, shrinking population, will come only with the kind of innovation that emerges through open competition, debate and adept government responses to rapidly changing socio-economic circumstances. Mr. Putin's decision says to the Russian elite: there's no need to debate Russia's future course, the only way forward is to continue the ways of the past.
Finally, it will become far more difficult for the West to engage comprehensively with a Russian government that increasingly resembles a sultanate based on a personality cult. Even if no fundamentals have changed with Mr. Putin's return, the perception has already shifted: Russia will find it harder to convince already skeptical publics in America and Europe that its politics and their politics aren't so different after all. And Western policy makers will have to respond to that skepticism, no matter how beneficial (for Russia and the West) engagement with Russia has been.
Mr. Putin may well continue Mr. Medvedev's modest reforms, or even push through a more comprehensive program, but that will not undo the damage his return has done to Russia's post-Soviet political transformation. By weakening Russia's political institutions, curbing pluralism, and threatening ties with the West, Mr. Putin's return has made the system he controls more brittle.
And if, as President Obama said during his visit to Moscow in July 2009, ''America wants a strong, peaceful, and prosperous Russia,'' then Mr. Putin's return is no good for the United States either.

HEADLINE: Taxes and Infrastructure

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Taxes, the Deficit and the Economy'' (editorial, Sept. 22) outlines the various tax-related ideas included in President Obama's proposals, including in particular the capping of deductions for certain taxpayers. The inclusion of tax-exempt bonds in this list of deductions undermines one of the key goals of the proposal: to promote the improvement of infrastructure. 
The burden of this change will be borne not by the affected taxpayers, who will simply demand a higher bond interest rate, but by the states, localities, and school and water districts that issue tax-exempt bonds to finance infrastructure projects.
Thus, in a very real sense, the proposal stands to increase borrowing costs for America's state and local governments, the very group that Mr. Obama has identified as in need of money to finance infrastructure.
Such increased borrowing costs have been estimated at $10 billion. Once the administration is aware of such a negative effect, we are confident that it will realize that this proposal undermines the goals that it is intending to achieve.

HEADLINE: Owners Of S.&P. And Dow May Unite

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
Two of the best-known stock market gauges in the world - the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 - may share the same home under a deal being discussed.
McGraw-Hill, the owner of Standard & Poor's, is in advanced talks with the CME Group Inc., which owns Dow Jones Indexes, about forming a joint venture, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Under the current terms of the talks, McGraw-Hill would own about 75 percent of the joint venture, while CME would own about 25 percent, one of these people said. Dow Jones, which owns about 10 percent of the Dow Jones index business and must approve any transaction, would receive a minimal stake in the new entity. 
A deal could be reached within a few weeks, though the discussions may still fall apart, this person cautioned.
Spokeswomen for McGraw-Hill and CME declined to comment. A representative for Dow Jones, which is owned by the News Corporation, was not immediately available for comment.
If consummated, such a joint venture would be the first time the S.&P. 500 and the Dow lived under one roof. Since their creation - the Dow in 1896, the S.&P. 500 in 1957 - both market measures have become permanent fixtures in the American economy and the most popular representations of the ups and downs of the stock market.
For many of America's biggest corporations, there are few more potent signs of dominance than being included in either index, and falling out of either imparts something of a stigma.
Those two benchmarks, however, are just the tip of a huge business. The companies own hundreds of thousands of indexes that track stocks, commodities and more exotic investments. Dow Jones Indexes alone has more than 130,000 indexes. Licensing these indexes for financial products can be a lucrative business.
The joint venture deal has been taking shape as McGraw-Hill has sought to revamp its operations to bolster its stock price. Earlier this month, the publisher said it would split into two publicly traded businesses by spinning off its education unit. The remaining operations - including the Standard & Poor's index unit and its credit ratings arm - would live on as McGraw-Hill Markets.
It is that company that is expected to house the expanded stock indexes business, the person briefed on the matter said.
By combining the two operations, the three companies are hoping to create a robust leader in market index products, including derivatives of their flagship products. It would also harness the growth in exchange-traded funds, many of which are built on permutations of major indexes.
It is unclear how the two activist investors pushing for greater changes at McGraw-Hill - the hedge fund Jana Partners and Canada's Ontario Teachers Pension Plan - view the potential joint venture. This summer, Jana and Ontario Teachers had called for a bigger breakup of McGraw-Hill.
But the company has resisted that push. While it agreed that its education unit would be better off as a separate business - it began preparing for that in March - McGraw-Hill has argued that keeping the rest of its businesses together, including its indexes operation, would make for a stronger company.
Representatives for Jana and Ontario Teachers were not immediately available for comment.
Shares in McGraw-Hill rose about 1.4 percent in after-hours trading after The Wall Street Journal reported the talks. They closed on Thursday at $42.31.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Is Longtime Favorite Target for Perry

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and KATE GALBRAITH. 
John M. Broder reported from Washington, and Kate Galbraith, who writes for The Texas Tribune, which produces a twice-weekly local section in the Texas editions of The New York Times, reported from Austin.

 BODY:
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has built a political career running against Washington, and no agency more symbolizes what he considers the meddlesome and economy-choking evils of the federal government than the Environmental Protection Agency.
Mr. Perry's conservative views on business costs, states' rights, job creation, energy policy and global competitiveness -- the core of his governing philosophy -- are illuminated most vividly in his clashes with the E.P.A. over issues like pesticide regulation and global warming.
From his earliest days as head of the Texas Department of Agriculture to his current campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, he has struck a consistent antiregulatory chord.
He brags that he has significantly reduced air pollution over his decade-plus tenure by working with businesses and that he does not need new overbearing mandates from environmental nannies in Washington. 
But E.P.A. officials and independent analysts outside government said that Mr. Perry was claiming credit for improvements in air quality brought in large measure by the very federal laws he has resisted and railed against, and that air pollution in Texas remains worse than in nearly every other state.
''His constituents are benefiting from the Clean Air Act that the E.P.A. is enforcing,'' said Janice E. Nolen, assistant vice president for national policy at the American Lung Association. ''It's happening in Texas, but not only in Texas, which tells us that it's federal action that is responsible.''
David E. Adelman, professor of environmental law at the University of Texas Law School, said the state had made progress in reducing pollution, but still had a long way to go. ''For the most part, Texas has lowered its toxic emissions, but so has essentially every other state in the country,'' he said, referring to airborne toxins like benzene and butadiene. ''The key point to recognize is that Texas started so much higher than everyone else.''
Catherine Frazier, a Perry campaign spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement, ''If elected president, the governor's energy priorities will be centered around scaling back the E.P.A.'s intrusive, misguided and job-killing policies, which will empower states to foster their own energy resources without crippling mandates and open the doors for our nation to pursue and strengthen an all-of-the-above energy approach.''
Ms. Frazier said that Texas had achieved large reductions in pollution by following its own path and asserted that some federal actions were driven by politics rather than science.
Mr. Perry used more colorful language this month in addressing a Tea Party group in Florida.
''Somebody has to tell the E.P.A. that we don't need you monkeying around and fiddling around and getting in our business with every kind of regulation you can dream up,'' he said. ''You're doing nothing more than killing jobs. It's a cemetery for jobs at the E.P.A.''
The main environmental battles of his governorship have centered on air pollution. Texas, with its large presence of oil refineries, chemical plants, cement kilns and other dirty industries, has struggled with emissions of both toxic pollutants and smog-forming compounds. Mr. Perry has repeatedly challenged federal regulators, in court and in public statements, over enforcement of the Clean Air Act, arguing that the state's unique, flexible, business-friendly approach is more effective than the federal strategy for controlling air quality.
Texas is also the largest emitter of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the country -- and the only state that has refused to abide by nascent federal greenhouse gas regulations. As a result, the E.P.A. seized control of greenhouse gas permits issued in the state early this year.
Republican politicians in Texas have long thrived on lashing out against federal regulation, but critics say Mr. Perry has taken it to new levels, picking fights with the E.P.A. even when it is not in the state's interest.
E.P.A. officials declined to comment on the record about their relations with Mr. Perry, saying they did not want to insert themselves into the presidential campaign. But they say they have worked cooperatively with lower-level Texas officials, who often seek federal technical guidance and money to address environmental problems. Recently, for example, the E.P.A. paid for and installed air quality monitors near several natural gas wells at the request of Texas officials.
The fights have been so bitter and the progress on air quality so hard-won in the Perry years that some environmentalists practically wax nostalgic for Mr. Perry's predecessor, George W. Bush, who as governor signed a bill intended to clean up old coal plants and put Texas on course to becoming the leading wind-power state.
''Bush was far better as governor in terms of his environmental interests,'' said Tom Smith, the director of the Texas office of the advocacy group Public Citizen.
No one disputes that during Mr. Perry's tenure, the state's air has become much cleaner. Ozone emissions fell by 27 percent from 2000 to 2009 -- a greater drop than in any other state, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the state's environmental monitor. Air emissions of toxic chemicals fell 41 percent over the same period, the agency said.
Houston, which had the worst smog problem in the nation during Mr. Bush's last years as governor, has substantially cleaned up its air: in 2007 it had just 38 bad ozone days, compared with 100 for Los Angeles. Houston remains out of compliance with federal ozone regulations, however, as does Dallas-Fort Worth, and this year the numbers in some cities are expected to be worse than last year's as a result of the extreme heat all summer.
Mr. Perry takes credit for the improvements, attributing them to state programs like flexible permitting, a system in which pollution output is capped according to a plant's entire output rather than smokestack by smokestack. Air quality progress, the governor has said, has come despite what he consistently derides as orders from Washington.
Mr. Perry assailed the clean air rule that a Texas power generation company blamed this month as the reason it will have to close power plant units and lay off 500 workers. ''Yet again, this administration is ignoring Texas' proven track record of cleaning our air while creating jobs, opting instead for more stifling red tape,'' Mr. Perry said in a statement.
Tensions with the E.P.A. have increased strikingly since the Obama administration appointed a new regional chief, Al Armendariz, an El Paso native. Mr. Armendariz, unlike many past regional E.P.A. chiefs, has an engineering background and is a former professor at Southern Methodist University.
Ken Kramer, director of the Texas chapter of the Sierra Club, said, ''This definitely has been the most confrontational that I've seen in the last couple of decades, almost to the point of being personal in terms of Perry lashing out at Armendariz.''
Mr. Perry and Mr. Armendariz have clashed over flexible permitting, practiced by Texas since the early 1990s. The E.P.A. argued that the permits allowed for too much overall pollution and were impossible to police. Texas has hit back against what Mr. Perry called an intrusive regulatory regime imposed by ''environmental statists.'' Ultimately, Texas lost the battle, and most of the facilities are making a transition to standard E.P.A. rules.
Mr. Perry has reserved special wrath for the Obama administration's intention to regulate climate-altering gases. Mr. Perry, who was a supporter of Al Gore's 1988 presidential campaign, has denounced climate scientists as grant-seeking frauds and the effort to control greenhouse gases as a ''contrived, phony mess.''
Texas led more than a dozen states in suing the E.P.A. to halt its greenhouse gas regulation program and has refused to participate in the federal permitting system that every other state now follows. The case is pending.

HEADLINE: The Pentagon Budget, Under Scrutiny

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Pentagon Budget and the Deficit'' (editorial, Sept. 27) is on target in calling on the Pentagon to ''sharply prune the tens of billions it spends every year on building new versions of cold war weapons systems ill suited to America's 21st-century military needs.'' This includes proposals for new nuclear subs and bombers that would cost upward of $100 billion over the coming decades.
The United States, by rightsizing its operational fleet of Trident nuclear-armed subs to 8 or fewer from 12 and building no more than 8 new nuclear-armed subs, could still deploy the same number of strategic nuclear warheads at sea as is planned (about 1,000) and save roughly $26 billion over 10 years, $31 billion over 30 years, and $120 billion over the life of the program. 
By delaying work on a new long-range penetrating bomber beyond the next 10 years, Congress could save at least $3.7 billion in research and development costs, and if the program were canceled, it would save at least $50 billion in procurement costs alone.
Because the Pentagon will continue to deploy 60 already proven B-2s and B-52s, delaying the new bomber program would not have any effect on United States nuclear force deployments.
By responsibly reducing strategic nuclear forces we no longer need and can't afford, we can help close the budget deficit and reduce Russia's incentive to maintain a larger nuclear arsenal.
DARYL G. KIMBALL Exec. Dir., Arms Control Association Washington, Sept. 27, 2011
To the Editor:
Your editorial did not mention that military compensation costs rose over the last decade because America spent the previous two decades whacking military pay, retirement and health care. When those cuts undermined retention and readiness in the '90s, Congress had to fix them.
Most Americans understand that it takes powerful incentives to induce top people to serve decades under conditions like those of the last 10 years. That great military benefit deal is available to any who meet the entry standards and pay the necessary upfront premium of decades of service and sacrifice. Few are willing.
You would cut benefits for those who serve and sacrifice the longest to pay more to those who leave early, and do not mention the retention-killing history of past, less severe cuts.
(Vice Adm., Ret.) NORB RYAN President and Chief Executive Military Officers Association of America Alexandria, Va., Sept. 27, 2011
To the Editor:
Your editorial highlighted the long-term costs of military pensions without fully acknowledging the sacrifice of our service members and their families.
While I agree that replacing the current pension system with a 401(k) plan is ill advised, delaying pension payments until normal retirement age would break a decades-old commitment to our veterans. We should not ask for additional sacrifices from our troops.
While an 18-year-old enlistee may retire at 38 after a 20-year career and begin receiving a pension, he is not on easy street. The average service member with a pay grade of E-7 after 20 years of service would receive an after-tax yearly pension of under $17,000. This is not a paltry sum, but hardly enough to retire and live out the rest of his life unemployed.
That retiree must re-establish himself in civilian life by finding a new career, likely requiring further education and job retraining. He or she may also have children to support.
We ask our service members to endure many burdens so that we may live in safety and security. The least we can do as a nation is maintain our commitment to properly compensate our service members for their service.
BOB CASEY Washington, Sept. 28, 2011
The writer, a Democrat, is a United States senator from Pennsylvania.
To the Editor:
The military budget needs to be cut, but your editorial takes aim at the wrong place. Instead of cuts in pay and benefits for our soldiers, cuts should come from the billions spent on nuclear weapons.
Debate in Washington dismisses almost $700 billion in spending over 10 years on nuclear weapons. New nuclear-capable submarines have an estimated price tag of $116 billion, and a new nuclear-capable bomber could cost $3.7 billion.
Additionally, new nuclear weapon facilities at an estimated $10 billion are on the way. And what for? Nuclear weapons are unable to protect Americans from today's threats, and President Obama has stated that the United States seeks the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.
The crisis in spending is a crisis of priorities. To cut the pay and benefits of our military would be shameful when wasteful spending on nuclear weapons needs to be cut instead.

HEADLINE: A Bad Union Vote

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew Cuomo's administration sent notices on Wednesday to 3,496 state employees that their jobs would be eliminated in 21 days. For that bad news, the workers can thank their union. On Tuesday, the New York State Public Employees Federation, representing 56,000 state employees, rejected a fair five-year contract that would have frozen base wages for three years and raised employee contributions to health coverage. 
Union leaders should ask the membership to vote again. They would be wise to agree to the concessions that the Civil Service Employees Association, representing 66,000 other state workers, already accepted and make sense in this economy. The contract includes 2 percent wage increases in the fourth and fifth years and comes with a promise of no layoffs for the next two years. There would be modest automatic pay increases for most workers. But the employee health care contribution, which has not changed in 30 years, would rise to 31 percent from 25 percent for higher-paid workers with family coverage; lower-paid workers would face a smaller increase.
The union leaders have said that they want to return to the bargaining table, a step the Cuomo administration should resist. Renegotiating with the Public Employees Federation would probably mean revisiting the contract with the Civil Service Employees Association.
Federation members grumbled that it is unfair for Governor Cuomo to demand sacrifices from them while giving wealthier New Yorkers a break by allowing a surcharge on higher-income earners to expire at the end of the year. Mr. Cuomo should work to extend that tax. But that issue does not affect the need to contain state labor costs, a reality that other public unions have accepted.

HEADLINE: Behind the Wheel, Moving Up

BYLINE: By SIDDHARTHA DEB. 
Siddhartha Deb is the author of ''The Beautiful and the Damned: A Portrait of the New India.''

 BODY:
THE man whom I shall call J showed up at my friend's apartment one evening. My friend had warned me that J was dropping in to talk about hard times -- he had lost his job heading a television channel, was going through a bitter divorce and had been reduced to living with his parents. But in spite of all this and the oppressive Delhi heat, J looked neat and composed. He began talking about problems with his wife, and his in-laws.
''The first instance,'' he began, ''was the Ford Ikon they wanted to give me.'' 
I was struck by the fact that his first point of reference was a car -- and an American model that would not have been available in India 15 years ago. It brought to mind how the car had suddenly become emblematic of a new India that hoped to model itself on the United States, especially in the individualism, speed and liberation promised by the open road.
Until the mid-1990s, cars had been mainly available in two models in India: the unglamorous, onion-shaped, sturdy Ambassador and the more aerodynamic Maruti 800. Both were produced by state-run companies (though the latter had a partnership with the Japanese company Suzuki). But when India began to open its markets, a wide range of cars became available, just as rising middle-class incomes and cheap consumer credit made buying such cars feasible.
In many ways, the marriage between the Indian middle class and the automobile culture has been disastrous. Roads remain awful, drivers continue to be erratic, and traffic in cities like Delhi and Bangalore is worse than ever. And yet the car has become deeply enmeshed with upward mobility, while also complicating that mobility. In the India of the Ambassador and the Maruti, the distinction was largely between those who owned cars and those who did not. In the India of Ford, Fiat, Hyundai and Mahindra -- where there is even a very cheap indigenous model called the Tata Nano -- distinctions are parsed in terms of the model one owns.
J's in-laws had borrowed money to buy the car as a wedding gift -- but it was really his wife who wanted it, and J, knowing that his in-laws weren't wealthy, had refused it, insisting that his bride travel to the wedding in his more modest Maruti Zen. His wife, unlike him, had been -- he hesitated before finding the right word -- aspirational.
I saw that aspiration frequently as I traveled around India. Even before I met Arindam Chaudhuri, a management guru and Bollywood film producer (who has filed a defamation suit against me in India), I knew about the car he was chauffeured around in, a lavishly appointed Bentley Continental, its shade of blue matching the color of his designer suits. Chak, an engineer I interviewed in Bangalore who had lived in the United States for two decades, drove a Ford SUV.
When I penetrated, with difficulty, into the rural headquarters of a seed dealer in Andhra Pradesh -- a man whose aspirational mansion had been burned down, either by rampaging farmers or by thugs dispatched by a rival seed dealer -- he turned out to be partial to a white Toyota Innova. To me, it looked like a suburban minivan, but to him and his associates, the tinted windows and cloth-covered seats were glamorous.
For the lower classes, cars give way to other modes of transport. The Assamese security guards I met in a steel factory in Andhra Pradesh showed me a battered bicycle they had found on a scrap heap, and which they had fixed up so they could ride to the bazaar for supplies. They pedaled away in the shadow of the new highway connecting Bangalore and Hyderabad, its flashing electronic signboards warning drivers not to use cellphones.
Esther, a waitress in Delhi, perfectly captured the transition between the lower and upper strata. We were taking a taxi to her apartment when she remarked, wistfully, how she would like to have a car someday. She then told me a story about her father, a retired official in the northeastern state of Manipur, and the bicycle he rode, sometimes carrying Esther's mother on the crossbar. ''But she's fat, and one day they fell down, and my mother got so mad at him that she said she would never ride on his bicycle again,'' Esther said.
It was a romantic image, one made precious by old black-and-white Hindi films where the modest but upright hero cycles around, his love perched sideways on the connecting bar. It made me think of the bicycles I see everywhere in New York, the expensive models made for lone riders, as well as the ones with child seats of varying sizes and shapes, and I wondered if the Indian upper classes, in their very race to catch up with the West, weren't falling behind yet again. I thought of the electric cars, of businesses like Zipcar, of car pools, and of the slowly emerging consciousness, even in the United States, about the limits imposed by the environment and the economy on cars.
But perhaps there is no such thing as just a car for aspirers. J certainly seemed to think so that evening as he told us the story of his failing marriage, recounting the vacations he took his wife on and the money he gave her and her family. Now, he said, she was accusing him and his relatives of harassment. She had claimed he was incapable of fulfilling his ''marital duties,'' a charge he denied indignantly. ''She was aspirational, you know,'' he said as his story wound down. ''She told me she wanted a red Pajero.''
He was referring to the Mitsubishi SUVs much loved by the power elite in India. ''I told her that in time maybe we could have a red Pajero.'' But she had been unwilling to give him that time, and so they had gone down the road that led to the lawyers and the courts.
He was writing a book about his experiences. He was aspirational, too, in his way. ''I have already written 60 to 70 pages,'' J said, picking up his watch from the table and strapping it on.
''I am thinking of calling it 'The Red Pajero,' '' he said, laughing. ''Maybe I could even get Mitsubishi to sponsor the book. It could be important. I think people will relate.''

HEADLINE: Hungary Blames The Banks

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Homeowners took risks in 2005 and 2006 that came to seem foolish, if not reckless, and wound up with mortgages they could not afford. Some blamed the banks for luring them into taking the risks. The banks offered some modifications, but said they believed it was the homeowner who should suffer for gambling and losing.
So it was in the United States. To allow people to buy homes they really could not afford, banks offered mortgages with artificially low monthly payments in the early years. When home prices fell, the mortgages blew up.
So, too, it was in Hungary, where home mortgages were relatively rare until the banks made it possible for buyers to avoid high interest rates, but with a big risk. 
Mortgages denominated in foreign currencies became wildly popular, because that way borrowers could get low interest rates, and thus afford to buy homes that would otherwise be out of reach. But then the local currency, the Hungarian forint, plunged in value, and homeowners faced rapidly rising monthly payments. They owed more forints than they had borrowed.
In the United States, the sanctity of contracts has generally prevailed. The banks have been forced to pay multibillion-dollar penalties for bad behavior, but that does little for the anguished homeowners.
In Hungary, the populist government has decided it is the banks -- mostly foreign-owned -- that should suffer. Under a new law, signed by Hungary's president this week, persons with loans denominated in Swiss francs can pay them off using an exchange rate of 180 Hungarian forints to the franc -- about a 25 percent discount to the current market rate of almost 240 forints. There are similar bargains offered on loans denominated in euros and Japanese yen.
It is not clear how much this will really help homeowners. Few of them have the money on hand to pay back their loans, and to get the money they presumably would have to borrow from banks. Andras Simor, the governor of Hungary's central bank, estimates that only one-fifth of borrowers will be able to take part.
The move has outraged the financial establishment of Europe. It represents a serious breach to the patterns followed in much of the world since the financial crisis burst open three years ago. Banks have lost a lot of money, and been bailed out, but bank executives have done quite well. Those who lent money to banks have generally gotten all their money back. Customers by and large have been forced to bear the brunt of their behavior, whether or not there was evidence the banks had misled them.
In Hungary, the lure of foreign currency loans back in 2005 was clear. Interest rates on mortgages denominated in Swiss francs were around 4 percent, while rates on forint loans could be in the double digits. Thanks to the lower monthly payments, a buyer could qualify for a Swiss franc loan who could not hope to get a loan in local currency. Soon a vast majority of mortgage loans were made in Swiss francs.
The risk was obvious. All the borrowers had income in forints, not francs. If the forint lost value, their loan payments could multiply.
Now the government claims that banks misled borrowers. The extent to which that is true is hard to gauge. But there is no doubt that a widely voiced theory was that because Hungary was a growing economy, its currency should appreciate against the staid old currencies of Western Europe. And that is exactly what happened in the years running up to the credit crisis. Those who failed to take out mortgages in Swiss francs or euros looked foolish.
When the forint began to lose value, banks did try to ameliorate the situation. In 2009, they offered to extend loan periods, so that homeowners could make lower monthly payments that would last for more years.
Earlier this year, with the forint around 220 to the franc, the banks came up with a plan that was reminiscent of the pay-option loans that helped to create the American financial mess. Borrowers could choose to make payments as if the forint were at 180 to the franc, and continue to do that through 2014. That would leave many with manageable payments, since most of the loans were taken out at exchange rates from 140 to 180 forints to the franc.
The savings from those lower payments would, however, simply be added to the principal of the loan. It was negative amortization, likely to postpone the pain but not alleviate it.
The Hungarian government, elected in 2010, has done a lot of things that upset others in Europe. It passed a media law that seemed aimed at silencing critics. It walked away from an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, choosing to seek fiscal stimulus rather than reduce deficits, as the previous government had promised to do after it was bailed out in 2008. The prime minister, Viktor Orban, blamed the central bank for the country's fiscal problems and cut the salary of its governor, Mr. Simor, by 75 percent.
Now it has gone after the banks.
Much of the Hungarian banking system is owned by Austrian banks, and Austria's finance minister, Maria Fekter, is reported by the Austrian business newspaper Wirtschaftsblatt to have sent a letter to Hungarian officials saying the new law violated ''all expectations an investor can have in a functioning market economy and democracy.''
Similar sentiments were voiced by Josef Christl, a former executive director of Austria's central bank, who is now an economics professor and a consultant to banks, including Erste Bank, Austria's largest and a major player in the Hungarian market.
''It is a serious violation of existing laws,'' he told me, pointing to European laws barring discrimination against companies from other countries. But there are Hungarian-owned banks, and they seem to be treated equally badly.
Mr. Christl said the law itself had helped to depress the value of the forint by raising fears about the government's economic policies. He said that had made the situation worse for borrowers, and he was dismissive of the country's economic record. ''Hungary is an underperformer with respect to growth and an overperformer with respect to debt,'' he said.
The rating agencies voiced alarm. Fitch said the law had set a ''dangerous precedent.'' Moody's called it a ''worrying precedent.'' In several other Eastern European countries, foreign-currency mortgages have turned into disasters.
At a news conference, the Hungarian central bank governor, Mr. Simor, said the move would ''weaken credit institutions' ability to support economic growth by extending credit. And that in turn will lead to a deterioration in Hungary's growth prospects and generate lower revenue for the government budget.''
It is far from clear that the Hungarian government can make the law stick. There are issues of European and Hungarian law, and there is the fact that Hungary, like many other governments, needs access to the international capital markets.
Even if the law does go into force, it would hardly be surprising to see the banks refuse to make new loans to enable borrowers to pay off old loans at a discount.
Speaking in Parliament earlier this month, the prime minister, Mr. Orban, said he ''expected that international organizations will attack us in international forums.'' He said that ''in case of unfavorable judgments, we will react with suitable countermeasures.'' He did not say what those might be.
But even if Hungary is slapped down, Mr. Orban has captured an antibank and antifinancier spirit that is much more widespread.
''It is time for the financial sector to make a contribution back to society,'' said Jose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president, as he proposed this week a tax on financial transactions.
The banks say that would be counterproductive and would drive trading to the United States, and they will probably prevail in the end, since the British government agrees. Do not be surprised if the debate on the proposal includes references to Jesus driving the money changers out of the temple.
When Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, met with Pope Benedict in Germany last week, she chose to highlight concerns over just where power resides.
''We spoke about the financial markets and the fact that politicians should have the power to make policy for the people and not be driven by the markets,'' The Financial Times quoted her as saying after the meeting. ''This is a very, very big task in today's time of globalization.''

HEADLINE: In European Crisis, Little Hope for a Quick Fix

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and LIZ ALDERMAN; Joshua Brustein contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It has happened time and again in recent months as Europe's debt crisis has played out. Stocks stage a strong comeback on expectations that a solution has been found. Then they quickly resume their decline as hopes dissipate, leaving investors puzzled and frazzled.
What is going on?
The problem, say close watchers of both the subprime financial crisis in 2008 and the European government debt crisis today, is that many investors think there is a quick and easy fix, if only government officials can agree and act decisively.
In reality, one might not exist. A best case in Europe is a bailout of troubled governments and their banks that keeps the financial system from experiencing a major shock and sending economies worldwide into recession. 
The latest rescue package for Europe gained approval from Germany on Thursday, after Chancellor Angela Merkel won a vote in Parliament, throwing the financial weight of the Continent's biggest economy behind a new deal.
But a bailout doesn't wipe out the huge debts that have taken years to accumulate -- just as bailing out American banks in 2008 didn't wipe out the huge amount of subprime debt that homeowners had borrowed but couldn't repay.
The problem -- too much debt and not enough growth to ease the burden -- could take many years to resolve.
''Everybody has been living beyond their means for nearly the last decade, so it is an adjustment that will be painful and long, and it will test the resilience of societies socially and politically,'' said Nicolas Veron, a fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels research group.
This is not to say that the discussions in Europe are moot. If governments can't agree on how to rescue Greece from its debilitating government debt, some fear the worst could happen -- a collapse of the financial system akin to 2008 that would ricochet around the world, dooming Europe but also the United States and emerging countries to a prolonged downturn, or worse.
Just like the United States, Europe built up trillions in debts in past decades. What is different is that more of the United States borrowing was done by consumers and businesses, while in Europe it was mainly governments that piled on the debt, facilitated by banks that lent them money by buying up sovereign bonds.
Now, just as the United States economy is held back by households whose mortgages are still underwater and who won't begin to spend again until they have run down their debts, Europe can't begin to grow again until its countries learn to live within their means.
In short, it means years of painful adjustment.
''We have to adjust to lower growth,'' said Thomas Mirow, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, referring to both Europe and America. ''It is of course going to be very painful. But leaders have to speak frankly to their populations.''
The uncertainty about Europe's future has been driving the gyrations of financial markets since the summer. Earlier this week, stocks rallied on euphoria that a new, more powerful bailout was near, but the rally fizzled Wednesday when cracks began to appear among European nations over the terms of money being given to Greece.
On Thursday, markets were mostly up again after the German approval of the 440 billion euro ($600 billion) bailout fund, intended to keep the crisis from spreading beyond Greece and Portugal to other European countries. Several other nations still have to ratify the agreement, but it now looks likely to be in place by the end of October.
Even this fund, however, is already seen as inadequate. Some worry that it still fails to fully address one of Europe's most pressing needs: fully recapitalizing its banks.
Now there is talk of enhancing the fund's firepower by allowing the European Central Bank to leverage its assets to buy up troubled government debt from the financial system. That would serve mostly to shift the debt from European banks to taxpayers.
''Clearly something is cooking, but the markets will eventually choke on the taste,'' said George Magnus, an economist at UBS in London. ''It is about getting banks off the hook, but the darker side is it's not doing anything real.''
Not everybody shares this view. Some argue that Europe is actually in better shape than the United States. Debt levels are painfully high in European countries like Italy, Ireland and Greece, but overall euro zone debt as a percentage of gross domestic product is 85 percent, less than the 93 percent level in the United States.
Also, European consumers did not go on the same borrowing binge, so their retrenchment need not be so severe.
''We need to do a lot to get over the crisis,'' said Holger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg Bank in London. ''But once we are over it, it will be the U.S. facing years of fiscal retrenchment, not Europe.''
A resolution of the crisis could bolster confidence in these battered economies, and lead to a return to positive growth. But the danger is that the strict austerity measures being adopted will only worsen economic downturns that some think could drag on for at least a decade in Greece, Portugal and Spain. Stagnant economies only make it harder for governments to pay down their debts.
Germany pulled itself around after years as the ''sick man of Europe,'' with high unemployment and sluggish growth. In the early 2000s, while the countries of Southern Europe spent beyond their means, the German government initiated a series of structural reforms, deregulation and wage adjustments that helped it become an economic powerhouse.
But it is unclear how other European nations like Portugal and Spain are to achieve a similar makeover.
The 440 billion euro bailout, even if enhanced, amounts to ''Band-Aid city,'' said Carmen Reinhart, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
''For a few weeks it buys tranquillity,'' she said, ''but it does not get at two critical issues: it does not reduce the massive debt overhang and it does not restore growth.''
Longer term, some political leaders and economists are pushing for a more integrated economic, fiscal and political union in Europe -- what they see as the only real solution.
''I don't think little steps are credible here,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economist who co-wrote a book about debt crises with Ms. Reinhardt. ''There needs to be a United States of Europe at the end of this, and it may well not include everyone in the euro zone.''
''They were thinking they had 20 years to get there,'' he said, ''and instead they have 20 weeks.''
Online Correction: September 29, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article used an incorrect unit in converting Europe's 440 billion euro bailout fund to dollars. It is $600 billion, not $600 million.

HEADLINE: Obama Charts A New Route To Re-election

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With his support among blue-collar white voters far weaker than among white-collar independents, President Obama is charting an alternative course to re-election should he be unable to win Ohio and other industrial states traditionally essential to Democratic presidential victories.
Without conceding ground anywhere, Mr. Obama is fighting hard for Southern and Rocky Mountain states he won in 2008, and some he did not, in calculating how to assemble the necessary 270 electoral votes. He is seeking to prove that those victories on formerly Republican turf were not flukes but the start of a trend that will make Democrats competitive there for years.
''There are a lot of ways for us to get to 270, and it's not just the traditional map,'' said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's chief strategist. ''That's why we're laying the groundwork across the country to compete on the widest possible playing field next year.''
While Mr. Obama's approval ratings have slid across the board as unemployment remains high, what buoys Democrats are the changing demographics of formerly Republican states like Colorado, where Democrats won a close Senate race in 2010, as well as Virginia and North Carolina. 
With growing cities and suburbs, they are populated by increasing numbers of educated and higher-income independents, young voters, Hispanics and African-Americans, many of them alienated by Republicans' Tea Party agenda.
''The biggest challenge'' for Republicans, said Tad Devine, a senior strategist for Al Gore's and John Kerry's presidential campaigns, ''is that they have to deal with what I would call the Obama electorate. And the Obama electorate is not the electorate that we have seen in America since I started working on presidential campaigns in 1980.''
Even so, Mr. Devine and other Democrats do not expect an easy race. ''It's not going to be a triumphal march to almost 54 percent of the vote and 365 electoral votes'' like in 2008, he said. ''It's going to be a hard slog, like the ones we did in 2000 and 2004 and came up short. The only difference is, Obama has got places to go that we couldn't go. We couldn't even target North Carolina when Kerry's running mate'' -- John Edwards, then a senator -- ''was from North Carolina.''
For Republicans, the reality of those changing demographics tempers their heightened hopes for beating Mr. Obama.
Terry Nelson, a campaign adviser to George W. Bush, John McCain and, this year, the former candidate Tim Pawlenty, said he was ''pretty optimistic'' for 2012, partly because Mr. Obama's support among lower-income, less-educated white voters, never high, has dropped enough that Republicans see good prospects for winning industrial-belt states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin.
But, Mr. Nelson acknowledged: ''The country is changing. In every election cycle, every year, every day, this country becomes more ethnically diverse. And that has an impact on the kind of coalition that you need to put together to win.'' He added, ''The truth is, Obama needs fewer white voters in 2012 than he did in 2008.''
Mr. Obama's recent travel reflects his calculus. On Tuesday, he was in Colorado, at a high school in a heavily Hispanic Denver neighborhood, to promote his jobs plan. This month he was in Ohio, but also in Virginia and North Carolina; he may return soon on a bus tour of neighboring states, aides say. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was in Northern Virginia on Thursday.
Virginia, North Carolina and Colorado together have more than double the number of Ohio's votes in the Electoral College -- 37 versus 18. And Obama advisers say that the same demographic factors at play in those states are also present in states Mr. Obama lost in 2008 -- like Arizona (whose senior senator, Mr. McCain, was his rival) and Georgia.
Except for Indiana, a long shot, Obama advisers say the president will be favored or competitive everywhere he won before, including Ohio. But polls underscore how tough a task he will have with independents in the industrial belt, where income and education levels are below the national average, compared with states like Colorado and Virginia with higher-income, better-educated independents.
The latest nationwide New York Times/CBS News poll this month showed that 51 percent of independents with household incomes below $50,000 disapproved of Mr. Obama's performance, as did 57 percent of those with incomes of $50,000 to $100,000. But independents with household incomes above $100,000 approved of his job performance by 50 percent to 43 percent.
In Colorado, the template for a repeat victory is last year's campaign of Senator Michael Bennet. A Democratic novice, Mr. Bennet defeated a Tea Party Republican in a year when Republicans were triumphant nationwide. He built a coalition of Latino voters, Democrats like himself who are college-educated transplants to Colorado, and independents in Denver and Boulder.
''No candidate can win this state without winning independent voters,'' said Mr. Bennet, who joined Mr. Obama on his Denver visit, along with Gov. John W. Hickenlooper and Senator Mark Udall; all three will help Mr. Obama's organization there in 2012.
With independents, Mr. Bennet said, ''The question that resonated in 2010 was, Do you want somebody who will go to Washington and try to work to solve problems, or do you want somebody who will simply be a partisan?'' They will seek a problem-solver again next year, he added, ''and I think the president has a strong case to make.''
A challenge for Mr. Obama in Colorado and elsewhere is mobilizing Hispanic voters, many of whom complain that he has not tried hard enough to overcome Republican opposition to immigration legislation. And appealing to independents will require some deft politics, since Mr. Obama's recent switch to a more confrontational approach with Congressional Republicans could cost independent support even as he energizes Democratic voters.
Virginia and North Carolina, with their respected universities, technology centers and diverse suburbs, are similar enough in their changing demographics that Mr. Devine suggests they can be viewed as a single state for purposes of presidential politics. Their combined 28 electoral votes are nearly equal to the 29 votes of Florida, which was traditionally joined with Ohio as must-haves for Democrats.
The change is evident outside Washington, where Virginia's northern suburbs now dominate in state elections, and south around Richmond.
''It's the difference between the Old Dominion and the New Dominion,'' said Mike Henry, campaign manager for Tim Kaine, the former governor and former Democratic Party chairman who is running for the Senate. Pointing to ''an influx of Latinos, African-American families, Asians,'' Mr. Henry said, ''the demographic characteristics of the state are totally different than what they were 10 years ago.''

HEADLINE: Banks to Make Customers Pay Debit Card Fee

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD and BEN PROTESS; Ann Carrns contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Bank of America, the nation's biggest bank, said on Thursday that it planned to start charging customers a $5 monthly fee when they used their debit cards for purchases. It was just one of several new charges expected to hit consumers as new regulations crimp banks' profits.
Wells Fargo and Chase are testing $3 monthly debit card fees. Regions Financial, based in Birmingham, Ala., plans to start charging a $4 fee next month, while SunTrust, another regional powerhouse, is charging a $5 fee. 
The round of new charges stems from a rule, which takes effect on Saturday, that limits the fees that banks can levy on merchants every time a consumer uses a debit card to make a purchase. The rule, known as the Durbin amendment, after its sponsor Senator Richard J. Durbin, is a crucial part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law.
Until now, the fees have been 44 cents a transaction, on average. The Federal Reserve in June agreed to cut the fees to a maximum of about 24 cents. While the fee amounts to pennies per swipe, it rapidly adds up across millions of transactions. The new limit is expected to cost the banks about $6.6 billion in revenue a year, beginning in 2012, according to Javelin Strategy and Research. That comes on top of another loss, of $5.6 billion, from new rules restricting overdraft fees, which went into effect in July 2010.
And even though retailer groups had argued that lower fees were important to keep prices in check, consumers were not likely to see substantial savings. In fact, they are simply going to end up paying from a different pot of money.
Or as Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, put it after passage last year of the Dodd-Frank Act, ''If you're a restaurant and you can't charge for the soda, you're going to charge more for the burger.''
Chase is now charging customers for a paper statement. It also, like many other banks, scrapped its debit card rewards program. And customers that Chase inherited from Washington Mutual no longer enjoy free checking accounts.
The bank is also exploring a number of other fee increases, including for online banking, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Bank of America's debit fee is steeper than most of its competitors', reflecting the broader challenges the bank is facing after the financial crisis. The bank has introduced an online-only account that charges customers for doing business at a local branch. It also plans to apply its new debit card fees to anyone who uses the card to make recurring payments like gym fees or cable bills.
Citibank is one of the few that said it would not introduce a charge for debit card use. ''We have talked to customers and they have made it abundantly clear that 'if you charge me to use my debit card, I would find that very irritating,' '' said Stephen Troutner, head of Citi's banking products. Still, the bank has made it more difficult to qualify for free checking, among other moves.
Earlier this year, Wells Fargo estimated that the Durbin rules would cost the bank $250 million in revenue every quarter. It hopes to make up half that gap with a variety of new products and customer fees, including the monthly debit card fee of $3. The change is part of a ''pilot program'' the bank will begin on Oct. 14 in five states across the country, including Washington and Georgia. As of Saturday, the bank will discontinue its debit card rewards program.
Meanwhile, HSBC said that it recently increased an A.T.M. fee -- to $2.50 from $2 -- for certain customers when they used a competitor's A.T.M. It also recently introduced a debit transaction fee of 35 cents, though the first eight transactions are free.
And at TDBank, customers will now have to pay $2 for using A.T.M.'s outside their network.
''Durbin essentially moves the cost of debit away from merchants, and now it's more focused on consumers,'' said Beth Robertson, director of payments research at Javelin. ''There are all sort of things happening where banks are saying, where can we put fees in place for our service to generate revenue or how can we reduce our costs?''
Over the last few years, consumers have increasingly shifted their spending to debit cards from credit cards, in large part to curb their spending. But some analysts predicted that the new fees could prompt consumers to return to credit cards -- a more lucrative alternative for the banks.
Consumers have already begun to react to the changes.
Patrick Shields, 48, said he had decided to leave Citibank, where he has held a small-business account for his residential window cleaning business since 1986. He was contemplating opening a personal checking account, but realized he could do better at a credit union.
''At the credit union, they opened it free of charges, which Citi could not and would not do,'' said Mr. Shields, who noted that a personal checking account would have cost more than the one he uses for his New York business. ''Now I have both accounts covered, and I am fee-free.''
The so-called Durbin rule quickly emerged as one of the thorniest provisions of Dodd-Frank, touching off a long and furious fight in Washington. Wall Street dispatched an army of lobbyists to tame the rule, ultimately yielding mixed results.
In June, the Senate defeated a measure that would have delayed the new rule. But just three weeks later, the Federal Reserve decided to cap the fees at 21 to 24 cents for each debit card transaction, a much lighter blow than once expected.
In a statement on Thursday, Senator Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said that small businesses would benefit from the new limits. ''Swipe fee regulation will still allow banks to cover the actual costs of debit transactions but will rein in the banks' excessive profit-taking.''

HEADLINE: An Icy Political Vision: President Obama, newly energized, takes on the callous values of the Republican Party

 BODY:
Taxes, spending and jobs dominate the conversation in Washington, but there is a great deal more at stake in next year's election, as Republicans know well. It sometimes seems as if they are the only ones who talk about their values, but they put forward an elitist and narrow vision that largely favors the upwardly mobile, the healthy, the native-born American and the needs of the corporation. 
This cold message is disguised, of course, cloaked in warm-sounding talk of solid American traditions and values. Democrats, including President Obama, have shied away from these issues or have been too late and too weak in providing voters with an alternative vision, with their own larger goals for the nation.
In the last few days, however, Mr. Obama has finally begun to broaden his challenge to Republicans. He is taking on their obeisance to wealth and refusal to reanimate the economy, as well as their callousness. ''This is a contest of values,'' Mr. Obama said on Sunday. ''This is a choice about who we are and what we stand for. And whoever wins this next election is going to set the template for this country for a long time to come.''
The Republican template has been in stark view at presidential debates lately. It is a program to wind down the government's longstanding guarantee of health care to the elderly and the poor and incinerate the Democrats' new promise to cover the uninsured; to abolish the Department of Education and its effort to raise national standards; to stop virtually all regulation of the environment and the financial industry; to reimpose military discrimination against gays and lesbians, deport immigrants, cut unemployment insurance and nutrition programs, raise taxes on the poor and lower them for the rich.
The candidates who pander to their party's lowest instincts are often egged on by the heartlessness of audience members at the debates. ''Has anybody been watching the debates lately?'' Mr. Obama asked in San Jose, Calif. He added: ''You've got audiences cheering at the prospect of somebody dying because they don't have health care and booing a service member in Iraq because they're gay. That's not reflective of who we are.'' (Mr. Obama might also have mentioned the lusty cheers for Gov. Rick Perry's record of presiding over 234 executions in Texas.)
There are many voters who are understandably dispirited or disillusioned with the Democrats. They might consider following a presidential suggestion and spending an evening or two watching the Republican debates. The Democrats lose their nerve at times. They are divided and factionalized and unsure, but they largely do not share what Mr. Obama called ''a cramped vision that says you're on your own.''
In making this long-overdue statement of contrast, Mr. Obama is animated by more than his own re-election. Should he be returned to office along with Republican majorities in the House or Senate, the country will have to endure years more of torturous partisan battles, as many or more steps backward as forward. At every level of the ballot, Republican candidates should be asked if they really want this to be a country where we're all on our own.

HEADLINE: Defeatism

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: An obsessive search for reasons not to fight unemployment. 

 BODY:
Martin Wolf is getting frantic, as well he should. The austerians have brought us to the brink of a vast disaster. A recession in Europe looks more likely than not; and the question for the United States is not whether a lost decade is possible, but whether there is any plausible way to avoid one.
Wolf directs us to a recent speech by Adam Posen (pdf), which opens with a passage that very much mirrors my own thoughts:
Both the UK and the global economy are facing a familiar foe at present: policy defeatism. Throughout modern economic history, whether in Western Europe in the 1920s, in the US and elsewhere in the 1930s, or in Japan in the 1990s, every major financial crisis-driven downturn has been followed by premature abandonment-if not reversal-of the macroeconomic stimulus policies that are necessary to sustained recovery. Every time, this was due to unduly influential voices claiming some combination of the destructiveness of further policy stimulus, the ineffectiveness of further policy stimulus, or the political corruption from further policy stimulus. Every time those voices were wrong on each and every count. Those voices are being heard again today, much too loudly. It is the duty of economic policymakers including central bankers to rebut these false claims head on. It is even more important that we do the right thing for the economy rather than be slowed, confused, or intimidated by such false claims.
Indeed. Posen's "unduly influential voices" are my Very Serious People. And it has been an awesome spectacle watching the VSPs search, obsessively, for reasons not to fight mass unemployment. Fiscal policy must tighten to appease the invisible bond vigilantes and please the confidence fairy. Interest rates must rise because, well, um, inflation, well, no, low rates cause moral hazard -- yes, that must be it. 
And we're not (just) talking about ignorant politicians. This stuff has been coming from the European Central Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Bank for International Settlements.
I don't fully understand it. But a large part of it, it seems obvious, is the intense desire to see economics as a morality play of sin and punishment, where the sinners are, of course, workers and governments, not the bankers. Pain is not an unfortunate consequence of policies, it's what is supposed to happen.
How obsessive are these people? So obsessive that when the financial doom they predict fails to materialize, they consider this a bad thing: punishment must be administered, so what are the markets waiting for? Here's Alan Greenspan a while back:
Despite the surge in federal debt to the public during the past 18 months-to $8.6 trillion from $5.5 trillion-inflation and long-term interest rates, the typical symptoms of fiscal excess, have remained remarkably subdued. This is regrettable, because it is fostering a sense of complacency that can have dire consequences.
Gosh, it's regrettable that the markets aren't confirming my warnings! And today Ronald McKinnon laments, yes, laments the failure of the invisible bond vigilantes to show themselves -- they're supposed to be "disciplining the government", so why aren't they here?
Just to reiterate a point I've made before, none of this reflects actual economic theory. Throughout this crisis, people like Adam Posen and yours truly have been basing our arguments on standard textbook macroeconomics, whereas the Very Serious People have been making up stories on the fly to justify their calls for pain. As Wolf, who really seems to have eaten his Wheetabix, puts it,
The waste is more than unnecessary; it is cruel. Sadists seem to revel in that cruelty. Sane people should reject it. It is wrong, intellectually and morally.
And this cruelty rules our world.

HEADLINE: Markets Can Be Very, Very Wrong

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Air pollution and economic ideology. 

 BODY:
Muller, Mendelsohn, and Nordhaus have a new paper in the American Economic Review that should be a major factor in how we discuss economic ideology. It won't, of course, but let me lay out the case anyway.
What MMN do is estimate the cost imposed on society by air pollution, and allocate it across industries. The costs being calculated, by the way, don't include the long-run threat of climate change; they're focused on measurable impacts of pollution on health and productivity, with the most important effects involving how pollutants -- especially small particulates -- affect human health, and use standard valuations on mortality and morbidity to turn these into dollars.
Even with this restricted vision of costs, they find that the costs of air pollution are big, and heavily concentrated in a few industries. In fact, there are a number of industries that inflict more damage in the form of air pollution than the value-added by these industries at market prices.
It's important to be clear about what this means. It does not necessarily say that we should end the use of coal-generated electricity. What it says, instead, is that consumers are paying much too low a price for coal-generated electricity, because the price they pay does not take account of the very large external costs associated with generation. If consumers did have to pay the full cost, they would use much less electricity from coal -- maybe none, but that would depend on the alternatives.
At one level, this is all textbook economics. Externalities like pollution are one of the classic forms of market failure, and Econ 101 says that this failure should be remedied through pollution taxes or tradable emissions permits that get the price right. What Muller et al are doing is putting numbers to this basic proposition -- and the numbers turn out to be big. So if you really believed in the logic of free markets, you'd be all in favor of pollution taxes, right?
Hahahahaha. Today's American right doesn't believe in externalities, or correcting market failures; it believes that there are no market failures, that capitalism unregulated is always right. Faced with evidence that market prices are in fact wrong, they simply attack the science.
What this tells us is that we are not actually having a debate about economics. Our free-market advocates aren't actually operating from a model of how the economy works; they're operating from some combination of knee-jerk defense of the haves against the rest and mystical faith that self-interest always leads to the common good.
And they're wrong, with every breath we take.

HEADLINE: Week 4 N.F.L. Matchups

BYLINE: MIKE TANIER


HIGHLIGHT: The matchups for the fourth week of the season include yet another grudge match for the Jets. 

 BODY:
Jets (2-1) at Ravens (2-1)

Any team coached by a member of the Ryan family does not so much play a 16-game schedule as careen from bitter rivalry to bitter rivalry, each game becoming the kind of over-boiled grudge match usually settled with suplexes and folding chairs at ringside. It happened to Buddy Ryan's Eagles, and it has happened to Rex Ryan's Jets.
Jets-Cowboys becomes Rex Ryan against Rob Ryan. Jets-Patriots becomes Rex Ryan against Bill Belichick. Jets-Ravens devolves into Rex Ryan against the team that declined to promote him to head coach when he was its defensive coordinator. Next time the Jets face the Raiders, it will be Rex Ryan against the team that broke his quarterback's nose. Even Rex Ryan could not muster a feud with the Jaguars, but Joe Namath got into the act this week, so if you play the current Jets against the 1968 version in a video game, that is now a grudge match, too.
Granted, the presence of the ex-Ravens Bart Scott, Jim Leonhard and Derrick Mason on the Jets roster does give the game a familiarity-breeds-contempt angle. "This is a family game, but it's also a heated rivalry," said Ravens defensive end Terrell Suggs, perhaps not realizing that Jets charity softball tournaments are also heated rivalries. "You've got to go beat up on the ones you love." In other words, this time it's personal. Just like all the other times. Pick: Jets.
Steelers (2-1) at Texans (2-1)

The season often starts this way for the Steelers. They grind out a couple of seemingly difficult wins against bad teams. They lose to the Ravens, or someone Ravens-like. We question their offensive line and remark that the team is not deploying the classic Steelers running game, because in Pittsburgh it is always 1978 and the only way to win is to hand off 40 times.
The Steelers have had a suspect offensive line for the entire Ben Roethlisberger era, made worse by Roethlisberger's belief that getting rid of the ball on time causes back pimples. Bruce Arians has been the offensive coordinator for five years, and he has always been more pass-oriented than the guys with Franco Harris collector's edition beer steins would like. The Steelers have reached two Super Bowls in four years through a succession of ugly wins. It is time to stop being surprised. Pick: Steelers.
Lions (3-0) at Cowboys (2-1)

The Cowboys botched several center snaps on Monday night, and Tony Romo knows why: the Redskins were imitating his pre-snap cadence. That's right: there is a Romo voice impersonator on the Redskins, or perhaps the team purchased one of those "Romo Calls" from a sporting goods store ("Blow into it, and American Idol runners-up flock to your position!") The Romo Karaoke did not stop the Cowboys' six field goals because no one knows what kicker Dan Bailey sounds like. (The holder Mat McBriar actually calls for the snap, but his voice was a mystery, too.)
Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson scored two touchdowns in each of his first three games, in part because opponents have an illogical impulse to leave him single-covered in clutch situations. The Cowboys will not make that mistake. "You always have to account for Calvin," safety Gerald Sensabaugh said. Maybe he should tell the Vikings and the Chiefs. Pick: Cowboys.
Panthers (1-2) at Bears (1-2)

It's time for advanced algebra with Mike Martz. Let x represent the amount of control Martz has over an offensive gameplan. Let f(x) represent running plays and g(x) represent passing plays. As x increases, the ratio of f(x) to g(x) is an asymptote approaching zero. Meanwhile, h(x), Lovie Smith's blood pressure, and p(x), Jay Cutler's health insurance premiums, increase exponentially. We would compute the rate of change in the Bears' playoff hopes as Martz's influence increases, but this is no place for derivative humor. For the Bears, Martz and his 4-to-1 pass-run ratios will always be an x-factor. Pick: Panthers.
Bills (3-0) at Bengals (1-2)

"The fandemonium is running high in Buffalo," began a WIVB television segment about the Bills early last week. The nearly three-minute segment revealed that Bills merchandise is flying off the shelves, that Ryan Fitzpatrick jerseys are on back order, that Bills fans are hanging out at the bar more but drinking less ("They don't have to drink away their sorrows," said the tavern manager Jill Vecchio, after wiping a bar top that looked perfectly clean in the first place) and that there is precious little else to talk about in greater Buffalo besides a three-game winning streak. One fan was said to be heading to an "exclusive Bills-only watering hole in Florida," which makes you wonder how some business models survive the recession while other, saner ones fail. Pick: Bills.
Patriots (2-1) at Raiders (2-1)

Raiders linebacker Rolando McClain said during the week that the Patriots were "just a finesse team." Tom Brady, perhaps realizing that the criticism hit too close to home, immediately consented to the most famous buzzcut since Elvis Presley was drafted in 1957. The high 'n' tight Brady can take solace in the fact that only successful teams are accused of being "finesse," often by grumbling opponents who fail to notice that their own offenses consist largely of end-arounds and cutesy option plays. Pick: Patriots.
Redskins (2-1) at Rams (0-3)

Like the first frost of autumn, the first unhinged DeAngelo Hall rant was late to arrive this year. But once it came, it delivered everything we have come to expect in a Redskins player interview: frustration, profanity and more than a hint of insubordination. Hall criticized the coordinator Jim Haslett's blitz packages, saying "you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out after a while." Rocket scientists could not track a 6.5-ton satellite as it crashed to the earth last week, so they might find Haslett's defense rather befuddling. Rams quarterback Sam Bradford has a degree in that most reliably predictive of all disciplines (finance), which may explain why he so often looks surprised. Pick: Redskins
49ers (2-1) at Eagles (1-2)

X-rays on Michael Vick's right hand revealed that the Eagles' linebackers are terrible. The Eagles took eventual action, benching Casey Matthews in favor of Brian Rolle in a panic-scented move. Vick says that there is a "100 percent chance" he will play despite a tender nonthrowing hand. Speaking of percentages, the folks at FootballOutsiders.com have determined that the 49ers have a 74.7 percent chance of reaching the postseason; only the Packers and the Lions have better odds. The percentages are determined by feeding statistics and schedules to a computer, watching as the computer gains sentience and weeps at the fate of the Seahawks, the Cardinals and the Rams, then drawing the obvious conclusion. Pick: Eagles.
Vikings (0-3) at Chiefs (0-3)

The Vikings have now blown halftime leads of 17-7, 17-0, and 20-0, and have been outscored, 67-6, in second halves and overtime. Coach Leslie Frazier and the offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave have made plenty of questionable decisions late in games. Why leave Calvin Johnson single-covered in overtime? Why work Adrian Peterson into the ground, then hand off to Toby Gerhart on fourth-and-1? The Vikings can defeat the Chiefs without solving these riddles. After that, their fans are advised to tape the games and watch them backward so they can enjoy the spirited comebacks. Pick: Vikings.
Saints (2-1) at Jaguars (1-2)

The Jaguars defensive coordinator Mel Tucker tore a quadriceps muscle while goofing off with other coaches after practice. Coach Jack Del Rio talked Tucker and the offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter into fielding punts from a JUGS machine, and things went horribly awry. Thank heavens they did not opt for skeet shooting instead. Del Rio was later seen grabbing the JUGS machine by the collar, getting up in its grill and shouting "You fool! That ball was meant for Koetter!" Tucker will miss this week's game, but defensive coordinators do not do much against the Saints anyway, except stand around and contemplate futility. Pick: Saints.
Titans (2-1) at Browns (2-1)

The Titans' passing attack has been surprisingly efficient in the early weeks, but that may change now that Kenny Britt has torn an anterior cruciate ligament. Britt had 17 receptions for 289 yards and 3 touchdowns, picking up much of the offensive slack left by Chris Johnson, who is still struggling to average more than one body length per carry. "It's not like we can magically create another Kenny Britt," quarterback Matt Hasselbeck said during the week. If they could, the Titans would win the first-ever Nobel Prize in Traffic Violations. Pick: Browns.
Falcons (1-2) at Seahawks (1-2)

The Falcons have surrendered 13 sacks in three games, prompting Coach Mike Smith to consider personnel changes: left tackle Sam Baker is a leading candidate to be benched if there is trouble Sunday. Meanwhile, on the police blotter, kicker Matt Bryant got his stolen golf clubs back. A Chinese food deliveryman swiped the clubs from Bryant's garage, then traded the clubs for drugs - who knew there was even an exchange rate? The police eventually tracked the stolen clubs by their serial numbers on the Internet, untangling one of the most pathetic webs of crime ever spun. Bryant's prized Scotty Cameron putter, like the Falcons' pass protection, was still missing at press time. Pick: Falcons.
Giants (2-1) at Cardinals (1-2)

The Giants' injury report arrived in the in-box this week, and it did not crash the server, there was no "low memory" error and there was no need to change toner cartridges twice while printing it up. Those are positive signs: Mario Manningham and Osi Umenyiora are back at practice, and additions are finally starting to outnumber subtractions. Eli Manning is fifth in the league in quarterback rating, and the Giants host the Seahawks after Sunday's journey to Arizona, where Kevin Kolb is fading a little every week, running back Beanie Wells is banged up and the local fans are distracted by the Diamondbacks. At this rate, Tom Coughlin may be almost cheerful by November. Pick: Giants.
Dolphins (0-3) at Chargers (2-1)

Reggie Bush Rationalization Season is upon us, a time to examine all of the underlying reasons for Bush's slow start while missing the main reason: he simply is not very good. "This last game, I got caught pressing. I've got to be patient," Bush said Wednesday. And the Wednesday before that. And most Wednesdays in 2009 and 2010. Tony Sparano wants his staff to "do a better job of getting Reggie in space, try to get Reggie touches early." Bush fumbled twice in the first half against the Browns, once on a pitch to the outside that gave him plenty of space in which to bobble. The Dolphins signed running back Steve Slaton this week. He's a small, shifty back who has had some brushes with greatness but has reliability issues. They must be trying to complete the set. Pick: Chargers.
Broncos (1-2) at Packers (3-0)

The Packers' midweek injury list was long. Running back Ryan Grant (kidneys) and tackle Bryan Bulaga (knee) are unlikely to play. Tight end Jermichael Finley and three key players in the secondary (Nick Collins, Charles Woodson and Tramon Williams) were all either out or limited in practice as of Wednesday. The Packers had a similar injury rash last season, and they won the Super Bowl by replacing their starters with other team's castoffs. Any general manager who releases a practice squad player right now is simply playing into Ted Thompson's hands. Pick: Packers.
Colts (0-3) at Buccaneers (2-1)

The two franchises that Tony Dungy helped to build are going in different directions. The Buccaneers are an up-and-coming team with lots of quality players but few superstars. The Colts are scotch-taping Kerry Collins together in what is becoming an increasingly depressing farce of an effort to survive without Peyton Manning. Dungy has become a best-selling author since leaving the Colts back when Manning was healthy and the supporting cast was capable. Dungy's next inspirational book should be titled "Distancing Yourself from Disaster." Pick: Buccaneers.

HEADLINE: Leading Off: It's (Useless) Prediction Time

BYLINE: LYNN ZINSER


HIGHLIGHT: The end of the regular season should persuade you to throw baseball playoff predictions out the window. 

 BODY:
Baseball's playoff prediction season is mercifully short, which is almost impossible to say about anything else about the game, and we should all be grateful for this. If the events of the past few weeks have taught us anything, it's that we know nothing. That's all of us, pundits, casual observers, former players now wearing TV makeup and hairspray. We all had as good a chance as the fish in our living room tank of predicting what happened at the end of this season.
Sure, everyone's going to have opinions and they are fun to argue over. Some people even get paid to prattle about them endlessly in front of a camera with completely misguided confidence -- again, thankfully, this lasts only one day -- but after proffering every one of them, we should be forced to add the footnote, "but I know nothing." Will C.C. Sabathia out-pitch Justin Verlander? Will Cliff Lee get every single batter out and still look as bored as the guy behind the counter at Kinko's? Will anyone outside the greater Phoenix area learn just who plays for the Diamondbacks these days? We've got no clue!
So please, take Tim Kurkjian's contention on ESPN.com that the Rays' magic is over with an entire mine of salt, and ditto for his dismissal of Detroit's chances against the Yankees. Scott Miller of CBSSports.com is all in on the Phillies, and lots of people are picking the Yankees, which means the idea of them as some sort of underdog is even more absurd than Mike Vaccaro of The Post believes. 
Please feel free to believe in the true plucky underdogs, the Rays, for at least a little longer, and we will find out quickly if Joe Maddon's decision to start rookie Matt Moore in Game 1 is inspired or just nutty. Right now, we'd be willing to believe Maddon could solve the global financial crisis after his decision to pinch-hit .108-hitting Dan Johnson one out away from doom in the final game. The Rays have a few more things going for them, writes Albert Chen on SI.com, the most obvious of which is Evan Longoria, whose season has been far more incredible than his stats might suggest. Jeff Passan of Yahoo.com gives a good in-depth look at why Longoria's season-saving heroics were no happy accident.
Longoria might be this year's playoff superstar, although Yahoo.com's Big League Stew blog offers 19 other contenders for that role. The Tigers' ace Verlander is on that list, of course, although the Yankees are clearly going to try to wear him down like they did in his regular season starts against them, writes Shawn Windsor in the Detroit Free Press. One of the more interesting twists to the Yankees-Detroit series is the blockbuster trade that turned out so well for both teams (as well as the Diamondbacks) involving Curtis Granderson and Austin Jackson and others.
Even a day later, it is still worth appreciating Wednesday night's amazing season finale, with Joe Posnanski explaining on SI.comwhy it was so magical. And Ken Rosenthal of Foxsports.com uses the occasion to urge baseball not to adopt the new playoff format that would have ruined all that. 
Rosenthal is also reporting the fallout from that great finish includes the imminent departure of Terry Francona as the Red Sox manager, although Gordon Edes writes on ESPN.com that the decision hasn't yet been made.
The N.F.L. will try to distract you from all that baseball fun this weekend, and it's staging a set of games featuring reunions of all kinds, writes John Clayton on ESPN.com. This is not surprising considering the massive player shuffling that followed the lockout this offseason, but what might be surprising is the level of bitterness, writes Michael Silver on Yahoo.com. During all the grudge matches, it might be considering whether Bill Belichick has lost a bit of his genius these days, as Billy Witz argues on Foxsports.com, but just saying that means he will probably win the rest of the games and laugh derisively at all of us from under his hoodie.
The N.B.A., by the way, is still locked out. If you forgot that, despite all the recent saber-rattling by Commissioner David Stern, you are not alone and former coach Jeff Van Gundy is warning everyone involved that fans may not be so forgiving when this is all over with.
In other disturbing news, former racing champion Al Unser Jr. was arrested under suspicion of driving while intoxicated, which seems to refute his contention to the Las Vegas Review-Journal a few weeks ago that he has turned the corner on his longtime alcohol problems.
Fortunately, most of us just have a baseball prediction problem. We can deal with that. We'll just throw them all out.

HEADLINE: Clearing House Group Assails Bank Capital Rules

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The Clearing House Association warns that requiring layers of bank capital protection would devastate the industry's returns and have a chilling effect on the economy. 

 BODY:
When several big banks faced extinction three years ago, many people wondered how such sophisticated institutions had failed to maintain rainy-day funds. 
Now, as regulators in Washington and abroad mandate larger capital cushions at the world's largest financial firms, the industry is railing against what it describes as too much of a good thing. 
The Clearing House Association, one of Wall Street's oldest and most influential trade groups, warned in a new report that requiring layers of bank capital protection would devastate the industry's returns and have a chilling effect on the economy. 
The report, sent this week to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and the Federal Reserve's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, argued that Wall Street was already well-capitalized, at least compared with the dark days of the financial crisis. 
The report, according to the Clearing House, "strongly suggests that additional capital requirements may serve little benefit at best, and most likely will burden market participants with unnecessary costs." Since the crisis, the report said banks had added some $200 billion in Tier 1 common equity, a crucial measure that regulators use to assess the health of an institution.
But that is not saying much. When Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, it had a debt-to-equity ratio of about 30 to 1, meaning it was borrowing $30 for every dollar in capital it held. Bear Stearns, another dangerously undercapitalized firm, also collapsed. Some 700 other banks collected more than $200 billion in taxpayer bailout funds to keep afloat. 
A collection of international financial regulators, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, approved far-reaching new rules last year that raised minimum capital requirements for big banks across the world. The so-called Basel III rules will require banks to raise the amount of common equity they hold to 7 percent of assets from 2 percent.
This summer, the committee proposed increasing the capital levels even further, by 1 to 2.5 percentage points, for the biggest and most interconnected banks. 
And that does not even count the new requirements stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the so-called too-big-to-fail banks like Goldman Sachs that have more than $50 billion in assets will face higher capital requirements and broader federal oversight.
The Clearing House study posed the question in the title of its report, "How much capital is enough?" It said the new rules would decrease return on equity for most American banks by up to 4.9 percentage points. 
The new requirements have touched off a heated debate in Washington and on Wall Street. Regulators and a number of lawmakers argue that without a capital buffer, the banking industry could once again drive the economy to the brink. 
But the rules have become the bane of many Wall Street executives, who argue that their firms are already sufficiently capitalized. 
The debate came to a head earlier this year, when JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, publicly confronted Mr. Bernanke at a conference. Mr. Dimon questioned the Fed chairman about whether "anyone bothered to study the cumulative effect of all these things?"

HEADLINE: Questioning a Standard Piece of Investment Advice

BYLINE: BUCKS EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: Paul Sullivan's Wealth Matters column offers some contrarian thoughts on investments. 

 BODY:
The long list of economic problems around the world -- from high unemployment and legislative gridlock in the United States to deep debt problems in Europe -- makes these scary times for investors, Paul Sullivan writes in his Wealth Matters columnthis week. The usual advice is to focus on a long-term plan and not abandon it when the times get tough. 
But Paul notes a new study that raises questions about another standard piece of investing advice -- investing money regularly over a period of time. This is the type of investing, known as dollar-cost averaging, behind 401(k) plans. The idea is that regular purchases reduce the risk of investing a large amount in a single investment at the wrong time.
But the new study, from Gerstein Fisher, a New York money manager, found that investing a lump sum yielded better results over a 20-year period than investing the same amount of money in equal amounts over 12 months. "The faster you invest the money the better you do," Gregg Fisher the president and chief investment officer of Gerstein Fisher, told Paul.
What is your investment strategy? Have you found a way to ride out the market?

HEADLINE: Ahead on Emancipation

BYLINE: LOUIS P. MASUR


HIGHLIGHT: The Massachusetts senator who tried to lead the way in freeing the slaves, and was denounced for it. 

 BODY:
No politician was more determined than Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts to ensure that secession and war resulted in emancipation. He interpreted every event through the lens of freedom. A quick end to the conflict, he feared, would leave slavery intact. Although he did not wish for it, he saw the benefit of the humiliating Union defeat at Bull Run in July 1861. He informed the abolitionist Wendell Phillips, "The battle & defeat have done much for the slave. I told the Predt that our defeat was the worst event & the best event in our history; the worst, as it was the greatest present calamity & shame, - the best, as it made the extinction of Slavery inevitable." 
Sumner, a conscience Whig, a Free Soiler and, finally, a leader of the Republican party, had always hated slavery. Educated at Boston's Latin School and Harvard College and Law School, Sumner became an indifferent lawyer and frustrated legal scholar (twice he was passed over for the Dane Professorship at Harvard). But at 6' 2", with wavy brown hair and deep blue eyes, he was built for politics. An English visitor called him a "man whom you would notice among other men, and who, not knowing, you would turn around to look at as he passed by you."
In an age known for oratory, Sumner was one of its foremost rhetoricians. He could speak for hours, without notes, and his deep, melodious voice soothed even as his words often provoked. A lengthy oration delivered in the Senate over two days in May 1856 nearly cost him his life. After Sumner denounced the outrages committed by pro-slavery forces in Kansas, South Carolina Representative Preston Brooks took offense at comments directed toward his cousin. As Sumner sat at his desk on the Senate floor, Brooks beat him viciously with a cane. Recovering slowly from his wounds, Sumner returned to the Senate on only a few occasions during the next three years. For most of that time, his seat remained vacant; he had become a living symbol of the violent intransigence of slaveholders.

Once war broke out, Sumner hastened to Lincoln "and told him I was with him now, heart and soul; that under the war power the right had come to him to emancipate the slaves." It was not, however, until Oct. 1, in a speech titled "Emancipation Our Best Weapon," delivered in Worcester before the Republican State Convention, that Sumner had a chance to develop the argument. 
 "It is often said," Sumner observed, "that war will make an end of Slavery. This is probable. But it is surer still that the overthrow of Slavery will make an end of the war." The crowd erupted in tumultuous applause and cheers. The war power, he believed, is "positively recognized by the Constitution ... [and] this law might be employed against Slavery, without impediment from States Rights." 
Sumner invoked John Quincy Adams, who, first in 1836 and again in 1842, had made the argument for military necessity. A quarter century before civil war erupted, Adams declared "from the instant that your slaveholding States become the theatre of war, civil, servile, or foreign, from that instant the war powers of Congress extend to interference with the institution of Slavery in every way by which it can be interfered with." He later said that once the laws of war went into effect "the commanders of both armies have power to emancipate all the slaves in the invaded territory," that "not only the President of the United States but the commander of the army has power to order the Universal Emancipation of the slaves."
Sumner called for a decree of emancipation and averred that "two objects are before us, Union and Peace, each for the sake of the other, and both for the sake of the country; but without Emancipation how can we expect either?" In a letter following the speech, Sumner predicted the future of an emancipation decree: "it is to be presented strictly as a measure of military necessity and the argument is thus to be supported rather than on grounds of philanthropy. At the same time, I do not hesitate in declaring also that thus you will do an act of justice." Sumner's prophecy was flawless: In his Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln justified the action as "a fit and necessary war measure," and added that he "sincerely believed" it to "be an act of justice."
It was easy for abolitionists to support Sumner's views, but radicals did not dominate public opinion. In Boston, conservative newspapers denounced the speech as "unfortunate," "impracticable" and "opposed to the spirit of the times." What about "servile insurrection?" What about the economic problem of "supporting four millions of human beings who have never been self-dependent?" The Caucasian, a vitriolically anti-abolitionist newspaper in New York, wondered "can any patriot read the rodomontade of this classic fanatic ... without a sense of pain, nausea, and disgust?" 
Even a supposedly friendlier figure expressed opposition. Charles Francis Adams Jr., writing to his brother Henry, wasn't impressed by the references to his grandfather in the speech: "What can Sumner mean by perpetrating historical frauds so sure of detection ... Sumner is a humbug! There's no doubt about it. He's been a useful man in his day, but he's as much out of place now as knights in armor would be at the head of our regiments." 
Henry Adams responded that while he was against slavery he agreed with more cautious voices like that of Secretary of State William H. Seward, who "says the time has not yet come; that we must wait till the whole country has time to make the same advance that we have made within the last six months, till we can all move together with but one mind and one idea."
The denunciation of Sumner serves as an important reminder that, in fall 1861, declaring emancipation and justifying it as a war measure was unthinkable to most Americans. But Sumner would not be driven off course. He believed the president was leaning in his direction and he tried to keep steady pressure on Lincoln, telling other Republicans to visit Washington "to press upon the Presdt. the duty of Emancipation, in order to save the country." Perturbed by the conservative tone of Lincoln's December message to Congress, Sumner rushed to the White House where "the President assured me that in a month of six weeks we should all be together." At year's end he wrote to Governor John Andrew on Massachusetts that Lincoln "tells me I am ahead of him only a month or six weeks." 
It turned out to be more like six months. On July 4, 1862, Sumner went to the White House not once but twice to implore the president "to make the day more sacred & historic than ever" by issuing a decree of emancipation. He came away from the first visit thinking Lincoln might at least declare the slaves in Virginia free, but by the second visit, the president had again shifted course fearing that if he issued such a decree "half the officers would fling down their arms & three more States would rise." 
Sumner believed the president "plainly mistaken." For the moment, his optimism flagged. It had reached a high point on May 28, 1862, when he breathlessly reported to Governor Andrew "[Secretary of War] Stanton told me this morning that a decree of Emancipation would be issued in two months. ... The cause of Emancipation cannot be stopped."
Finally, on July 22, Lincoln met with the Cabinet and announced his intention to issue a preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. Sumner heard the news and was delighted, though he despaired that the decree was not promulgated immediately and, when it was at last declared on Sept. 22, lamented that it would not take effect until Jan. 1, 1863, one hundred days away.
But Sumner did not rest: he immediately starting pressing the president to authorize the enlistment of black troops. He sent him George Livermore's work, "An Historical Research Respecting the Opinions of the Founders of the Republic on Negroes as Slaves and Citizens and as Soldiers," and called Lincoln's "especial attention to the last half," which concerned the use of blacks as soldiers.
The final Emancipation Proclamation did indeed provide for the enlistment of blacks, and those soldiers played an important role in the outcome of the war. Sumner beseeched Lincoln with one final request - if no one had spoken for it, would the president send him the pen used to sign the decree.

HEADLINE: Can You Hear Them Now?

BYLINE: PETER CATAPANO


HIGHLIGHT: Is the Occupy Wall Street protest movement a hapless carnival or a "church of dissent?" 

 BODY:
Do clothes matter? Do appearances?
Were our parents' not-so-subtle hints that our decade of pilly flannel, disintegrating Yes T-shirts (best band logo ever) and on-again-off-again grooming habits were impeding our success and social progress actually true?
Two short weeks ago, few people were paying attention to the activities of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Mainstream media attention was sparse. But the images of the group's protests in Lower Manhattan, which began on Sept. 17 and continue as I write, tended to look something like this:
On Tuesday of this week, these folks showed up on Wall Street. Dapper aren't they? (Maybe there something about a uniform. Or is it how they go in rows like that?)
That was a group of several hundred pilots who went to Wall Street on Tuesday to stage their own separate protest against their management. It elicited mostly admiration, nothing like the criticism that has been visited upon the Occupy Wall Street protestors, who are involved in a larger, more disparate and less tidy affair.
Was it because they were so neat? Or was it more tactical - that they clearly stated their grievances, made their views known and went on their way?

Whatever the answer, the image of the pilots provided a strong visual contrast to the ongoing protests, and raised the question of whether the media coverage of them has been sufficient, or fair. In the nearly two weeks since the protests began, that debate has been heated.
Last Friday, a column by The Times' Ginia Bellafante described the protestors as "a noble but fractured and airy movement of rightly frustrated young people" eager for the "opportunity to air societal grievances as carnival." The movement, she wrote, is a "diffuse and leaderless convocation of activists against greed, corporate influence, gross social inequality and other nasty byproducts of wayward capitalism." And later: "The group's lack of cohesion and its apparent wish to pantomime progressivism rather than practice it knowledgably is unsettling in the face of the challenges so many of its generation face..."
That probably wasn't just the kind of media attention Occupy Wall Street was hoping for. Those who saw something grander at play in the protests bristled at the portrayal. And with simmering outrage about the economy (90 percent of American think it stinks) and continued big payouts to failed Wall Street executives (like Leo Apotheker, who was fired by Hewlett-Packard but will leave with $23 million for 11 months' work), it hardly seems like mere agitation.
In an extended post at The Dissenter, Kevin Gosztola ventured an answer to that question, which included this opinion:
Criticism of Occupy Wall Street is just a way for establishment media, the power elite and those who believe in their views to defend their ideology on how politics is supposed to work. It is their way of affirming their conviction that at some point the children need to leave the streets and the grown-ups must be allowed to work in peace. It is also part of the culture; expressing support for "hippies" or a "plurality of voices" preaching against capitalism will not win friends and influence people in the Beltway. And so, they will make criticisms whether there is evidence to support what is said or written.
Digby at Hullabaloo, who cut the protesters some slack, offered this observation: "Movements don't come nicely prepackaged, even when they're corporate sponsored." She continued: 
The truth is that protests always have an element of street theater to them and on the left, this happens to be the theater we produce. (There was plenty of drumming up in Wisconsin ...) The point is to raise consciousness, create reaction and see if something catches. It's not easy to get attention for this sort of thing, so early protesters tend to be people who are willing to take risks and make fools of themselves in ways that the rest of us aren't. It takes a village full of weirdos to start a protest movement.
So, the fact that these people don't have full power point presentation of their goals and are asking for all kinds of disparate things is not cause to shun them. It's an opportunity to use the moment to draw attention to the problem (even if there's no fully laid out solution) and bring more people to the cause.
At Salon Glenn Greenwald argued that the criticisms of the movement's lack of organization and message were "ludicrous": 
Does anyone really not know what the basic message is of this protest: that Wall Street is oozing corruption and criminality and its unrestrained political power - in the form of crony capitalism and ownership of political institutions - is destroying financial security for everyone else? Beyond that, criticizing protesters for the prominence of police brutality stories is pure victim-blaming (and, independently, having police brutality highlighted is its own benefit). 
Most importantly, very few protest movements enjoy perfect clarity about tactics or command widespread support when they begin; they're designed to spark conversation, raise awareness, attract others to the cause, and build those structural planks as they grow and develop. Dismissing these incipient protests because they lack fully developed, sophisticated professionalization is akin to pronouncing a three-year-old child worthless because he can't read Schopenhauer: those who are actually interested in helping it develop will work toward improving those deficiencies, not harp on them in order to belittle its worth.
Despite complaints among protest supporters that the media coverage has been both sparse and dismissive, more attention came their way as the days wore on: New York police arrested dozens of people and various confrontations between police and protestors turned violent. One incident, captured on video, in which a high-ranking police officer used pepper spray on a group of protestors, has gone viral, and the matter has already gone to Commissioner Raymond Kelly, who has promised to investigate.
At The New York Observer, Kat Stoeffel described the scene and noted (with New York-style detachment) how a media benefit might arise from the nasty incident:
Two young women are penned against the sidewalk by an orange net, but they strain against it as they look down the sidewalk in horror, where someone is being aggressively handcuffed, bloodied face down on the pavement. While they're looking away, a high-ranking police officer in white swiftly approaches them, douses them with pepper spray, and slips back into the crowd. The two young women, blinded, drop to their knees screaming and clutch at their faces. Two women behind them also begin to cry as their faces visibly redden.
The video won't bring regulatory reform to financial services, reinstate capital gains tax, or repeal Citizens United, but it is one way to end a media blackout, or bounce back from a bad review.
But complaints that the media wasn't paying attention to the substance of the protests and their larger purpose persisted.
The blogger Michael Zachman proposed his own theory:
The contrast between the protest's prominence on, say, Facebook and its near-invisibility in the mainstream media is beginning to ebb a bit as local papers draw on newswire material, but what took so long for national news to pick up on a very visible protest in the media capital of the country?
Might news organizations' reluctance stem from the fact that most of them are owned by the large corporations that are publicly traded on Wall Street? It's hard to explain otherwise. After all, polls show that many Americans would be interested in the marchers' arguments. A Pew Research Center poll shows that "nearly half of Americans - 47 percent - say Wall Street hurts the nation's economy more than it helps." According to a Bloomberg poll, a whopping "70 percent of Americans say big bonuses should be banned this year at Wall Street firms that took taxpayer bailouts." In another poll conducted by Lake Research Partners, 77 percent of respondents approved of tougher rules for Wall Street. Seems like viewers and news readers would enjoy having a look at these protests.
Over at Media Matters for America Eric Bohlert tangled with what he saw as the movement's media problem. He argued that Occupy Wall Street lacks something the Tea Party had in their nascent days - a cable news outlet to deliver its message:
[W]hat would the Occupy Wall Street protests look like if they were embraced the way cable news embraced the protest-based Tea Party? Keep in mind, during a key ten-day span of activity between April 9-19, 2009, the cable news channels reported more than 100 times about the fledgling Tea Party. That's four times the amount of attention they've given to Occupy Wall Street this month.
Recall that the Tea Party movement was (theoretically) born on CNBC, when reporter Rick Santelli started ranting about Obama on the floor of the Chicago stock exchange, warning viewers the new Democratic president was steering the country towards a Castro-like Cuban economy. CNBC then hyped the clip incessantly ("Shot Heard Around The Word"/"Santelli's Manifesto"), while NBC led the evening news that night with the cable clip from its sister station, announcing Santelli's rant to struck a "populist" chord. (In fact, polling at the time suggested a strong majority of Americans the Obama plan to stem foreclosures; the plan Santelli had railed against.)
Fox News then quickly claimed ownership of the anti-Obama movement, providing free publicly and advertising for the right-wing rallies.
One of the more resonant broadsides of the week came from Matt Stoller, posting on Naked Capitalism, who argued that what was going on down at Wall Street was not really a protest, but a "church of dissent": 
[I[t's obvious that this isn't just about Wall Street, nor is it really a battle of any sort. There are political signs there attacking Fox News, expressing anger about Troy Davis, supporting the Iranian revolution, urging the Federal Reserve be reigned in, and demanding rich people pay their taxes. There are personal signs about debt, war, and medical problems. And people are dressed in costume, carrying lightsabers, and some guys are driving around a truck with a "Top Secret Wikileaks" sign on the side. I asked if they were affiliated with the site, and one of them responded with "That's what the Secret Service asked". Most of all, people there are having fun.
What these people are doing is building, for lack of a better word, a church of dissent. It's not a march, though marches are spinning off of the campground. It's not even a protest, really. It is a group of people, gathered together, to create a public space seeking meaning in their culture. They are asserting, together, to each other and to themselves, "we matter."
Perhaps coincidentally, Michael Kazin, a professor of history at Georgetown, wrote on The Times' op-ed page last week about the dissipation of the American left: 
[T]he left must realize that when progressives achieved success in the past, whether at organizing unions or fighting for equal rights, they seldom bet their future on politicians. They fashioned their own institutions - unions, women's groups, community and immigrant centers and a witty, anti-authoritarian press - in which they spoke up for themselves and for the interests of wage-earning Americans.
Today, such institutions are either absent or reeling. With unions embattled and on the decline, working people of all races lack a sturdy vehicle to articulate and fight for the vision of a more egalitarian society. Liberal universities, Web sites and non-governmental organizations cater mostly to a professional middle class and are more skillful at promoting social causes like legalizing same-sex marriage and protecting the environment than demanding millions of new jobs that pay a living wage.
Fair enough. But that was last week.

HEADLINE: Podcast: European Debt, a Tax Plan and General Motors

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen. 

 BODY:
It's been a difficult three months for the financial markets, and the global economy is weak. Unfortunately, more problems are probably on the way.
A resolution of the Greek financial crisis is not in sight. Approval of new powers for a stopgap bailout fund depends on the approval of all 17 members of the euro zone, and Finland, Germany and Austria all gave a thumbs-up in the last several days, as I write in the Strategies column in Sunday Business. But in a conversation in the new Weekend Business podcast, Floyd Norris says that many other countries still need to vote, and that even if they approve the strengthening of the fund, further remedies for Greece - requiring many further votes - will undoubtedly be required. The global economy, meanwhile, appears to be losing steam.
The United States has not come up with a solution for its fiscal problems yet, and many Republicans in Congress are opposed to raising taxes. In a separate conversation, and in the Economic View column in Sunday Business, Tyler Cowen, the George Mason University economist, says that a tax increase is inevitable sooner or later. If it doesn't come as part of a "grand bargain" to reduce the deficit, he says, it will be forced on the United States later on - so it's best to try to come up with a reasonable solution now.
And in his new book, "Once Upon a Car," Bill Vlasic says G.M.'s plight in 2008 was so serious that it contemplated a merger with its cross-town rival, Ford. That merger didn't take place, of course, but in a conversation with David Gillen, he says that it was actually proposed in a meeting between the leaders of the two companies. An article adapted from Mr. Vlasic's book appears on the cover of Sunday Business.

You can find specific segments of the podcast at these junctures: Floyd Norris (30:27); news headlines (18:47); Bill Vlasic on G.M. (14:45); Tyler Cowen (6:50); the week ahead (1:30).

HEADLINE: Defeatism

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: An obsessive search for reasons not to fight unemployment. 

 BODY:
Martin Wolf is getting frantic, as well he should. The austerians have brought us to the brink of a vast disaster. A recession in Europe looks more likely than not; and the question for the United States is not whether a lost decade is possible, but whether there is any plausible way to avoid one.
Wolf directs us to a recent speech by Adam Posen (pdf), which opens with a passage that very much mirrors my own thoughts:
Both the UK and the global economy are facing a familiar foe at present: policy defeatism. Throughout modern economic history, whether in Western Europe in the 1920s, in the US and elsewhere in the 1930s, or in Japan in the 1990s, every major financial crisis-driven downturn has been followed by premature abandonment-if not reversal-of the macroeconomic stimulus policies that are necessary to sustained recovery. Every time, this was due to unduly influential voices claiming some combination of the destructiveness of further policy stimulus, the ineffectiveness of further policy stimulus, or the political corruption from further policy stimulus. Every time those voices were wrong on each and every count. Those voices are being heard again today, much too loudly. It is the duty of economic policymakers including central bankers to rebut these false claims head on. It is even more important that we do the right thing for the economy rather than be slowed, confused, or intimidated by such false claims.
Indeed. Posen's "unduly influential voices" are my Very Serious People. And it has been an awesome spectacle watching the VSPs search, obsessively, for reasons not to fight mass unemployment. Fiscal policy must tighten to appease the invisible bond vigilantes and please the confidence fairy. Interest rates must rise because, well, um, inflation, well, no, low rates cause moral hazard -- yes, that must be it. 
And we're not (just) talking about ignorant politicians. This stuff has been coming from the European Central Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Bank for International Settlements.
I don't fully understand it. But a large part of it, it seems obvious, is the intense desire to see economics as a morality play of sin and punishment, where the sinners are, of course, workers and governments, not the bankers. Pain is not an unfortunate consequence of policies, it's what is supposed to happen.
How obsessive are these people? So obsessive that when the financial doom they predict fails to materialize, they consider this a bad thing: punishment must be administered, so what are the markets waiting for? Here's Alan Greenspan a while back:
Despite the surge in federal debt to the public during the past 18 months-to $8.6 trillion from $5.5 trillion-inflation and long-term interest rates, the typical symptoms of fiscal excess, have remained remarkably subdued. This is regrettable, because it is fostering a sense of complacency that can have dire consequences.
Gosh, it's regrettable that the markets aren't confirming my warnings! And today Ronald McKinnon laments, yes, laments the failure of the invisible bond vigilantes to show themselves -- they're supposed to be "disciplining the government", so why aren't they here?
Just to reiterate a point I've made before, none of this reflects actual economic theory. Throughout this crisis, people like Adam Posen and yours truly have been basing our arguments on standard textbook macroeconomics, whereas the Very Serious People have been making up stories on the fly to justify their calls for pain. As Wolf, who really seems to have eaten his Wheetabix, puts it,
The waste is more than unnecessary; it is cruel. Sadists seem to revel in that cruelty. Sane people should reject it. It is wrong, intellectually and morally.
And this cruelty rules our world.

HEADLINE: Markets Can Be Very, Very Wrong

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Air pollution and economic ideology. 

 BODY:
Muller, Mendelsohn, and Nordhaus have a new paper in the American Economic Review that should be a major factor in how we discuss economic ideology. It won't, of course, but let me lay out the case anyway.
What MMN do is estimate the cost imposed on society by air pollution, and allocate it across industries. The costs being calculated, by the way, don't include the long-run threat of climate change; they're focused on measurable impacts of pollution on health and productivity, with the most important effects involving how pollutants -- especially small particulates -- affect human health, and use standard valuations on mortality and morbidity to turn these into dollars.
Even with this restricted vision of costs, they find that the costs of air pollution are big, and heavily concentrated in a few industries. In fact, there are a number of industries that inflict more damage in the form of air pollution than the value-added by these industries at market prices.
It's important to be clear about what this means. It does not necessarily say that we should end the use of coal-generated electricity. What it says, instead, is that consumers are paying much too low a price for coal-generated electricity, because the price they pay does not take account of the very large external costs associated with generation. If consumers did have to pay the full cost, they would use much less electricity from coal -- maybe none, but that would depend on the alternatives.
At one level, this is all textbook economics. Externalities like pollution are one of the classic forms of market failure, and Econ 101 says that this failure should be remedied through pollution taxes or tradable emissions permits that get the price right. What Muller et al are doing is putting numbers to this basic proposition -- and the numbers turn out to be big. So if you really believed in the logic of free markets, you'd be all in favor of pollution taxes, right?
Hahahahaha. Today's American right doesn't believe in externalities, or correcting market failures; it believes that there are no market failures, that capitalism unregulated is always right. Faced with evidence that market prices are in fact wrong, they simply attack the science.
What this tells us is that we are not actually having a debate about economics. Our free-market advocates aren't actually operating from a model of how the economy works; they're operating from some combination of knee-jerk defense of the haves against the rest and mystical faith that self-interest always leads to the common good.
And they're wrong, with every breath we take.

HEADLINE: Week 4 N.F.L. Matchups

BYLINE: MIKE TANIER


HIGHLIGHT: The matchups for the fourth week of the season include yet another grudge match for the Jets. 

 BODY:
Jets (2-1) at Ravens (2-1)

Any team coached by a member of the Ryan family does not so much play a 16-game schedule as careen from bitter rivalry to bitter rivalry, each game becoming the kind of over-boiled grudge match usually settled with suplexes and folding chairs at ringside. It happened to Buddy Ryan's Eagles, and it has happened to Rex Ryan's Jets.
Jets-Cowboys becomes Rex Ryan against Rob Ryan. Jets-Patriots becomes Rex Ryan against Bill Belichick. Jets-Ravens devolves into Rex Ryan against the team that declined to promote him to head coach when he was its defensive coordinator. Next time the Jets face the Raiders, it will be Rex Ryan against the team that broke his quarterback's nose. Even Rex Ryan could not muster a feud with the Jaguars, but Joe Namath got into the act this week, so if you play the current Jets against the 1968 version in a video game, that is now a grudge match, too.
Granted, the presence of the ex-Ravens Bart Scott, Jim Leonhard and Derrick Mason on the Jets roster does give the game a familiarity-breeds-contempt angle. "This is a family game, but it's also a heated rivalry," said Ravens defensive end Terrell Suggs, perhaps not realizing that Jets charity softball tournaments are also heated rivalries. "You've got to go beat up on the ones you love." In other words, this time it's personal. Just like all the other times. Pick: Jets.
Steelers (2-1) at Texans (2-1)

The season often starts this way for the Steelers. They grind out a couple of seemingly difficult wins against bad teams. They lose to the Ravens, or someone Ravens-like. We question their offensive line and remark that the team is not deploying the classic Steelers running game, because in Pittsburgh it is always 1978 and the only way to win is to hand off 40 times.
The Steelers have had a suspect offensive line for the entire Ben Roethlisberger era, made worse by Roethlisberger's belief that getting rid of the ball on time causes back pimples. Bruce Arians has been the offensive coordinator for five years, and he has always been more pass-oriented than the guys with Franco Harris collector's edition beer steins would like. The Steelers have reached two Super Bowls in four years through a succession of ugly wins. It is time to stop being surprised. Pick: Steelers.
Lions (3-0) at Cowboys (2-1)

The Cowboys botched several center snaps on Monday night, and Tony Romo knows why: the Redskins were imitating his pre-snap cadence. That's right: there is a Romo voice impersonator on the Redskins, or perhaps the team purchased one of those "Romo Calls" from a sporting goods store ("Blow into it, and American Idol runners-up flock to your position!") The Romo Karaoke did not stop the Cowboys' six field goals because no one knows what kicker Dan Bailey sounds like. (The holder Mat McBriar actually calls for the snap, but his voice was a mystery, too.)
Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson scored two touchdowns in each of his first three games, in part because opponents have an illogical impulse to leave him single-covered in clutch situations. The Cowboys will not make that mistake. "You always have to account for Calvin," safety Gerald Sensabaugh said. Maybe he should tell the Vikings and the Chiefs. Pick: Cowboys.
Panthers (1-2) at Bears (1-2)

It's time for advanced algebra with Mike Martz. Let x represent the amount of control Martz has over an offensive gameplan. Let f(x) represent running plays and g(x) represent passing plays. As x increases, the ratio of f(x) to g(x) is an asymptote approaching zero. Meanwhile, h(x), Lovie Smith's blood pressure, and p(x), Jay Cutler's health insurance premiums, increase exponentially. We would compute the rate of change in the Bears' playoff hopes as Martz's influence increases, but this is no place for derivative humor. For the Bears, Martz and his 4-to-1 pass-run ratios will always be an x-factor. Pick: Panthers.
Bills (3-0) at Bengals (1-2)

"The fandemonium is running high in Buffalo," began a WIVB television segment about the Bills early last week. The nearly three-minute segment revealed that Bills merchandise is flying off the shelves, that Ryan Fitzpatrick jerseys are on back order, that Bills fans are hanging out at the bar more but drinking less ("They don't have to drink away their sorrows," said the tavern manager Jill Vecchio, after wiping a bar top that looked perfectly clean in the first place) and that there is precious little else to talk about in greater Buffalo besides a three-game winning streak. One fan was said to be heading to an "exclusive Bills-only watering hole in Florida," which makes you wonder how some business models survive the recession while other, saner ones fail. Pick: Bills.
Patriots (2-1) at Raiders (2-1)

Raiders linebacker Rolando McClain said during the week that the Patriots were "just a finesse team." Tom Brady, perhaps realizing that the criticism hit too close to home, immediately consented to the most famous buzzcut since Elvis Presley was drafted in 1957. The high 'n' tight Brady can take solace in the fact that only successful teams are accused of being "finesse," often by grumbling opponents who fail to notice that their own offenses consist largely of end-arounds and cutesy option plays. Pick: Patriots.
Redskins (2-1) at Rams (0-3)

Like the first frost of autumn, the first unhinged DeAngelo Hall rant was late to arrive this year. But once it came, it delivered everything we have come to expect in a Redskins player interview: frustration, profanity and more than a hint of insubordination. Hall criticized the coordinator Jim Haslett's blitz packages, saying "you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out after a while." Rocket scientists could not track a 6.5-ton satellite as it crashed to the earth last week, so they might find Haslett's defense rather befuddling. Rams quarterback Sam Bradford has a degree in that most reliably predictive of all disciplines (finance), which may explain why he so often looks surprised. Pick: Redskins
49ers (2-1) at Eagles (1-2)

X-rays on Michael Vick's right hand revealed that the Eagles' linebackers are terrible. The Eagles took eventual action, benching Casey Matthews in favor of Brian Rolle in a panic-scented move. Vick says that there is a "100 percent chance" he will play despite a tender nonthrowing hand. Speaking of percentages, the folks at FootballOutsiders.com have determined that the 49ers have a 74.7 percent chance of reaching the postseason; only the Packers and the Lions have better odds. The percentages are determined by feeding statistics and schedules to a computer, watching as the computer gains sentience and weeps at the fate of the Seahawks, the Cardinals and the Rams, then drawing the obvious conclusion. Pick: Eagles.
Vikings (0-3) at Chiefs (0-3)

The Vikings have now blown halftime leads of 17-7, 17-0, and 20-0, and have been outscored, 67-6, in second halves and overtime. Coach Leslie Frazier and the offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave have made plenty of questionable decisions late in games. Why leave Calvin Johnson single-covered in overtime? Why work Adrian Peterson into the ground, then hand off to Toby Gerhart on fourth-and-1? The Vikings can defeat the Chiefs without solving these riddles. After that, their fans are advised to tape the games and watch them backward so they can enjoy the spirited comebacks. Pick: Vikings.
Saints (2-1) at Jaguars (1-2)

The Jaguars defensive coordinator Mel Tucker tore a quadriceps muscle while goofing off with other coaches after practice. Coach Jack Del Rio talked Tucker and the offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter into fielding punts from a JUGS machine, and things went horribly awry. Thank heavens they did not opt for skeet shooting instead. Del Rio was later seen grabbing the JUGS machine by the collar, getting up in its grill and shouting "You fool! That ball was meant for Koetter!" Tucker will miss this week's game, but defensive coordinators do not do much against the Saints anyway, except stand around and contemplate futility. Pick: Saints.
Titans (2-1) at Browns (2-1)

The Titans' passing attack has been surprisingly efficient in the early weeks, but that may change now that Kenny Britt has torn an anterior cruciate ligament. Britt had 17 receptions for 289 yards and 3 touchdowns, picking up much of the offensive slack left by Chris Johnson, who is still struggling to average more than one body length per carry. "It's not like we can magically create another Kenny Britt," quarterback Matt Hasselbeck said during the week. If they could, the Titans would win the first-ever Nobel Prize in Traffic Violations. Pick: Browns.
Falcons (1-2) at Seahawks (1-2)

The Falcons have surrendered 13 sacks in three games, prompting Coach Mike Smith to consider personnel changes: left tackle Sam Baker is a leading candidate to be benched if there is trouble Sunday. Meanwhile, on the police blotter, kicker Matt Bryant got his stolen golf clubs back. A Chinese food deliveryman swiped the clubs from Bryant's garage, then traded the clubs for drugs - who knew there was even an exchange rate? The police eventually tracked the stolen clubs by their serial numbers on the Internet, untangling one of the most pathetic webs of crime ever spun. Bryant's prized Scotty Cameron putter, like the Falcons' pass protection, was still missing at press time. Pick: Falcons.
Giants (2-1) at Cardinals (1-2)

The Giants' injury report arrived in the in-box this week, and it did not crash the server, there was no "low memory" error and there was no need to change toner cartridges twice while printing it up. Those are positive signs: Mario Manningham and Osi Umenyiora are back at practice, and additions are finally starting to outnumber subtractions. Eli Manning is fifth in the league in quarterback rating, and the Giants host the Seahawks after Sunday's journey to Arizona, where Kevin Kolb is fading a little every week, running back Beanie Wells is banged up and the local fans are distracted by the Diamondbacks. At this rate, Tom Coughlin may be almost cheerful by November. Pick: Giants.
Dolphins (0-3) at Chargers (2-1)

Reggie Bush Rationalization Season is upon us, a time to examine all of the underlying reasons for Bush's slow start while missing the main reason: he simply is not very good. "This last game, I got caught pressing. I've got to be patient," Bush said Wednesday. And the Wednesday before that. And most Wednesdays in 2009 and 2010. Tony Sparano wants his staff to "do a better job of getting Reggie in space, try to get Reggie touches early." Bush fumbled twice in the first half against the Browns, once on a pitch to the outside that gave him plenty of space in which to bobble. The Dolphins signed running back Steve Slaton this week. He's a small, shifty back who has had some brushes with greatness but has reliability issues. They must be trying to complete the set. Pick: Chargers.
Broncos (1-2) at Packers (3-0)

The Packers' midweek injury list was long. Running back Ryan Grant (kidneys) and tackle Bryan Bulaga (knee) are unlikely to play. Tight end Jermichael Finley and three key players in the secondary (Nick Collins, Charles Woodson and Tramon Williams) were all either out or limited in practice as of Wednesday. The Packers had a similar injury rash last season, and they won the Super Bowl by replacing their starters with other team's castoffs. Any general manager who releases a practice squad player right now is simply playing into Ted Thompson's hands. Pick: Packers.
Colts (0-3) at Buccaneers (2-1)

The two franchises that Tony Dungy helped to build are going in different directions. The Buccaneers are an up-and-coming team with lots of quality players but few superstars. The Colts are scotch-taping Kerry Collins together in what is becoming an increasingly depressing farce of an effort to survive without Peyton Manning. Dungy has become a best-selling author since leaving the Colts back when Manning was healthy and the supporting cast was capable. Dungy's next inspirational book should be titled "Distancing Yourself from Disaster." Pick: Buccaneers.

HEADLINE: Leading Off: It's (Useless) Prediction Time

BYLINE: LYNN ZINSER


HIGHLIGHT: The end of the regular season should persuade you to throw baseball playoff predictions out the window. 

 BODY:
Baseball's playoff prediction season is mercifully short, which is almost impossible to say about anything else about the game, and we should all be grateful for this. If the events of the past few weeks have taught us anything, it's that we know nothing. That's all of us, pundits, casual observers, former players now wearing TV makeup and hairspray. We all had as good a chance as the fish in our living room tank of predicting what happened at the end of this season.
Sure, everyone's going to have opinions and they are fun to argue over. Some people even get paid to prattle about them endlessly in front of a camera with completely misguided confidence -- again, thankfully, this lasts only one day -- but after proffering every one of them, we should be forced to add the footnote, "but I know nothing." Will C.C. Sabathia out-pitch Justin Verlander? Will Cliff Lee get every single batter out and still look as bored as the guy behind the counter at Kinko's? Will anyone outside the greater Phoenix area learn just who plays for the Diamondbacks these days? We've got no clue!
So please, take Tim Kurkjian's contention on ESPN.com that the Rays' magic is over with an entire mine of salt, and ditto for his dismissal of Detroit's chances against the Yankees. Scott Miller of CBSSports.com is all in on the Phillies, and lots of people are picking the Yankees, which means the idea of them as some sort of underdog is even more absurd than Mike Vaccaro of The Post believes. 
Please feel free to believe in the true plucky underdogs, the Rays, for at least a little longer, and we will find out quickly if Joe Maddon's decision to start rookie Matt Moore in Game 1 is inspired or just nutty. Right now, we'd be willing to believe Maddon could solve the global financial crisis after his decision to pinch-hit .108-hitting Dan Johnson one out away from doom in the final game. The Rays have a few more things going for them, writes Albert Chen on SI.com, the most obvious of which is Evan Longoria, whose season has been far more incredible than his stats might suggest. Jeff Passan of Yahoo.com gives a good in-depth look at why Longoria's season-saving heroics were no happy accident.
Longoria might be this year's playoff superstar, although Yahoo.com's Big League Stew blog offers 19 other contenders for that role. The Tigers' ace Verlander is on that list, of course, although the Yankees are clearly going to try to wear him down like they did in his regular season starts against them, writes Shawn Windsor in the Detroit Free Press. One of the more interesting twists to the Yankees-Detroit series is the blockbuster trade that turned out so well for both teams (as well as the Diamondbacks) involving Curtis Granderson and Austin Jackson and others.
Even a day later, it is still worth appreciating Wednesday night's amazing season finale, with Joe Posnanski explaining on SI.comwhy it was so magical. And Ken Rosenthal of Foxsports.com uses the occasion to urge baseball not to adopt the new playoff format that would have ruined all that. 
Rosenthal is also reporting the fallout from that great finish includes the imminent departure of Terry Francona as the Red Sox manager, although Gordon Edes writes on ESPN.com that the decision hasn't yet been made.
The N.F.L. will try to distract you from all that baseball fun this weekend, and it's staging a set of games featuring reunions of all kinds, writes John Clayton on ESPN.com. This is not surprising considering the massive player shuffling that followed the lockout this offseason, but what might be surprising is the level of bitterness, writes Michael Silver on Yahoo.com. During all the grudge matches, it might be considering whether Bill Belichick has lost a bit of his genius these days, as Billy Witz argues on Foxsports.com, but just saying that means he will probably win the rest of the games and laugh derisively at all of us from under his hoodie.
The N.B.A., by the way, is still locked out. If you forgot that, despite all the recent saber-rattling by Commissioner David Stern, you are not alone and former coach Jeff Van Gundy is warning everyone involved that fans may not be so forgiving when this is all over with.
In other disturbing news, former racing champion Al Unser Jr. was arrested under suspicion of driving while intoxicated, which seems to refute his contention to the Las Vegas Review-Journal a few weeks ago that he has turned the corner on his longtime alcohol problems.
Fortunately, most of us just have a baseball prediction problem. We can deal with that. We'll just throw them all out.

HEADLINE: Questioning a Standard Piece of Investment Advice

BYLINE: BUCKS EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: Paul Sullivan's Wealth Matters column offers some contrarian thoughts on investments. 

 BODY:
The long list of economic problems around the world -- from high unemployment and legislative gridlock in the United States to deep debt problems in Europe -- makes these scary times for investors, Paul Sullivan writes in his Wealth Matters columnthis week. The usual advice is to focus on a long-term plan and not abandon it when the times get tough. 
But Paul notes a new study that raises questions about another standard piece of investing advice -- investing money regularly over a period of time. This is the type of investing, known as dollar-cost averaging, behind 401(k) plans. The idea is that regular purchases reduce the risk of investing a large amount in a single investment at the wrong time.
But the new study, from Gerstein Fisher, a New York money manager, found that investing a lump sum yielded better results over a 20-year period than investing the same amount of money in equal amounts over 12 months. "The faster you invest the money the better you do," Gregg Fisher the president and chief investment officer of Gerstein Fisher, told Paul.
What is your investment strategy? Have you found a way to ride out the market?

HEADLINE: Ahead on Emancipation

BYLINE: LOUIS P. MASUR


HIGHLIGHT: The Massachusetts senator who tried to lead the way in freeing the slaves, and was denounced for it. 

 BODY:
No politician was more determined than Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts to ensure that secession and war resulted in emancipation. He interpreted every event through the lens of freedom. A quick end to the conflict, he feared, would leave slavery intact. Although he did not wish for it, he saw the benefit of the humiliating Union defeat at Bull Run in July 1861. He informed the abolitionist Wendell Phillips, "The battle & defeat have done much for the slave. I told the Predt that our defeat was the worst event & the best event in our history; the worst, as it was the greatest present calamity & shame, - the best, as it made the extinction of Slavery inevitable." 
Sumner, a conscience Whig, a Free Soiler and, finally, a leader of the Republican party, had always hated slavery. Educated at Boston's Latin School and Harvard College and Law School, Sumner became an indifferent lawyer and frustrated legal scholar (twice he was passed over for the Dane Professorship at Harvard). But at 6' 2", with wavy brown hair and deep blue eyes, he was built for politics. An English visitor called him a "man whom you would notice among other men, and who, not knowing, you would turn around to look at as he passed by you."
In an age known for oratory, Sumner was one of its foremost rhetoricians. He could speak for hours, without notes, and his deep, melodious voice soothed even as his words often provoked. A lengthy oration delivered in the Senate over two days in May 1856 nearly cost him his life. After Sumner denounced the outrages committed by pro-slavery forces in Kansas, South Carolina Representative Preston Brooks took offense at comments directed toward his cousin. As Sumner sat at his desk on the Senate floor, Brooks beat him viciously with a cane. Recovering slowly from his wounds, Sumner returned to the Senate on only a few occasions during the next three years. For most of that time, his seat remained vacant; he had become a living symbol of the violent intransigence of slaveholders.

Once war broke out, Sumner hastened to Lincoln "and told him I was with him now, heart and soul; that under the war power the right had come to him to emancipate the slaves." It was not, however, until Oct. 1, in a speech titled "Emancipation Our Best Weapon," delivered in Worcester before the Republican State Convention, that Sumner had a chance to develop the argument. 
 "It is often said," Sumner observed, "that war will make an end of Slavery. This is probable. But it is surer still that the overthrow of Slavery will make an end of the war." The crowd erupted in tumultuous applause and cheers. The war power, he believed, is "positively recognized by the Constitution ... [and] this law might be employed against Slavery, without impediment from States Rights." 
Sumner invoked John Quincy Adams, who, first in 1836 and again in 1842, had made the argument for military necessity. A quarter century before civil war erupted, Adams declared "from the instant that your slaveholding States become the theatre of war, civil, servile, or foreign, from that instant the war powers of Congress extend to interference with the institution of Slavery in every way by which it can be interfered with." He later said that once the laws of war went into effect "the commanders of both armies have power to emancipate all the slaves in the invaded territory," that "not only the President of the United States but the commander of the army has power to order the Universal Emancipation of the slaves."
Sumner called for a decree of emancipation and averred that "two objects are before us, Union and Peace, each for the sake of the other, and both for the sake of the country; but without Emancipation how can we expect either?" In a letter following the speech, Sumner predicted the future of an emancipation decree: "it is to be presented strictly as a measure of military necessity and the argument is thus to be supported rather than on grounds of philanthropy. At the same time, I do not hesitate in declaring also that thus you will do an act of justice." Sumner's prophecy was flawless: In his Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln justified the action as "a fit and necessary war measure," and added that he "sincerely believed" it to "be an act of justice."
It was easy for abolitionists to support Sumner's views, but radicals did not dominate public opinion. In Boston, conservative newspapers denounced the speech as "unfortunate," "impracticable" and "opposed to the spirit of the times." What about "servile insurrection?" What about the economic problem of "supporting four millions of human beings who have never been self-dependent?" The Caucasian, a vitriolically anti-abolitionist newspaper in New York, wondered "can any patriot read the rodomontade of this classic fanatic ... without a sense of pain, nausea, and disgust?" 
Even a supposedly friendlier figure expressed opposition. Charles Francis Adams Jr., writing to his brother Henry, wasn't impressed by the references to his grandfather in the speech: "What can Sumner mean by perpetrating historical frauds so sure of detection ... Sumner is a humbug! There's no doubt about it. He's been a useful man in his day, but he's as much out of place now as knights in armor would be at the head of our regiments." 
Henry Adams responded that while he was against slavery he agreed with more cautious voices like that of Secretary of State William H. Seward, who "says the time has not yet come; that we must wait till the whole country has time to make the same advance that we have made within the last six months, till we can all move together with but one mind and one idea."
The denunciation of Sumner serves as an important reminder that, in fall 1861, declaring emancipation and justifying it as a war measure was unthinkable to most Americans. But Sumner would not be driven off course. He believed the president was leaning in his direction and he tried to keep steady pressure on Lincoln, telling other Republicans to visit Washington "to press upon the Presdt. the duty of Emancipation, in order to save the country." Perturbed by the conservative tone of Lincoln's December message to Congress, Sumner rushed to the White House where "the President assured me that in a month of six weeks we should all be together." At year's end he wrote to Governor John Andrew on Massachusetts that Lincoln "tells me I am ahead of him only a month or six weeks." 
It turned out to be more like six months. On July 4, 1862, Sumner went to the White House not once but twice to implore the president "to make the day more sacred & historic than ever" by issuing a decree of emancipation. He came away from the first visit thinking Lincoln might at least declare the slaves in Virginia free, but by the second visit, the president had again shifted course fearing that if he issued such a decree "half the officers would fling down their arms & three more States would rise." 
Sumner believed the president "plainly mistaken." For the moment, his optimism flagged. It had reached a high point on May 28, 1862, when he breathlessly reported to Governor Andrew "[Secretary of War] Stanton told me this morning that a decree of Emancipation would be issued in two months. ... The cause of Emancipation cannot be stopped."
Finally, on July 22, Lincoln met with the Cabinet and announced his intention to issue a preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. Sumner heard the news and was delighted, though he despaired that the decree was not promulgated immediately and, when it was at last declared on Sept. 22, lamented that it would not take effect until Jan. 1, 1863, one hundred days away.
But Sumner did not rest: he immediately starting pressing the president to authorize the enlistment of black troops. He sent him George Livermore's work, "An Historical Research Respecting the Opinions of the Founders of the Republic on Negroes as Slaves and Citizens and as Soldiers," and called Lincoln's "especial attention to the last half," which concerned the use of blacks as soldiers.
The final Emancipation Proclamation did indeed provide for the enlistment of blacks, and those soldiers played an important role in the outcome of the war. Sumner beseeched Lincoln with one final request - if no one had spoken for it, would the president send him the pen used to sign the decree.

HEADLINE: Can You Hear Them Now?

BYLINE: PETER CATAPANO


HIGHLIGHT: Is the Occupy Wall Street protest movement a hapless carnival or a "church of dissent?" 

 BODY:
Do clothes matter? Do appearances?
Were our parents' not-so-subtle hints that our decade of pilly flannel, disintegrating Yes T-shirts (best band logo ever) and on-again-off-again grooming habits were impeding our success and social progress actually true?
Two short weeks ago, few people were paying attention to the activities of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Mainstream media attention was sparse. But the images of the group's protests in Lower Manhattan, which began on Sept. 17 and continue as I write, tended to look something like this:
On Tuesday of this week, these folks showed up on Wall Street. Dapper aren't they? (Maybe there something about a uniform. Or is it how they go in rows like that?)
That was a group of several hundred pilots who went to Wall Street on Tuesday to stage their own separate protest against their management. It elicited mostly admiration, nothing like the criticism that has been visited upon the Occupy Wall Street protestors, who are involved in a larger, more disparate and less tidy affair.
Was it because they were so neat? Or was it more tactical - that they clearly stated their grievances, made their views known and went on their way?

Whatever the answer, the image of the pilots provided a strong visual contrast to the ongoing protests, and raised the question of whether the media coverage of them has been sufficient, or fair. In the nearly two weeks since the protests began, that debate has been heated.
Last Friday, a column by The Times' Ginia Bellafante described the protestors as "a noble but fractured and airy movement of rightly frustrated young people" eager for the "opportunity to air societal grievances as carnival." The movement, she wrote, is a "diffuse and leaderless convocation of activists against greed, corporate influence, gross social inequality and other nasty byproducts of wayward capitalism." And later: "The group's lack of cohesion and its apparent wish to pantomime progressivism rather than practice it knowledgably is unsettling in the face of the challenges so many of its generation face..."
That probably wasn't just the kind of media attention Occupy Wall Street was hoping for. Those who saw something grander at play in the protests bristled at the portrayal. And with simmering outrage about the economy (90 percent of American think it stinks) and continued big payouts to failed Wall Street executives (like Leo Apotheker, who was fired by Hewlett-Packard but will leave with $23 million for 11 months' work), it hardly seems like mere agitation.
In an extended post at The Dissenter, Kevin Gosztola ventured an answer to that question, which included this opinion:
Criticism of Occupy Wall Street is just a way for establishment media, the power elite and those who believe in their views to defend their ideology on how politics is supposed to work. It is their way of affirming their conviction that at some point the children need to leave the streets and the grown-ups must be allowed to work in peace. It is also part of the culture; expressing support for "hippies" or a "plurality of voices" preaching against capitalism will not win friends and influence people in the Beltway. And so, they will make criticisms whether there is evidence to support what is said or written.
Digby at Hullabaloo, who cut the protesters some slack, offered this observation: "Movements don't come nicely prepackaged, even when they're corporate sponsored." She continued: 
The truth is that protests always have an element of street theater to them and on the left, this happens to be the theater we produce. (There was plenty of drumming up in Wisconsin ...) The point is to raise consciousness, create reaction and see if something catches. It's not easy to get attention for this sort of thing, so early protesters tend to be people who are willing to take risks and make fools of themselves in ways that the rest of us aren't. It takes a village full of weirdos to start a protest movement.
So, the fact that these people don't have full power point presentation of their goals and are asking for all kinds of disparate things is not cause to shun them. It's an opportunity to use the moment to draw attention to the problem (even if there's no fully laid out solution) and bring more people to the cause.
At Salon Glenn Greenwald argued that the criticisms of the movement's lack of organization and message were "ludicrous": 
Does anyone really not know what the basic message is of this protest: that Wall Street is oozing corruption and criminality and its unrestrained political power - in the form of crony capitalism and ownership of political institutions - is destroying financial security for everyone else? Beyond that, criticizing protesters for the prominence of police brutality stories is pure victim-blaming (and, independently, having police brutality highlighted is its own benefit). 
Most importantly, very few protest movements enjoy perfect clarity about tactics or command widespread support when they begin; they're designed to spark conversation, raise awareness, attract others to the cause, and build those structural planks as they grow and develop. Dismissing these incipient protests because they lack fully developed, sophisticated professionalization is akin to pronouncing a three-year-old child worthless because he can't read Schopenhauer: those who are actually interested in helping it develop will work toward improving those deficiencies, not harp on them in order to belittle its worth.
Despite complaints among protest supporters that the media coverage has been both sparse and dismissive, more attention came their way as the days wore on: New York police arrested dozens of people and various confrontations between police and protestors turned violent. One incident, captured on video, in which a high-ranking police officer used pepper spray on a group of protestors, has gone viral, and the matter has already gone to Commissioner Raymond Kelly, who has promised to investigate.
At The New York Observer, Kat Stoeffel described the scene and noted (with New York-style detachment) how a media benefit might arise from the nasty incident:
Two young women are penned against the sidewalk by an orange net, but they strain against it as they look down the sidewalk in horror, where someone is being aggressively handcuffed, bloodied face down on the pavement. While they're looking away, a high-ranking police officer in white swiftly approaches them, douses them with pepper spray, and slips back into the crowd. The two young women, blinded, drop to their knees screaming and clutch at their faces. Two women behind them also begin to cry as their faces visibly redden.
The video won't bring regulatory reform to financial services, reinstate capital gains tax, or repeal Citizens United, but it is one way to end a media blackout, or bounce back from a bad review.
But complaints that the media wasn't paying attention to the substance of the protests and their larger purpose persisted.
The blogger Michael Zachman proposed his own theory:
The contrast between the protest's prominence on, say, Facebook and its near-invisibility in the mainstream media is beginning to ebb a bit as local papers draw on newswire material, but what took so long for national news to pick up on a very visible protest in the media capital of the country?
Might news organizations' reluctance stem from the fact that most of them are owned by the large corporations that are publicly traded on Wall Street? It's hard to explain otherwise. After all, polls show that many Americans would be interested in the marchers' arguments. A Pew Research Center poll shows that "nearly half of Americans - 47 percent - say Wall Street hurts the nation's economy more than it helps." According to a Bloomberg poll, a whopping "70 percent of Americans say big bonuses should be banned this year at Wall Street firms that took taxpayer bailouts." In another poll conducted by Lake Research Partners, 77 percent of respondents approved of tougher rules for Wall Street. Seems like viewers and news readers would enjoy having a look at these protests.
Over at Media Matters for America Eric Bohlert tangled with what he saw as the movement's media problem. He argued that Occupy Wall Street lacks something the Tea Party had in their nascent days - a cable news outlet to deliver its message:
[W]hat would the Occupy Wall Street protests look like if they were embraced the way cable news embraced the protest-based Tea Party? Keep in mind, during a key ten-day span of activity between April 9-19, 2009, the cable news channels reported more than 100 times about the fledgling Tea Party. That's four times the amount of attention they've given to Occupy Wall Street this month.
Recall that the Tea Party movement was (theoretically) born on CNBC, when reporter Rick Santelli started ranting about Obama on the floor of the Chicago stock exchange, warning viewers the new Democratic president was steering the country towards a Castro-like Cuban economy. CNBC then hyped the clip incessantly ("Shot Heard Around The Word"/"Santelli's Manifesto"), while NBC led the evening news that night with the cable clip from its sister station, announcing Santelli's rant to struck a "populist" chord. (In fact, polling at the time suggested a strong majority of Americans the Obama plan to stem foreclosures; the plan Santelli had railed against.)
Fox News then quickly claimed ownership of the anti-Obama movement, providing free publicly and advertising for the right-wing rallies.
One of the more resonant broadsides of the week came from Matt Stoller, posting on Naked Capitalism, who argued that what was going on down at Wall Street was not really a protest, but a "church of dissent": 
[I[t's obvious that this isn't just about Wall Street, nor is it really a battle of any sort. There are political signs there attacking Fox News, expressing anger about Troy Davis, supporting the Iranian revolution, urging the Federal Reserve be reigned in, and demanding rich people pay their taxes. There are personal signs about debt, war, and medical problems. And people are dressed in costume, carrying lightsabers, and some guys are driving around a truck with a "Top Secret Wikileaks" sign on the side. I asked if they were affiliated with the site, and one of them responded with "That's what the Secret Service asked". Most of all, people there are having fun.
What these people are doing is building, for lack of a better word, a church of dissent. It's not a march, though marches are spinning off of the campground. It's not even a protest, really. It is a group of people, gathered together, to create a public space seeking meaning in their culture. They are asserting, together, to each other and to themselves, "we matter."
Perhaps coincidentally, Michael Kazin, a professor of history at Georgetown, wrote on The Times' op-ed page last week about the dissipation of the American left: 
[T]he left must realize that when progressives achieved success in the past, whether at organizing unions or fighting for equal rights, they seldom bet their future on politicians. They fashioned their own institutions - unions, women's groups, community and immigrant centers and a witty, anti-authoritarian press - in which they spoke up for themselves and for the interests of wage-earning Americans.
Today, such institutions are either absent or reeling. With unions embattled and on the decline, working people of all races lack a sturdy vehicle to articulate and fight for the vision of a more egalitarian society. Liberal universities, Web sites and non-governmental organizations cater mostly to a professional middle class and are more skillful at promoting social causes like legalizing same-sex marriage and protecting the environment than demanding millions of new jobs that pay a living wage.
Fair enough. But that was last week.

HEADLINE: U.S. Still Dominates in Research Universities

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: In almost every discipline, a majority of top university research departments are in the United States. It may not stay that way, though. 

 BODY:
Next time you get depressed thinking about the state of the American education system, just visualize this chart:
 Source: O.E.C.D. and SCImago Research Group (CSIC) (forthcoming), Report on Scientific Production, based on Scopus Custom Data, Elsevier, June 2011. Statlink http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888932485310
The chart, based on new datafrom the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, shows the distribution of the top 50 universities for a range of disciplines. Rankings are based on citations of work coming from each university's department.
The darker blue bars at the bottom of the chart refer to American universities. And as you can see, at least at the post-secondary level, we still have some top-notch schools.
In fact, for every discipline shown except for the social sciences, a majority of major research institutions are in the United States. Even in the social sciences a plurality of the top departments are based in the United States.
Across all disciplines shown, 80 percent of the top research departments are in the United States. The next-highest share is in Britain (light blue bars), which is host to 10 percent of the world's top research departments.
American tertiary education dominance may not last forever, though. 
The share of residents who hold doctorates is lower in the United States than in many other countries, as shown in the chart below. Indeed - partly because the rest of the American education system is so weak - many of the students attending American doctorate programs are visiting from abroad.
As other countries devote larger shares of their economies to research and development, the world's top students may see new educational opportunities at home. And they may not bother reinfusing America's university system with new talent.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Said to Have a Leading Candidate to Run the Port Authority

BYLINE: MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: A top aide in the Cuomo administration, Patrick J. Foye, was described as a favorite to lead the agency, according to a person familiar with the selection process. 

 BODY:
Patrick J. Foye, a longtime figure in the public life of the New York City region, is a leading candidate to become executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, according to a person familiar with the selection process. 
, who previously led the Empire State Development Corporation and was once a deputy to the Nassau County executive, is currently deputy secretary for economic development for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. He has also worked at the Long Island Power Authority and the United Way of Long Island.
Mr. Cuomo, who will make the appointment, has already drawn up a short list of candidates for the Port Authority position, according to the individual, who insisted on anonymity because the governor's decision making process was intended to be private. The administration is still talking to other candidates about the job.
The position will be vacated next month, when Christopher O. Ward, the Port Authority's current executive director, plans to resign. Mr. Ward, who was appointed by Gov. David A.

HEADLINE: Protests Stir Up Voices on the Web

BYLINE: JILLIAN DUNHAM


HIGHLIGHT: Fourteen days of protests over Wall Street have led to a flood of information and opinion on the Internet. 

 BODY:
As the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York cycled through their 14th day, with a surge of attention and confusion over a Radiohead show that wasn't, an overwhelming amount of information continued to flood the Internet, from snarky Tweets to informational Web sites to blogs representing individual experiences during the economic crisis.
The protests were in many ways born on the Web, with calls to action on multiple organizing sites, including Adbusters and NYC General Assembly. Anonymous, an Internet hacking group that has taken a leadership role in the movement, continues to spread information through its blog and Twitter feeds.
The organization Occupy Wall Street has been using its Web site to spread news to supporters and the news media. As controversy over the Police Department's use of pepper spray intensified, Occupy Wall Street posted videos of the episode and published the name of the deputy inspector involved, Anthony Bologna. Inspector Bologna was later taken to task on "The Daily Show" by its host, Jon Stewart, and the actor Christopher Meloni, a former star of "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit."
Criticism of the demonstrations has a home on the Web as well. A regular contributor to the conservative site Redstate.com, the blogger Teresa Koch, described the protests as "a lovely little temper tantrum being thrown by a bunch of well-fed white kids who fancy themselves as some sort of modern-day, new age revolutionaries," and called on the protesters to forgo products from companies like Google and Apple, and the makers of Ivory soap. 
The smart-mouthed Wall Street blog Dealbreaker showed a video of a distraught law student on his knees, shouting, "That's the bank that took my parent's home!" The blog asked, "How long must a child of parents with multiple degrees beg to be arrested before someone listens?" ("A prettay, prettay, prettay long time," Dealbreaker reckoned, in a Larry David imitation). Commenters there piled on. "Hey, Sean Penn called and asked you to dial it down a notch, " one wrote.
But sharp criticism did not belong to detractors alone. A video that was widely reposted, and republished, by, among others, the site Daily Kos, showed well-dressed individuals said to be Wall Street executives drinking cocktails on an elegant balcony, laughing and taking pictures of the protesters below. "Marie Antoinette did something like that - didn't work out so well for her," said a Twitter contributor using the name Zoocritter.
Others offered a range of expressions, including curiosity and constructive criticism. 
 On a blog hosted by Forbes magazine, an accountant, Peter J. Reilly wrote of being a runner on Wall Street at age 16. "With occasional side jobs like getting lunch for partners, we spent the morning delivering paper stock certificates and the afternoon picking up checks," he said. "No question I would be dropping in at the park if I had the chance."
Echoing a frequent chant at the protests, a Tumblr blog, "We Are the 99%" collected images of handwritten messages from individuals hard-hit by the economic crisis, often held by the writers. "I am a single working mother of two toddlers," one message read. "I eat one meal per day to ensure my children can eat three."
John Farley, a Web editor for the online magazine Metro Focus, blogged about being arrested while covering the protests.
An article on the site of Mother Jones magazine, "Why #occupywallstreet Isn't Working," gained popularity on Facebook. The article criticized the movement's strategy, saying, "It's hard to be taken seriously as accountability-seeking populists when you're donning Guy Fawkes masks."
On Twitter, celebrities including Russell Simmons pledged their support for the movement. Others on Twitter painted pictures of the situation on Wall Street.
Husky in Georgia wrote: "At #occupywallstreet, u will find hippies, true. Also, unions, libertarians, children seniors, ppl with good jobs, and more."
Henry Blodget, a former research analyst who is a founder of the online publication Business Insider, used Twitter to link to a piece from the Web site by Julia La Roche describing protesters' going without showers for days, smoking marijuana and piling up trash.
Some on Twitter asserted that there was barely any coverage at all, while others noted coverage that they felt was fair. While news of the protests was largely absent from the home pages of major international newspapers like Le Monde and The Times of India, organizers said they were receiving messages of solidarity from Spain and from Greece, where economic protests are currently under way.
"Anyone organizing out in the west coast?" a commenter on NYC General Assembly named Janessa asked last Thursday. "I'd love to join the fight!!" As it turned out, the protest spread to San Francisco a week later.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Said to Have a Leading Candidate to Run the Port Authority

BYLINE: MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: A top aide in the Cuomo administration, Patrick J. Foye, was described as a favorite to lead the agency, according to a person familiar with the selection process. 

 BODY:
Patrick J. Foye, a longtime figure in the public life of the New York City region, is a leading candidate to become executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, according to a person familiar with the selection process. 
, who previously led the Empire State Development Corporation and was once a deputy to the Nassau County executive, is currently deputy secretary for economic development for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. He has also worked at the Long Island Power Authority and the United Way of Long Island.
Mr. Cuomo, who will make the appointment, has already drawn up a short list of candidates for the Port Authority position, according to the individual, who insisted on anonymity because the governor's decision making process was intended to be private. The administration is still talking to other candidates about the job.
The position will be vacated next month, when Christopher O. Ward, the Port Authority's current executive director, plans to resign. Mr. Ward, who was appointed by Gov. David A. Paterson, had an icy relationship with Mr. Cuomo, but his work has been praised by an array of leaders in New York's political, civic and business worlds, particularly for his ability to jump-start the stalled rebuilding of the World Trade Center site.
The departure of Mr. Ward has been lamented by many city leaders, who say he will be difficult to replace. Some have privately grumbled that Mr. Cuomo would prefer to appoint an agency head who is loyal to his administration.
It is not unusual, however, for a new governor to clear out top-ranking officials who were held over from a prior administration.
Mr. Cuomo's choice of a successor will be among the most critical appointments of his tenure. Along with overseeing the World Trade Center, the authority is in charge of billions of dollars of infrastructure projects, including bridges, tunnels, airports and shipping ports. It is considered the leading agency in the economic development of the New York and New Jersey metropolitan region.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Hints That Wall St. Protesters Could Overstay Welcome

BYLINE: KATE TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: On his weekly radio appearance, the mayor was asked if the protesters would be allowed to stay as long as they wanted in Zuccotti Park. "We'll see," was his response. 

 BODY:
The Occupy Wall Street protesters may not be able to camp out in a downtown park indefinitely, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg warned on Friday morning. 
"People have a right to protest but we also have to make sure that people who don't want to protest can go down the streets unmolested," the mayor. "We have to make sure that while you have a right to say what you want to say, people who want to say something very different have a right to say that, as well. That's what's great about this country."
Asked by the radio host John Gambling if the protesters would be allowed to stay as long as they wanted in Zuccotti Park, a public-private park, Mr. Bloomberg said, "We'll see." 
"You're worried about sanitation, and you're worried about lots of different - there's lots of laws on the books of what you can do in parks and that sort of thing," he said on the weekly radio show that he appears on with Mr. Gambling.
Mr. Bloomberg also suggested that the protesters were misguided, emphasizing that financial institutions employ large numbers of New Yorkers - many of them not wealthy executives.
"The protesters are protesting against people who make forty, fifty thousand dollars a year and are struggling to make ends' meet - that's the bottom line," the mayor said, adding: "People in this day and age need support for their employers."
Mr. Bloomberg, who began his career on Wall Street and made his considerable fortune in a media company that caters largely to financial institutions, has been a prominent defender of banks as they face criticism for their risky practices in the run-up to the financial crisis. On Friday, he argued, as he has done many times recently, that attacking banks is counterproductive when trying to help the economy.
"If the banks don't go out and make loans, we will not come out of our economic problems, we will not have jobs," he said, "and so anything we can do to responsibly help the banks do that, encourage them to do that is what we need."
He was not asked, and did not comment, on the growing controversy over the tactics employed by the police, including the use of pepper spray, to control the protesters.
The discussion of the Wall Street demonstrations prompted Mr. Bloomberg to recall an earlier era of protest, the mass marches against the Vietnam War.
"I remember in the Vietnam War there were enormous protests on Wall Street," said Mr. Bloomberg, who was working for Salomon Brothers at the time. "I've always thought one of the sad things is when the Vietnam vets came back we didn't treat them the way they deserve to be treated."
Mr. Bloomberg did not serve in Vietnam, having been classified as 1Y - draftable only in a national emergency - due to having flat feet.
"Whether you support a war or not," he said, "our vets deserve the respect and the help when they get back."

HEADLINE: Obama Hailed After Awlaki Killing, but For How Long?

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: Praise flowed in to the White House from normally critical quarters after it announced the killing of the Al Qaeda leader. 

 BODY:
The killing of Anwar al-Awlaki in an American missile strike on Friday cements President Obama's record as a relentless hunter of Al Qaeda terrorists. Whether that success in counterterrorism will help Mr. Obama's overall image as a leader is less certain.
The president got a healthy bump in the polls after ordering the commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May. But that goodwill evaporated a month later, as concerns about the economy resurged. In the New York Times/CBS News poll, his approval rating shot up to 57 percent, from 46 percent, after the raid, but fell back to 48 percent in early June.
Still, the killing of Awlaki is part of a pattern of successful strikes against Al Qaeda leaders and field commanders over the last year. And with terrorism analysts arguing that the American-born cleric posed a greater threat to American citizens than Bin Laden, praise flowed in to the White House from normally critical quarters.
"The killing of al-Awlaki is a tremendous tribute to President Obama and the men and women of our intelligence community," Representative Peter T. King of New York, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement Friday.
Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor running for the Republican presidential nomination, called the killing "a major victory in our fight against Islamist terrorism and proper justice for the numerous attacks and plots he inspired or planned against America."
"I commend the president, the members of the intelligence community, our service members, and our allies for their continued efforts to keep Americans safe," Mr. Romney said in a statement. "Nevertheless, we must remain vigilant and continue the fight against those who seek to destroy us and our freedoms."
Mr. Obama sought to put the Awlaki raid into a broader context of the administration's campaign against Al Qaeda.
"The death of Awlaki marks another significant milestone in the broader effort to defeat Al Qaeda and its affiliates," the president said at a ceremony Friday to mark the retirement of Admiral Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
To blunt criticism from the left that the United States had targeted an American citizen for assassination, Mr. Obama took pains to describe Awlaki's role as a key Al Qaeda operative behind plots against Americans and the inspiration for other attacks, including the mass killings at Fort Hood, Tex. 
White House officials expect the economy to be the overwhelming issue in next year's election. To the extent that foreign policy plays a role, a senior official said, it is more likely to pose a downside risk - Europe's debt crisis, for example, or the dislocations caused by the Arab Spring.
But Mr. Obama has consistently gotten his highest ratings for his handling of terrorism and homeland security. In a recent Republican debate, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas went out of his way to praise Mr. Obama for the Bin Laden raid, even as he criticized his foreign policy on other grounds.

HEADLINE: Short-Termism and Energy Revolutions

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Experts assess a shift in Energy Department research priorities toward near-term goals. 

 BODY:
The calls these days for a technological "energy revolution" are widespread. But how do you spark breakthroughs when the natural bias of businesses, investors and governments is toward the here and now?
In governance, politics creates a bias toward the short term. This is why bridges sometimes fall down for lack of maintenance. That's also why it's so hard to sustain public investment in the research and intellectual infrastructure required to make progress on the frontiers of chemistry, biology and physics, even though it is this kind of work that could produce leaps in how we harvest, harness, store and move energy. (This is why I asked, "Are Chemists and Engineers on the Green Jobs List?" back in 2008.)
To get the idea, you only have to look at the sputtering state of President Obama's mostly unfunded innovation hubs, or look once again at the energy sliver in the graph showing America's half-century history of public investment in basic scientific research. (There's not much difference in research patterns in most other industrialized countries.)
You can also look at the first Quadrennial Technology Review produced by the Department of Energy (summarized by Climate Progress earlier this week). The review was conducted after the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology wisely recommended regular reviews of this sort as part of its prescription for accelerating change in energy technologies.
This excerpt from the new review articulates the tension pretty transparently for a government report:
There is a tension between supporting work that industry doesn't- which biases the department's portfolio toward the long term-and the urgency of the nation's energy challenges. The appropriate balance requires the department to focus on accelerating innovation relevant to today's energy technologies, since such evolutionary advances are more likely to have near- to mid-term impact on the nation's challenges. We found that too much effort in the department is devoted to research on technologies that are multiple generations away from practical use at the expense of analyses, modeling and simulation, or other highly relevant fundamental engineering research activities that could influence the private sector in the nearer term.
Both near-term and long-term effort and investment are needed, of course. This is a question of balance, specifically within the limited amount of money designated for research and development. In finding that balance, I'm not sure it's possible to overcome the political pressures tugging agencies and officials to stress refinement and deployment of known and maturing technologies (even though that's where industry and private investors are most focused).
On the left, the pressure is for resources to deploy today's "green" technology. On the right, as illustrated in a Heritage Foundation report on ways to cut President Obama's budget for the Energy Department, the philosophy seems to be to discourage government spending on basic inquiry related to energy.
According to Heritage, science "in service of a critical national interest that is not being met by the private sector" is fine if that interest is national defense, but not fine if it's finding secure and sustainable (environmentally and economically) sources of energy.
I solicited reactions to the Energy Department review from a variety of technology and innovation analysts. The first to weigh in are Daniel M. Kammen, an energy technology researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who is on leave working for the World Bank, and Robert D Atkinson, the founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.
Here's Kammen: 
The idea of a regular review and status report on both energy innovation and deployment spending is a good one. Some of the findings in the QTR review are useful, although little is new. Overall, though, this is a useful exercise, and one that should be a requirement from any major programmatic effort.
There are some very curious omissions from the report, such as more detail on the need to both generate and report on jobs created in this sector -- a political 'must' these days (see, e.g., the "green jobs" review by the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at Berkeley) -- and straightforward comparisons in the way of 'report cards' on how the US is stacking up relative to other key players (e.g. China, Germany...).
Perhaps the biggest worry in this report, however, is the missing logic and value of a 'shift to near term priorities in energy efficiency and in electric vehicles.' This may be a useful deployment of some resources, but a range of questions are simply never addressed. Among the questions that need firmer answers are:
- Following record levels funding made available to the energy industry through the [stimulus package of spending], what are the clearly identified market failures that exist in this area that added funding will solve? Funding is always welcome, but energy efficiency in particular, can be strongly driven by regulation and standards, and because good energy efficiency innovations have such rapid payback times, would regulatory approaches, or state-federal partnerships in regulation and incentives not accomplish a great deal of what can be done in this area? Congressman Holt raises a number of key questions on related issues, while pointing to some very hopeful experiences, notably in the Apollo program, in his 16 September editorial in Science.
Nobody will complain if funds come their way, but given the state-by-state laboratories we already have of differing approaches to energy efficiency, the logic of spending in this area remains to be proven (as much as we all rightly love and value and benefit from energy efficiency).
- Near-term electric vehicle deployment. A similar story could be told here. As the director of the University of California at Berkeley's Transportation Sustainability Research Center (http://tsrc.berkeley.edu) I am huge believer in electric vehicles [EVs]. However, the review does not make clear what advances in this area are already supported through [the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy], and what areas of near-term research are also not best driven though regulation, such as low-carbon fuel standards, R&D tax credits, 'feebates' that transfer funds from those individuals who purchase inefficient vehicles to those who purchase efficient ones. Similar to the story in energy efficiency, we do have already an important set of state-by-state experiments that have been in place for some time, and these warrant an assessment of how much innovation they have driven, and which ones do and do not have an application in scale-up at the federal level.
Finally, the electric vehicle landscape is already very rich in terms of plans for deployment by automakers. What are the barriers five-plus years out that the companies see research-versus-deployment and market-expansion support as the most effective way to drive change in the industry? Where will this focus put the U.S. industry relative to China?
Finally -- and while I in some ways cringe at returning to an old story -- the real need in the R&D sector is continuity and matching an increasing portfolio of strategic research with market expansion. My former student and colleague Greg Nemet have written consistently on this:
- U.S. energy research and development: Declining investment, increasing need, and the feasibility of expansion
- Reversing the Incredible Shrinking Energy R&D Budget
How this will be achieved in the current political climate in Washington, D.C., is vital to any 'near term' strategy for energy R&D.
Here's Robert Atkinson:
If DOE is shifting toward a more short-term focus, this is quite disturbing. It would mean that DOE has given up on addressing the challenge of climate change and instead is just focused on the near term goal of reducing oil imports and modestly reducing the expansion the coal fired power plants. If DOE thinks it is still focused on climate change, do they think they are fighting "American warming"?
If so, cutting the growth of our emissions make sense. But its global warming and solving this means supporting the development of scalable, cheap low or no-carbon energy so that every country, rich and poor, will have an economic incentive to transitioning to cheap energy. Increasing building efficiency, modernizing the electric grid, alternative hydrocarbon fuels, and increasing vehicle efficiency do virtually nothing to meet this goal. They are "American warming" solutions.
This is also troubling because (as you point out) who else is going to invest in the long-term, more fundamental, high risk, breakthrough research than the U.S. government. It certainly won't be VCs. And it won't be the Chinese who are principally interested in cutting their energy imports and exporting current generation clean energy, not developing technology to save the planet. Of course all the folks out there who have been pushing the mistaken view that we have all the clean technologies we need, will hail this as the right direction. But it's doing what the rest of the market has been doing in recent years - shifting from high risk, long-term research to short-term, low risk. If the federal government is doing this it is troubling to say the least.

HEADLINE: A Bright Forecast for Direct Marketing

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The Direct Marketing Association predicts that despite the concerns about the direction of the economy, spending for direct marketing advertising will continue to grow. 

 BODY:
Forecasters are predicting that despite the concerns about the direction of the economy, spending for direct marketing advertising will continue to grow.
The forecast is being issued by the Direct Marketing Association in conjunction with its annual meeting, the D.M.A. 2011 Conference and Exhibition, to be held in Boston from Saturday through Thursday.
The forecast, called "The Power of Direct Marketing," is released every other year. According to the forecast, spending for direct marketing ads -- in media like direct mail, catalogs, television, telephone marketing, Internet marketing and social networking -- will reach $163 billion this year, up 5.6 percent from $154.4 billion in 2010.
And spending will grow again next year, according to the forecast, increasing 3.4 percent from 2011 to $168.5 billion.

Those who compiled the forecast are no Pollyannas, according to Yory Wurmser, director for marketing and media insights at the association. During the stock market gyrations in August, "we put back our print run by a couple weeks," he said, to reassess the predictions in light of economic developments.
Still, "we're pretty confident right now," Mr. Wurmser said, that growth in direct marketing ad spending will continue and that "direct marketing will outpace the U.S. economy as a whole."
"If you look at the big companies in the U.S. -- Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple -- they're platforms for direct marketing or use direct marketing," he added.
Indeed, much of the growth in the direct marketing ad expenditures is attributable to digital channels, Mr. Wurmser said, among them search-engine marketing, mobile marketing and marketing in social media.
Spending in traditional media continues to increase, the forecast predicts, but remains below the levels of the peak year of 2007.
Those traditional channels include direct mail, which some scorn as junk mail, and direct-response television, which includes commercials and infomercials featuring the proverbial operators who are always "standing by."
An exception to the optimistic picture for traditional media is newspapers; spending for direct response newspaper ads is forecast to decline from $8.4 billion in 2010 to $7.3 billion in 2011 and $7 billion in 2012.

HEADLINE: The Money Flow From Households to Health Care Providers

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Government medical programs often pass through more cents on the dollar to the providers of care than private insurers do, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
My last post, "The Role of Prices in Health Care," contained a chart connecting health spending with health income. One reader commented:
The graph misses a very major, and growing, component of the U.S. health care system. In between "the rest of society" and the "owners of health care resources" there is not only the "health care system" but also the United States government (unless we view the government as one of those resources). This is sapping a not insignificant portion of the resources that could and should otherwise be devoted to the provision of actual health care services. 
I am not sure just what to make of this. Is the argument that government is a sinkhole that absorbs "a not insignificant portion of the resources" that could otherwise be devoted to health care proper? Are there not other intermediaries, such as private insurers? Or is the argument that government as a public provider of health insurance to millions of Americans siphons off financial resources and returns no benefits to society, while private insurers do?

Consider the chart below. It illustrates that the flow of money through health care in the United States is complicated, with many detours on the way from households, which ultimately pay for all of the nation's health care, to providers. Along the way are a number of pumping stations, employers among them. 
Naturally, the providers of health care receive less than what households originally contributed to finance health care. Like private insurers, public insurers are pumping stations along the way that keep some of the money to finance their own operations. And both the public and private pumping stations provide society benefits in return, namely, access to health care when needed and the peace of mind that the family will not go broke over medical bills from a major illness.
Readers who seek to get a feel for the dollars flowing through this piping system - $2.6 trillion in 2010 - can find insight in Table 16 of the most recent National Health Expenditure Projections published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services of the Department of Health and Human Services (referred to hereafter as C.M.S. data). 
This next chart conveys an idea of changes over time in the money flow through major public and private insurance programs and through out-of-pocket payments by patients. It should be noted that the fraction of Medicaid in this chart includes the federal match, which is about two-thirds of total Medicaid spending. It is a fact that government insurance programs have played an increasing role in the overall health care money flow. Their role in the future is now a fiercely debated issue in the political arena.
To get a rough indication of what fraction of the money flow is retained by the various pumping stations in the money flow, it is helpful to compare what the C.M.S. actuaries call National Health Expenditures, or N.H.E., with what they call Personal Health Care Expenditures, or P.H.C., a component. N.H.E. includes all outlays on health care, including research and construction. It also includes what the intermediate pumping stations (i.e., public and private health insurers) retain for their operations. P.H.C., on the other hand, represents only what the providers of health care received from the various intermediaries and directly from patients. 
This next chart exhibits personal health spending as a percentage of total national health spending for three health insurers: private insurers, Medicare and Medicaid. These data are calculated from Tables 3 and 5 of the C.M.S. data. These percentages suggest that a relatively high share of the funds Congress and state legislators appropriate for the two largest government programs, Medicaid and Medicaid, becomes revenue for the providers of health care.
According to a C.M.S. actuary, for the traditional Medicare program excluding money contributed by Medicare to private Medicare Advantage plans on behalf of beneficiaries choosing those plans, as much as 98 cents is paid to providers for every $1 appropriated by Congress for Medicare. (The 93.8 percent shown in the next chart includes Medicare dollars channeled through Medicare Advantage plans.)
In fairness, it must be added that traditional Medicare basically sets prices and then just pays bills. It makes no active attempt to manage care (utilization controls, disease management, coordinating care and so on), because it has not been allowed by Congress to do so. It is almost as if Congress did not want traditional Medicare to be a prudent purchaser of heath care for the elderly.
From the viewpoint of prudent purchasing, most economists would probably judge these prices too low. On the other hand, the fact that traditional Medicare just pays bills more or less passively may be precisely the reason that it is still so popular among the elderly. Traditional Medicare still offers beneficiaries completely free choice of providers and therapy - a degree of freedom that many younger Americans in insurance plans with limited networks of providers no longer enjoy.
The ratio of P.H.C. to N.H.E. for private insurance reflects what is known as the medical loss ratio, or M.L.R., on which I have written a post previously. It is the fraction of the premium an insurer pays out for "health benefits." The overall average of 88.3 percent for private insurance includes M.L.R.'s ranging all the way from a low 55 percent for small insurers selling policies to individuals and small employers, mainly through insurance brokers, to M.L.R.'s above 90 percent for large insurers performing merely administrative services (e.g., negotiating fees or claims processing) for self-insuring large employers. 
The ratios in the last chart should not be confused with the overall administrative overhead of health care in the United States, a topic already touched on in an earlier post. A public or private health insurance program not only has its own operating costs but visits substantial administrative costs on the providers of health care, mainly on billing properly for services rendered. 
I shall comment on these additional overhead costs in a future post.
