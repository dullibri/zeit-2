HEADLINE: Getting Alienated Freudians to Associate

BYLINE: By ROBERT S. BOYNTON 

 BODY:
Sometimes a bookstore is just a bookstore.
But sometimes, as today's Freudians should know, it is also a publisher, a Web site and a gathering place for readings, lectures and book parties. At least that is the case with Other Books, on the first floor of a turn-of-the century brownstone on West 20th Street in Chelsea. The store's window displays an Interpretation of Dreams T-shirt and a "Freudian Slips" post-it pad to "write what's really on your mind." Inside the front room, titles like "Before I was I" and "Ours, Yours, Mine" are packed into bursting shelves, while crammed in the back are desks and flat-screen computers for editing books and journals. And at the rear of the building is a small office (with couch, of course) where Michael Moskowitz, Other Press's publisher, sees his patients. 
 An analyst, an academic and an editor, Mr. Moskowitz, 49, is a psychoanalytic entrepreneur with a mission. He wants to rescue psychoanalysis from the academic isolation and bitter scholarly skirmishes that have dogged it for the last 20 years by bridging the divide between clinicians and theorists who work in various disciplines. In the process, he hopes to turn Other Books into an intellectual center for psychoanalysis, psychology and cultural studies.
"Postwar American psychoanalysis did itself a tremendous disservice by cutting itself off from the culture at large," he said one day recently, sipping a glass of wine over lunch at a Chelsea bistro. A compact man with shoulder-length hair and piercing eyes, Mr. Moskowitz speaks of psychoanalysis with the pained concern one might use to describe a wayward child. "On the one hand, it refused to recognize that all sorts of nonanalysts could legitimately use psychoanalytic theory. On the other hand, it cut itself off from real experimental science.
"At Other Press, we want to get scientists talking to humanists, clinicians to theorists, Lacanians to Freudians, and Americans to analysts all over the world."
Compared with the near-glacial time frame one associates with psychoanalysis, Other Press's progress has been extremely rapid. In less than two years, Mr. Moskowitz has opened the bookstore, published the company's first 30 titles, acquired three journals (including Psychoanalytic Quarterly, the oldest independent journal on the topic), and founded a new interdisciplinary journal, Infant, Child and Adolescent Psychotherapy. Last fall Other Press purchased Karnac Books, Britain's pre-eminent psychoanalytic bookseller and publisher, along with its two London bookstores and 250-title backlist.
Now Mr. Moskowitz is trying to turn his Web site into what he calls "the Amazon of psychoanalysis," offering a psychoanalytic best-seller list and chapters from Other Press's own books and journals.
"We want to be the destination for psychotherapists and people interested in cultural studies and related areas," Mr. Moskowitz explained. "There are over 500,000 therapists in the U.S. and several million around the world."
Other Press publishes widely in the field, including a series introducing the notoriously difficult ideas of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, that is being edited by Mr. Moskowitz's business partner, Judith Fehrer-Gurewich, a Belgian psychoanalyst with a law degree and a Ph.D. in sociology. It was she who raised funds for Other Press from European investment bankers with an interest in psychoanalysis.
Other new books are John Gedo's "Evolution of Psychoanalysis," a comprehensive overview of the field, as well as the reissue of several psychoanalytic classics, like "The Fifty-Minute Hour" by Robert Lindner and the feminist study "The Mermaid and the Minotaur" by Dorothy Dinnerstein.
Mr. Moskowitz is embarking on his venture at a time when psychoanalysis has taken a beating in both the academic world, where there have been nasty battles over Freud's theories and experimental practices, and the marketplace, where managed care and antidepressants have sharply curtailed the availability of therapy -- especially expensive, time-consuming psychoanalysis. Leading university presses like Yale and Harvard as well as established trade houses have virtually ceased publishing psychoanalytic books.
But Mr. Moskowitz is unfazed, and to scholars and analysts who have wearied of what they call the "Freud wars," Other Press represents a refreshingly open and nondogmatic perspective.
Jonathan Lear, a philosopher and psychoanalyst who teaches at the University of Chicago, says: "The best response to the critics of Freud is not to answer them point by point, but to do something new and interesting. And that is precisely what Michael is doing by providing a forum for the most creative work going on today." Elisabeth Young-Bruehl, the Anna Freud biographer and co-author of "Cherishment," a study of Eastern and Western theories of emotional attachment, says, "A wonderful rejuvenation of psychoanalysis is taking place, and Other Press is the cafe for the process."
Despite various setbacks, Mr. Moskowitz and others are convinced that psychoanalysis is developing a broader intellectual and social significance.
"Twenty years ago, psychoanalysis was predominately white, male and middle-class," said Kirkland Vaughns, an African-American psychoanalyst who is the editor of Infant, Child and Adolescent Psychotherapy. "A tremendous amount has been learned since then that can benefit emotionally disturbed black and Hispanic kids who are usually sent straight to the juvenile justice system."
There are few disciplines that have not been influenced by psychoanalysis, and new programs in psychoanalytic studies have recently been founded at Emory University, Columbia University and the University of Chicago. "As a cultural phenomenon, this is the great age of psychoanalysis," says Richard J. Bernstein, the head of the philosophy department at the New School for Social Research. "Our courses on it draw students from a greater variety of disciplines than ever before."
The son of an immigrant Hungarian plumber, Mr. Moskowitz has always perceived himself as someone who was, as in the title of his book, "Reaching Across Boundaries of Culture and Class." He grew up in Port Jervis, N.Y., an upstate town, and his first encounter with Freud came at age 14 when he found a copy of "The Interpretation of Dreams" his sister had brought home from college.
Arriving at Columbia in 1967, Mr. Moskowitz was shocked to find that the Psychology 101 course didn't include Freud. "No one reads that stuff anymore," he was told by a professor. Accordingly, in good 60's fashion, Mr. Moskowitz took over a class and brought in an analyst from the medical school. After receiving his Ph.D. in psychology from City University and his analytic training at New York University, Mr. Moskowitz taught, worked in mental hospitals and started a community-based counseling center for traumatized Vietnam veterans in New Haven.
In 1992 he joined Jason Aronson, a publisher of books on psychology and Judaica, and for the next five years ran the psychology half of the business. In 1998 he was approached by Ms. Gurewich with a proposal to start a press of their own.
Mr. Moskowitz is determined to develop Other Press's scope both here and abroad. He is talking to the London School of Economics about creating a think tank to analyze social issues from a psychoanalytic perspective, and he wants to start a journal in South America, where psychoanalysis seems to be thriving ("Every hill town in Argentina has an analyst," he says).
But New York is still at the psychological heart. "What I love about the bookstore is that it is a real space, a safe community where all are welcome and ideas can be freely exchanged," Mr. Moskowitz said. "The fact is that we are biological animals who live in culture. Psychoanalysis is the only theory I know of that tries to explain both these things."

HEADLINE: Helen Venturelli, 86; Fought for Police Widows

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Helen Venturelli, a champion of better benefits for widows of police officers and firefighters killed on the job, died March 15 at Westchester Square Hospital in the Bronx. She was 86 and lived in the Bronx.
In 1943, Mrs. Venturelli's husband, Pasquale, a policeman, leapt onto the running board of an automobile to try to apprehend two teenagers who were stealing the car. He died instantly when they rammed the vehicle into a wall. 
 Mrs. Venturelli was left with two sons, Robert, 9, and Alfred, 7, and a pension of $125 a month, with no increases for inflation. She earned extra money from various part-time jobs, and was eager to get involved when Florence Churchill, who was trying to raise three children with polio on a $125 monthly pension after her husband died in the line of duty, wrote her in 1960 about forming an organization to fight for higher payments to police widows.
At the first meeting of what became the Police and Fire Line of Duty Widows of New York City, Mrs. Venturelli pressed to include firefighters' widows, a suggestion that was immediately embraced. The group started a series of demonstrations at City Hall and elsewhere, and in 1962 won an increase in pensions equal to half the average monthly salary of a police officer, $347. In 1968, after years of struggle, they won hospitalization insurance, the same as that given to city workers.
Mrs. Venturelli succeeded Mrs. Churchill as president in 1977 and served in that post for 20 years. A striking woman with blue eyes, perfectly coiffed hair and a collection of distinctive hats, her powers of persuasion at City Hall and in Albany were keen, said Louise Crane, vice president of the widows' group.
"She knew how to talk, she could talk to anybody," said Mrs. Crane, whose husband was shot six times as he chased a robbery suspect up a Harlem fire escape in 1963.
Mrs. Venturelli is survived by her son, Alfred of Westchester; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
Mrs. Venturelli visited Albany each year to fight for inflation adjustments. Beginning in 1978, she and her allies were successful each year.
"If you don't keep after something, you sometimes get forgotten," Mrs. Crane said. "And another thing Helen did: she always had them write thank-you notes."

HEADLINE: Clinton Lauds Technology As Key to India's Economy

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: HYDERABAD, India, March 24

 BODY:
President Clinton saluted India's information-technology industry today, the core of the country's steady economic growth and a supplier of brain power to Silicon Valley in California.
This was the last full day of Mr. Clinton's visit to India, and after having dealt with tricky strategic and political questions, it seemed appropriate that the president should concentrate on the economy, the area where there is probably the most commonality between the United States and India. 
 For the moment, trade between the two countries is relatively small, $12 billion last year compared with $94.9 billion between the United States and China. But it is the potential for dramatic growth, especially with an expanding middle class with a taste for American consumer goods, that excites the administration and American businesses.
The United States is India's largest trading partner. But India, because of its high tariffs and largely state-run economy, accounts for less than 1 percent of American global investments. Mr. Clinton, accompanied throughout his India trip by Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, made clear that he hoped that would change.
After touring booths that displayed information technology and receiving an Indian driver's license through the Internet, the president spoke at a software center, popularly known as Hitec City, an acronym for the Hyderabad Information Technology-Engineering Consultancy. Computer companies including Microsoft, Oracle and Toshiba have set up shop here, alongside new Indian giants and smaller start-ups.
In extolling Indian achievements in information technology, Mr. Clinton cited computer superstars like Vinod Khosla, who helped build Sun Microsystems, and Vinod Dahm, who created the Pentium chip.
India is "fast becoming one of the world's software superpowers," Mr. Clinton said, proving that "in a globalized world, developing nations not only can succeed, developing nations can lead."
The number of Internet users in India is expected to grow 10 times in the next four years, he added. The worth of India's information-technology exports have catapulted, to $4 billion from $150 million 10 years ago. The Indian government projects that by 2008 the exports will grow to $85 billion.
Most important for India, Mr. Clinton said, the significant effects of Indian computer engineers on the American industry is beginning to pay back at home. "We're moving from brain drain to brain gain," Mr. Clinton said.
A group, IndUS Entrepreneurs, whose members include the leading Indian software engineers in Silicon Valley, estimates that 30 percent of the software engineers there are of Indian origin. Most were educated at Indian technology institutes and went to the United States to give an impetus to Silicon Valley. But now, with the Indian economy growing at 6 percent a year, and with 10 percent growth within sight, some Silicon Valley veterans are beginning to return.
Mr. Clinton also struck one of his favorite themes about the Internet, that it can be used to lift the poor. India, he told his audience, accounts for 30 percent of the world's software engineers, but also 25 percent of the world's malnourished. Thus, he said, India is in a special position to show how its brains and inventiveness in the new technologies could improve health care and education across the nation's villages.
This is "good economics," Mr. Clinton said. If for example, villages had computers with educational software, and printers, that would create a potential for a revolution in education in a country where almost 50 percent of the population is illiterate.
"It would mean, among other things," he said, "that the world's most populous nation would have the world's largest number of educated people and, therefore, in no time would have the world's largest economy."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
'Friends Don't Have to Agree'
 BOMBAY, March 24 -- Mr. Clinton ended his trip in India in this most populous city tonight. He addressed a group at the stock exchange and said he hoped that his presence would be the catalyst for a new relationship with the United States.
"Friends don't have to agree on every issue," Mr. Clinton said. "They just have to have an honest relationship about it."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Campaign by Confession in Bid for Kennedy's Senate Seat

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
PUT yourself in the shoes of Jack E. Robinson III.
Faster than you can say your own name, your fledgling campaign for Edward M. Kennedy's United States Senate seat has been clobbered by embarrassing accusations that you are sure came from the senator's camp: a rush of stories about your driving record, your legal history and, most mortifying of all, your love life. 
At the news conference to announce your candidacy, you find yourself forced to declare: "I am not a womanizer. I am not a groper."
Imagine how tempting it would be to fight back by dragging up the scandals that roiled your opponent's past.
Indeed, in an interview at the elegant home office that is so far his campaign's only place of operations aside from its Web site, www.robinson2000.com, Mr. Robinson suggested, "Perhaps, the senator should issue 'The Kennedy Report' to tell us exactly what happened at Chappaquiddick."
In that highly unlikely event, the report would be the second confessional exercise of the race.
Mr. Robinson, a 39-year-old businessman, sixth-generation Republican and first-time candidate, has already posted "The Robinson Report" on his campaign Web site. Perhaps the most notable effort at a pre-emptive political strike of the Internet era, it lists and explains every incident in his life that he thought might be fodder for attacks.
It includes an ex-girlfriend's restraining order against him, which was dropped, he writes, because he had phone-record proof that she was the real harasser, and a drunken driving charge that was dropped after he passed a Breathalyzer test. He also thrice flunked bar exams in other states before passing in Massachusetts, has had some lawsuit tangles and was once arrested for failing to pay a speeding ticket.
"Yes, there have been some embarrassing incidents, and we believe sources close to the Kennedy campaign have basically launched this attack," said Mr. Robinson, a bachelor. "So I decided to try to put an end to all these extraneous issues by just releasing everything I could think of in my entire life that could even possibly be used against us."
Senator Kennedy's spokesman, Will Keyser, dismissed as "completely ridiculous" Mr. Robinson's suggestion that the damaging information had originated in the senator's camp.
But that has not mollified Mr. Robinson. "You know, there's a candidate in this race who was actually convicted of a crime, and it's not me," he said. (After Mr. Kennedy's 1969 plunge off a Chappaquiddick bridge, which killed his car's passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, he pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and was given a two-month suspended sentence.)
But the reasons for Mr. Robinson's frustration and anger just keep growing. Amid the rush of accusations, he was unceremoniously disowned this week by the Republican governor of Massachusetts, Paul Cellucci, and the State Republican Party, a rejection that Mr. Robinson called "unheralded in American history" and a "typical Beacon Hill back room double-cross."
And almost every day, local papers have carried a new source of embarrassment, leading some to comment that Senator Kennedy may finally have a rival with a past as problematic as his own.
On Tuesday, it was an unidentified woman's account in The Boston Globe that Mr. Robinson had subjected her to unwanted advances after a heavy-drinking dinner date, including French kisses that led her and her friends to refer to him as "Jack the Tongue." Mr. Robinson denies the accusation.
And on Thursday, it was reports that he left the scene of an accident that occurred while he was giving a radio interview on his cell phone. Mr. Robinson, who was not accused of being at fault, has said he was pulling forward to get out of traffic's way, not fleeing.
The flood of what he calls "fallacious and fraudulent allegations" has utterly obscured Mr. Robinson's campaign message: He presents himself as a Senator John McCain-style reformer who wants a radical overhaul of the country's education and campaign finance system, a less radical overhaul of the health care system and a more concerted foreign policy.
"We need to reform the system, and I don't believe the senator's capable of doing that," he said. "He is the system."
The accusations have also obscured what is otherwise a quite distinguished resume. Raised in Boston's Roxbury section, son of two entrepreneurs who divorced when he was 5, Mr. Robinson attended Brown University and received law and business degrees from Harvard. He was the top executive of an airline and wrote a book, "Freefall: The Needless Destruction of Eastern Airlines" (HarperCollins, 1992). In the mid-90's, he shifted to the cell-phone industry and founded a company doing business in the Caribbean.
ASKED why he was running now, Mr. Robinson said he had four goals in his life, and he had accomplished the first three: to graduate from Harvard; to be president of an airline by the time he was 30, which he made by about a week, and to be economically self-sufficient by 40. The fourth, he said, was to be a United States senator from his home state, Massachusetts.
He has been living out-of-state for a dozen years, in Manhattan and then Greenwich, Conn., he acknowledged; but he has voted here since the mid-90's, he said, and was moving his possessions back this week to the stone Tudor-style house on Boston's graceful Arborway where he grew up.
Some Massachusetts political analysts say that Mr. Robinson's candidacy is so laughable that the Republican Party should be ashamed for not being able to field a candidate credible enough to keep Senator Kennedy busy at home instead of off gaining votes for other Democrats.
But for Mr. Robinson, this is the fight of his life, he said, tougher and nastier than anything he has ever encountered.
He is putting out a "clarion call for help," he said, and plans to battle on no matter what.
"Party be damned, full speed ahead," he said, "because I don't want the next generation of politicians to live through what I just lived through."

HEADLINE: India Wins Battles in Its War on TB, but It Has a Long Way to Go

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: HYDERABAD, India, March 24

 BODY:
For a year, 10-year-old Chaitanya Pusa suffered from recurring fevers, a hacking cough and debilitating weakness. She saw healers who chanted mantras over her and private doctors who missed her real illness.
Her family, which survives on a meager income from three milking cows, sunk deeper and deeper in debt to pay the bills. The girl lay bedridden. "When she developed pain in her chest, we panicked and took her to the hospital," said her grandmother, Sandamma Pusa. 
 Doctors there promptly determined that Chaitanya was one of the two million people who develop tuberculosis each year in India, more than in any other country.
About 450,000 die from it -- more than from AIDS, malaria and tropical diseases combined -- but Chaitanya, now 12, will not be one of them.
Today, on World Tuberculosis Day, President Bill Clinton gave this little girl with dark brown eyes and long braids her final dose of the medicines that will cure her, and he signed the register that has documented each stage of her six-month treatment.
"TB kills more people around the world than ever before, including one almost every minute here in India," Mr. Clinton said, calling for intensified efforts to control the epidemic and to find a vaccine that will prevent it.
Chaitanya's is one of 40,000 lives that experts say have been saved by the use of a treatment that is popular here. It begins with an accurate diagnosis, then ensures that patients complete a six- to eight-month regimen in which an observer watches them take their medicines. Paramedics monitor the patients' records to double-check that the treatment is proceeding properly.
Last month a team of experts from the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Bank, working with India's leading tuberculosis specialists, interviewed 1,000 patients and reviewed the records of more than 10,000 to evaluate the strategy, which has been used in India since 1993.
They discovered that this method, known as directly observed treatment, short course, or DOTS, has doubled cure rates to 84 percent and cut death rates to 4 percent from 29 percent.
Almost a quarter of a million people with tuberculosis, which is caused by bacteria and spreads through the air when an untreated patient coughs or talks, have been given the treatment in India. Still, it is available to only about 15 percent of India's population of one billion. The challenge in this vast, impoverished country with its shaky public health system is to expand the program, and fast.
Some critics say that the strategy is too cumbersome and that the public health systems in developing countries like India are too weak to make the program work on a much larger scale. But proponents say that more than five million patients have already been treated using DOTS and that the program has worked in poor countries like Tanzania, Vietnam and Peru.
"We have a cure for TB," said Tom Frieden, a doctor who ran New York City's tuberculosis program and now advises the Indian government about TB on behalf of the World Health Organization. "And it's cheap and cost-effective. It's just not being applied as widely as it should be."
More resources are coming in to spread the treatment to new parts of India. The World Bank, the largest contributor, has given India a five-year, low-interest loan of $142 million. The British government recently pledged $25 million over five years to combat TB in this southern state of Andhra Pradesh. The United States contributes a relatively small amount: $1 million for an applied research project in another southern state, Tamil Nadu.
The box of drugs, the size of a shoe box, required to treat a patient in India costs $10 to $15. And by saving the lives of young men and women, who are not only the most likely victims but their families' breadwinners, TB treatment also helps to prevent poverty.
The first thing this morning here in Hyderabad, Mohammad Jaffar, a social worker and father of six children 9 and younger, and Mohammad Fakaruddin, a leather worker with a 3-year-old son and a 4-year-old daughter, came into the Nampally treatment center. Both are in the early, intense phase of treatment. Jerripotula Urmila, a pharmacist, gave them their foil packets of pills and watched to be sure that they took them.
People with the disease in Hyderabad, where treatment is available, seem confident that they will be cured. For them the stigma of the disease has lifted.
Mohammad Mahaboob, 35, who drives a motorized rickshaw, got his final treatment this morning from the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, Chandrababu Naidu. "I read in the newspaper that it is very much curable," Mr. Mahaboob said, "so I wasn't too worried."
And Chaitanya, dressed in her favorite full-length festival dress made of a shimmery golden fabric, walked confidently up to the president of the United States this morning for the last dose of medicine she would need to banish the disease.
She put the pills on the back of her tongue, tilted her head back and poured the water into her mouth, in the Indian way, without touching her lips. She was done with TB. Her ordeal was officially over.

HEADLINE: Pakistanis Are Uneasy Over Clinton's Visit

BYLINE: By BARRY BEARAK 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, March 24

 BODY:
High anxiety has replaced great expectations in this capital, with people anticipating that President Clinton will arrive on Saturday not just to say hello, but also to deliver a scolding.
This is to be Mr. Clinton's final stop on a long-awaited visit to southern Asia. For months, Pakistan's military rulers, who took power in a bloodless coup on Oct. 12, had feared that Mr. Clinton would shun them entirely as their rivals in New Delhi wanted. 
 Instead, after five friendly days of talking, toasting and sightseeing in India, he will now make a meager five-hour stop here, enough time to meet with Pakistan's chief executive, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, and to address the nation on television.
Given some of what Mr. Clinton has said in India, Pakistanis may prefer that he had gone straight home. "Reality is finally sinking in that this is the 21st century, the new world order, and that nations with strong economies will get America's attention, and that does not include Pakistan," said Rifaat Hussain, an international studies professor at Quaid-i-Azam University here.
Indeed, the difference in Washington's perceptions of India and Pakistan seems to be the difference between a potential market and a potential disaster.
India, a resolute democracy, is home to a booming software industry and a rapidly multiplying middle class. Pakistan, with democracy interrupted, is nearly bankrupt, relying on a steady intravenous drip of restructured loans from international lenders. Social upheaval appears to be a growing possibility, with poverty and corruption pushing people toward Islamic fundamentalism.
Today, the president's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said Mr. Clinton would carry a message of hard realities, telling General Musharraf that Pakistan was "a country in trouble" and that a nuclear-arms race with India would be a ruinous folly.
In May 1998, India and Pakistan exploded tit-for-tat tests of nuclear weapons, with New Delhi the first to hit the button. Last summer, the countries squared off in fierce battles in the mountains of Kashmir, the territory that the two have fought over since they emerged free from the British Empire in 1947.
India and Pakistan share more than a common boundary. They can watch each other's television stations. And this last week, Pakistanis scornfully viewed what seemed a love fest between their Indian enemies and America's president.
There was a sliding succession of indelible imagery. Mr. Clinton was wildly cheered in India's Parliament. He danced to folk music with Rajasthani village women, and he reveled at the sight of tigers in the wild.
"It's a personal and national victory for the Indians," said Najam Sethi, editor of a weekly, The Friday Times. "There's only one superpower in the world, and that superpower has come to them. When we see the Indian TV screen, we see such fawning over Clinton: 'Here, look, this is where Clinton sat!' And, 'Here, this is the kind of soup he ate!' "
Worse yet, the president appeared to be tilting toward India's side on Kashmir. In a widely quoted interview with ABC News, Mr. Clinton said, "I believe there are those within the Pakistani government that have supported those who engage in violence in Kashmir."
To many here, that seemed an endorsement of one of New Delhi's most constant accusations, that Pakistan has complete command over groups of Islamic militants that are creating bloody havoc in Indian-controlled Kashmir. The Pakistanis, to the contrary, routinely claim to supply only moral and political support to the "holy warriors."
General Musharraf had some reason to hope that Mr. Clinton would say something quite different. Recently, the president had called the subcontinent "the most dangerous place in the world today," a nervous observation that might well have preceded a United States move to involve itself in a coaxed settlement, something that Pakistan wants and India does not.
Instead, although Mr. Clinton did urge India to negotiate with Pakistan, he said emphatically, "I have certainly not come to south Asia to mediate the dispute over Kashmir." And at least in public, the president made no mention of well-documented human-rights violations by India's extensive army and paramilitary presence in Kashmir.
"It needs to be accepted that Washington's old policy of friendship with Pakistan is no more," Inayatullah, a columnist, wrote in a Pakistani daily, The News.
Often, America had employed Pakistan as reliable helpmate in the cold war. After the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, Islamabad was used as the conduit for billions of dollars in military aid to the Mujahedeen resistance.
Today, some of those same warriors have shifted the focus of their battle to India and America. Among them is Osama bin Laden, whom the United States considers responsible for bombing two of its embassies in 1998. Mr. bin Laden's name will surely come up in the talks between Mr. Clinton and General Musharraf on Saturday. Mr. bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan, with the ruling Taliban militia as his host. Washington has been disappointed in Pakistan's reluctance to use its influence with the Taliban to press for Mr. bin Laden's expulsion or arrest.
Another certain item on the president's agenda will be a timetable for Pakistan's return to democracy. On Thursday, General Musharraf announced that three rounds of local elections would be held from December to July 2001. But he gave no indications of when a full restoration of civilian government would occur -- and Washington immediately expressed dismay.
For his part, the general displays optimism about meeting the president. The two men may well hit it off. If Mr. Clinton can come across as a hail fellow well met, so can General Musharraf, a person with an easy manner around Westerners. His brother is a doctor in Chicago. His only son is an actuary in Boston for the State of Massachusetts.
But the two leaders are scheduled to meet one on one for only 40 minutes, a brief time that could be taken up simply defining what each means by troublesome terminology like "terrorism" and "democracy."
General Musharraf, however, has expressed confidence that when Mr. Clinton meets him in person he will find a trustworthy, altruistic soldier -- and not an enemy of freedom.
"We have to tell President Clinton our point of view," the general said. "I am confident that I will be able to convince him."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Share Prices End Volatile Trading Week on a Slow Note

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Stocks go up, and stocks go down. But yesterday stocks mainly went sideways.
A volatile week on Wall Street ended with a whimper, as the Dow Jones industrial average fell slightly and the technology-fattened Nasdaq composite index crept closer to the record it set earlier in March. The Dow was down 7.14 points, to 11,112.72, while the Nasdaq rose 22.42 points, to 4,963.03. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose slightly, 0.11 point, to 1,527.46. 
 The real action yesterday was in the bond market, with the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond falling 1 7/32 , to 103 19/32 . That drove the bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, up to 5.99 percent from 5.91 percent.
Analysts said bond investors were worried by the report that some members of the Federal Reserve, which sets short-term interest rates, had argued for a half-percentage point increase in rates at the Fed's February meeting, whose minutes were released this week. The Fed has raised rates five times since June, most recently on Tuesday.
Each increase has been only one-quarter percentage point. A larger increase would indicate that the Fed is increasingly concerned about inflation, which is bad for bonds, because they pay a fixed return.
Generally, stocks and bonds move in tandem, with higher interest rates considered bad for stocks because they drive up corporate borrowing costs and make bonds more attractive as an alternative. But stock investors shrugged off the latest rate increase, confident that higher short-term rates would not slow the economy enough to hurt corporate profits and that the Fed was almost finished raising rates in any case.
"Every increase that occurs, people feel that we're closer to the ultimate time where the Fed's going to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said Vernon Winters, chief investment officer of Mellon Private Asset Management, which has $58 billion in assets. "Maybe a half-point rise gets it over with even sooner."
Mr. Winters said this week's action had been very positive for stock investors because it was the first time this year that stocks had risen across the board. He noted that the Wilshire 5000 index, which represents almost the entire United States stock market, broke out of a narrow trading range and set all-time highs for the last four days. Yesterday, the Wilshire closed at 14,751.64, up 17.39 points. For the week, the index was up more than 3 percent.
"Clearly, there's been a thrust in the last week that has a positive tone," Mr. Winters said. "The values of all stocks went up across the board, rather than just taking from one and giving to the other."
Big individual gainers yesterday included I.B.M., which rose $6.125, to $121.375, and Wal-Mart Stores, up $1.50, to $55.50.
The day's most noticeable decliner was Johnson & Johnson, which fell $7.50, to $72.50, after halting marketing of Propulsid, a heartburn drug that has been linked to heart problems and as many as 80 deaths. Propulsid sales, which were almost $1 billion in 1999, could be just over $250 million this year, analysts said. The drop wiped out more than $10 billion of Johnson & Johnson's market value.

HEADLINE: Son Chosen to Run for Mother's Seat

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, N.Y., March 24

 BODY:
Nassau County Democrats announced today that they had chosen Craig Johnson, a lawyer, to run for the seat in the County Legislature left vacant by his mother, Barbara J. Johnson, who died earlier this month of cancer. Republicans are expected to pick their candidate for the crucial race early next week.
The outcome of the special election in the 11th Legislative District, which is to be held on May 2, will determine which party controls the 
 Legislature. The Democrats held a 10-to-9 majority for slightly more than two months, until the death of Mrs. Johnson on March 9 resulted in a 9-to-9 deadlock. She had just been elected to her third term, capturing 66 percent of the vote.
The Democrats had the majority for the first time in nearly 100 years when they took office in January after voters in November rejected Republican candidates, blaming them for the county's continuing fiscal problems.
Although the Long Island economy, like the rest of the nation's, is robust and the county is one of the country's wealthiest, Nassau faces a deficit this year of more than $100 million and its bonds have been reduced by Wall Street rating agencies to one step above junk status.
Mr. Johnson, 28, of Port Washington, said he looked forward to the next five weeks of campaigning. "It's going to be a hard campaign, and I can't stress that enough, but I know I have a great team with all the Democratic members of the Legislature behind me."
Mr. Johnson has not held elective office in county government but worked with his mother during her time in the Legislature.
Judith A. Jacobs, the Democratic leader of the County Legislature, will retain her title of majority leader if Mr. Johnson is elected.
"The voters put us here in November to clean things up, but we've only just begun," Mrs. Jacobs said. "We need Craig to hold on to the majority."
The 11th Legislative District is traditionally regarded as a swing district, where the number of Republican and Democratic voters are evenly divided.
The district is comprised of Greenvale; Port Washington, including the villages of Sands Point, Manorhaven, Baxter Estates, Port Washington North and Flower Hill; Roslyn, which includes Roslyn Estates and Roslyn Harbor; Manhasset, including the villages of Munsey Park, Plandome, Plandome Heights and Plandome Manor; and parts of the village of Old Westbury and Westbury.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICAN BLUEPRINT: Details of Plan on Spending and Tax Cuts

 BODY:

The House passed a Republican budget blueprint early yesterday by a vote of 211 to 207. The nonbinding blueprint sets targets for spending and tax cuts for next year.
Republicans said the plan balanced the need to spend more on the military and education with their desire to restrain the growth of government and provide large tax cuts. Democrats said the plan would push the government back into deficit, put Social Security and Medicare at risk and force deep cuts in essential programs. 
 
OVERALL SPENDING: Total spending authority for the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1 would rise 3 percent, to $1.85 trillion.
 
TAX CUTS: Over five years, tax cuts would be at least $150 billion. The measure also created a $50 billion reserve fund that could be used to reduce taxes and would channel to tax cuts any increase in the projected surplus over the next five years, a figure that Republicans said could be as much as $40 billion. That would make the total tax cut as much as $240 billion over five years.
 
DISCRETIONARY SPENDING: Spending on programs that must be appropriated each year would rise 3.2 percent, to $596.5 billion. Of that, $307.3 billion would go to the Pentagon, an increase of 6 percent. Spending on all other nonmilitary programs would rise by less than $1 billion, to $289.2 billion. Some categories, like education, would have substantial increases, but nearly everything else would have to be cut after taking account of inflation.
 
DEBT REDUCTION: The part of the budget surplus generated by Social Security, some $2.3 trillion over 10 years and $1 trillion over five years, would be allocated to reducing the $3.5 trillion in national debt held by the public.
 
MEDICARE: Some $40 billion would be allocated over five years to pay for the addition of prescription drug coverage to the health insurance system for the elderly.

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Orders Slip, But Experts Remain Upbeat

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
Orders for costly manufactured goods continued to slide in February, again weighed down by a plunge in demand for aircraft, the government said today.
Orders for durable goods like cars, computers and appliances and big-ticket items, intended to last three years or more, fell 2.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted $208.45 billion. But even so, economists said the manufacturing sector's recovery from the global financial crisis of 1997-99 remained on track. 
 February's report, released by the Commerce Department, was far weaker than analysts' forecast of a decline of 0.2 percent. The report followed a drop of 2.2 percent in January, which was revised downward from a previous fall of 1.9 percent. The February fall was the sharpest since April of last year.
But excluding an 8.7 percent drop in transportation orders, February orders were down a more modest 0.2 percent. Compared with February 1999, orders were up 7.3 percent. And in December of last year, overall orders rose 6.5 percent. Analysts underscored that there was little in the report to suggest an imminent slowdown in the booming economy.
"All of this is coming after a pretty lengthy period of strength," said Jay Feldman, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. "The rest of the economy is running red hot."
Financial markets showed little reaction to the report, which came just days after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the second time this year to try to keep the economy from overheating.
Bond prices, which are highly sensitive to inflation, initially ticked up on the report, but quickly resumed a downward slide on fears that the Fed might raise rates more aggressively in the months ahead given that its moves so far have had scant impact on the torrid pace of growth.
Such worries mounted after the release of minutes from the central bank's Feb. 1-2 policy meeting, which showed several Fed officials had pushed for a more drastic course of monetary tightening.
Today's durable goods report said orders for transportation equipment fell 8.7 percent, to $47.14 billion, led by a decline in aircraft and parts orders. Economists tied the drop to a 38-day strike by engineers at the Boeing Company that ended only last week.
Industrial machinery and equipment was down 4.6 percent at $40.63 billion. Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, however, rose 6.4 percent, to $39.71 billion, in February.
Shipments of finished products fell 1.8 percent, to $205.71 billion. But the orders backlog, a harbinger of future production, rose 0.5 percent, to $519.04 billion, adding to January's 0.7 percent gain.

HEADLINE: Despite Talk of Vice Presidency, a Senator Focuses on His Day Job

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., March 24

 BODY:
In New York, there is the colossal battle known as Hillary versus Rudy. In the Senate race in New Jersey, the winner of a hugely expensive fight for the Democratic nomination will face the survivor of a four-way clash among obscure Republicans. But in Connecticut, things are so quiet that voters could be forgiven for not realizing that Senator Joseph I. Lieberman is actually up for re-election.
Mr. Lieberman, a two-term Democrat, has sky-high approval ratings, overflowing campaign coffers and, as yet, no opponent. The one Republican who has expressed any interest in mounting a challenge, Mayor Philip A. Giordano of Waterbury, has been discouraged from doing so by two of the most important members of his party, Gov. John G. Rowland and the state Republican chairman, Chris DePino. 
 So when Mr. Lieberman's name comes up these days, it is not in terms of the Senate race in November but the result of a recent bubble of speculation about him as a possible running mate for Al Gore. In a more substantive way, though, the lack of a United States Senate contest in Connecticut is allowing Mr. Lieberman to do actual work, like crisscrossing the state last week to visit schools and push for a major new education bill. "This bill actually dramatically increases federal support of education, by $7 billion," he told the 40 students in the senior class at Bridge Academy, a charter school in downtown Bridgeport, last Friday.
"We call it three R's: reinvestment, reinvention and responsibility," he said, standing at the front of a classroom used for history, art and Spanish lessons. "I hope that it will come up in April in the Senate."
Clearly, this was not the electrifying oratory of a candidate hot on the campaign trail. But in many ways, the visit encapsulated Mr. Lieberman's current political state: his confidence, his popularity and his bipartisan reputation.
Bridge Academy, with 160 students, was founded three years ago with the help of federal money made possible by a bill Mr. Lieberman sponsored with a Republican senator, Dave Durenberger of Minnesota. Mr. Lieberman arrived at the school to thunderous applause, smiled proudly as students told him of the school's success and spoke earnestly of the need for more federal money to replace a start-up grant that ends this year.
Questions from the students also served as a reminder of the delicate balance a senator must strike between the most global issues and the most local ones. The first hand in the air belonged to Zasha Soto, whose interests were purely parochial. "Would you be the speaker at our graduation?" she asked. Mr. Lieberman agreed, provided that it fit into his schedule.
After the talk, Yessenia Romero followed the senator into the hallway with a question at the opposite extreme. "How do you feel about maybe becoming vice president?" she wanted to know.
"It's nice to hear it," Mr. Lieberman said of the recent speculation, which includes a column urging his selection in the Capitol Hill journal Roll Call last week and a recent article in the conservative Weekly Standard. "But I don't expect it." Miss Romero seemed satisfied with that response.
A listing of possible vice-presidential contenders in the magazine Campaigns and Elections also puts him on the Democratic short list.
Far-fetched as a spot on the national ticket may be, the fact that Mr. Lieberman, 58, an observant Jew who does not work on the Sabbath, is mentioned at all is testimony to the heights his stature has reached, both in the Democratic Party and in the Senate. One reason for his increased prominence was his willingness to become the first Democrat to condemn President Clinton publicly for his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, a stand that reinforced Mr. Lieberman's reputation as one of the Senate's stronger moral voices.
But much of his rise has to do with his reputation as an independent-minded New Democrat whose religious observance is appreciated by some of his more conservative colleagues across the aisle and whose policy interests have at times diverged with the majority view in the Democratic Party. For example, he speaks favorably about school vouchers.
"People don't want you to agree with them on everything," Mr. Lieberman said over tea and a cheese omelet at a Bridgeport diner last Friday. "They want to feel that you are doing what you feel is right. Part of what I have tried to do is be independent and not walk the political party line if I didn't think the party happened to be right in that case. And this state is very supportive of that kind of representation."
It is a tad ironic that Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the man Mr. Lieberman ousted from the Senate in 1988, won acclaim in some of the same ways -- by being one of the first Republicans to condemn Richard M. Nixon over Watergate, for example. Mr. Lieberman keeps that 1988 race in mind, in particular how he overcame a 24-point deficit in the polls to topple a seemingly invincible incumbent.
That race is a constant reminder, he said, not to take his re-election for granted. To that end, he has written a book, "In Praise of Public Life," a sentimental ode to the life of a career politician that is in equal parts patriotic and self-promotional. The book, published by Simon and Schuster, is now in stores.
He has also amassed a considerable $3.1 million war chest. "I do feel fortunate now, having put this amount of money in the bank," Mr. Lieberman said. "There is no question that it does give me more time to focus on my Senate work, and that's a blessing."
As expected, his re-election campaign will focus on his work on several issues, including economic growth, environmental protection and national security, as well as on the policy areas he hopes to continue tackling: improving education and cultural values, increasing federal financing of scientific research, closing the wealth gap and protecting the state's defense industry jobs.
"If you are an incumbent, you are running on your record, so hopefully you have been doing your job aggressively since the first day that you got it," he said. "A campaign is a way just to go back and talk to people about what you have done and what you hope to do if they are good enough to re-elect you." He said he had slowed his fund-raising efforts.
Mr. Giordano, a 36-year-old Republican serving his third two-year term as mayor of Waterbury, has formed an exploratory committee to begin raising money and has been traveling the state to gauge his level of support. He said he understood why the governor and other Republicans might not be too optimistic about his chances.
"When you are running against someone like Joe Lieberman, who has $3.5 million in the bank, I wouldn't expect the governor's comments to be too encouraging," Mr. Giordano said. But he questioned the effectiveness of Mr. Lieberman and the state's senior senator, Christopher J. Dodd, who is also a Democrat. "I believe we have been ill represented up in D.C.," he said in a telephone interview.
"I believe our senators have gotten too global," Mr. Giordano added. "They have lost touch with the local folks." He said he thought that Mr. Lieberman was vulnerable to a challenge, especially in the areas of defense and education. Mr. Giordano said he did not know when he might formally declare his candidacy.
Mr. Lieberman, for his part, said he would continue his work in Connecticut and in Washington, paying little heed to any talk about his joining the national ticket.
"It is surreal," he said of the speculation. "Because unlike most political experiences, this is not something one creates. This is, you know, the Grand Mentioner, and you get mentioned and you know it's an honor to be mentioned, but I consider myself to be fortunate to be a senator from Connecticut. It's what I dreamed of doing. I love my work and I don't expect or seek anything else."

HEADLINE: OPEC Divided On Increase In Production

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: VIENNA, March 24

 BODY:
After watching oil prices triple over the last year to their highest level since the Persian Gulf war, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is groping toward agreement on a modest increase in production.
But OPEC ministers preparing for a crucial meeting here Monday still appeared divided today on the extent and timetable of any production increases despite intense lobbying by the United States, where soaring gasoline prices have created a political uproar. 
 It is widely expected that OPEC ministers, who control about 40 percent of the world's oil supply, will agree to increase production. But few outside experts think the increase will be big enough to cause more than modest price reductions at the gasoline pump.
Officials from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest producer and the most powerful OPEC member, have quietly endorsed the goal of reducing oil prices to about $25 a barrel from its peak of $34 on March 8.
Indeed, OPEC production is already running more than a million barrels a day over its stated limit of 23 million barrels, and most experts believe the bulk of this extra oil is coming from Saudi Arabia.
Since March 8, the benchmark market price for oil has dropped about 18 percent and as of today was trading at about $28 a barrel. Much of that reflects an expectation among oil traders that OPEC will raise production by about 1.5 million barrels a day. It also reflects an unofficial increase in production that has already occurred.
But even if oil does settle at about $25 a barrel, analysts say that would probably knock only a few pennies off the price of gasoline in the United States, where a gallon of unleaded regular costs an average $1.60.
In the meantime, countries like Iran and Libya were still fighting against a big production increase and their positions have hardened in recent days.
"OPEC is divided," said Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Indonesia's oil minister, to reporters in Jakarta today. "I think it's going to be a heated debate during the meeting."
With oil officials already descending on the Intercontinental Hotel here today, the stakes and the uncertainties about Monday's meeting are both usually high.
"The only thing we know is that OPEC is going to increase production," said Peter Ginoux, who oversees petroleum trading at Salomon Smith Barney in London. "We don't know how much of an increase. We don't know how it will be divided between countries and we don't know the timing."
It was OPEC's surprisingly unified and disciplined decision to cut daily production by 2.1 million barrels last March that sent prices soaring and ignited protests from American drivers and politicians.
In the House of Representatives, lawmakers passed a largely symbolic bill this last week that would require the Clinton administration to determine whether OPEC nations were colluding to fix prices and punish any deemed to be doing so. There is also growing pressure on President Clinton to provide relief by selling oil from the federal government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
Bill Richardson, the Secretary of Energy, has waged an intensive lobbying campaign with the leaders of oil-producing countries, and spent much of this last week meeting with officials in Norway, Nigeria, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates.
American officials have been pushing for an increase of as much as 2.5 million barrels a day, the amount that oil analysts believe is necessary to stabilize prices at about $25 and allow oil companies to rebuild their depleted reserves.
Saudi officials are believed to support an increase of about 1.5 million barrels a day, and they appear to have support from countries like Venezuela and Mexico. Though Mexico is not a member of OPEC, it joined in last year's production cut and is a formidable producer.
But analysts say the real issue is not the nominal increase in amount countries pledge to produce. More important is whether those increases come on top of the current cheating on restrictions.
If oil-exporting countries increase their formal commitments by two million barrels a day, but eliminate the roughly one million barrels a day in noncompliance, the net increase would be only about one million barrels and its market impact would be limited.
"The biggest question is how they handle compliance," said Gary N. Ross, chief executive of PIRA Energy Group, a petroleum industry consulting firm. "How much do they raise the pledge volume, and does noncompliance come down as a result?"
Robert Priddle, executive director of the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based research group, estimated that world output will need to increase by 500,000 to 1 million barrels a day just to bring supply back in line with demand.
Oil producers are understandably anxious, having experienced both an unnerving plunge in prices and an almost equally unexpected ricochet back up -- all in the last two years.
The 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, which deeply depressed demand for oil, and a Saudi decision to step up production helped contribute to a supply glut in 1998 that pushed prices down to about $11 a barrel, inflicting severe financial pain on OPEC nations and other big exporters. Analysts estimate that decline cost OPEC nations $65 billion in revenue.
The severity of that crisis finally imposed discipline on OPEC nations, particularly chronic cheaters like Venezuela, and persuaded non-OPEC producers like Mexico and Norway to join in with production cuts last year.
Now prices have shot up even more dramatically than they declined two years ago, leaving consumers as well as producers almost shell shocked by the turbulence.
"They have never really been in this situation before," said Paul Horsnell, assistant director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies in Oxford, England. "This is the first time they have ever had to add more than a million barrels a day on the market in a coordinated way."
The last time prices shot up so much was during the Persian Gulf war, when oil producers cranked up their output to compensate for the cutoff from Iraq and Kuwait. But that case was simpler, because all producers simply produced as much as they possibly could.
Iran's OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said on Thursday that he had become more skeptical about production increases in the aftermath of the price retreat since the March 8 peak.
"Two weeks ago it may have been justified to call on OPEC to increase production," Mr. Ardebili said. "But now we have a different situation in that during the past three to four days oil prices have fallen by $4 to $5 and this is expected to continue."
Mr. Ross, of PIRA Energy Group, argued that OPEC has extraordinary leverage at the moment because production growth has been slow in non-OPEC areas and global economic growth is accelerating. A 1 percent increase in global economic growth increases oil demand by an estimated 700,000 barrels a day.
"The momentum is with OPEC," Mr. Ross said.

HEADLINE: Indian Bureau Recommends Federal Recognition for Two Pequot Tribes in Connecticut

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
The Bureau of Indian Affairs recommended yesterday that the Eastern Pequot and Paucatuck Eastern Pequot tribes of Connecticut be granted federal recognition, a step that would provide new government benefits and economic opportunity for tribe members and perhaps bring more casinos to Connecticut.
While formal recognition might take a year or more, ecstatic leaders of the Eastern Pequots and the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots, who share a 224-acre reservation in North Stonington near the Rhode Island border, voiced confidence that their decadeslong quest for tribal sovereignty was at last in sight. 
 "This is truly an historic day," said Mary Sebastian, 64, chairwoman of the 770-member Eastern Pequots, in a telephone interview last night. "After 20 years of waiting, we are pleased the Bureau of Indian Affairs agrees that our tribe has maintained its social, cultural and political identity as a sovereign nation."
In another interview, James Cunha, 37, chief of the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots, said his 150 members had "wept tears of joy" at the news from Washington and were gathering to celebrate and to plan work on a final comment on the tribe's petition, which must be filed in 180 days. "We are very happy," he said.
Ms. Sebastian and Mr. Cunha noted that recognition would make tribe members eligible for a wide range of federal assistance in housing, education, health care and other benefits, and that economic opportunities for members would undoubtedly follow.
Both declined to say whether their tribes planned eventually to establish casinos in Connecticut, but Mr. Cunha expressed gratitude to Donald Trump and the Trump Organization for supporting his tribe's efforts.
Only two tribes in Connecticut have federal recognition, and they have been able to use their status to open highly successful casinos: the Mashantucket Pequots, who operate Foxwoods, one of the world's largest and most prosperous gaming establishments, and the Mohegans, who run the Mohegan Sun Casino in the Uncasville section of Montville.
"What we plan to do at this point is still a ways away," Mr. Cunha said. "We're taking this one step at a time."
Ms. Sebastian said that her tribe, if recognized, would make "housing, education and health care for our members No. 1 on our agenda." As for people leaping to conclusions about casinos, she said: "Let them leap. Right now, I'm not going to focus on anything else."
She expressed gratitude to the Connecticut congressional delegation and to state and local officials who supported the tribe's petition.
Joy over the bureau's recommendation masked a long, bitter dispute between the Paucatuck and Eastern Pequots about whether the groups constitute two tribes or different factions of the same tribe, and about which group was truly descended from the original Pequots, who were given the reservation by 17th-century colonial leaders after a war that nearly wiped out the tribe.
The Eastern Pequots began pursuing federal recognition in 1979, a complex process to show that the group had been continuously identified as a tribe since colonial times, that it was a distinct community, that it had maintained authority over its members and that current members were proven descendants.
In 1990, 150 Paucatuck Eastern members began pursing federal recognition separately. The Mohegans supported the Paucatucks and the Mashantucket Pequots supported the Eastern Pequots, who have contended that the Paucatuck Pequots were part of the Eastern tribe.
Both applications had run into trouble in the last decade. In 1990, the bureau said the Eastern Pequots had skipped generations in their attempt to show historic links to ancestors. In 1994, the bureau said the Paucatuck tribe had not proved it was a distinct community since historic times.
While their applications for recognition have been pending, the Paucatuck and Eastern Pequots have avoided talk of plans to establish casinos, but that possibility and its enormous impact have prompted concern among officials.
The Town of North Stonington has hired an anthropologist and a genealogist to monitor both federal petitions, and town officials have said that federal recognition of even one group would probably result in land claims and casinos that would bring drastic change to the area. State officials, too, are monitoring the situation carefully.
Mr. Trump, who has a casino in Atlantic City, has indicated an interest in working with the tribes.
Connecticut's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said the state had been notified of the bureau's decision, but had not immediately received a copy of the 40-page ruling. "We will review the decision and will consult with the governor's office as well as our congressional delegation and the affected towns," Mr. Blumenthal said.
Ms. Sebastian said, "We are proud of our tribe's long and impressive history of attempting to work with its neighbors in North Stonington, Ledyard and Preston, as well as the surrounding communities."

HEADLINE: Annan Exhorts U.N. Council on 'Oil for Food' for Iraqis

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 24

 BODY:
Secretary General Kofi Annan warned today that the United Nations was in danger of losing a propaganda war with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq if the "oil for food" program intended to help Iraqi civilians suffering under sanctions is not made more effective immediately.
"The humanitarian situation in Iraq poses a serious moral dilemma for this organization," Mr. Annan told the council. "The United Nations has always been on the side of the vulnerable and the weak, and has always sought to relieve suffering, yet here we are accused of causing suffering to an entire population." 
 He was speaking at a special daylong Security Council session to review the organization's work in Iraq, during which the United States was on the defensive against criticism that it is blunting the positive impact of the program by blocking more than 1,000 import contracts.
Responding to such charges, James B. Cunningham, the deputy American representative at the United Nations, announced today that the United States was lifting its holds, in the committee on sanctions against Iraq, on 70 contracts worth at least $100 million. The United States also formally introduced its resolution doubling to $600 million the value of oil equipment Iraq may import every six months. The amount of oil Iraq can export has not been limited since December.
Richard C. Holbrooke, the American representative, was not in the Security Council today. He has played down the Iraq issue since his arrival in August, showing little interest in a long-running Clinton administration policy that has drawn rebukes against the United States. He has turned the Iraq file over to Mr. Cunningham, who is more familiar with the issue, having been posted here when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, an invasion that led to the imposition of international sanctions.
Today, Mr. Cunningham offered several proposals for better supervision in Iraq, so that American suspicions about the ultimate use or destinations of certain imported goods, including electrical, scientific, telecommunications and oil equipment, could be reduced.
Even with current Iraqi problems, Mr. Cunningham said, Iraq's oil exports and food imports are reaching the levels that prevailed before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
In a long speech accompanied by statistical material circulated to council members, Mr. Cunningham continued to place much of the blame for shortcomings in the oil sales plan on Mr. Hussein's government, which, he said, refuses to expedite orders, share information or allow inspections at many sites.
Mr. Annan also took the Iraqis to task, saying people living under sanctions are "often victims both of their own government and of the measures taken against it." The only way to end that, he added, is for Iraq to comply with council decisions.
The council is waiting to see whether Mr. Hussein will allow the return of weapons inspectors, the key to ending sanctions.
But Mr. Annan expressed anguish over the position the United Nations now finds itself in, with an uncooperative Iraq on one side and an intransigent United States on the other.
"We are in danger of losing the argument, or the propaganda war -- if we haven't already lost it -- about who is responsible for this situation, President Saddam Hussein or the United Nations," he said.
During today's debate, several council members tried to shift from past blame to future efforts to make the "oil for food" program work.
Sir Jeremy Greenstock of Britain, speaking to reporters before this afternoon's session, said there were numerous things the council could do without further debate.
"We can speed the procedures in the sanctions committee," he said. "We can inject more cash into the U.N. program in Iraq. We can start to stop the smuggling that is going on, the illegal oil sales. We can increase the number of monitors looking at the program's delivery in Iraq, and if we do that, we can bring down the number of holds."
The Russians, French and Chinese were most critical today of the American and British positions on Iraq. Sergey Lavrov, the Russian representative, accused the United States and Britain of killing more than 140 people and wounding hundreds in attacks in the no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq.
"Any explanation that these strikes were not directed at civilians does not hold water," Mr. Lavrov said. He called for an early suspension of sanctions.
Peter van Walsum, the Dutch representative and chairman of the committee on sanctions against Iraq, said that despite differences, there was a council consensus that Iraq still has to convince the world that it does not have dreams of creating prohibited weapons.
"Iraq is the only country in modern history that has not only attempted to develop all categories of weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, biological and chemical -- but has actually used such weapons, both against a foreign enemy and against its own citizens," Mr. van Walsum said. "In doing so, Iraq has placed itself in a league of its own."
Until today, two issues lying at the heart of the debate on Iraq had rarely been raised. One is the scarcity of verifiable information beyond what is physically visible to United Nations officials in Iraq -- whose appointments Baghdad can control in the sense that it can reject nominees for relief positions, and whose movements are frequently circumscribed.
All health and poverty figures the United Nations has to work with are provided by the Iraqi government. Journalists cannot report freely in the country, and the international news agencies there must use Iraqi citizens for day-to-day reporting, which usually amounts to no more than repeating what officials say in the state-controlled press.
Iraqi government decisions are often opaque, some United Nations officials say. In some ministries, there appears to be little planning for social development using what funds are available to the government from its own resources.
The second issued seldom raised before now is that in the virtual absence of independent information-gathering in Iraq, critics of Mr. Hussein say, the effects of sanctions can be manipulated to influence public opinion inside and outside the country, as a few speakers noted today.
Richard Butler, a diplomat in residence at the Council on Foreign Relations, who was chief arms inspector in Iraq from 1997 to 1999, argues that sanctions worked when they were first imposed.
"Sanctions might work initially, depending not on how severe they are or how the leadership reacts to them," he said in an interview on Wednesday. "They did, in the Iraq case, concentrate their minds for a while."
But the longer sanctions are applied, Mr. Butler said, "the less and less effective they become, to the point where they invert in their effectiveness for two reasons. One, they get busted through a black market, and two, the leadership is able to parlay this into a reason for staying in power.
"I think that's exactly where Saddam is now," he said. "He's saying, 'Only I can protect you from all those bad people out there, and that's why you've got to stick with me.' "

Microsoft Said to Offer Plan
To Settle Antitrust Case
Microsoft presented a proposal in an attempt to settle the antitrust case filed by the Justice Department and 19 states against the company. Lawyers were studying the plan to decide whether it was promising enough to warrant weekend negotiations.
Representatives of the government said Microsoft agreed to restrain some of its business practices but the document contained so many technical details that they could not analyze it quickly. Judge Richard A. Posner, chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals in Chicago who is acting as a mediator in the case, has urged the two sides to resolve the case quickly. Page A1.
 
Dow Falls, but Nasdaq Rises Again
A volatile week on Wall Street ended quietly, as the Dow Jones industrial average fell slightly and the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index crept closer to the record it set earlier in March. The Dow was down 7.14 points, to 11,112.72, while the Nasdaq rose 22.42 points, to 4,963.03. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.11 point, to 1,527.46. The real action yesterday was in bonds, with the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond falling, sending the bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, up to 5.99 percent from 5.91 percent on Thursday.

European Beer Prices Investigated
European investigators looking into the retail price of beer made surprise visits to five breweries, including Grolsch and Heineken in the Netherlands and the Italian brewer Peroni, to investigate documents that may shed light on how the industry sets prices. C2.
 
Steel Maker Bids for Car-Parts Unit
The British mobile telephone giant Vodafone AirTouch said it had received an unsolicited offer from ThyssenKrupp, Germany's largest steel maker, for the car parts and engineering unit of Mannesmann, which Vodafone recently agreed to acquire for $183 billion. Analysts said a deal for the unit could be worth $10 billion. C2.
 
Clinton Lauds India's Tech Industry
India's information technology industry, the core of the country's steady economic growth, was saluted by President Clinton, who, on the final full day of his visit to the country, was promoting trade between the two countries and more American investment in India. A4.
 
Durable Goods Orders Decline 2.3%
Orders for durable goods declined 2.3 percent in February, the second consecutive monthly decline and the largest in 10 months. The figure was lower than analysts had expected, but was still 7.3 percent higher than a year earlier, indicating that the recovery by the manufacturing sector of the economy from the global financial crisis of 1997-99 remained on track. C3.
 
Exxon Mobil Challenges ARCO Sale
Exxon Mobil said that it sued to block the sale of the Atlantic Richfield Company's Alaskan oil fields to Phillips Petroleum, contending it had the right of first refusal to purchase some of the assets. The lawsuit seeks a preliminary injunction that could delay BP Amoco's proposed $33 billion purchase of ARCO. C3.
 
South American Auto Trade Pact
South America's two largest countries, Brazil and Argentina, reached an agreement on the trade of automobiles. The five-year accord will establish an equal balance of imports and exports between the two nations, in addition to a shared tariff of 35 percent on imports from outside the Mercosur trade bloc, which includes Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.

HEADLINE: An Enigmatic Pianist Reclaims Her Stardom

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

 BODY:
Few people who have heard the tempestuous Argentine-born pianist Martha Argerich play ever forget it. She is a colossal technician, a powerfully intuitive musician and an electrifying performer. Just last week at Carnegie Hall, as soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra in a concert conducted by Charles Dutoit, Ms. Argerich vanquished the formidable challenges of Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 3. Her fiery, ecstatic performance elicited a frenzied ovation, including 10 curtain calls, from a sold-out house.
Though she inspires cultlike devotion among ordinary concertgoers, her admirers include many of the world's most respected musicians. Mstislav Rostropovich, the great cellist and conductor, recently called her "a pianist with no limits at all, none whatsoever." 
 But Ms. Argerich, who will perform again tonight at Carnegie Hall, is the most enigmatic figure in classical music today, by turns passionate, disarming and chaotic. Beset with inner demons and insecurities, she can be an erratic performer and has been famously prone to canceling concerts precipitously. "Martha is an unguided missile," as one close friend of hers has memorably put it.
For years the reclusive pianist assiduously avoided giving interviews, even as adoring fans worried about her and flocked to her concerts, hoping that she was well, hoping she would play. Ms. Argerich kept her silence even as rumors spread that she was fatally ill.
But on one recent night, close to 11 o'clock, Ms. Argerich (pronounced AHR-gur-itch) sat in the lounge of a midtown hotel for the first extended one-on-one interview she has given in nearly 20 years and talked openly about her work and her health.
Some weeks earlier she had allowed a statement to be released confirming that she had been treated for melanoma, cancer of the skin, at the John Wayne Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, Calif. But now she revealed the extent of the problem: the melanoma had spread to her lymph nodes and lungs. "I was afraid of my own body," she said of the trauma she faced. "I was afraid of myself for the first time; afraid to be me."
So far the treatments appear to have been successful. She is in remission. Indeed, out of gratitude Ms. Argerich's concert is to benefit the institute. All tickets were scooped up weeks ago. Her program tonight is also significant because, for the first time in 19 years, she is performing solo repertory in a major American concert venue.
During the wide-ranging 90-minute interview, Ms. Argerich, who is 58, also spoke of musical matters and her tumultuous career: her beginnings as a pint-size prodigy; her early triumphs; her crisis of confidence when she felt "out of order," as she put it, "like an elevator or a telephone;" her practice habits, which can be "not very systematic and not very disciplined;" and her "contradictory type of relationship" to the piano. "I can be obsessive" when there is music to be learned, she said; but at other times "I don't touch the piano at all."
Pinning the unpredictable Ms. Argerich down to a time and place for the interview proved difficult. When she finally arrived as promised, she had just finished practicing in an upstairs studio at Carnegie Hall and was in work mode: dressed in slacks and a long sweater, her sleek mane of black hair a bit disheveled. Ms. Argerich, barely 5-foot-4, is a striking woman with bright brown eyes and a sturdy build. Her hands are surprisingly small, and on this night a few finger tips were protected by band-aids.
In 1981, Ms. Argerich announced that she was giving up solo recitals entirely, and, with occasional exceptions for special, usually hush-hush events, she has kept to her word. Why?
"It's really a very obsessive situation, when you are alone onstage playing on your own," she said. "I have a tendency to be a very obsessive person. It makes me very . . . I don't know." Of course, the solo repertory is wonderful, she added. But she prefers playing chamber music and concertos, which is more stimulating and less lonely.
Her insecurities as a performer long predate her health crisis. The daughter of two university-based economists in Buenos Aires, she began piano lessons at 5. When she was 8 she played a difficult Beethoven piano sonata (Op. 31, No. 3) for the renowned pianist Walter Gieseking, who proclaimed her a phenomenon. At 16, within the space of three weeks, she won both the Busoni and the Geneva International Piano Competitions.
When she was 21 she suffered a crippling bout of depression that lasted over two years. After studying in Europe, she moved to New York and "didn't do anything," she said. "I just sat in an apartment watching the late late show." Even getting married and having the first of her three daughters, each by a different man, did not lift her from the depression.
"I felt I could not play any more," she said. "Since I spoke several languages, I thought I would just become a secretary." She credits a former teacher, the Polish-born pianist Stefan Askenase, and his strong-willed wife with helping to lift her out of this hole and back into music. Their intervention clearly worked, for in 1965, at 24, Ms. Argerich won first prize in the Chopin International Competition in Warsaw, and her career took off. Among the colleagues who helped was Mr. Dutoit, to whom she was married from 1969 until 1973 and with whom she remains good friends.
She was quickly acclaimed for her rhapsodic playing, particularly of the Romantic repertory. But as her career developed, she began missing concerts, quite often. "I don't know why I had this very scandalistic reputation," she said, coyly. "I played more concerts than what I canceled." In early 1968 she was scheduled to play Beethoven's First Piano Concerto for her debut with the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Leonard Bernstein. She withdrew on short notice.
"It was terrible I did this," she said. "It was not for health reasons. It was some other problems I had. So Bernstein played the concerto himself. The manager at the time was very funny. He said: 'Lennie played. He had a great success, so he loves you!' " Ms. Argerich burst into hearty laughter and grabbed a handful of the sesame crackers she had just discovered on the snack tray.
Of course, some real crises compelled her to miss performances in some cases, like two recitals scheduled in Tokyo early last month. Ms. Argerich had been hoping to try out there the solo works she will play tonight. But a former teacher, the pianist Friedrich Gulda, a deeply spiritual musician ("my most important influence"), died, plunging her into distress. After attending his funeral in Vienna, Ms. Argerich flew that same day to Tokyo, and within two hours of landing performed, as scheduled, the Chopin Piano Concerto No. 1 with Vladimir Ashkenazy conducting. "It was the best Chopin E Minor I ever played," she said. "I don't know why." But she developed a fever and had to cancel two eagerly anticipated solo recitals.
Not getting this trial run has added pressure to tonight's concert. Half of her program will be solo repertory, works by Bach, Chopin and Prokofiev's daunting Seventh Sonata. Ms. Argerich is looking forward much more to the concert's second half, when she will have some company onstage: the Juilliard String Quartet for a performance of Schumann's Piano Quintet, and an old friend, the pianist Nelson Freire, for a performance of Ravel's "Valse" in its arrangement for two pianos.
She has been practicing hard. A night owl, she prefers to work late. When not availing herself of Carnegie Hall's studios she has been at the Metropolitan Opera House, where a young friend, the tenor Kamel Boutros, arranged for access to a studio.
"Once I start practicing I can stay," she explained. "But I don't start," she added, laughing again. "O.K, if I am in trouble, I need to practice. But that kind of obsessive practicing is not good. Ideally, I would like to practice very little, just two hours and then not more."
Obviously, health concerns have contributed to her anxiety. Though enormously relieved by her medical progress, Ms. Argerich delayed the appointment for her annual checkup until after tonight's concert. "I was too nervous," she said. "Let's hope for good news," she added, tapping on the cocktail table.
Her first melanoma appeared 10 years ago, at a very difficult time. "One year before, my mother had died of cancer," she said. "Then, the same day I was diagnosed, my best friend died from another type of cancer. She was 49. It was like a nightmare."
Ms. Argerich underwent treatment in Europe, but five years later another melanoma appeared. Within a year it had spread. The condition was now life-threatening.
Through friends Ms. Argerich learned of a surgical oncologist, Dr. Donald L. Morton, the medical director of the John Wayne Cancer Institute, a nonprofit organization in Santa Monica, Calif., supported by the National Cancer Institute and private funds. Since 1960 Dr. Morton had led a research team seeking to develop a vaccine that could be used to fight melanoma by simulating the body's immune system.
In addition to recommending the experimental vaccine, which Ms. Argerich is taking, Dr. Morton explained that she would have to undergo surgery to remove cancerous tissue from her lungs.
"This was March 1997," Ms. Argerich said. "Just before the surgery, I felt, 'This is dangerous.' You see, to play the piano you use these muscles here." She pointing to the areas below her arm, on her side and back.
Dr. Morton, speaking by telephone from California, said he had not realized until then how important those muscles were to a pianist. "Thank God we were able to accomplish the procedure without doing damage to the muscles," he said. The recovery was grueling for her, said Dr. Morton, who is in New York to attend the benefit. "But the same characteristics that make her a world-class pianist also make her a survivor," he said. "She is a very brave lady."
While leaving her practice room at Carnegie Hall on the way to the interview the other night, Ms. Argerich was approached by a young usher who is a big fan. She wound up confiding her nervousness to him. "So, he told me, 'You must learn the wisdom of uncertainty,' " she recalled. "That's nice, no?"
Uncertainty is something Ms. Argerich has learned to live with.

HEADLINE: Budget Rift, Not a Chasm

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
This year's partisan battle over the federal budget, which lurched forward early today when the House narrowly passed a Republican tax-and-spending blueprint, has a familiar ring.
Republicans want a big tax cut, more money for the military and reductions in just about everything else. Democrats are trying to expand or at least protect spending on a wide array of domestic programs. Each side is attacking the other in apocalyptic terms. The policy and political repercussions could be substantial. 
 But it is worth noting that prosperity has brought the parties closer on fiscal policy than either usually admits.
Without debate or rancor, Republicans and Democrats have more or less agreed that the surplus being generated by Social Security -- $1 trillion over the next five years and $2.3 trillion over a decade -- should go to pay down the portion of the debt held by the public, currently about $3.5 trillion. (The fine print could theoretically also allow the money to be used to help create private investment accounts within Social Security. But that Republican goal has been put on the back burner at least until after the election.)
There is common ground on other issues as well. Republicans are proposing a substantial increase in spending on education, seeking to neutralize an issue that long played to the advantage of Democrats. Both parties want to provide money to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, though they differ on the scale any such program should have.
And the unanimous votes this month in both the House and the Senate to repeal the earnings limit on Social Security recipients provided some hope that compromise might be possible on other tax issues, like the marriage penalty paid by many two-income couples.
"We should be doing a little bit more celebrating for what we have been able to achieve as Republicans and Democrats alike," said Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee.
Still, the differences, in both ideological and dollar terms, are more than enough to create political friction on the campaign trail this year as well as in Washington.
The House budget blueprint, passed by a largely party-line vote of 211 to 207 early today after more than 12 hours of often rancorous debate, would cut taxes by at least $150 billion over five years and perhaps as much as $240 billion. It would also raise total government spending authority by 3 percent, to $1.85 trillion.
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has locked up the Republican presidential nomination, wants a $483 billion tax cut over five years -- more than his party is willing even to try getting through Congress this year.
Vice President Al Gore, who will be Mr. Bush's opponent in the fall, says that the approach taken by Republicans in Congress would risk a return to budget deficits and imperil efforts to shore up Social Security and Medicare -- and that Mr. Bush's plan is even worse.
The Senate will soon take up a budget plan similar to the one passed by the House, though it has been bottled up for the past week in the Senate Budget Committee by conservatives who are pressing for bigger tax cuts and less spending.
Once both chambers have settled on and reconciled their budget plans -- nonbinding resolutions that provide a framework for the development of specific spending and tax bills -- the really difficult work will begin.
At that point, the appropriations committees that set spending levels for everything from fighter planes to farm aid and school lunch programs will start drafting their bills. If the past few years are any guide, they will find it difficult if not impossible to remain within the limits set out in the budget outline.
The budget provides for a 6 percent increase in military spending, to $307.3 billion, but essentially freezes nonmilitary spending at $289 billion, requiring cuts in most programs once inflation is taken into account. Most of the rest of the budget goes to pay Social Security and Medicare benefits and interest on the national debt.
In each of the past several years, the Republican-controlled Congress has approved nonmilitary spending increases well above the inflation rate. In part, that is because of pressure from President Clinton. But it is also because Republicans themselves have found it hard to vote for spending cuts or freezes in popular programs at a time when the budget surplus is swelling.
The result has been to make it difficult for Republicans to pass the appropriations bills needed to keep the government operating, leading to an end-of-session rush to cut deals and get out of town, even if it requires using budgetary gimmicks to make the numbers add up. Such a prospect looms again this year, when members of Congress will be particularly eager to get home to campaign.
The failure by Republicans to set realistic spending targets "has delayed, rather than expedited, action on appropriations bills and other fiscal legislation," Jacob J. Lew, the White House budget director, said in a letter sent to Congressional leaders on Thursday night.
The problem is exacerbated by a split within the Republican Party. House leaders had difficulty rounding up the votes they needed to pass the budget early today because a group of conservatives had threatened to vote against it on the ground that it did not have enough safeguards against last-minute deals to increase spending.
Yet moderates and members of the appropriations committees warned that the spending levels in the budget plan were already unrealistically low, and that passing appropriations bills would become even more difficult if conservatives insisted on further cuts or more debt reduction.

HEADLINE: US Airways and Union Talking as Strike Deadline Passes

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Negotiators for US Airways Group and its flight attendants union continued talking early this morning as the 12:01 a.m. deadline for the talks passed.
The airline and the union had reported modest progress earlier in the evening and at about midnight, Jeff Zack, a union spokesman said that the two sides had agreed to continue talking beyond the deadline. 
 Lawrence Nagin, US Airways's executive vice president and general counsel, said the chairman of the National Mediation Board had asked them to extend the talks past the deadline and the two sides agreed to do so. The airline's management repeated yesterday that if no agreement was reached by the deadline, US Airways would suspend operations beginning today to avoid being whipsawed by the attendants' planned partial strike.
Adopting unorthodox tactics, the union's 10,000 flight attendants have warned of a partial strike that would disrupt 49 of the airline's busiest routes. Company officials fear that the partial strike, which the union calls Chaos -- Create Havoc Around Our System -- would tie the airline in knots and strand thousands of passengers during a busy time when many schools have spring break.
At a news conference yesterday in Washington, Patricia Friend, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, said the union was continuing preparations for a strike, adding, "We've been able to settle a large number of issues, mostly the smaller issues, but the larger issues of pay and pension remain unresolved."
The union's leaders and Rakesh Gangwal, the airline's chief executive, were still negotiating late yesterday in an undisclosed Washington hotel with the assistance of Ernest W. DuBester, chairman of the National Mediation Board. Officials from both sides said the talks were difficult because the airline was intent on reining in its operating costs, the highest in the industry, while the attendants want a large raise because they have not had an across-the-board pay increase in four years.
The flight attendants have been bargaining with the airline since 1996 and they became free to strike at 12:01 a.m. today when a federally mandated 30-day cooling-off period expired. Under federal law, President Clinton has the power to order the airline and attendants to continue normal operations for 60 days, but officials for each side said they doubted he would do that because neither side has requested such intervention. Several labor experts said they doubted he would intervene because it would upset the A.F.L.-C.I.O., in an important election year. The labor federation complained bitterly in 1997 when Mr. Clinton intervened to cut short a pilots' strike at American Airlines, saying his action weakened the pilots' leverage.
The threat of a shutdown of US Airways, the nation's sixth-largest airline, whether through a strike or the company's pre-emptive action, was sowing tension and chaos in airports around the nation yesterday as thousands of passengers rushed to change their reservations or seek refunds on their tickets. On a typical day, US Airways operates 2,200 flights carrying a total of 150,000 passengers.
"There's a considerable amount of nervousness out there," said Michael Pingrey, owner of Act Travel, a Washington-based travel agency. "We're working hard to get people on other flights, but it's getting tougher and tougher. Everyone has been trying to get onto other flights, but all the other flights are booked up now."
A shutdown would do the greatest harm on the East Coast, where US Airways has hubs in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Charlotte, N.C., and holds 36 percent of the market.
Delta Air Lines has said that if US Airways' New York-Washington-Boston shuttle is suspended, it would add several planes to the Delta shuttle, while Amtrak said it would add 1,500 train seats to carry on the New York-Washington-Boston routes.
US Airways has arranged for other airlines and Amtrak to honor its tickets if its operations are shut down. The airline advises customers holding electronic tickets to call US Airways or a travel agent, or to go to a US Airways counter, to get their tickets reprocessed so those tickets can be accepted at other airlines.
Philip Baggaley, an airline analyst at Standard & Poor's, said a shutdown would cause the airline $15 million to $20 million in losses a day. But he said the airline had more than $1 billion in cash to help weather a shutdown, including a $500 million credit line it recently drew down. To control costs, US Airways is pressing the attendants to accept a formula, known as parity plus one, similar to that accepted by its other major unions. That formula would link attendants' pay to the average of their counterparts at the nation's four largest airlines plus 1 percent.
But US Air's attendants have bridled at this, egged on by union leaders who say the formula put forward by management would cut their pay and benefits. Resistance to the formula has been fueled further by resentment toward the compensation received by US Airways' top executives. Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman, received $34.2 million last year in salary, bonus and stock option grants, several times that of his counterparts at the top four airlines.
"It's outrageous that when they receive their large salaries and bonuses and when the airline continues to prosper in a strong economy, they expect us to take a pay cut and accept concessions," said Christopher Spangler, a $32,000-a-year flight attendant based in Pittsburgh. Attendants' pay starts at $17,145 and rises to a maximum of $36,918 after 14 years.
Company officials assert that their pay offer is generous because it links the attendants not to their counterparts at struggling companies, but to their counterparts at the industry leaders: United, American, Delta and Northwest.
US Airways officials added that if the union accepted the parity formula it would go far to restrain the airline's costs. These officials added that if the attendants were to receive a higher formula, then the airline's other major unions might demand to have their contracts reopened.
"This is not about who is right or wrong or who wins or loses," said Nagin, the airline's general counsel. "It's about this company being competitive and doing what's right for our employees."
One sticking point has been the attendants' assertion that management was pressing them to accept the same version of the parity formula as the pilots did.

The Battle for God
 By Karen Armstrong.
 442 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50. 
 Dr. JAMES LUTHER ADAMS, my ethics professor in seminary, used to tell us that we would end our careers fighting an ascendant fundamentalist movement, or, as he liked to say, "the Christian fascists." He was not a scholar to be disregarded, however implausible such a scenario seemed, and still seems. But it is clear that as we enter the new millennium the traditional versions of the three monotheistic religions have failed to fill the huge spiritual void of modernity -- one Jean-Paul Sartre called "a God-shaped hole." We lie on the cusp of a great religious experiment, one similar to the upheaval that led to the decline of paganism and the rise of reformers and prophets during the so-called Axial Age (800 B.C.-200 B.C.), when the most important thoughts worth thinking were first thought. Regretfully, for the moment, all innovation, passion and energy lie with the adversaries of secular, democratic society.
Whether or not you see fundamentalism as a threat, as Karen Armstrong does in "The Battle for God," hers is one of the most penetrating, readable and prescient accounts to date of the rise of the fundamentalist movements in Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Rather than make sweeping pronouncements, she wisely focuses on the fundamentalist strains in the United States, Israel, Iran and Egypt. She displays, as she should, sympathy for the plight of those who turned to fundamentalism after being shunted aside by forces and states that have little patience with the quest by the poor and the dispossessed to find meaning and purpose.
But what has evolved as a response to modernity is also tainted, Armstrong points out, with the doctrines and mores of the 20th century, including the support for liberation movements, the requirement to fashion messages to suit the confines of the electronic media and the disturbing belief that the rational world can be applied to the mythos of religion as if it were a science. Protestant fundamentalists read the Bible, she writes, "in a literal, rational way that is quite different from the more mystical, allegorical approach of premodern spirituality." Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was not, as she aptly reminds us, a throwback to the Middle Ages: "in fact much of his message and developing ideology was modern. His opposition to Western imperialism and his support of the Palestinians were similar to other third world movements at this time; so was his direct appeal to the people." Even the ultra-Orthodox Jews, who try to turn their back on secular Israeli society, have founded yeshivas that are recognizable, voluntarist institutions. "They adopted a novel stringency in their observance of the Torah and learned to manipulate the political system in a way that brought them more power than any religious Jew had enjoyed for nearly two millenniums," Armstrong notes.
These movements are struggling to define, often in disturbing ways, an ethic in a world whose landscape has altered dramatically. They are a product, although they do not recognize themselves as such, of the culture they hope to vanquish, and all "have a symbiotic relationship with modernity." Like other uncompromising movements -- fascism, communism and nationalism -- fundamentalist sects fester. "The West has developed an entirely unprecedented and wholly different type of civilization," Armstrong, the author of three previous books, including "A History of God," writes, "so the religious response to it has been unique." She is unsure how to vanquish or tame these movements, pointing out that each attempt to crush them has resulted in more virulent strains. The problem may be that such vindictive intolerance, racism and homophobia simply have no place in a civil society. Much of fundamentalism is an ideology of rage, a product of the worst elements of the society it condemns. The Gush Emunim in Israel, the forces grouped around the Iranian clergy, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and the constituencies of Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson "have absorbed the pragmatic rationalism of modernity, and, under the guidance of their charismatic leaders, they refine these 'fundamentals' so as to create an ideology that provides the faithful with a plan of action," Armstrong writes.
The fieriest and deadliest battle, however, is not between the sacred and the profane, but between the anointed and the apostates masquerading as believers. The assassinations of Anwar Sadat and Yitzhak Rabin illustrate, Armstrong says, the two wars being fought in the Middle East, one between the Arabs and the Jews and the other "between secularists and religious." It was the internecine fighting between the powerful television evangelists, not the liberal establishment they set out to topple, that saw the collapse of the empires of Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart. The Christian right consumed itself.
But as Armstrong's narrative, which traces these movements back to their roots, makes plain, there has long been an ebb and flow. In a pattern they share with all fundamentalist groups, including those who fought the shah of Iran or the Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser, the sects, each time they are wounded, regroup, redefine their mission and return again to assault modern society. "Protestant fundamentalists in the United States became more reactionary, intransigent and literal-minded after their humiliation at the Scopes trial," she writes. "The most extreme forms of Sunni fundamentalism surfaced in Nasser's concentration camps, and the shah's crackdowns helped to inspire the Islamic Revolution."
None of this is a defense of modernity. Armstrong, who spent seven years as a Roman Catholic nun, recognizes that for many people modern society means "an emptiness, a void, that rendered life meaningless; many would crave certainty amid the perplexities of modernity; some would project their fears onto imaginary enemies and dream of universal conspiracy." Scientific rationalism, while discrediting myth, has nothing, she says, to offer in its place. And it has led, in its perverted forms, to the creation of the most effective totalitarian states and ideologies in human history, along with two world wars, the gas chamber and the gulag. "Without the constraints of a 'higher,' mythical truth, reason can on occasion become demonic and commit crimes that are as great as, if not greater than, any of the atrocities perpetrated by fundamentalists," she says.
For those who feel battered and perplexed by forces they cannot control and cannot understand, especially Muslims under the boot of the shah, Jews reeling from the annihilation of the shtetl and the Holocaust, poor peasants ground down by the pro-Western government of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and American Christians who resent the arrogance and ethos of the Eastern liberal establishment, the retreat into fundamentalism offers refuge and hope. But ultimately, like all ideologies that eschew compromise, fundamentalism is utopian and accepts the morally corrosive proposition that the ends always justify the means. Disturbingly as it is to accept, the inquisitional nature of the early church seems closer to these new Jeremiahs than the soft universality of mainstream religion.
Already mutant splinter groups, many of which have retreated from the tainted, profane world, have left more temperate fundamentalists far behind. The organization known as Christian Identity, which has swung so far out of orbit that it disapproves of fundamentalism, rails against the Christian right's support for Zionism. It is angered that the Jews have usurped the title of Chosen People from the Aryan race. The ideology of Christian Identity is the kind of poison ingested by Timothy McVeigh before he blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995. It bears a striking similarity to the fringe Muslim and Jewish groups who see any target, including children and the innocents, as the regrettable cost of holy war.
History is awash with beleaguered revolutionaries and lunatic extremists who were endowed with enough luck and enough ruthlessness to fill power vacuums. The danger is not that fundamentalism will grow, Armstrong's analysis suggests, so much as that modern, secular society will wither. Already mainstream Christianity, Judaism and Islam lie defeated and emasculated by the very forces that ironically turned them into tolerant, open institutions. "The chances of this theology's achieving much popularity in the United States are, to be sure, remote; but it has been suggested that in the event of an environmental or major economic catastrophe, an authoritarian state church could replace the liberal polity of the Enlightenment," she writes. "Christianity, after all, was able to adapt to capitalism, which was alien to many of the teachings of Jesus. It could be used to back a fascist ideology that, in drastically changed circumstances, might be necessary to maintain public order."

The Cluetrain Manifesto
 The End of Business as Usual.
 By Rick Levine,
 Christopher Locke, Doc Searls
 and David Weinberger.
 190 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
 Perseus Books. $23. 
 Perhaps the current Slogan Era of business thinking began in 1995, with the appearance of Fast Company magazine. The distressed type on the cover introduced "The New Rules of Business" in the form of catch phrases like "Work Is Personal" and "Knowledge Is Power." The slogans seemed vaguely political, and that was the idea -- the editors announced a "business revolution." Of a piece with this rhetoric was the appearance, about a year ago, of a "manifesto" at www.cluetrain.com. The site, put together by a small cadre of tech-oriented thinkers, came to the attention of a Wall Street Journal writer, and now we have a book -- already creeping up on some best-seller lists -- that consists of the original document plus seven related essays.
Although there are 95 points to the manifesto, most are refinements of a few underlying ideas, which are of course reducible to slogans: "Markets are conversations," and the murkier but equally important "Hyperlinks subvert hierarchy." What these statements mean is that, in a networked world, workers and consumers can share information far more easily than ever before. The loser is "the company," which the authors dismiss as being "a metaphysical construct" in any event.
So you, the person who works for a company, have or will have extraordinary communication with fellow employees, from subversive e-mail about how stupid that meeting was to comments about your latest project from co-workers you've never even met. With the right kind of intranet, the right idea will always emerge, possibly from someone you would never have asked (and thus does a hyperlink subvert a hierarchy). Meanwhile, you, the consumer, can cross-check those companies' claims and ask for or give advice about any product or service. Ultimately, advertising proves futile. "Word of Web will trump word of hype, every time," the authors write.
That, needless to say, is itself hyperbole. So is much of the authors' view of business, which they often express with about as much sophistication as Holden Caulfield. Basically, people who run companies are venal phonies, and they are foolishly trying to bend the networked economy to their cynical ways with disingenuous corporate Web sites and boring intranets.
But that's O.K. A manifesto should be full of hyperbole, and while this one often strains credulity in the particulars, the general thrust is on the mark. Certainly at the large companies I've worked for, the intranet was no more populist a forum than the bulletin board in the lobby. And as a reporter I have dealt with enough corporations to applaud the chapter on the banality of public relations. "The Cluetrain Manifesto" suggests that even companies that see themselves as "getting" the Internet are actually in denial about it, and that's probably true.
What's strange -- but ultimately revealing -- is how the authors frame their broadside. "Burn down business-as-usual," Christopher Locke writes in the opening chapter. "Bulldoze it. . . . Topple the statues of heroes too long dead into the street. Sound familiar? You bet it does. And the message has been the same all along, from Paris in '68 to the Berlin Wall, from Warsaw to Tiananmen Square: Let the kids rock 'n' roll!" Whether that was the ultimate message of these events is debatable, but it emphatically is the message that "The Cluetrain Manifesto," and the culture it emerged from, have for society. What the Slogan Era's "business revolution" is really about is not borrowed from politics; instead, it's a phenomenon that offers middle-aged managers a second chance to sound a barbaric yawp and imagine a new significance to their lives. This message is popular because no one wants to serve the public, but everyone wants to feel like a rock star. "There's a huge opportunity here," Locke declares, "for individuals to keep their day jobs but at the same time indulge their natural human bent for self-expression." And if you buy into that, then, gee, it turns out that business and rock 'n' roll -- why, they're practically the same thing after all!

HEADLINE: Steve Phillips's Winter of Content

BYLINE: By Bruce Weber; Bruce Weber is a theater critic for The New York Times.

 BODY:
In the wee hours last Oct. 20, Kenny Rogers threw his last pitch for the New York Mets, ball four to Andruw Jones of the Atlanta Braves, walking in the winning run in the 11th inning. It was a moment of startling anticlimax, bringing to an abrupt, pallid end an otherwise nerve-jangler of a ballgame, the equally vivid National League Championship Series and, just short of a consummating subway World Series against the Yankees, the Mets' whole preposterously titillating and melodramatic season.
"I remember seeing it, and my first thought was, 'This just isn't right,"' says Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager. 
 Phillips is speaking at a moment of relative calm, in his office at the Mets' spring training complex in Port St. Lucie, Fla., with players limbering up nearby for a morning workout. Renewal is in the warm, breezy air, as it always is in baseball at this time, but for Phillips, a rising executive in a transforming business, a climax is imminent. Now entering his third full season -- which begins this week with the Mets traveling to Tokyo for two games against the Chicago Cubs -- as the team's chief architect, Phillips has earned a reputation around baseball as something of a shopaholic, and a gifted one. Only eight of the major-league players he inherited when he assumed his post in July 1997 are still in the organization, and the core players of last year's team -- the catcher Mike Piazza, the third baseman Robin Ventura, the starting pitcher Al Leiter and the power relief pitcher Armando Benitez, who led the Mets into post-season play for the first time since 1988, are all Phillips acquisitions. Still, his contract expires at the end of the year, and before they renew it, the owners are waiting to see how the Mets, with Phillips's latest renovations, perform.
This winter, in a frenzy of trades and free-agent signings -- some completely unforeseen, like the trade with Houston that brought Mike Hampton to New York, a No. 1 starting pitcher (an ace, in age-old parlance) -- Phillips has redesigned last year's near-miss team. Seven players from last October, more than a quarter of the roster, are gone.
It has all been in the service of an iffy proposition that illustrates the increasingly pressurized dynamics of the general manager's job -- making sure that the Mets' fortunes this year will not hang on a single errant pitch. And it has all taken place amid a lingering buzz of organizational tension and in the shadow of the crosstown Yankees, whose three world championships in four years have made them the sporting kings of New York.
"As dramatic as everything was for us to get to that point, and for a bases-loaded walk to end the season, it wasn't right," Phillips says again, only to discard the past with his next breath. "At that point it was, 'O.K., what's the plan, Steve?"'
In the 1960's and early 1970's, when artificial turf and domed stadiums began to appear, when the pitcher's mound was lowered and the umpires began their steady shrinkage of the strike zone and when the designated-hitter rule took effect in the American League, baseball's evolution, for good or ill, was on the field. Since the advent of player free agency and salary arbitration in the mid-1970's, however, the game has changed far more significantly in the front office.
The economic advantages enjoyed by large-market teams, provided mostly by local broadcast rights, has widened the divide between wealthy and penny-pinching franchises. At the same time, soaring payrolls have made each big-ticket player's signing more of a risk and made owners more attentive to the operations of their ball clubs. Five years ago, the Mets' player payroll was about $13 million; this year it is close to $90 million. That the business of baseball is a dicey one, dependent more than ever on winning, is evident in that although the Mets drew 2.8 million fans last year, the most in a decade, the club made a profit with only the revenues from its post-season games.
Now just 36, Steve Phillips is representative of a generation of executives who have emerged in response to these developments, refining the role of the general manager; it is their job, simply put, to allot the owners' resources wisely. It is a less powerful post than it was but more accountable, less wide-ranging but in the minutiae of wheeling and dealing with 29 other general managers and dozens of player agents more complex and indisputably under more scrutiny by fans and reporters, especially in New York.
In 1986, the year of the last Met championship, the general manager at the time, Frank Cashen, who oversaw not only the team's player personnel dealings but also the marketing of the club, the stadium operations and the legal affairs, said that with his generalized skills, he could run a dairy as well as a baseball team. No general manager in baseball could say the same today.
"I remember when I was an administrative assistant on the club and I'd be in the general manager's box during the game," Phillips says. "And Frank and Al Harazin" -- Cashen's former assistant, who was, briefly and disastrously, his successor -- would be reading books. And they'd be talking about them and about things going on in the world. The guys today, I don't think we could do that. We know about baseball. We talk about that. And about our families."
Well spoken and reporter friendly, Phillips looks his age -- young, that is -- in spite of the frost that has begun to sprinkle his light hair. A compact man who carries himself with the ease of an ex-athlete, he is a former infielder who reached the Double A level in the Met organization before hitting the ceiling of his talent and reluctantly leaving the game to go into business. But he has no formal business training; his undergraduate degree, from the University of Michigan, is in psychology. Ten years ago, just before he was hired by the Mets as an assistant to the team's scouting and minor-league directors, beginning a rapid rise through the ranks, he was working for the Maritz Motivation Company in St. Louis, designing and selling worker-incentive programs to American corporations.
"I thought too much, overanalyzed, changed my stance every at bat," Phillips says, explaining his limitations as a player. (It was Yogi Berra who most succinctly expressed baseball's delicious mind-body problem: "You can't hit and think at the same time.") "When I struck out, it wasn't just that out, it was the 50 before. My temperament is better suited for the front office than for playing." Player-gained savvy is an obvious advantage in his current post, and in that sense he is a descendant of one line of traditional baseball executives. But it is Phillips's apprenticeship in the front office (he has also served as the Mets' minor-league director and assistant general manager), essentially a business degree that baseball as a whole is only just beginning to offer, that makes his resume so contemporary.
His first job included keeping detailed inventory of all the costs associated with running the Met farm system, from player salaries to new pitching machines; he has learned baseball value, both on the field and on the bottom line, which is how value is measured today. Players aren't just players anymore; they're also money. A long-term player contract can amount to a mortgage on a franchise. "I get buyer's remorse after every deal," Phillips says. But even so, he has a reputation for guts, which has, among other things, endeared him to players who don't ordinarily deal with the general manager except at contract time.
"He's not afraid to make a deal, and that's big," says Leiter, who was displaced by Hampton as the leader of the starting rotation. "A lot of G.M.'s are afraid to pull the trigger, because it's their neck on the line."
Guts are only half of it. Here, for example, is Phillips on the recently concluded contract for Armando Benitez, a powerful relief pitcher entering, at 27, the prime of his career. Benitez had filed for arbitration for this year's salary -- meaning the team and the player submit salary proposals, and an independent official chooses one, based on an estimation of what players of similar value are making -- because negotiations for a four-year agreement had stalled.
The problem was that during the first year of the four, the so-called arbitration year, the salary was to be based on his past accomplishments; for the following three years, which would be his free-agent years if he did not sign now, the Mets had to negotiate based on speculation of his future market value. "They're two different animals," Phillips says. "So we started by trying to agree on his value for the three free-agent years, assuming he has good seasons as a closer, and worked backward from that, and negotiated the arbitration year. Then, once we agreed on the total package, we negotiated how we could slice it up in a structure that satisfied both sides."
The result was a $22 million deal over four years, with salaries of $3.25 million, $5.625 million, $5.625 million and $6.75 million, plus a $750,000 signing bonus, a third of which will be paid out each of the next three years.
"There are some tax breaks for guys who take a signing bonus instead of a salary," Phillips says. "And in 2002 there is some question about a strike or a lockout, and he wanted some money coming in just in case."
Compared with, say, Mariano Rivera of the Yankees, a top closer who lost his arbitration case this spring but still received $7.25 million, Benitez is, from the Mets' perspective, a reasonable risk who could develop into a great bargain. "If he gets 40 saves this year and helps us win the World Series, imagine what his free-agent value would be," Phillips says.
And here is Phillips on horse-trading, discussing a complicated deal from the fall of 1998, meant to unload a declining outfielder, Bernard Gilkey, and his two-year, $11 million contract. That season the Mets had acquired Mike Piazza from the Florida Marlins, and in the weeks before the Gilkey deal had signed the All Star catcher to a seven-year, $91 million contract.
"We thought Gilkey was going to be tough to trade after the season he'd had," Phillips says, "but we found a place to send him, Arizona, where we could get two players for the same money. We got Willie Blair, a pitcher, and George Fabregas, a catcher, and we thought we could get lucky with one or the other."
In the end, instead of overpaying Gilkey, the Mets wound up with two inexpensive minor leaguers. "We traded Blair to Detroit for Joe Randa, and we didn't want Randa," Phillips says. "We just wanted out from under Blair's money, so we traded Randa to Kansas City for Juan LeBron, a prospect. Then we traded Fabregas to the Marlins for another prospect because they needed a front-line catcher. It was all about moving money."
Fred Wilpon, the Mets' president and with Nelson Doubleday the team's co-owner, is unequivocal in his support of Phillips, in word if not yet entirely in deed. "I respect his responsibility; I don't tell him who to pick as a baseball player," Wilpon says. In fact, the owners have never nixed a deal Phillips proposed to them. But Wilpon and Phillips speak nearly every day -- I try to help him in terms of framing the business situation," Wilpon says. Asked if he and Doubleday are more hands-on owners than they used to be, he responds: "Yes, that's fair to say. We have someone who is young chronologically who is running our team. On the other hand, he had seven years in our system as a player and seven more coming through the ranks. Practically all of his working life has been in this organization."
Most pointedly, both Phillips and the Mets' on-field manager, Bobby Valentine, have contracts that expire after the 2000 season, and the owners have explicitly declined to extend them. That nonvote of confidence has inspired much speculation. One theory is that the owners, partners for 20 years but winners of only one World Series, now feel they have spent enough money and expect their manager and general manager to deliver a championship. Another is that a sale of the team is imminent and the owners do not want to saddle prospective buyers with contracts for leaders they haven't chosen. While denying that he is planning to sell, Wilpon does acknowledge that he and Doubleday have entertained offers for at least part of the team.
On baseball's organizational turbulence meter, the mets are not quite the Bronx Zoo Yankees of the Billy Martin-Reggie Jackson-George Steinbrenner era, but compared with the smooth and staid Yankees of today the Mets are a veritable riot. And indeed, the Braves' final 10-9 victory in October -- a game that saw the Mets fall behind 5-0, recoup and eventually take the lead in the top of the eighth only to lose it again in the bottom -- cemented the Mets' image as baseball's leading melodramatists.
Last year's loopy and improbable events included the firing of three coaches in midseason that launched a swivel in team fortunes; a late-September seven-game losing streak that threatened a seemingly assured playoff spot, followed by a four-game winning streak to close out the year, including a one-game playoff with the Cincinnati Reds; and an authoritative whupping of the Arizona Diamondbacks in the first round of playoffs, which was followed by three consecutive losses to the Braves, followed by two heart-stopping wins and the final heart-rending loss.
In the meantime, two players -- Bobby Bonilla, now gone, and Rickey Henderson -- irritated management and fans alike with their seemingly selfish indifference in the heat of battle. Valentine courted personal disaster by declaring, in the midst of the September losing streak, that he should be fired if the Mets didn't make the post-season.
And then there were rumors that Wilpon and Doubleday were at odds. And that Valentine, a tightly wound, ego-driven man, was chafing under the younger Phillips, particularly after Phillips's decision in June, with the team floundering, to dismiss two pitching coaches, Bob Apodaca and Randy Niemann, and a batting coach, Tom Robson. Many had expected Valentine would be the one fired, and though Phillips's surprising move saved the manager's job, there was, both men acknowledge, a tense confrontation over it -- I had gone to battle with those guys," Valentine says -- and it is hard to argue with the results. The Mets won 40 of their next 55 games. (And Robson, oddly enough, was rehired in the off-season.)
"I can look back now and understand it a lot more than I could that day," Valentine says. "We won a lot of games after that, so I won't play the village idiot and say it was the wrong thing to do."
The two men still assess each other warily; you could see it on the Port St. Lucie practice field, as each man strolled about on his own, never quite crossing paths. "When you're getting the job done, which is your first concern, the friendship thing doesn't quite equate," Valentine says. But they are not without mutual respect. Phillips praises Valentine's gifts as a teacher and game strategist, while Valentine appreciates Phillips's preparation and attention to detail in personnel matters. "I wouldn't be a G.M. with a bag of gold and a gun held to my head," he says.
Phillips, who is married with two children, was himself at the center of a bizarre team crisis. In November 1998, he took a "voluntary" leave of absence after admitting to adultery in the wake of a threatened sexual harassment charge. His return was announced in a news conference that included a confession and apology by Phillips. It was all an extraordinary spectacle that still strikes many as an unnecessary public flogging. Phillips, who has undergone counseling and by all accounts has begun to repair the damage to his family, declines to talk about any of it.
Wilpon says that Phillips was never in danger of being fired, provided he followed through on a promise to seek help, and he reinstated Phillips after only eight days. Asked why he has not extended Phillips's and Valentine's contracts, Wilpon gives a baseball answer. "People sign a contract and they get a certain amount of security for a certain job. There's a beginning and an end to that. Maybe it's going to be helpful to Bobby and to Steve -- to all of us -- to be accountable. I expect us to be a contending team."
One observer who would be very surprised should the Mets jettison Phillips is Scott Boras, the powerful player agent who at the end of the year will be seeking a contending team and a stable organization for his free-agent client -- Seattle's shortstop, Alex Rodriguez, who may be the game's brightest young star. "I think Steve has a dynamic about him that is really important to the Mets," Boras says. "He's experienced in three ways. First, he has pursued the big deal and landed it, and he has the confidence to do it again. Second, he has dealt with New York, professionally and personally, and has come out on top. Third, he knows what he's doing; he's credible."
Phillips's credibility is precisely what the Mets' season will measure. This winter, his plan was to augment the pitching staff, which is almost every team's priority every off-season, and to mend a hole in baseball's best infield after the team's stylish, free-agent first baseman, John Olerud, signed to play in his hometown, Seattle. "We also wanted to add a little more thump to our outfield," Phillips said. "We had pretty good production, but we had three guys out there -- Henderson, Hamilton and Roger Cedeno -- who didn't drive the ball as much as they got on base."
Unlike the Atlanta Braves, with their great starting rotation, or the Cleveland Indians, with their potent offense and stingy bullpen, the Mets have been stellar in neither their starting pitchers nor their closers. SaysPhillips: "The strategy is that the game isn't necessarily won in the first innings or the last, but over nine innings. So we've tried to maintain a high level of consistency, 1 through 12, among our pitchers. But now Benitez has come on and made us better at the back end, and Hampton makes us stronger at the front, without compromising the consistency we'd built."
Indeed, the Mets' collection of midgame relievers, including John Franco, Pat Mahomes, Turk Wendell and Dennis Cook, is probably baseball's most effective group. "Starters used to get you to the eighth, and you'd bring in a closer, a guy who could go two innings," Phillips says. "Then there really weren't any two-inning guys any more, and now it's more specialized still. In my opinion, you need a seventh-, an eighth- and a ninth-inning guy now."
Still, even with the acquisition of Hampton, the starting staff has questions. Only three of the five starters -- Leiter, Rick Reed and Bobby J. Jones -- remain from last season. Rogers, a free agent who was seeking a four-year, $8-million-a-year deal, is gone.
"We considered it," Phillips says. "That wasn't the best use of our $8 million, in my view, and it would have been tough to bring him back to start a multiyear deal when you know the first time he takes the mound he's going to get booed." (Rogers eventually signed with Texas for three years at $7.5 million annually.)
Masato Yoshii, another starting pitcher, is also gone, traded to Colorado for a lesser pitcher, Bobby M. Jones. This was a money trade -- Yoshii, at 34, was making $3 million. But Phillips was working on another deal for a younger pitcher whom the Mets liked for his sinker and the modest contract he already had signed for the next two years.
If that deal had gone through -- it didn't, and for that reason Phillips could be in violation of baseball's tampering rules if the player's name were publicly revealed -- there would have been no room for Yoshii on the staff, and he would be more difficult to trade for significant value in return because other teams would recognize the Mets' desperation. Meanwhile, Phillips was busy acquiring four other pitchers -- Bill Pulsipher, Jesse Orosco, Glendon Rusch and Rich Rodriguez -- overstocking the larder with baseball's rarest commodity, left arms. The Mets have nine lefties with major-league experience, too many to squeeze onto the roster but potentially useful as bait for a future trade.
In any event, it was easier to part with Yoshii after Hampton was signed. In this case, Phillips took advantage of the Mets' willingness to spend for a championship and the leverage that star players now wield in shaping their own careers. And he still needed a little luck. Hampton, entering the last year of his contract -- he'll be paid $5.75 million this year -- was afraid that if he signed an expensive, long-term contract with Houston, the team, with its midrange budget, would be unable to afford to pay the other quality players needed to win a title, so he asked to be traded to a contender.
At first, the Mets were not in the running; Houston wanted a shortstop as part of the deal. But then the Astros landed a young shortstop, Adam Everett, in a deal with Boston. It finally worked, however, because the Mets were willing to relieve the Astros of Derek Bell, an outfielder who slumped last year but was nonetheless earning $5 million annually. In exchange, the Mets gave up Octavio Dotel, a promising but unproven pitcher, and Roger Cedeno, a speedy outfielder who will replace the center fielder Houston gave up in the deal for their new shortstop.
"We took $10.75 million and gave back about $2.5 million," Phillips says.
The off-season's other key development was the departure -- not unexpected -- of Olerud. He and his wife had had their first child since he signed his last contract, in 1998, and though the Mets matched the Mariners' initial salary offer and offered to fly both sets of grandparents to New York several times during the year, Olerud defected. "John was our No. 1 priority, but we knew it was 50-50 and we knew it wasn't going to be about money," Phillips says. "That was refreshing. It would've been more refreshing if he'd chosen to come back."
Still, Phillips had already been shopping and within a week signed Todd Zeile, a free agent from the Texas Rangers. Other first basemen were available, and Zeile, a third baseman by trade, is not likely to be the anchor of the Mets infield that Olerud was. But Phillips liked the way Zeile fit in the Met lineup. Olerud hits for better average; Zeile hits more homers. But that is just a shard of the comparison.
"We are a work-the-count kind of offense," Phillips says. "We take pitches deep into the count, so we focus on pitches per plate appearance, which translates into on-base percentage, which translates into runs scored. Olerud is a significant loss, because of his on-base percentage, which was .427 last year. Zeile's isn't that high -- he was at .354 -- but the interesting thing is he actually sees more pitches per plate appearance. What that means is that at 3-1, 3-2, he's swinging. He's an R.B.I. guy -- he drove in 98 runs last year hitting sixth or seventh in the order.
"John was an on-base percentage guy. He drove in 96 with two guys in front of him with over .400 on-base averages. He walked 125 times. One of the things I think is that even without John, we're going to have a significant number of guys on base, and that a guy who swings more will drive in more runs. So we've changed our offense a little that way, but without letting the opposing pitcher off the hook by letting him do less work."
The loss of Cedeno has cost the Mets their leading base-stealer; and unlike Olerud, Zeile hits right-handed, leaving the Mets with a starting lineup lopsided to starboard. To solve those problems, Phillips wanted to secure a left-handed-hitting outfielder. Ken Griffey Jr., their notorious first choice, snubbed them and then forced his old team, Seattle, to send him to Cincinnati, where his father is a coach.
It remains to be seen whether the addition of Hampton will compensate for the loss of Yoshii, Rogers and Dotel, and Phillips still wouldn't mind trading for a proven starter from a weaker team that is seeking to unload salary: Brad Radke of the Twins, for example. Still, the Braves have lost John Smoltz, a leading starting pitcher, to injury, and the lingering ill will from the racist comments of their closer, John Rocker, will not help team chemistry. Barring injuries of their own, the Mets are well positioned to unseat Atlanta as the long-reigning champions of the National League and to challenge the Yankees for primacy in the world -- and even more important, the city. As the games begin, Phillips says he is content with his winter.
"We're ready to go with the guys we've got," Phillips says. And if he feels any pressure at all, it wouldn't be like him to let on. Asked if the Mets are a championship-caliber team, he is unequivocal. "No question," he says. "There's no doubt about it."

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
Impresarios Working on the Fringe

BYLINE: By ERIC V. COPAGE; Eric V. Copage, a reporter for the City Weekly section of The New York Times, writes about culture.

 BODY:
LIMOR TOMER, a Juilliard-trained pianist and former music history teacher at New York University, descended into the dim light of the basement of Two Boots, an East Village pizzeria. For the last two years, the owners of the pizzeria had used the basement, called the Den, sporadically for video nights and private parties. But now Ms. Tomer, walking around the 500-square-foot space, was evaluating it for her own use.
She looked at the size of the sound board, the size and quality of the speakers and the postage stamp-size stage in the corner, then smiled. "The room holds 50 people, but it has a comfortable vibe," Ms. Tomer said recently. "It is completely open. It doesn't say drum-and-bass or jazz or classical. So anything could be played in it." 
 These days, in the brave world of new music in New York, versatility is the key word. Ms. Tomer is one of a small but avid group of advocates who are presenting music that falls between the cracks of genres. It is music that won't fill 600-seat auditoriums but may be the wellspring for mainstream music to come. Call Ms. Tomer and her ilk downtown Diaghilevs, mini-impresarios, or settle for a less grandiose term, music curator. Regardless, while they usually work on a small scale, what they do is hugely important to the artistic soul of New York. In an environment in which culture is straitjacketed and niche-marketed at warp speed, they are keeping in circulation its most precious artistic currencies: experimentation, risk taking and innovation.
Some of these edgy impresarios have a steady venue; some are peripatetic and, like sonic Johnny Appleseeds, move from church to cafe to bar to basement, as well as smaller traditional venues throughout the city, to find places for unfamiliar, often challenging, music. They differ from nightclub bookers in that they are not primarily trying to fill up a space. They differ from the typical concert producer in that they are not merely signing up an artist. They are on a personal mission: exposing others to the music about which they are enthusiastic. Even when the music is not hard to classify -- like German lieder or chamber music -- they are putting that familiar music in unfamiliar places, and thereby cross-pollinating audiences.
George Steel, who is the executive director of the 685-seat Miller Theater at Columbia University, also uses smaller venues downtown. "It's a wonderful period of transition in terms of instrumentation, in terms of the amount of improvisation," he said. Mr. Steel recently presented a concert by the chamber group the Absolute Ensemble at the Flea, a 75-seat theater in TriBeCa. It featured a chamber transcription of the Mahler Fourth Symphony with a part for a Yamaha DX7 electronic keyboard.
He presented the concert at the Flea because, he said, "you can grab a beer and go into the theater."
"The social pressure is off the audience to behave in the usual prom-night fashion."
Mr. Steel's next downtown adventure will be in July, when he presents contemporary classical music at the Cornelia St. Cafe in Greenwich Village.
David Linton, a composer specializing in electronic music, has a somewhat different approach to curating. His idea is that presentations should be a cross between a party and a concert, a kind of aswitched-on Lilith Fair, without the feminist slant. The artists in his shows specialize in electronically generated sounds, ranging from techno to Morton Subotnick-like sheets of sound. Mr. Linton has put on shows in places like Context Studios, a performance space, and the basement lounge at CBGB's, both in the East Village, as well 168 Bar in Chinatown. His SoHo loft was the original home of Sound Lab, an underground club for electronic music. His latest curatorial project, Unity Gain, a series of freewheeling works by composers, will be presented the first Wednesday of every month at Galapagos, a bar and gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Some of the composers will show up at virtually every presentation, and others will participate less frequently, resulting in a mix of new and old music so that audiences will never know exactly what to expect.
This mixing and blending of musics and audiences stems from several factors. An increasing number of musicians feel at home in more than one musical genre. Even a musician devoted to classical music, for instance, cannot escape the dissonant harmonies that are frequently found in movie soundtracks or the African music played in the background music at an upscale coffee shop. Yet audiences seem increasingly segmented, as record companies and concert promoters stream performers into a given niche. "People into one thing tend not to cross over into another thing," said Ms. Tomer, who also curates three nights a week for the BAM cafe at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and organizes a monthly series of classical music at Joe's Pub at the Public Theater in the East Village.
Another reason for the growing segmentation is the price of tickets. When $20 to $25 tickets are the cheapest seats, everybody, musician, curator and institution alike, can feel the creeping conservatism higher ticket prices might inspire. Conversely, when the entrance fee is about the same as a movie ticket, musicians and curators feel freer to experiment. Of course, artists dedicated to their art will eventually find places to perform, especially in today's New York City, where a booming economy has put a new performance nook on nearly every block. But through their passion, these music curators facilitate exposure. Many are performers or former performers who see their role as advocating and nurturing colleagues rather than merely pushing acts.
The phenomenon of music curating in New York can be traced back, if not to the prewar Copland-Sessions concerts, then at least to 1960, when the composer La Monte Young ran a series of concerts in Yoko Ono's Chambers Street loft. In 1971, Rhys Chatham became the first curator at the Kitchen, an alternative performance space then in Soho. And while curators like Phill Niblock, who runs the Experimental Intermedia concerts, Thomas Buckner of the Interpretations Series and Jim Staley of Roulette have been active for decades, today's curators face vastly different challenges. For years, there was little interest from the uptown crowd. But today happenings downtown travel uptown at warp speed. NBC recently opened a theater space called P.S. NBC at the Here Arts Center in SoHo, one of the city's leading alternative theatrical spaces. The purpose? To scout talent for the network.
Similarly, over the last several years mainstream music institutions have noted the increased openness of their audiences and taken steps to exploit it. Lincoln Center has used its summer festival to explore fringier territory like "The Electronic Ordo Virtutum," a new interpretation of Hildegard von Bingen's 12th-century proto opera. Likewise, it has turned to smaller venues -- the 600-seat John Jay College Theater and the 500-seat New Victory Theater -- to present more experimental productions during its regular season. Carnegie Hall is also building a more flexible setting for music, the Judy and Arthur Zankel Hall, to expand the kinds of programming it presents.
Will today's music curators and their close relationships with artists be ennobled by alliances with larger institutions, given greater budgets and more freedom? Or will they be made virtually obsolete, gobbled up by mainstream venues? The betting is that there will always be lofts, bars and living rooms where people working in what will always be the no man's land of experimental music will gather. There will always be those who take joy in seeking out relationships with fringe artists, and midwifing a musician from obscurity to an appreciative audience.
It's late after a performance at Ms. Tomer's Saturday Balkan Cabaret at the Den at Two Boots. The musicians are packing, but the audience is still lingering -- talking, basking in the reverberations of the music. Asked what she would do if the music she is so passionate about suddenly went mainstream, Ms. Tomer knitted her brow and offered an idealistic response: "If what I am interested in becomes popular enough to support itself, if it creates enough momentum to garner bigger institutions, then I am gone. I will go on to the next uncharted area."

HEADLINE: A Great Orchestra Dancing Past the Graveyard

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
DVORAK HALL in the Rudolfinum, the home of the Czech Philharmonic on a crook of Smetana's Moldau River, is, like this city itself, a small treasure. The stage, below a commanding pipe organ, projects into an auditorium mutedly colorful in grays and tans. Magnificent columns, beginning at balcony level, tower above on three sides, giving a sense of height and grandeur. That upper chamber provides light, from high windows during the day and chandeliers at night, and a rich, reverberant acoustic.
But the overriding impression occurs at orchestra level, where the room seems a jewel box, with elegantly decorated walls snugly enclosing most of the 1,000 seats, and that impression is one of smallness and intimacy. (Alice Tully Hall, by comparison, has 1,100 seats.) One of fragility, even, for how can a historically great international orchestra continue to function in the highly charged world economy of a new century from such a tiny, antiquated base? 
 In fact, the size of the hall, which was completed in 1885, used by the Parliament of Czechoslovakia from 1919 to 1939 and beautifully reconstructed from 1989 to 1992, may be the least of the orchestra's problems. For one thing, the Philharmonic spends relatively little time there. Like many other financially challenged performing-arts institutions in the emerging capitalist nations of Eastern Europe, the Czech Philharmonic has found the grass greener abroad. It performs about half of its 100 or so concerts a year on the road.
This afternoon, led by its chief conductor, Vladimir Ashkenazy, the orchestra gives the first of three concerts at Avery Fisher Hall, having just completed two weeks of touring in Florida and California. These concerts, the Philharmonic's first in New York since 1996, present mostly Bohemian or Czech music and are part of Lincoln Center's Prague Festival, which celebrates the 10th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, a few months past. The festival began yesterday with a symposium on Prague's rich cultural history.
Touring is far from the whole solution, however, and not only because of the wear and tear it exacts on players and staff. As a state institution in a nation embroiled in an awkward transition to a market economy, the Czech Philharmonic has suffered a drastic reduction in subsidies in recent years but still labors under burdensome restrictions on how it can raise money and spend what it raises. It cannot, for example, unilaterally increase the salaries of players, who by any reasonable standard are cruelly underpaid.
Crisis, to be sure, is nothing new to the Czech Philharmonic, which was formed by members of the National Theater Opera Orchestra and gave its first concert in 1896, conducted by Antonin Dvorak in the Rudolfinum. Indeed, the second chapter in a published history of the Philharmonic is titled "Krize," with reference to a strike that resulted in the dismissal of the players by the theater in 1901 and the establishment of a shaky independent organization.
Yet through it all, including artistic misdirections compounding the financial woes of the last decade, the orchestra has maintained not only an excellent standard of performance but also something of its local character: a particularly rustic, woody cluck in the woodwinds, incisive playing from the brasses, a dark depth to the strings. The woodwinds are notable more for the individuality of their colors than for their blend. If any orchestra dances better, it can only be the Vienna Philharmonic, which may at the moment have more reason to do so. All this, at least, to judge from limited recent experience: two concerts and a rehearsal in Dvorak Hall, including repertory to be performed in New York.

THE characteristic sound of an orchestra, in many instances already a casualty of the jet age and the resultant interchangeability of players as well as maestros, is something that seems to worry critics and connoisseurs these days more than conductors. Engaged around the globe and at least marginally influenced by recent notions of period performance practice, conductors tend to prefer versatility: a shifting sonority appropriate in weight and coloration to the composer or work in question rather than a sound boasting local color. Mr. Ashkenazy is no exception.
"They are aware of their sound," he said of the Czech players. "But the repertory requires a certain type of sound. That's why more and more orchestras sound the same. Maybe there's some kind of margin where you can retain a certain sound and still play the repertory as it should be played."
Mr. Ashkenazy, at 62, is the ultimate musical cosmopolite. He left Russia in 1963 as an acclaimed pianist and now lives near Lucerne, Switzerland, with his family. After stints as principal guest conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra, music director of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London and chief conductor of the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra (now the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin), he took over the Czech Philharmonic in 1998, picking up after a series of podium misadventures.
In 1991, the players, newly free to elect their leaders, voted to hire Gerd Albrecht as principal conductor rather than extend the contract of Jiri Belohlavek, who had taken over the year before. Mr. Albrecht, a German, thus became the first non-Czech maestro in the Philharmonic's storied history. The orchestra's fame was built and sustained during the long, successive tenures of four conductors, each a major figure internationally: Vaclav Talich from 1918 to 1934, Rafael Kubelik to 1950, Karel Ancerl to 1968 and Vaclav Neumann to 1990.
Part of the players' thinking about Mr. Albrecht, apparently, was that with his international contacts, he would attract more recording projects for the orchestra. But as it happened, the classical-record business was on the verge of a worldwide meltdown. Mr. Albrecht, who took over in 1993 after Mr. Belohlavek's angry exit, himself resigned in a fit of pique in 1996. Although no one would say much about Mr. Albrecht's term or his departure, the circumstances were obviously not happy.
"There were two camps," said Petr Kristian, a veteran violinist, "half and half." Mr. Albrecht, who had done much Czech music with the orchestra before, including Dvorak operas, suddenly seemed less interested in it, and some players are said to have found him highhanded in manner.
"It was destructive for the orchestra when he left in the middle of his contract," Mr. Ashkenazy said. After Mr. Albrecht's departure, the gap was filled jointly by Vladimir Valek, Sir Charles Mackerras and Ken-Ichiro Kobayashi. Mr. Valek, as permanent guest conductor, led tours celebrating the orchestra's centennial, including one in the United States in 1996. Mr. Ashkenazy first conducted the orchestra in 1997.
In his own conducting career, Mr. Ashkenazy ran into a situation in 1994 somewhat like Mr. Belohlavek's. Without consulting Mr. Ashkenazy, the Royal Philharmonic, which he had led since 1986 and with which he had open-ended plans extending to 1997, made an offer to a successor, Daniele Gatti. Mr. Ashkenazy resigned immediately.
Though widely experienced by now, he has not yet achieved the universal respect as a podium technician or interpreter that he enjoys as a pianist. (He will be heard in both functions tomorrow evening, playing and conducting Mozart's great D minor Concerto.) But many players respond to his innate musicality, evidently the Czechs among them.
"He is a good musician," said Jaroslav Halir, a young trumpeter. Mr. Kristian seconded that opinion, adding that Mr. Ashkenazy, because of his Slavic Russian roots, is sympathetic to the orchestra's tradition and style. (Mr. Ashkenazy rehearses the orchestra in English, when, that is, the musical terminology itself is not Italian.)
And he offers advantages beyond his musicianship. "With his connections, he can bring in many soloists and good conductors," Kr. Kristian said. "The level has improved in the last two years.
Another invaluable asset, not unrelated: Mr. Ashkenazy has brought along his powerful manager, Jasper Parrott, who is based in London. Mr. Parrott, a longtime friend and collaborator of the conductor's, wrote the biography "Ashkenazy: Beyond Frontiers" in 1985 with Mr. Ashkenazy's help. Mr. Parrott's father, Cecil Parrott, was the British ambassador to Czechoslovakia from 1960 to 1966, a writer about music, the author of a biography of Jaroslav Hasek and a translator of Hasek's "Good Soldier Svejk."
Mr. Parrott has been using his own diplomatic and managerial skills on the orchestra's behalf. For one thing, he is working with Mr. Ashkenazy for changes in legislation and governmental regulations.
"The Czech Republic is in some ways worse off, because it started out better," Mr. Parrott said of the various Eastern European countries still adjusting to life after Communism. "The attempt to liberalize after the revolution was largely a fraud. It sort of avoided problems and made things look good. Five years ago everything hit the buffers, and it became clear how little fundamental reform there had been. The Poles made much more rational reforms, and now Hungary has, too.
"It is difficult for institutions in the Czech Republic to benefit from entrepreneurial activities. Museums and performing-arts institutions are treated in the same way as everybody else, and they've all done badly. It's sort of equal misery for everybody, so nobody has gone bust."
Mr. Parrott has also been helping the orchestra's administration -- the managing director, Jiri Kovar, and the new intendant, Eva Sedlakova -- develop a modern management style based on Western models. The Czech Philharmonic administers the Rudolfinum as a whole, with its performance halls and art gallery. Mr. Kovar was said to be occupied with legal matters during a reporter's brief visit and thus unavailable. Ms. Sedlakova was put forward as the one who runs the orchestra day to day.
For an American, nosing around in the Czech Philharmonic's finances is depressing business. The overall institution's annual budget amounts to less than $4 million. The players' average salary, Ms. Sedlakova said, is 12,000 Czech crowns a month, which comes to about $4,000 a year. Although comparisons at such a level are almost beside the point, the average salary in the Vienna Philharmonic was said last year to be $59,000, and the starting salary in top American orchestras hovers near six digits.
The Czech players' average salary corresponds to that of the citizenry as a whole and is regulated to do so. "The budget for salaries is fixed," Ms. Sedlakova said. "It is not possible to increase salaries even for very good players."
State subsidies have declined steadily to about $1.3 million a year. "The subsidy now covers one-third of the budget," Ms. Sed lakova said, "and we still have the same regulations as if it were subsidized 100 percent." Sponsorship from corporations like the Investment and Postal Bank and Skoda Auto amounts to perhaps $300,000. The rest has to be earned through ticket sales and tours.
At least the players do not have to buy their own instruments. They may use those of the institution, and Ms. Sedlakova said the majority do. The players stand to make additional money by moonlighting, playing chamber music or recording film music, and Mr. Kristian said all do. A few, he added, also teach.
Still, the sums are pathetic, and even given a relatively low cost of living in Prague, such a scale puts the orchestra at a clear disadvantage in the international market for top musicians. Of the 120 players, Mr. Ashkenazy said, only one is not Czech, and that one is Slovakian. Here, to find a silver lining, is a reason the orchestra has been able to retain some of its old character.
And its old habits. Only five players are women: three violinists, who joined the orchestra in recent years, and (the classic dodge) two harpists. "It totally changed the atmosphere of the orchestra when women came in," Ms. Sedlakova said, declining to elaborate much. "It just changed. The building is not built to separate men and women. There are few rooms."
The difficulty in attracting players from outside the Czech Republic has by no means been killing, obviously, since native players have been good enough to lift the orchestra to its present level. The worse problem is the converse: keeping the best Czech players from accepting foreign opportunities, which are sure to increase when the Czech Republic enters the European Union, perhaps in 2003. Mr. Ashkenazy cited the case of a young Czech horn player who eluded the orchestra's grasp, which he fears may become typical.
"It is not yet destructive, but it might be," he said. "The playing itself is still at a very high level, but the morale is not so good. The players sit there with their arms folded, thinking we will do something for them, because that's the way it was under Communism."
Mr. Ashkenazy seems to be trying his best to help. "It takes a lot of time and energy meeting with important people to find solutions, meeting with this minister, that minister," he said. "But if we ever get to the point where we can do with our money what we like, then we'll be all right."

ALTHOUGH no one would specify Mr. Ashkenazy's salary, Mr. Parrott said that "his fees are substantially below his international level, but they are at least honorable." He is maintaining most of the busy schedule to which he was already committed elsewhere before coming to the aid of the orchestra. He spends six or seven weeks a season with the Czech Philharmonic in Prague, he said, and another six or seven weeks on tour.
"It would be nice if he could be here more," Ms. Sedlakova said. She pointed out that although he had not yet taken part in player auditions, in which he is supposed to have a vote, she hoped he might make one next month for an opening in the horn section.
"But when he is here he does his utmost," she added. "The time of conductors like Ancerl and Neumann is another world. Even if we had a very good Czech conductor, he would mostly be abroad. The main thing is to be in touch."
Mr. Ashkenazy says he hopes to spend more time in Prague, and he is not in any case trying to drum up new business. "I don't like to guest-conduct so much," said this most self-effacing maestro (if that is not in fact an oxymoron). "I'm too shy. I like to establish relationships." His contract with the Czech Philharmonic runs until next year, and an extension is being negotiated, doubtless with understandable caution on both sides.
"We mustn't be too pessimistic," Mr. Ashkenazy said of the many difficulties still ahead of him and the orchestra. "We can't predict everything. But it would be a shame to lose a great orchestra, because you might lose it."

HEADLINE: FILM;
Exploring the Farthest Edges of French Society

BYLINE: By NANCY RAMSEY; Nancy Ramsey's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about the Iranian director Majid Majidi.

 BODY:
DRESSED in a leather jacket and jeans, the director Claire Denis, whose latest film, "Beau Travail," opens on Friday, has a casual sophistication. At 49, she is petite, intense, reticent and, on occasion, disarmingly honest. Her voice is raspy but energetic, and in conversation she is at once very quick and very thoughtful. The daughter of a French civil servant, Ms. Denis grew up in Cameroon in West Africa during the final days of the colonial empire.
"Beau Travail" ("Good Work"), the story of a troop of French Foreign Legionnaires, is set in present-day Djibouti, in East Africa. "When I was a child, I was living in a landscape that I knew was not mine," Ms. Denis said one evening last September over a glass of red wine near Lincoln Center, where her film was screening as part of the New York Film Festival. "People have written that my being raised in Africa, growing up in a different culture, forever a foreigner, made me solitary. But I never suffered not to be raised in France. I liked this sharing of cultures. Of course it's an imposed sharing, but it opens your mind. My parents were teachers, and my father was militant for independence. One of my small memories of when I was a child was somebody immediately clearing away my plate at the table as soon as I was finished. My parents told me that wasn't normal." 
 "Chocolat" (1988), her critically acclaimed first film, is set in Cameroon and combines a spareness with a rich sensuality and texture. A shy little girl is tended to and served by a kind, strappingly handsome houseboy. Father is often away on business; sexual tension builds between mother and houseboy. Slow, languid days in the hot African sun coexist with the racial tensions about to explode under the harshness of colonial rule.
"In 'Chocolat,' I was trying to say something about the perversity of the colonial situation," said Ms. Denis, who now lives in Paris and who as a young filmmaker worked as an assistant to Wim Wenders, Jim Jarmusch and Costa-Gavras. "French colonialism was a little better," she said, and smiled. "Well, you know how French people are, they're always better." Her next features, "No Fear, No Die" (1990), "I Can't Sleep" (1993) and "Nenette and Boni" (1996), were set in France but on the margins of French society: the outskirts of Paris, the port city of Marseille. Populating the films are African guest workers, West Indian immigrants, disaffected adolescents, black-market businessmen who prey on the illegal immigrant community, all thrown together in rich tapestries. They move in and out of the street's night shadows, Ms. Denis's camera glancing off them at oblique angles, a visual metaphor for their tangential relationship to mainstream society. Sultry soundtracks are punctuated by the rhythms of reggae and disco. In describing "I Can't Sleep," in which a transvestite and his lover are killing old women in Paris, Caryn James noted in The New York Times that "it calmly lures viewers into an ordinary world where the sinister and the benign wear the same face."
Lives on the edge, moral ambiguity: making a film whose main characters are legionnaires seemed a logical next step. "When you join the legion, nobody remembers the past, even if you were in prison," Ms. Denis said. "It's a hard life, but it's also a protected life." With outposts in remote corners of the world, where strict discipline ruled, the legion developed a reputation as a haven for criminals and misfits.
"Remember Gary Cooper in 'Beau Geste'?" she asked. " 'Where would you go if you wanted to disappear completely?' " Ms. Denis first encountered the Foreign Legion not in Africa but in Paris, on the Champs-Elysees during a Bastille Day parade, and for her it was not the legion of criminals and misfits but of Edith Piaf's "Mon Legionnaire." ("He was thin/ He was fine," she trilled. "And the desire for his skin consumes me.") "The legionnaires' parade was very beautiful," Ms. Denis said. "They were very solemn and proud, they never mixed with the other soldiers."
Shortly before Christmas 1998, Ms. Denis, the cinematographer Agnes Godard (who has worked with her since "Chocolat" and is no relation to the director Jean-Luc Godard), and a small crew arrived in Djibouti and stayed five weeks. "We shot from morning to evening," Ms. Denis said. "Bringing along a generator would have meant bringing it by boat, so we used only natural light." The crew's equipment was spare: a truck, two tents and, for protection, 15 guns. Assistance came from Djibouti's Ministry of Culture and Army; according to Ms. Denis, the French Army was none too happy about the project.
"It was rather difficult to convince them that I was not going to make fun of the legion," Ms. Denis said.
"Beau Travail" is beautifully filmed, the dialogue is minimal and the military training sequences, under the scorching African sun with the sparkling blue Gulf of Aden in the background, are elaborately choreographed, often to the backdrop of Benjamin Britten's opera "Billy Budd." The story line, in fact, is based loosely on Herman Melville's allegorical novella, set in 1797 in the British Navy, in which an innocent sailor, Billy Budd, is destroyed by a petty officer, John Claggart.
In "Beau Travail," Sentain, a new recruit played by Gregoire Colin, arrives in Djibouti; he is young, fit and brave, and his sergeant, Galoup (Denis Lavant from Leos Carax's "Lovers on the Bridge"), becomes consumed with jealousy over him. Vowing to destroy Sentain, Galoup ends up destroying his own career.
On the surface, Galoup's story is not a sympathetic one. "It was up to me to make him someone I would like," Ms. Denis said. "I needed to be somewhere inside that character. I cannot be the one to judge. I always consider a character to be as anxious and fragile as I am. My link with Galoup, I suppose, is some kind of pathetic obligation to do well, to be loyal, to work hard as opposed to the search to be happy." Critics have noted Ms. Denis's striking empathy with her characters. "Some directors make films that are clearly for the elite," said Jean-Michel Frodon, who writes about film for Le Monde. "But Claire Denis does not make films from a superior position. She's also not somebody who lives only with her brain. She reacts to feelings and sensations.
"Many directors take a big red pen and draw arrows on the screen so that you know who is who and what is what, where it comes from, where it goes," he continued. "But Denis doesn't design characters that way. She does not twist the way things are just because it's more attractive. I think that the word that would define her is ethical."
Outside of directing, she was active in a movement launched by French film directors in early 1997 that worked on behalf of "sans papier," people without documents who were being threatened with deportation by the authorities. "She kept working on it after the media attention went away, when most of her colleagues went back to their usual business," Mr. Frodon said.
Ms. Denis's sense of justice applies as well to her casting choices. For the role of Bruno Forestier, the commander who presides over the troops in "Beau Travail," she chose Michel Subor. One of Mr. Subor's first roles as an actor was in Jean-Luc Godard's overtly political and seldom shown "Le Petit Soldat" (1960), a film made shortly after "Breathless." Its existentialist hero, Bruno Forestier, a young man trying to find his way in a Europe where good and evil were not so clear as during World War II, was an army deserter who was coerced by right-wing forces to assassinate a man fighting for the cause of Algerian independence.
" 'Petit Soldat' is one of my favorite movies ever, and I always considered Michel Subor's performance one of the best performances in a film," Ms. Denis said. "At the end, Forestier has killed a man, and he knows he cannot return to France."
And so Forestier, again played by Mr. Subor, appears, 40 years later, in Ms. Denis's Africa. "Working with Michel Subor was so moving, it's something I'll never forget," she said. "It was almost as if he had disappeared as an actor. Did you know he was the voice-over in 'Jules et Jim'? I hadn't seen him since he had a part in Hitchcock's 'Topaz.'
"As a young actor with Godard, he had such strength, and that's still with him. And Denis Lavant has this whole physical world within him."
"Beau Travail" begins and ends in Marseille, with a solitary Galoup recounting his tale in a narrative voice-over similar to Forestier's in "Petit Soldat." The last scene is set in a disco to the pulsing "Rhythm of the Night"; Stephen Holden, in The Times, called it "a frenzied Dionysian release." It is ambiguous, like much in Ms. Denis's films. "It was like an emotion I couldn't stop," she said. "The best explanation is that I wanted that scene and that's why it's there. The whole film is a kind of stew, a cuisine. 'Le Petit Soldat' is always in my mind; whenever I don't know what to do in a film, it's like a light for me. And I took from Melville what interested me.
"The innocence of Billy Budd, the role of law, that didn't interest me the most. I always found Claggart more interesting; he represents neither power nor innocence like me."

HEADLINE: Korea to Syosset: A 2-Generation Bridge

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW 

DATELINE: SYOSSET

 BODY:
THE manicurist at the first table in the busy nail salon remembers everything: the names of her regular customers, what colors they choose, whether they prefer their nails long or short, shaped square or round. As manager and a partner of Pinky Nails, she is known as Jane.
But after work every evening, during her 10-minute drive to her Hicksville apartment, she resumes her role as Jung S. Yoo, Korean immigrant, who even after 15 years living in the United States is still only comfortable when speaking Korean. 
 While customers at the salon insist she is fluent in English, Ms. Yoo does not share their confidence. "When I want to say something, it's hard for me to explain it in English," she said. "Sometimes I hear a new word and look it up, but by the next day, I forget it."
For Ms. Yoo, a new life in America began in 1985, when she moved from South Korea to Flushing with her husband and their nine-year-old son, Jong, who quickly became Americanized as "Dennis Kim" (his father's surname).
"I am part of what we call the 'one-point-five generation,' " said Mr. Kim, now 23 and a New York City police officer, who had stopped at Pinky Nails recently to take his mother to dinner for her birthday. "We call ourselves 1.5 because we are both Korean and American.
"My mother, coming from Korea as an adult, is part of the 1.0 generation. My mother understands the English of her customers, but if she watches the news on TV, she only understands part of it. Members of the 1.0 generation don't integrate that much with Americans."
As for the 1.5 generation, Mr. Kim explained: "Coming here as a kid, I had a tough time in the beginning, but I've found myself. I've learned to assimilate in both cultures and to distinguish which parts of me should be Korean and which American. I look Korean, but I'm American. When I'm with my Korean friends, we speak Korean; when I'm with my American friends, we speak English. My children, who will be born here, will be part of the 2.0 generation."
For the 1.0 generation, the decision to come to the United States was often motivated by enticing stories from friends and family already here. "My husband's family has been in New York since 1978," said Ms. Yoo. "But he was not as interested in coming here as I was. I couldn't wait to come to this exciting country."
But while her husband was greeted with a job at the midtown Manhattan deli where his brother worked, Ms. Yoo had to figure out what she could do in her new home. For Korean immigrants, the typical pattern is to follow in the footsteps of family or friends who have already found jobs, frequently in dry-cleaning, fruit and vegetable markets and nail salons.
While there are no Korean associations listed in the telephone directories for Long Island, there is a Korean Community Service Center in Flushing that helps Korean immigrants with problems ranging from language barriers or confusion over local laws to job searches.
For Ms. Yoo, the path to a nail salon came through a friend. As she remembered, "My friend told me that it was very hard to find work, but giving manicures was quick to learn and would be an easy job."
Following a crash course, Ms. Yoo found her first job at a salon in Manhattan, two months after arriving in the United States. For four years, she worked in New York City. But in 1989, when Dennis was starting eighth grade, she was not satisfied with the education he was getting and decided to move to Long Island. Following a friend who told her schools were good in Locust Valley, the family rented a house there.
Thus Ms. Yoo came to the Island at the very beginning of a surge in Asian residents. The Census Bureau put the number of Asians and Pacific Islanders in Nassau and Suffolk at 63,000 in 1990, and estimates that their number shot up 52 percent by July 1998, to 96,000.
The year she arrived on the Island, 1989, brought two other major changes to life in America: Ms. Yoo and a relative became partners in their own salon, and she learned to drive. "When we lived in Korea, most women didn't know how to drive," she said. "Even in Queens, I never needed to drive. But on Long Island there was no choice. So I went to a Korean driving school."
For Dennis Kim, life also became increasingly Americanized. After graduating from Locust Valley High School, he continued to college, first at SUNY Farmingdale, then at SUNY Albany.
"Like most kids, I really didn't know what I wanted to do with myself," he said. "A friend of mine convinced me to take the exam to become a police officer, and right after graduating from college, I was hired by the New York City Police Department."
He is now one of 40 Koreans on the force, he said, "but half are Americans who don't even speak Korean."
In 1996, when the family became eligible for American citizenship, Ms. Yoo and her husband immediately started studying for the exam, which included a test on the Constitution and American government. Of the decision to apply for citizenship, Ms. Yoo explained, "We had been here for more than 10 years, and this was my home."
But for Dennis Kim, at 20 years old, contemplating the decision of where his permanent home should be was more difficult. "I realized then," he said, "that if I went back to Korea, I would no longer fit in."
Preparing for the citizenship exam was overwhelming, Ms. Yoo said. "There was so much to remember," she said. "We had to know about the three branches of government and what each color of the American flag stands for. We received a manual and a tape, and every day I took the tape in my car and studied the material. Today, four years later, I forgot it all."
Now an American citizen and entrepreneur, Ms. Yoo has become a familiar and friendly face to hundreds of steady customers at Pinky Nails who appreciate her interest in their personal lives. "Many mothers and daughters come to get their nails done together," she said. "We've celebrated with them many bar mitzvahs, weddings and new babies."
While comfortable chatting in English with her customers, Ms. Yoo still switches to Korean when conversing with her co-workers, all of whom are also Korean.
Since a Seinfeld comedy routine in which Korean manicurists were apparently gossiping in their own language about their American customers, Ms. Yoo has been asked countless times if the manicurists do in fact talk about their customers.
"Of course not," she insists. "When we discuss what color polish a customer wants, or which nails need to be repaired, it's just easier to explain it in Korean than in English."
And Mr. Kim, who saw the Seinfeld episode, challenged its authenticity. "That's not the way we speak," he said. "They imitated the sounds, but it was not our language. If I was younger and more into defending our culture, I would have been offended, but now I think it's funny."
Outside work, Ms. Yoo's social life centers around membership in a Korean church in Bethpage. She often spends days off with friends in Flushing, where there is easy access to Korean groceries and video.
"My mother likes her life very simple," Mr. Kim said. "She refuses even to get a beeper."
And as a true 1.0, she still insists on speaking only Korean at home. "I don't want my son ever to forget the Korean language," Ms. Yoo said. "And I never want him to forget that while he is American, he is also Korean."
She is even more Korean, and travels back to South Korea every other year to visit her parents and other family members, but her real home is now on the Island, she said, with her son and husband.
"I don't know how long I'll continue working, or if one day I might return to Korea," Ms. Yoo said. "Right now, this is my home, but the truth is, nobody really knows what tomorrow will bring."
 
A Diverse Island
Articles in this series are looking beyond the stereotypes that sometimes taint relations between immigrants and native-born Long Islanders. Future articles will examine immigrants' lives and how they are being woven -- or not -- into the social and economic fabric. The first article, on March 12, examined the lives and aspirations of Muslims on the Island.

HEADLINE: The View From/Dobbs Ferry;
Ballroom Dance Pizazz From Russian Emigres

BYLINE: By LYNNE AMES 

DATELINE: DOBBS FERRY

 BODY:
WHEN she was a little girl in the city of Baku in what was then the Soviet Union, Lilia Borovski told herself stories about becoming a dancer and a princess. The princess part did not materialize, but she and her husband, Ilia Borovski, could be seen as royalty of sorts. Still in their early 20's, they are well known in the world of competitive ballroom dancing, having won dozens of international competitions doing everything from the stately waltz to the flashy Argentine tango.
Last year, they moved from Moscow to the United States to broaden their opportunities. Earlier this winter, they became teachers at Royal Ballroom, a studio that opened here this month. Their reputations in Russia had been solid, they said, but here in America, they felt they could soar as far as their fancy footwork could carry them. 
 "In America, if you have an idea, you can grow," Ms. Borovski, a petite woman with huge almond-shaped eyes, said. "In Russia, it is more fatalistic; there are limits."
Her husband added: "Here, too, everyone feels safer. Nobody worries about tomorrow, about the car breaking, about one day waking up and having no money at all."
In recent years, many ballroom dancers have left Russia and come to the United States, the Borovskis said. Those who left while Communist rule still prevailed generally did so for political and ideological reasons; those who came after the breakup of the Soviet Union were usually fleeing precarious economic conditions. But whatever the reason, they found a welcoming environment, where they can pursue their dancing and teach it to amateurs at studios like Royal Ballroom.
Indeed, Royal Ballroom alone has nine Russian teachers, including the Borovskis. The company Royal Ballroom Inc. is owned by Alex Koulik, a former neurologist, and his wife, Tanya, an English teacher, who left Moscow seven years ago and now live in Millburn, N.J. The Kouliks, who have earned several championship titles, run Royal Ballroom Studios in Millburn and New Brunswick. Their most recent venture, the one in Dobbs Ferry, is franchised to Barbara Antes, an American nurse, entrepreneur and dancer from Pleasantville.
The Kouliks, the Borovskis, two other Russian couples and a 29-year-old dancer and aerospace scientist, Vlad Kalyuzhny, rotate among the New Jersey and Dobbs Ferry studios, giving lessons and exhibitions.
On Friday evening the public can see some of them dance at Royal Ballroom on Ashford Avenue here. (The cost is $10 a person; the number to call for more information is 479-9090.)
For those who want to work with Russian dancers, there are individual and group lessons.
On a recent night at Royal Ballroom here, the Borovskis and Mr. Kalyuzhny led students around the blond wood floor, past mirror-lined walls, giving instructions. (Mr. Kalyuzhny, who is also highly proficient in computer and accounting, helps with the financial end of the business operation as well.) In their liltingly accented voices, they counted out beats -- "cha-cha, cha-cha-cha" -- and gave directions to students ranging from highly skilled to visibly self-conscious. If they felt frustrated by some pupils' lack of innate ability, they never let it show.
"We love to help everyone, to show them the better, more professional way," Ms. Borovski said.
They also talked about their own lives. Mr. Borovski, 23, was born in Iranteevka, a suburb of Moscow; his wife, 24, is from Baku, near the Caspian Sea. Both remember growing up in an era where anything American was considered forbidden, therefore desirable: "Even bubble gum from America, it was a brighter shade of pink," he said.
Both began dancing at an early age. Ms. Borovski, who said, "My first word was cha-cha," remembers being allowed to compete virtually anywhere but America. "Smooth" dances, as they are known -- fox trot, waltz, and the like -- were favored in Russia over livelier, more suggestive Latin ones, although the rhumba was allowed because it came by way of Cuba. Costumes, while elaborate creations of sequins and silk, could not be as revealing as their American counterparts.
In 1993, Ilia and Lilia met at a competition in St. Petersburg. "I have another partner, he has another partner," Ms. Borovski recalled. "First two dances, samba and cha-cha, I win. Second two, rhumba and pase doble, he wins. In competition, I'm thinking about dancing, not romance."
Five years later, however, they met again. This time they clicked instantly and within two days were talking about spending the rest of their lives together. They soon married, moved to Miami Beach and, after that, to Dobbs Ferry. They are "extremely happy" living in America, and with each other: they never have to explain anything, they said, verbally or on the dance floor. "We feel the same things, we think the same things, we move the same way," Ms. Borovski said.
As for Mr. Kalyuzhny, he does not yet have a professional dance partner or a spouse. A native of Moscow, he said he was a straight-A student, first in grade school, then in high school, then at the Moscow Aviation Institute, where he studied to be a cosmonaut. "By education," he said, "I am a designer of space stations."
When the Soviet Union broke up, financing of the space program was cut off, and he got temporary work as a translater. Soon he was offered a job with an American-based construction company. While living in Staten Island (he now lives in Edison, N.J.), he obtained a green card and decided to stay.
"Dance lessons are so much cheaper in Russia and, for professionals, the competition has no big prizes," he said. "Here one can teach ballroom dancing for much more money and can win money in competitions. I would like to also be in aerospace, but I do not know if I can ever be in that profession here."

O'Neill Seminars
On Tuesday at 7 p.m. David Hays, designer of the original production of Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night," will talk about the play in the house where it is set, Monte Cristo Cottage, the O'Neill summer home at 325 Pequot Avenue in New London.
This will be the first of two seminars on O'Neill. The second is scheduled on April 11 at the same time and place. The speaker will be Ted Mann, founder of the Circle-in-the-Square Theater in Manhattan, and producer of numerous O'Neill plays. 
 The seminars are precursors to a ceremony on April 28 when honorary doctorate degrees will be conferred on Arthur and Barbara Gelb, authors of the definitive biography of the playwright, "O'Neill," published in 1962. The couple has written a second three-volume work titled "O'Neill: Life With Monte Cristo," to be published by Applause Books in May. Mr. Gelb, formerly managing editor of The New York Times, is director of The New York Times College Scholarship program.
Presentation of the honorary degrees will take place at 4:30 p.m. in the Cummings Art Center of Connecticut College, 270 Mohegan Avenue, New London. Included in the ceremonies will be talks about O'Neill, his background and his work, by the Gelbs and others.
The event will kick off a series of symposiums, lectures, performances and exhibitions to be presented through December of this year under the umbrella title "Eugene O'Neill's New London: The Influence of Time and Place," a tribute to the only American Nobel Prize-winning playwright.
All events are open to the public free of charge. Call (860) 439-2787 for more information.
 
Before Jeans
Before the fashion-bereft 60's and the subsequent elevation of the blue jean and T-shirt to a thousand-dollar plateau, there were real clothes by Schiaparelli, Mainbocher and Chanel as well as Trigere, Norell, McCardle and other Americans.
Fashion has moved along, smartly or not, through the 20th century, and at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford it is documented in an exhibition that points up its erratic trajectory. From haute couture paper dresses to beaded extravaganzas, from Seventh Avenue to Hollywood, custom salon to ready-to-wear, changes in silhouettes, fabrics and concepts are displayed on 25 mannequins. Adjuncts to the clothes are also on view, including perfume, underwear, accessories, photographs and advertisements.
"The Fashion Follies: A Look Back at the 20th Century" may be seen through Sept. 10, on Tuesday through Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $7, $5 for students and people 62 and older, $3 for children 6 through 17, free under 6, and free to everyone on Thursdays and before noon on Saturdays. Call (860) 278-2670 for more information.
 
American History
A three-day Conference on Native American Studies will be held for a third year at Yale in New Haven, beginning on Friday at 5 p.m. with an address by Arthur Lazurus. The former Yale law professor represented the Sioux Nation before the Supreme Court in a landmark effort to redress the government's appropriation of the Black Hills in 1876.
A panel discussion on Saturday morning on the historical perspectives of legal sovereignty will be led by Alan Trachtenberg, professor of English at Yale. The afternoon session will open with a talk by Oren Lyons, a chief and faithkeeper of the Onondaga Nation, to be followed by a panel on contemporary sovereignty in political, economic and environmental matters. Judith Resnik, another Yale law professor, will lead that discussion.
Saturday evening will be filled with a reception and dinner at the Beineke Library, where Gerald Vizenor, Native American poet and writer, will read from his work. And on Sunday morning, Carol Rose, Yale professor of law and organization, will be moderator for a panel on intellectual sovereignty.
The weekend will culminate in a powwow on Sunday at 12:30 in the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, featuring a dance contest, drumming performance and crafts in a variety of Native American idioms. All events are open to the public and do not require reservations. Call (203) 432-2956 or send an e-mail message to george.miles@yale.edu for more information.
 
Tallulah Bankhead
"Tallulah Tonight!" -- called "Southern Comfort" when it was presented in New Rochelle earlier this month -- has been developing over many months of traveling around the country as a vehicle for Tovah Feldshuh. It was first performed a year ago at Odette's, a cabaret in New Hope, Pa., and it is expected to be booked into an Off Broadway house later this year.
The Tallulah of the title is the legendary actress from Alabama. The show, based on an episode in Ms. Bankhead's tumultuous life, opens at Theater Works in Hartford on Friday, running through May 7. Ms. Feldshuh, winner of Obie, Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle awards, will portray Ms. Bankhead.
Ms. Feldshuh, who wrote the script with Linda Selman, has given herself an opportunity to exercise her vocal talent by interspersing the script with songs by Cole Porter, Noel Coward and Johnny Mercer.
Performances are Wednesday through Saturday at 8; Sunday at 2:30 and 7:30. Additional Tuesday performances are scheduled on April 4, 18 and 25 at 8, and a Saturday matinee will be given on April 29 at 2:30. The theater address is 233 Pearl Street and tickets at $20, $25 and $35 may be reserved by calling (860) 527-7838.
 
Puppet Artistry
Saturday, April Fool's Day, is also the National Day of Puppetry, and it will be celebrated at the Charter Oak Cultural Center in Hartford with a full complement of puppet arts from 9 to 4:30. There will be workshops and demonstrations as well as performances of interest to novice puppeteers, polished performers, educators -- and to children and grown-ups who just enjoy puppet shows. One of the workshops will be devoted to Punch and Judy, conducted by Don Wonderlee, and one of the performances will be "Shadows 'n' Light," by Jim Napolitano of Nappy's Puppets.
The day was organized by the Connecticut Guild of Puppetry. The center is at 21 Charter Oak Avenue and admission to all events for the entire day requires registration at $40. Admission to the 2 p.m. performance by Mr. Napolitano is $3. Call (860) 693-4129 for more information.
 
Whistler's Influence
James McNeill Whistler is the subject of three lectures organized by the Hill-Stead Museum in Farmington. The first two are to be held at Miss Porter's School, 60 Main Street in Farmington, on Wednesday and April 5. The third will take place at Hill-Stead on April 12.
Linda Merrill, curator of American art at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, will present the first lecture, called "Whistler in America," appraising his influence on American art as an expatriate American. (Whistler left the United States at the age of 21.) The second lecture, "Patron and Friend: Charles Lang Freer and James McNeill Whistler," will be given by Kenneth Myers, assistant curator of American art at the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of the Smithsonian Institute.
Freer, a Detroit industrialist, was a prodigious collector of Whistler's work -- some 130 paintings, 174 works on paper, and 946 prints. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: For Fairness, Metro-North Takes Over Lots

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
IN Pelham, out-of-towners pay a premium to park at the train station: $390 a year compared with the $350 it costs villagers. It is a similar story in Port Chester, where commuters from nearby towns like Rye Brook and Greenwich pay $470 annually, compared with the $256 that local residents pay.
All that, however, is likely to change as the Metro-North Railroad takes over parking lots in places along its lines. 
 With Westchester's rail commuters lining up for parking permits like Giants fans for season tickets, Metro-North has decided to enter the parking lot business and level the playing field for all customers.
"It's a fairness issue," Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for the railroad, said, explaining why the railroad is taking over some of the parking lots it owns, instead of leasing them to the municipalities. "The goal is to improve access to our stations for all people, regardless of where they live."
She added: "Not everyone realizes that we don't control all the parking lots. They assume that if it's our station, it's also our lot. So we've decided that what we can control we will." An estimated 79,000 customers commute on Metro-North's lines every weekday during the morning rush.
Metro-North has already taken back 19 of 83 parking lots in New York State. On March 1, it took control of the spaces it owns in Mamaroneck, and next month it will do the same in Pelham. It has not announced which stations are next.
Once Metro-North takes over the spaces it owns next to the Pelham station, the resident rate will prevail for all. Justifying Pelham's policy up to now, Mayor Joseph E. Durnin Jr. said that if his village had not given preference to residents, "It would have been open season for anyone to use our station."
In Port Chester, where Metro-North also owns part of the lot but leases all of it to the village, Richard A. Falanka, the village clerk, agreed with Mayor Durnin, saying that "parking spaces are like gold" and municipalities should make sure their own residents are served first.
But Ms. Anders said the railroad wants an impartial party -- not the towns and villages -- to issue permits and maintain waiting lists. Metro-North has hired Allright Transit Services of Poughkeepsie to run the lots. She said that the company will take over the existing waiting lists and maintain them.
The railroad also plans to increase the amount of available parking for commuters, "even if that means literally repainting lines to eke out another space," Ms. Anders said.
In addition, Metro-North will assume responsibility for landscaping, striping, snow removal and lighting, among other things -- the duties formerly carried out by the municipalities that leased the slots and shared the revenue with Metro-North.
Michael S. Blau, Mamaroneck's village manager, said that from an economic perspective, Metro-North's re-entry into the parking lot business in his municipality turned out to be a good thing. Mamaroneck did not charge out-of-towners more to park. "The village initially resisted, but once we looked at all of our costs versus the revenues generated, we realized there was no benefit to our running the lot," Mr. Blau said. "We weren't making enough money to justify keeping it because we were anticipating major costs to maintain it."
Meanwhile, at stations where Metro-North owns relatively few parking spaces, out-of-town commuters may continue to fume.
In Tarrytown, for example, Metro-North owns only 77 of the 909 parking spaces next to the station. Those 77 spaces are metered, open to all. In an effort to keep cars from Rockland from crowding out local residents who park during the early morning commuter rush, Tarrytown raised its rates for nonresident commuters to $950 a year, a $325 increase. By contrast, Tarrytown residents pay $150 a year.
"Our goal is to encourage people from Rockland to take mass transit across the Tappan Zee," Richard Slingerland, the village adminstrator, said.
Out-of-town commuters in Croton-on-Hudson will also have to put up with the village's rate structure, said Richard F. Herbek, village manager and clerk. The village, which owns 2,000 spaces in the parking area, charges $1,008 a year for one of 50 preferred parking spaces, which are right next to the tracks and are guaranteed to be available. Other permit spaces are oversold on the assumption that not everyone will be commuting at the same time. Permits are $648 a year for nonresidents and $432 for residents.
Mr. Herbek said Croton's rate structure is intended to discourage commuters from Rockland, Orange and Dutchess Counties and other Westchester communities. The Croton-Harmon station, the largest in Westchester, generates more than $1 million in annual income for the town.
Other municipalities in Westchester where Metro-North owns at least some of the parking spaces are Scarsdale, North White Plains, Mount Kisco, Hastings-on-Hudson, Irvington, Ossining, Peekskill, Larchmont and Rye. And at many of those stations, the Metro-North spaces are metered.
Besides Mamaroneck, Allright already oversees parking lots in Harrison and Mount Vernon East. In parts of Connecticut up to New Haven, where Metro-North also operates, the state's Department of Transportation oversees the parking lots.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Helmetta, N.J.;
Middlesex County's Version of Mayberry

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW 

 BODY:
AT regular intervals each day, the Helmetta Police Station is locked up so that the sole officer on duty can go out on patrol. Generally, he's back at the station within an hour. Crime is virtually nonexistent in Helmetta, a Middlesex County borough that measures all of 0.9 square miles.
Wedged between the towns of Spotswood and Jamesburg, Helmetta is truly a sleepy little town. It has four police officers, fewer than 800 homes and just a handful of businesses -- among them, a 19th-century general store, a flower shop, a gas station, a post office and a landscaping supply store -- all on Main Street. But the commercial activity in the borough is about to double, with the impending completion of a small strip mall at the corner of Main Street and Old Forge Road. 
 Alluding to the town portrayed on "The Andy Griffith Show," Mayor Frank Hague said, "People say we're like Mayberry, U.S.A., a small town where people gather for coffee at the general store and watch out for each other."
The one thing that rattles Helmetta, literally, are the Conrail freight trains that chug through several times a day, shaking the nearby houses. The line was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad before the turn of the century to haul tobacco from the South to the Helme Tobacco Company mill, which was the world's largest snuff producer and the borough's main employer until it closed in 1993. Now, the deserted 21-building, 14-acre mill complex looms over Main Street as a reminder of the borough's proud industrial past and as its hope for the future.
The mill is the heart of the 220-acre G. W. Helme Snuff Mill Historic District, which is listed on both the National and State Registers of Historic Places. The district is bounded by Manalapan Brook to the south, Lake Avenue to the East, Ericson Avenue and Helmetta Pond to the north and Railroad Avenue to the west.
"It's the center of our town and needs to be redeveloped," said Mayor Hague, who has not been able to determine if he is distantly related to the longtime Jersey City mayor of the same name. "We would like to see the owners sell the mill so that it can be reused to provide jobs and more tax revenue. It could be used for light industrial lofts or even be outfitted as an assisted-living facility."
The mill is now owned by Swisher International of Wheeling, W. Va., and is for sale for $1.25 million. Stephen M. Segal, the owner of Segal Commercial Realty, which is representing Swisher, said that the best use for the property would be a converting it to housing for the elderly. "It is a multibuilding site where the buildings are of different ages, some 100 years old, which makes it complicated to redevelop," he said. "However, a number of developers are looking seriously at the property now." He would not name them.
Started in 1825, the snuff mill was sold to George W. Helme in 1879. In 1888, the borough split from East Brunswick in a dispute over services. It was named in honor of Mr. Helme's daughter Olivia Antoinette Helme, who was known as Etta.
Today, about a quarter of Helmetta's residents still have strong ties to the mill. Janice Mondoker, the vice president of the Helmetta Historic Society, recalls picking her father up at the mill entrance when the whistle blew for lunch every day. Her father was employed by the mill for half a century, and her parents, Emil and Margaret Mondoker, still live in one of the 105 houses that the company built for its workers at the turn of the century.
Many of those homes, on John Street, Railroad Avenue, Old Forge Road and Main Street, still have outhouses in their backyards. But with the installation of indoor plumbing in the 1940's, they were converted into storage sheds.
Peggy Gandy, the owner of Gandy Realty in neighboring Jamesburg and a lifelong resident of the area, recalled that until the tobacco company sold them to the workers in the late 1960's, the houses were all painted white. "That was the only color the company used," she explained.
Mrs. Gandy said the sturdy houses -- 16 feet wide, two stories tall, with two bedrooms and one bath -- are the most affordable ones in the borough, selling for $115,000 to $135,000, depending on condition and improvements. Occasionally, a house in need of updating sells for under $90,000, and recently one with an additional bedroom on Old Forge Road went for $149,900.
T HE borough also has 1940's ranches, a few postwar Cape Cods and a row of 1920's Sears prefabricated two-story houses that still have assembly instructions etched into their rafters. Those homes sell in the $115,000-to-$135,000 range.
The most expensive single-family homes in the borough are three- and four-bedroom colonials in the Sutton Place development, 60 houses built two years ago just off Main Street. They originally sold for $180,000 to $245,000. The first resales are just coming on the market, Mrs. Gandy said.
Helmetta has one major condominium complex, 340 two-bedroom units at Heather Glen, in a wooded setting off Lake Avenue, about a quarter mile from Main Street. Sandra Bohinski, the borough clerk, said that when Heather Glen was built in the late 1980's, it virtually doubled the borough's population.
Last year, 24 Heather Glen condos were sold at prices ranging from $74,500 for a one-bath unit to $104,000 for a two-bath end unit.
Among the people who recently moved into Heather Glen was Rocco Mazzio, a divorced father of three, who bought his condominium in January because it provided enough space for his children to sleep over and wooded trails for them to hike on.
"I was looking for an affordable home in a family-oriented community," Mr. Mazzio said.
Two other complexes are in the early stages of development: Regency Manor, with 70 single-family houses for people 55 and older, and Lakeview Commons, with 30 town houses. Both are just off Maple Avenue, behind the old mill complex.
The borough has about a dozen one- and two-bedroom apartments with monthly rents in the $650-to-$700 range, Mrs. Gandy said.
In mid-March, just seven houses and eight condos were on the market in Helmetta. "It's impossible to build up inventory because the houses in Helmetta are selling almost as quickly as they are being listed, often for more than the original asking price," she said. "The economy is good in all of Middlesex County, and Helmetta has the advantage of that small-town feel."
Young families with children are moving in, replacing older residents who are dying off. Empty-nesters from neighboring towns are also drawn by the small mill houses and affordable prices. Some longtime residents complain that Helmetta is becoming noisy because children play field hockey and soccer on its narrow streets, partly because there are no public parks. But others see this as a revival of a community tradition that existed when they were children.
Helmetta's 250 public school students attend classes in the neighboring Spotswood School District. With a total of 1,550 pupils, Spotswood has two elementary schools, Memorial Middle School for grades seven and eight, and Spotswood High School.
The G. Austin Schoenly School, with kindergarten and first grade, was recognized in 1997 by the United States Department of Education as a Blue Ribbon School, an honor given to 263 schools nationwide that year.
Dr. Anthony E. Vaz, the school superintendent, said that the district emphasizes literature and writing, starting in kindergarten. Each classroom in the system has at least one computer, he said, and all schools except Schoenly have computer laboratories. The middle and high schools are connected to a computer network, and by the end of the year Dr. Vaz expects to have the other schools connected to the network.
Although 83 percent of the 138 students who graduated last year went on to college, the district's seniors have scored at or below the state average on College Board tests for the last five years. Last year, Spotswood High seniors had combined verbal and math scores of 992, 15 points below the state average. Because of budget limitations, the school offers no advanced-placement courses, a policy that is being re-examined in light of the test scores, Dr. Vaz said.
The Spotswood School District is grappling with both a rising population and budget constraints. In the last seven years, the school population has grown by 7 percent. And in the last 18 years, only two budgets passed on the initial vote, the last time in 1993.
"Some of our classes have as many as 28 students, which is way too high," Dr. Vaz said. "We are currently examining our facilities, and we will decide whether we need to restructure the system or build."
Dr. Vaz believes construction will be difficult because the three municipalities that make up the district -- Spotswood, Helmetta and Milltown -- are all primarily residential, with few businesses to share the tax burden with homeowners.
ANOTHER price that Helmetta residents pay for the small-town atmosphere is the lack of shopping. The closest supermarket is five miles away in Spotswood, and the closest mall is Brunswick Square, six miles away in East Brunswick.
The residents do have Bo's General Store, the former company store directly across the street from the snuff mill. The proprietor, Roger Bohinski, the husband of the borough clerk, worked in the mill during his youth and displays his collection of antique snuff tins, packages of chewing tobacco, tools and other mill memorabilia. Along with groceries and liquor, Bo's General Store offers lots of atmosphere, with half a dozen tables and a four-stool counter called the "gossip corner," where old-timers and newcomers alike gather over coffee.
"This town will never change," Mr. Bohinski said, pointing out that because mill and the company houses still dominate the landscape, Helmetta looks much the way it did 100 years ago. "We may get a couple hundred more homes," he said, "but we are and will always remain a factory town."

THE RIGHT SNUFF: During the Great Depression, Helmetta was one of the few factory towns that received no federal assistance, according to a history published for the borough's centennial in 1988. Despite the hard times, Americans continued buying snuff produced by the Helme Tobacco Company's mill. Although hours were cut back at times, there was always work at the mill, and during this period of bank failures, the mill paid its hands in cash.

HEADLINE: A Way to Get More Money for Their Milk

BYLINE: By JAMIE MONAGAN 

 BODY:
CONNOISSEURS rhapsodize over products from the great cheese-making capitals of the world such as Asturias in northern Spain and Franche-Comte in the French Alps. Can raves for Colchester and Falls Village be far behind?
Six farmhouse cheese-making operations have opened across Connecticut over the past three years, each producing small quantities of hand-made "boutique" goat, cow or sheep cheeses. 
 Though the quantities are less than 1 percent of the state dairy production, according to a state Department of Agriculture estimate, these businesses reflect a new survival strategy in the face of fluctuating milk prices and unrelenting development pressure.
"If farmers can't make a living, no way are they going to hold onto land that's worth a million dollars, especially with development going on around them that makes farming more difficult," according to Liz MacAlister.
During the past 20 years at the 75-acre Cato Corner Farm in Colchester, she has tried various schemes to turn a profit, none very lucrative.
"I like my cows a lot and I really wanted to keep them, so I came up with cheese as a 'value-added product.' I no longer sell my milk wholesale, so I'm not at the mercy of fluctuating prices and minute profit margins."
Bill Hopkins, marketing representative for the agriculture department, helped spark the new businesses with a 1996 seminar, "How to Save the Farm and Keep the Cows," which offered alternatives to merely sending milk out to be bottled. Three of the current generation of cheese-makers attended, including Ms. MacAlister.
"At that time the price for fluid milk was about 20 cents a gallon, so we tried to offer dairy farms an alternative so they could get more money for their milk," Mr. Hopkins said. "The more creative, entrepreneurial ones headed off in this direction."
Ms. MacAlister estimates she has spent $50,000 in equipment and barn renovations during the two years she has been in the cheese business -- a relatively small investment, she said, since she already owned the land and animals.
She sells most of her cheese at green markets in New York City, successfully enough that her 30-year-old son, Mark Gilman, quit his teaching job to help full-time with the cheese-making operation.
"With an English degree you can do anything, even make cheese," she joked.
This year they will milk 35 Jersey cows, which give the high protein and butterfat milk needed for cheese.
Adhering to traditional European methods, Ms. MacAlister's production is dictated by the seasons.
"In France and Italy certain cheeses are made only in the spring, for example, when the animals are eating a certain kind of pasture," she said.
"It's a very refined way of thinking. We keep the cows on pasture almost the entire time we're making cheese so they only eat what's seasonal. If I were to feed them silage, which is essentially a fermented product, it would affect the taste of the cheese, particularly as it ages and the flavors intensify."
"The appeal of farmhouse cheese, assuming it's well-made, is its rusticity, as opposed to the garishness of big budget, mass-produced cheeses," said Steve Jenkins, author of "The Cheese Primer" (Workman Publishing) and head of the cheese department at Fairway Market in New York. "The whole experience is predicated on memorability. You remember a cheese when you're struck by its rusticity and hands-on attention and taste of the land. When you close your eyes you can almost envision the lovely fields the animals graze in. It sounds like hyperbole, but it's absolutely the case."
Joan Lamothe finds she does well selling her goat and cow's milk cheese straight from her Rustling Winds Creamery, a 200-acre farm on Canaan Mountain in Falls Village. She tends two Jersey cows and 23 goats, "counting papa," to produce a variety of hard and soft cheeses, including Cheshire, a type of cheddar which Steve Jenkins said is "among the most satisfying, simple, hearty and rustic cheeses known to man."
Mrs. Lamothe, a 58-year-old widow with calloused hands and a no-nonsense manner, says she has invested $250,000 in equipment and a new barn, and isn't sure she will ever make her money back.
"Depends on how long I'm here," she said.
Most of the 50 pounds of cheese she produces each week is made from raw, unpasteurized milk, all of it "all natural."
"When I order feed, I tell them just what I want in it and how I want it mixed -- no pesticides, herbicides, hormones or additives of any kind," Mrs. Lamothe said. "I put in my own minerals and vitamins that the animals need. I usually do that with herbs, which is better for them anyway.
"Nettles are very good for goats. They love them -- eat the prickers and all, great big thistles. All that stuff is tonic for them."
Mrs. Lamothe dotes on the "weird personalities" among her flock, especially 14-year-old April. "She follows me around like a dog. She'd come in and help me make cheese if I let her."
The agriculture department dairy division wouldn't appreciate April's presence in the cheese house, however.
State inspectors make frequent unannounced visits at all the creameries to make sure that sanitary conditions, especially concerning raw milk, are strictly maintained.
Paul Trubey, who tends a herd of 18 swiss dairy goats at Highwater Dairy in Glastonbury, has been licensed commercially only since June, though he had been experimenting with different cheeses for years. His fledgling business got a boost last year when he won first place in the fresh non-herbed goat cheese category at the American Cheese Society's national competition in Shelburne, Vt.
Highwater Dairy is already turning a small profit, but Mr. Trubey intends to "keep his day job" as a hospice program administrator and part-time instructor at Central Connecticut State University.
"People are really interested in small, local, artisan produce," said Mr. Trubey, who is the only man among Connecticut farmhouse cheese-makers. When all his goats are lactating, Mr. Trubey makes up to 100 pounds of fresh goat cheese a week, which he sells to local stores and restaurants and at green markets in Kent and Storrs.
Another Connecticut cheese-maker with academic ties, Elisa Santee, makes cheese from the milk of 11 Jersey cows at her 140-acre Foxfire Farm in Mansfield. She is also an adjunct math professor at Three Rivers Community Technical College.
"For a farm this size, cheese-making is a better source of income than selling fluid milk," said Mrs. Santee, who has a master's degree in business administration. "There's better cash flow, and it's more easily managed, but like any start-up business, you have to get out there and do the legwork. If you don't pound the pavement promoting your product, very few people know about you.
"Connecticut has a huge agricultural base that I think the public is not generally aware of, from our oyster beds to maple sugaring to cattle to cheese-making," she said. "We have a great deal to offer agriculturally, but we seem to be very quiet about it."
Foxfire Farm is the only certified organic producer of cheese in the state. She makes cheese from a family recipe -- her husband is a fourth-generation dairy farmer -- from March through December.
"Our cows are always dried off before Christmas so that we can have some family time when milking is not the focus," said Mrs. Santee, who also raises organic lamb and vegetables with her husband and two daughters.
Beaver Brook Farm in Lyme is a sheep dairy, one of about 100 across the United States. Suzanne Sankow and her husband, Stanley, whose family has farmed the 175 acres since 1917, raise 600 sheep, about 150 of which are milked for cheese. In only her third year, she sold more than $30,000 worth of cheese, the same amount grossed from the wool and meat operations.
Her total output of 3,000 pounds of yogurt, feta and other cheeses sold easily last year, despite prices starting at $16 a pound. "I have people from New York who call me ahead of time to reserve their yogurt, and then drive over to get it," Ms. Sankow said.
Ms. MacAlister of Cato Corner Farm said it is a sophisticated population who appreciates boutique cheeses and they don't object to the higher prices.
"If you're willing to market yourself," she added, "making and mongering cheese is a great way for dairy farmers to survive."

HEADLINE: E-Sales Drive Need for Warehouses

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR 

DATELINE: PORT CHESTER

 BODY:
AT his first Internet-based grocery operation, Allen MacCannell relied on supermarkets in New York City to deliver the goods that his customers ordered online.
But the costs were high and the delivery service was not reliable, so Mr. MacCannell helped form a new company with its own fleet of trucks and a warehouse in a dusty industrial complex here near the Connecticut border. 
 Taking advantage of its proximity to New York City and its northern suburbs, the company, YourGrocer.com, saw its business take off, and it has already added a second warehouse, in Elmsford.
"We chose Westchester because of its free access into Manhattan over the Third Avenue Bridge," Mr. MacCannell said. "The warehouse space you can get here is convenient and really inexpensive."
Mr. MacCannell's company is among dozens in the New York City suburbs that have entered the online delivery business in recent years, generating economic growth by providing consumers with a variety of products, from books to chocolates to wines. But these fast-growing companies have also created a surge in demand for warehouse space across the region.
In Westchester, real estate agents say, demand is so strong that a shortage of warehouse space has developed.
Paul Jacobs, a consultant for Insignia/ ESG, a real-estate broker, said the shortage has many potential buyers looking to New Jersey and Rockland County.
Insignia does not keep statistics on warehouse rents and vacancy rates, he said. But in one recent example, a client seeking industrial space chose a site in New Jersey over Westchester because he could not find a block at a reasonable price.
"Industrial space is very tight," he said. "There is not a lot of product because Westchester County has not historically developed industrial space because land values have been so high, and it has really gotten tighter in recent years."
Nearly a dozen e-commerce companies have set up shop in Westchester and just across the Connecticut line in Fairfield County.
For example, Eglobalshop.com, a startup company that plans to sell apparel, household products and other items, intends to set up a warehouse in Larchmont. TradeOut.com, a company that sells excess inventory, is based in Ardsley. Wrenchead.com, which sells auto parts, and Camdens.com, which sells gifts geared to executives, both have their headquarters in White Plains and operate warehouses there.
Driven by the growth in e-commerce, warehouse space in North America has grown by about 20 percent a year for the last two years, according to the International Warehouse Logistics Association, based in Park Ridge, Ill. Westchester County has proved particularly attractive to e-commerce companies that want a presence in the most densely populated area in the nation.
"It is exciting; it is like the industrial revolution of the last century," said Kevin L. McNulty, the association's membership services director. "I have never seen anything quite like it."
While government officials and those at the Chamber of Commerce say that no major studies have been done on e-commerce warehouse demand in Westchester, if it follows regional trends in neighboring suburban counties, it accounts for about 40 percent of the demand.
Less than a decade ago, experts predicted that Internet ventures would no longer need actual stores, drastically reducing the amount of space used for commercial storage.
But experts have learned quickly that while the world of e-commerce may be a great place to buy wine or books, cyberspace has no shelves or storage space. And the products sold by Internet companies must be stored someplace.
This has led to the construction of more warehouses in surburan counties -- in proximity to technology-savvy high-income communities -- across the country.
Westchester is particularly popular, Mr. MacCannell said, because companies can easily deliver to customers in New York City without having to pay tolls, and they have easy access to Westchester, Rockland and Fairfield Counties, as well as northern New Jersey.
YourGrocer.com, which serves Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Manhattan, Westchester, Rockland and western Fairfield, is considering an expansion into northern New Jersey, Mr. MacCannell added.
The county's shortage of warehouse space has been compounded by a general shortage in commercial space, which experts trace to small business growth even before the e-commerce boom.
In the early 90's, the county had experienced a weak commercial real estate market, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the national commercial brokerage company. But last year, Westchester saw leasing activity jump and the overall vacancy rate fall to 15.2 percent from 17.6 percent in 1998.
The shift was being driven, Cushman & Wakefield officials said, by a growth in demand for warehouse, industrial and office space. In one example of the growing shortage, Drinks America, an Internet alcoholic beverage company, was looking for an 8,000- to 12,000-square-foot building, which would include a warehouse to serve the New York region.
The company looked at three potential sites in Westchester, but then chose Long Island, despite reservations about logistics, because two of the Westchester sites were under contract before company officials had a chance to make any decisions.
In its infancy, e-commerce companies, like Amazon.com, tried to provide goods by serving as the middle man between consumers and wholesale businesses. They relied on vendors to make deliveries on time.
But after facing problems fufilling orders, especially around the last two holiday seasons, many companies decided to set up their own warehouses so they could keep items in stock and more accurately predict when items would arrive.
Mr. MacCannell's first e-commerce company was NYCGrocery.com, which relied on vendor supermarkets to make deliveries. But the Manhattan-based company was limited by the high prices for goods in the city supermarkets and the unreliability of their delivery services.
So they decided to move to the suburbs, where real estate was cheaper and bulk groceries were too, Mr. MacCannell said. The old company was purchased by YourGrocer.com, Mr. MacCannell said.
Dwarfing the original YourGrocer.com warehouse in Port Chester, the new one in Elmsford is about the size of four football fields and took some time for a real estate agent to find, said Mr. MacCannell, 36, the founder and vice president for sales at the company. The company is leasing the 20,000-square-foot warehouse for $100,000 a year.
At the Elmsford warehouse, the company's more than 20 mid-size delivery trucks and one large rig can be heard loading and revving up each afternoon to make trips throughout Westchester and surrounding communities.
YourGrocer.com requires customers to make orders of at least $50 by 5 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays and by noon on Fridays for delivery the next day. The orders are processed in the corporate offices in Port Chester, and then the goods are loaded onto the trucks. The company makes about 100 deliveries a day, Mr. MacCannell said.
The trucks, Mr. MaCannell said, "basically go straight from the warehouse into the surrounding communities, including Manhattan, and on heavy days we have to send in the large tractor trailer to Central Park, where we split the goods onto smaller trucks."
Over the border in Fairfield County, Shoplink.com has also launched an online delivery service for groceries. Officials at the Massachusetts-based company recently opened a warehouse of more than 83,000 square feet in Stratford.
Officials from Shoplink said that they looked for space in both counties and eventually settled on the warehouse in Stratford because it could serve communities in Westchester and Fairfield.

HEADLINE: Suburban Home Prices: Upward, Ho!

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
WITH 1999 standing as the fourth straight record-setting year for home prices throughout the nation and the New York metropolitan region, and with older baby boomers ensconced in their homes of choice while younger ones seek a place to finally fit their families, it has come to this:
One day last month in Westchester County, a desperate young woman knelt on the porch of a four-bedroom home in Hastings-on-Hudson and slipped photographs of her children under the door. 
 "They wanted the house so badly," said Robin Friedman, the manager of the Houlihan/Lawrence brokerage office in nearby Irvington. "They obviously were hoping to pull at the seller's heart strings. Unfortunately, they did not make the highest offer and did not get the house."
The home, which Ms. Friedman described as a "nice split-level," sold for $450,000.
All across the region, because of a confluence of mostly propitious economic forces, the squeeze is on -- and what spurts up are prices.
In the suburban arc around New York City, according to data collected by the National Association of Realtors, the median price for existing single-family homes hit $208,000 in 1999, an 11 percent rise over 1998 -- and nearly triple the nation's 3.9 percent rate of increase. "Virtually every area around New York City was close to double digits in increases," said Dr. Fred Flick, the association's vice president for economic research.
The median price for Nassau and Suffolk Counties, for example, rose by 9.7 percent in 1999, to $197,000. Westchester County's average price ascended to $458,981, a 15.1 percent increase. In New Jersey, the median price for Middlesex, Hunterdon and Somerset Counties, computed together by the National Association of Realtors, jumped to $221,000, a whopping 23.3 percent increase over 1998 -- nearly six times the national rate of appreciation.
And while that New Jersey statistic was certainly the extreme, it was also the point of the arrow for the region. For the second straight year, according to another measure of the market, the Case Shiller Weiss repeat-sales survey, every one of the 576 ZIP code areas in 14 counties that constitute most of New York City's suburban ring saw prices appreciate in 1999 -- 396 of them by at least 8 percent. (Statistics for several areas, including all of Rockland County, were incomplete.)
That boon -- for sellers -- rides atop a historic boom.
January was the 107th month of the nation's economic expansion, the longest ever, surpassing the 106-month period from 1961 to 1969. "So, 31 days into the 365,250-day-long millennium, we break the record," said Dr. James Hughes, the dean of the Rutgers University School of Planning and Public Policy. "What a way to start a millennium!"
"We used to think 3 percent was the maximum growth rate for the gross domestic product," Dr. Hughes said. "But we closed out the millennium, the fourth quarter of 1999, with a G.D.P. growth of 6.9 percent."
"And housing certainly went along for the economic ride," he said.
Not only did the national median price for existing single-family homes set a record last year, so, too, did sales volume. There were 5.19 million resales in 1999, said Dr. Flick of the National Association of Realtors, breaking the record of 4.97 million sales set in 1998.
At the same time, national sales of newly built homes also set a record last year, breaking the 1998 mark. "In the last four years," said Steve Berman, a statistician in the residential construction branch of the Census Bureau, "we have had four of the best six years ever for sales of new homes since the beginning of time -- which for us is 1963, when we started the survey." There were 907,000 new homes sold in 1999, topping the record of 886,000 sold in 1998.
"So don't be surprised," Mr. Berman said, "that given last year's numbers, when combined with the record for existing-home sales, that the nation's homeownership rate hit an all-time high." The old record, set in 1998, was 66.3 percent of all households owning their own homes, he said, "and it hit 66.9 percent in '99."
Obviously, sales activity has been feverish throughout most of the country; regional records were set in the Midwest and South, and the West enjoyed its third-best year ever. Less obviously, sales volume has been somewhat dampened in the Northeast, and in the metropolitan region in particular.
Part of the reason, as Rae Rosen, senior regional economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, sees it, is that "in some sense, we're landlocked -- in the city, but also in many older suburban areas."
And in the view of Patrick O'Keefe, the executive vice president of the New Jersey Builders Association, the dearth of development is attributable to stringent zoning regulations and open-space preservation. In New Jersey, for example, Mr. O'Keefe said, "housing production is down 36 percent, decade to decade," from 37,900 units a year during the 1980's to 24,000 in the 90's.
All of which, given the resurgence of the regional economy, has acted as a pincer, pushing up prices.
HOUSING demand has been fueled, in large part, by job growth. In the 31-county New York-Northeastern New Jersey region, according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, 205,000 private-sector jobs were created last year, raising the job total for the region's private industries to 8.3 million. "The 1999 growth record comes in as the best for any year in the region's current recovery, which began in 1993," said John L. Weiting, the bureau's regional commissioner. Between 1989 and 1992, the regional economy suffered through a major downturn, with 715,000 private-sector jobs lost during that period. In 1992, Mr. Weiting pointed out, the region's unemployment rate stood at 8.4 percent; at the end of last year, it was 4 percent.
So the underlying forces of the housing market, Dr. Hughes at Rutgers said, "have been job and income growth, the wealth effect from the stock market and consumer confidence, all reinforcing the other force -- the baby boom still trading up at a furious pace."
This year, the baby-boom generation will range in age from 36 to 54. "The older boomers are locked into the houses they want, so they are not selling," Dr. Hughes said. "The younger boomers are trying to settle into the communities where they can finish raising their families. So we're short of product."
There are no overall regional statistics on inventory, but the national numbers offer a hint of the crunch. In January 1999, Dr. Flick said, there were 2.04 million listings available around the country; in January 2000, there were 1.15 million. Locally, by way of example, the Westchester County Multiple Listing Service reported only 3,141 listings available at the end of 1999, down 32 percent from 4,619 in December 1998.
ONE consequence -- directly observed by Ms. Rosen of the Federal Reserve Bank -- is a phenomenon called the "teardown" or "knockdown." "They buy the house for the value of the land, at fairly impressive prices, knock it down and rebuild -- large houses, sometimes right to the property line," she said. "It's happening in Connecticut and northern New Jersey, and it's true on Long Island, too."
"I live in Connecticut," she said, "and there's five knockdowns on my block."
Conventional wisdom has it that rising mortgage rates stifle demand, and interest costs for the standard 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage have certainly risen recently.
"Currently, we are at four-year highs for the 30-year fixed mortgage, hovering near 8.3 percent," said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage statistics company in Butler, N.J. "There's been a long, steady climb since October of 1998 when we achieved 31-year lows of 6.68 percent." During 1999, the low mark for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 6.84 percent on Jan. 31; the high was 8.31 percent on Aug. 13.
Rising home prices and mortgage costs do, of course, take "some of the marginal home buyers out of the market," Mr. Gumbinger said, but house-hungry, thick-walleted buyers have, literally, adjusted.
"The steady rise in fixed rates," Mr. Gumbinger said, "has given some resurgence to adjustable-rate mortgages" -- or ARM's -- a mortgage product that, at least to begin with, offers a lower-cost alternative to traditional fixed-rate financing.
Currently, Mr. Gumbinger said, about 30 percent of mortgages being originated "have some form of adjustable rate, up sharply from the 10 percent in January '99."
"That is one of the reasons home sales have not cooled too much despite the climb in interest rates," he said.
Certainly, the ardor to buy, often at any price, has not cooled. "There's a house in Hartsdale that was listed at $399,000, and there were so many offers within 24 hours of the listing that the owner instructed the agent to get everybody's best offer in writing," said Ms. Friedman, the Houlihan/ Lawrence broker in Westchester. "My agent just phoned to say she got a call advising her that none of the written offers were being accepted and the owner was raising the asking price to $429,000 and starting over again."
Tracking real estate trends by the numbers defies absolute precision. Although single-family house sales are reported by local realty boards, not all real estate agents are members of the boards and not all sales are made through agents, so not all sales in a given area are recorded. At the same time, while one board may use median prices -- meaning half the sales are above that figure and half below -- others calculate an average. Still, the numbers serve as barometers of market patterns.
In Westchester, according to the New York State Association of Realtors, the average price hit $458,981 in 1999, up 15.1 percent from $398,727 in 1998. But with inventory low, sales volume slipped by 5.1 percent, from 6,907 in 1998 to 6,553 last year.
The upward price spiral was reflected in the findings of the Case Shiller Weiss repeat-sale survey. The survey is based on a table showing the average price for all single-family homes sold in most ZIP code areas, year by year. To determine price fluctuations in 1999, for example, the survey took the purchase price of each home sold in each ZIP code area during the year just ended, compared it to the price the house brought the last time it sold, and then, using the annual index, adjusted the previous purchase price to what it likely would have been had it sold in 1998. The 1999 sales prices for homes within each ZIP code area were then compared with the estimated 1998 prices to compute the average change.
Of Westchester's 65 ZIP code areas, the survey indicated, 10 saw prices increase by up to 4 percent last year, 14 rose by 4 to 8 percent, 35 by 8 to 12 percent and 6 -- Eastchester, Hastings-on-Hudson, Larchmont, Rye, Tuckahoe and Wykagl-- jumped at least 12 percent.
Ms. Friedman's anecdotal evidence bore out those findings. In North Yonkers, a four-bedroom split-level was purchased in December 1997 for $225,000. "In January '99," she said, "the owner put it on the market for $305,000, got bids over the asking price and then decided she didn't want to sell because she could get more money. She re-listed three months ago at $349,000, and it's in contract, close to asking price."
In Rockland County, according to the Greater Hudson Valley Multiple Listing Service, the median price in 1999 was $238,000, up 9 percent from $220,000 in 1998. But sales volume was down 3.4 percent, from 2,009 in 1998 to 1,940 last year.
Ann Garti, the executive officer of the Hudson Valley service, said: "One community that was heretofore very affordable is Stony Point. In 1998, the average price was $215,660, and in 1999 it was $258,618, a 20 percent jump. We have a community in the far reaches of Rockland, the northwest corner -- Sloatsburg. There you had a 1988 average of $153,284, and in 1999 it went up to $175,416, 14 percent."
T HE situation was similar on Long Island. In Nassau County, according to the Long Island Board of Realtors, the median price in December hit $230,000, up 12.5 percent from $204,500 in December 1998.
The Case Shiller survey showed that of Nassau's 64 ZIP code areas, 1 saw prices increase by up to 4 percent, 6 appreciated between 4 and 8 percent, 47 by 8 to 12 percent and 10 -- Atlantic Beach, Cedarhurst, Hewlett, Lawrence, Long Beach, Oceanside, Rockville Centre, Woodmere and two in Valley Stream -- rose by 12 percent or more. At the same time, the number of Nassau sales dropped 9.9 percent, to 7,389 from 8,199.
"The brokers are stressed because of the inventory shortage and buyer's demand," said Joseph Mottola, the executive officer of the Long Island board.
Mr. Mottola offered several community-specific examples: "In Baldwin, the median went to $188,600, up 6 percent from $178,000 in 1998. Glen Cove saw an increase from $252,750, up 12.2 percent to $284,500. And Levittown had a 14 percent increase, $158,000 to $180,000."
In Suffolk County, the median price for homes sold in December was $168,000, 1.8 percent more than the $165,000 in December 1998. And the number of sales throughout the county was 11,265, virtually the same as the 11,244 transactions in 1998. Of the 86 ZIP code areas in Suffolk, 29 appreciated by 4 to 8 percent and 57 by 8 to 12 percent.
"While the overall increase was less than Nassau's, in these three towns, the increase was significant," Mr. Mottola said. Brentwood rose 15 percent, from $113,000 to $130,000; Northport jumped 12 percent to $325,000, from $290,000; and in tonier Cold Spring Harbor, the increase was 27 percent, $530,000 to $675,000.
Measuring the market in Connecticut is complicated by the fact that the state does not indicate property type on deed transfers. Yet, by far, most transfers are residential, said Vincent Valvo, the editor and publisher of The Connecticut Law Tribune, which tracks the state's economic trends.
Citing data compiled by Warren Information Services, a real estate statistics company, Mr. Valvo said that in Fairfield County the median price was $220,000 in 1999, up 4 percent from $211,500 in 1998.
Bucking the sales-volume trend, Fairfield showed an increase last year with 20,074 transactions, a 2.4 percent rise over the 19,598 recorded in 1998.
According to the Case Shiller survey, of Fairfield's 45 ZIP code areas, 1 saw prices rise by up to 4 percent, 12 by 4 to 8 percent, 29 by 8 to 12 percent and 3 -- Westport and two in Norwalk -- by at least 12 percent.
It is all indicative of the Connecticut rebound. "In 1993, Connecticut was absolutely anemic," Mr. Valvo said. "We had massive layoffs, high commercial vacancy rates. Fairfield faired better than other counties, but it still suffered."
Over the last two years, however, "it's completely turned around," Mr. Valvo said. "Technology has been strong, and that's allowing workers to afford the higher prices for Fairfield homes. It's causing some firms to expand outside the county. You're basically pushing people, business and wealth up the Merritt Parkway."
Randi Hutton, a broker at Tilghman & Frost Coldwell Banker in Westport, concurred: "The midrange customer, $500,000 to $600,00, if that's midrange -- well, maybe it is in Fairfield -- they want the large kitchen, nine-foot ceilings, but they can't afford that in this price range. So they're willing to go north, where they can get more space and land for their money."
"They say, 'We don't want to be more than an hour from the city,' " Ms. Hutton said. "Then when they see the reality, they make the commute 15 minutes longer."
Officials of the New Jersey Association of Realtors did not respond to repeated requests for information. But some indication of price shifts in the northern New Jersey area -- all of them up -- was offered by the National Association of Realtors.
In Bergen and Passaic Counties, the median was $218,400, up 4.9 percent from $208,200. In Monmouth and Ocean Counties, it was $161,200, up 14.2 percent from $141,100. In Newark, there was a 9.2 percent rise, from $192,000 to $210,500.
And, of course, there was that 23.3 percent vault in Middlesex, Hunterdon and Somerset Counties, from $179,000 to $221,200.
Of the 316 ZIP code areas in the 10-county area of northern New Jersey surveyed by Case Shiller, 16 saw prices rise by up to 4 percent, 91 by between 4 and 8 percent, 201 by 8 to 12 percent and 8 -- Milburn, 1 in Newark, South Orange, Chatham, Passaic, 2 in Paterson, and Summit -- jumped by at least 12 percent. (The 10 counties are Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union.)
In the view of Mr. O'Keefe of the New Jersey Builders Association, "housing prices are going through the roof -- pun intended."
The median price for a new home in New Jersey, as of last September, was $231,125, Mr. O'Keefe said, "up 14.9 percent from $201,137 in 1998."
"And in northern New Jersey's Bergen County, for example, it was $379,900, up 12.7 percent from $336,950," he added.
There has been a "significant increase" in residential construction in Hudson and Bergen Counties, Mr. O'Keefe said, "but it's mostly rental."
WHICH is why some buyers go to great lengths -- and designs -- to get what they want. Ric Martel, the manager of the Coldwell Banker brokerage office in Spring Lake, N.J., told the tale of one family's unusual twist on the teardown phenomenon.
"They bought the original house in the $600,000 range," Mr. Martel said. "Then they donated it to Habitat for Humanity, picked it up and towed it to Neptune, and put it on a lot that was donated there.
"Then they built themselves a 4,800-square-foot home, side to side, setback to setback, for another, I'd say, $600,000."
"I guess they got a tax write-off for giving away that old house," he said.

The Noose Is Tightening For Smokers in New Jersey

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

DATELINE: PRINCETON

 BODY:
John Burns sat at the bar at Triumph Brewing Company on Nassau Street, his Newport 100's and Bengal Gold pale ale forming a cozy universe along with his copy of "The Turning Point" by Malcolm Gladwell about crucial moments in social trends.
"It's a reading room," Mr. Burns, 45, said of the pub, across the street from the university's FitzRandolph Gate and populated last Sunday by a harmonious blend of tobacco lovers and others. "It's a place where I can sit down and interact with a Nobel laureate or a guy who pumps gas." 
 So Mr. Burns -- who works at a health food store here -- said he was alarmed by one of the state's budding trends: smoking bans on private property.
Amid a growing intolerance toward smokers and medical findings about the harmful effects of second-hand smoke, state legislators have introduced bills aimed at banning smoking in restaurants, shopping malls and -- if a building owner wants -- in leased office space.
Since 1994, 172 of New Jersey's 566 municipalities have adopted restrictions of some kind, from bans on cigarette vending machines to smoke-free school zones, according to New Jersey Group Against Smoking Pollution, or GASP. But in what supporters and opponents say would be a first for New Jersey -- and the entire New York region -- the Princeton Regional Health Commission is moving to ban smoking in bars as well as almost all public places.
"I believe in the public and the private, and I think that the sense of public entitlement has crossed the line to the point where --" said Mr. Burns, pausing in midsentence to light another Newport -- "freedom is being directly threatened. And to have something like having a drink and smoking a cigarette be infringed upon is almost fascism."
In a bastion of intellectual freedom like Princeton, that is an indictment almost as strong as a freshly lighted Camel, and one the commission rejects.
"This is a smoke-free ordinance, we don't think of it as a ban," said Katherine Benesch of the 10-member commission. "The fact that there is so much research now that talks about the effects of second-hand smoke definately had an impact."
So far, none of the proposed state legislation has been approved in committee, much less survived votes in the full Senate and Assembly. Moreover, Governor Whitman, who received an award from the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids in October for an anti-smoking campaign, is reserving judgment on the measures. Her spokesman, Pete McDonough, said that she preferred to "try to use market forces" to dictate smoking policies for businesses.
"As a rule, the governor tries to avoid restaurants where people are allowed to smoke," said Mr. McDonough. He noted that the current state budget included $30 million for programs to help smokers quit and to keep children from starting.
For now, Mrs. Whitman's commissioner of health and senior services, Christine Grant, has invited the New Jersey Restaurant Association, which represents 1,000 of the state's 10,000 licensed retail food vendors, to discuss voluntary restraints. A 1985 state law requires restaurants to post signs if smoking is permitted, and Francis Schott, an association spokesman, said members did not want to change things.
"We'd propose that private restaurants continue to post their policy and that consumers continue to have the right to chose whether to patronize the smoky little jazz club or patronize smoke-free environments," Mr. Schott said.
Yet in an interesting twist, teachers have expressed concern about a measure introduced by State Senator John Lynch, Democrat of New Brunswick, that would prohibit smoking on school property. "Sometimes they confuse the adult staff with children," said Karen Joseph, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Education Association.
As for the proposed ordinance in this university town, the health commission, which ministers to the borough and the surrounding township of the same name, voted unanimously on Feb. 15 to introduce its far-reaching ban; it can adopt it at a meeting scheduled for April 18.
Proponents of the ban, which exempts the local smoke shop, say it could help New Jersey catch up with other states, citing a statewide ban California has imposed on smoking in workplaces, including bars. "We're not doing anything radical here," said Ms. Benesch.
But Richard Ryan, manager of the Ivy, a bar on Nassau Street, said 85 percent of his customers smoke, and the ban would hurt business. "I don't think they considered the ramifications," Mr. Ryan said.
Among the 16 restaurants and bars in the borough with liquor licenses, only three do not have nonsmoking sections. As William J. Cleary, executive director of the New Jersey Licensed Beverage Association, put it, "There's not been one case ever recorded where someone was forced into a restaurant and wasn't allowed to leave if they didn't want to be there."
Regina Carlson, executive director of GASP, noted that three-quarters of the public did not smoke, and would drink and eat out more often people did not have to think twice about where to go.
Michael Marlow, a professor of economics at California Polytechnic Institute in San Luis Obispo, who has tracked the effects of smoking bans, said the results were not surprising. Some restaurants see an increase, most experience little change, and bars tend to lose out.
More interesting, Professor Marlow said, are the unanticipated results: Maine's ban on smoking in bars that serve food has prompted some owners to scrap their menus. "You also see more purchases of take-out food by smokers," he said.
If anyone seemed likely to support the ban here, it would be Alice Rogers, 25, a student at Westminster Choir College.
"I'm sensitive to second-hand smoke," Ms. Rogers said after emerging from the Triumph. But she added: "About the ordinance, I'm against it. I think it takes away a freedom."

Tableware as History: You Are Where You Eat

BYLINE: By JENNIFER OLSHIN 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
FROM the Fairmont markets to antique fairs around the country, private dealers to eBay, Charles Venable has been collecting dishes. In under a decade, Dr. Venable, the deputy director and chief curator of decorative arts at the Dallas Museum of Art, and his staff have assembled an encyclopedic collection of ceramic and glass tableware used in America over the last century.
The culmination of this collecting adventure is the exhibition "Tabletop to TV Tray: China and Glass in America, 1880-1980," on view at the Newark Museum of Art. Presenting more than 500 examples of ceramics and glassware, period advertisements and archival photographs from both the Newark and Dallas permanent collections, the show traces the history of America's love affair with dishes. 
 With Steven G. Harrison, assistant curator of decorative arts at the Dallas Museum of Art, as co-curator with Mr. Venable, and Ulysses Grant Dietz, the Newark Museum's curator of decorative arts, as director, the show is a radical undertaking. It is a documentary of the dishes that ushered middle- and upper-class Americans through their daily lives. The 500-page exhibition catalog, written by Dr. Venable, Ellen Paul Denker and Dr. Katherine C. Grier, is a trove of reference material.
The exhibition is introduced to the visitor through a "great wall of china" -- a dazzling array of plates mounted on dozens of square, white-painted boards arranged in rows on a wall. Beneath each board, a shelf carries matching cups and saucers. A display technique used by department and specialty stores starting in the early 20th century, the great wall of china allowed potential buyers to assess a store's entire selection. At the Newark Museum, the recreated wall resembles a giant game board or puzzle and the viewer is invited to identify and relate individual pieces based on historical hints, personal memories or familial possessions.
Within this enormous genealogy of plates, Rockwell Kent's iconic image of the New York skyline is illustrated in a red-and-white design from 1937, derivations of the American Op-Art movement are captured in a frenetic Wedgwood design of 1968-69, and the German modernist aesthetic is portrayed in an abstracted pattern made by J. Uffrecht and Company around 1935. These wide juxtapositions reflect the influence of the complex and ever-shifting economic, political and social landscape on the American tablescape.
"Most people forget that very few Americans bought all white, pristine, high-art glass and ceramics; they wanted pattern and color, they wanted warm and cozy, the conservative and the balanced," Dr. Venable said. "We tried to put a different perspective on these objects by placing them side by side."
The exhibition presents the consumer as the dominant force driving foreign and domestic retail strategy in this country.
Throughout the 19th and early 20 centuries, the growing appetite for refinement at the table resulted in an increasing demand for large numbers of matching ceramics, glassware and specialized items like pressed glass pickle jars and asparagus tongs. Looking to their 18th-century English and Continental ancestors for stylistic inspiration, Victorian Americans consumed vast numbers of traditionally shaped, floral-painted services with gilded rims. The oyster plate, made by the French Limoges factory, Haviland and Company, for the Rutherford B. Hayes White House service, exemplifies these trends. So to does the enduring popularity of conservative motifs and revival styles marketed by Spode, Wedgwood and other 20th-century Staffordshire potteries.
Though traditions persisted, new players were gaining inroads into the dinnerware market in America. The war, the Depression and casual living contributed to new trends in dining. In the 1930's, table services contracted in size, practicality was emphasized and the color palette changed dramatically.
Furthermore, American producers gained their own constituency. Homer Laughlin China Company's sturdy and brilliantly colored Fiesta line, introduced in 1936, was an immediate commercial success. Fiesta shapes, with sturdy talc bodies and semireflective finishes, echoed the streamlined designs of Art Deco while its characteristic concentric circles suggested a traditional potter's wheel. Also selling by the millions were Russel Wright's sets of American Modern. Wright's pieces, many on view at the museum, were rimless, easy to stack and carried such innovative colors as sea foam blue, coral and chartreuse.
The 1930's were filled with new American pastimes, including card parties, and mah-jongg parties and ladies' luncheons, and the end of prohibition in 1933 had spawned the cocktail party. Magazines in this jazz age taught the public how to drink in the home, at country clubs and at hotels. The cult of the martini provided makers like A. H. Heisey and Company with boundless opportunities, such as elaborate ensembles of cut-glass decanters, stainless-steel shakers, glasses and swizzle sticks, while drinking Champagne inspired innovations like the champagne pitcher.
Not all modern experiments appealed to Americans. Eva Zeisel's boldly shaped Museum line from 1946 (hailed at the time by the Museum of Modern Art as "good design") is exhibited as a design that did not sell well. Summing up this phenomenon, Dr. Venable said, "Most museum curators in the past have been more fascinated by the avant-garde but this is not always in step with the culture at large."
While aesthetic preferences fluctuated, Americans were enamored of new materials if they facilitated the process of cooking, serving and storage. In the 1950's, manufacturers targeting this new wave of consumers became household names; Pyrex, the continuously improving shock-resistant glass, was ubiquitous by the 1940's and 50's, Moderne carafes kept coffee hot at the table, and "casserole dishes," encouraging oven-to-table service for buffet-style dinners, became the norm. Plastics, introduced in the 1930's exploded in the marketplace as Tupperware, Boontonware and even traditional manufacturers like Lenox and Fostoria, began producing millions of plastic wares. Examples of all these wares can be seen in the exhibition.
With the emergence of the barbecue and the TV dinner, expediency at the table became a dominant trend. Gerald Gulotta's Chromatics from 1970 were fantastically popular. With their alternating concave and convex components, they fit snugly on a shelf. But casual entertaining did not preclude the emergence of zany and theatrical designs based on broader decorative and fine-art movements. The giant sunflowers in Day-Glo colors seen in a Wild Poppy chop plate and coffeepot (made 1969-71) are influenced by both Scandinavian and indigenous American design initiatives and Mikasa's Millennium plate reflects Italian Memphis design.
Again and again, this exhibition surprises with its elevation of the everyday. As Ulysses Dietz put it, "It crosses the line into real life, not just curatorial life." Installed around the museum's rotunda, the exhibition seems to have no beginning and no end; one could just keep going in an endless circle of dishes.

HEADLINE: Expensive Sport Utilities Fall Short of Expectations

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN 

 BODY:
LUXURY sport utilities built on the underpinnings of trucks, as most are, tend to disappoint owners more than luxury cars -- and also more than a new breed of carlike "crossover" S.U.V.'s, according to two recent studies.
The consumer satisfaction studies -- by Strategic Vision and J. D. Power & Associates, two California-based research companies -- suggested that high expectations might be a factor in buyers' dissatisfaction. 
 "Luxury cars tend to provide some of the industry's highest-quality offerings," said George Owens, manager of product research at J. D. Power. "People who are coming from luxury cars are continuing to bring with them luxury-car expectations."
While most sport utilities, including luxury models like the Cadillac Escalade and Lincoln Navigator, have bodies fixed to truck frames, crossovers like the Lexus RX 300 and BMW X5 use one-piece unit bodies like most cars'. Crossovers also have suspensions and steering systems much like those of cars, compared with the rugged, often less sophisticated, systems of trucks.
 In a report comparing the RX 300 with traditional sport utilities and luxury sedans, Daniel Gorrell, vice president of Strategic Vision, said old-style S.U.V.'s did not deliver the attributes buyers sought and fell short of meeting owners' emotional needs. These buyers want a luxury vehicle that makes them feel in control, is able to handle anything, adds to the fun in their life and gives a sense of freedom, he said. "Yet these vehicles deliver less well on these dimensions than luxury cars or the RX 300," he said.
These truck-based luxury sport utilities scored lower than luxury cars in quietness, engine performance, ease of entry and exit, and particularly on fuel economy.
The 1998 and 1999 initial quality studies by J. D. Power indicated that consumers liked their luxury cars better, in general, than their luxury trucks.
One group in particular -- those who traded in luxury cars -- is even less happy with their fancy trucks. These consumers' complaints mostly related to the quality factors that the industry calls "fit and finish."
Several manufacturers have crossovers in the works, including Buick, Pontiac, Porsche, Saab and Volkswagen. Mr. Gorrell said crossovers "represent the birth of a significant new segment that can offer customers the best of both worlds."
One person who has also seen some disenchantment, but doesn't think it is a big problem, is George Petersen, president of AutoPacific Inc., another consulting firm. Luxury S.U.V.'s provide outstanding satisfaction, Mr. Petersen said, adding: "But it's not the same level of satisfaction as a luxury car, and it's a different kind of satisfaction. They are still based on trucks and don't have the same level of finesse as luxury cars." Owners take that into account, he said, "because, by golly, them are trucks."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST HARLEM;
Buses May Return to 101st Street, and Neighbors Are Riled

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL 

 BODY:
It is hard to find space in Manhattan for eight macaws. But Esther Sirol, a retired contractor, found a three-story brownstone on East 101st Street that could comfortably accommodate her and her grown daughter, Sonia, as well as the birds.
When Ms. Sirol moved there from East 65th Street in 1998, the large bus municipal bus depot a block away on Lexington Avenue was vacant. But in January, the Metropolitan Transit Authority began demolishing the depot, creating plumes of debris and dust. The agency plans to build a new $90 million structure. 
 But what has lingered in the air for her, Ms. Sirol said, is the sense that her investment in the neighborhood was for naught. "There are going to be buses going in and out, and who's going to want to stay here?" Ms. Sirol said.
Demolition should be completed this week. On Tuesday, the city plans to award a design and construction contract to the Perini Corporation of Framingham, Mass., to build a four-story building for storage, administrative and cleaning. There will be space for 133 articulated buses, the long ones with accordionlike middle segments. The project is expected to take two years.
Local officials and residents say the city has ignored their pleas to consider the depot's possible impact on a neighborhood struggling for economic rebirth.
But Albert W. O'Leary, a spokesman for New York City Transit, said, "Space is a premium in New York, and we are pretty much stuck with the space we have."
The 81,000-square-foot plot of land has been municipal property since 1895, when it was used for a trolley barn. The city had planned to rebuild the bus depot on 100th Street since it was closed in March 1998, Mr. O'Leary said.
But Councilman Philip Reed, whose district includes East Harlem, said: "The depot has never really been a very good neighbor. Historically it has really polluted the neighborhood."
Mr. Reed has urged the governor and the city to halt construction. In January, his office suggested that the transit authority consider expanding a depot at East 126th Street, but Mr. Reed said that idea was rejected.
Meanwhile, a competing vision for the land has emerged. Henry M. Calderon, president of the East Harlem Chamber of Commerce, said investors had shown serious interest in a plan to turn the site into a retail center with office space or middle-income housing.
"If we go ahead with the M.T.A.'s plan, we're throwing away and misusing valuable property," Mr. Calderon said. "East Harlem isn't a dumping ground anymore. It's part of an economic renaissance." NINA SIEGAL

HEADLINE: A Strange Brew's Buzz Lingersin Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif.

 BODY:
IN June 1975, a solitary computer hacker slipped quietly into a van in the parking lot of a local hotel, Rickey's Hyatt House, and "borrowed" a copy of Microsoft BASIC, the first commercial program from a tiny Albuquerque, N.M., company started by two other young hackers, William H. Gates and Paul G. Allen.
The van was on a nationwide tour to show off the MITS Altair 8800, one of the world's first personal computers. The program -- stored as a set of punched holes in a long paper tape -- was "liberated" to be shared by a rag-tag group of Silicon Valley computer hobbyists who that March -- 25 years ago this month -- had banded together as the Homebrew Computer Club. 
 The tape was handed to Dan Sokol, then 31, a semiconductor engineering manager who did what he thought was right.
"I made convenient copies for the members of the Homebrew Club, because I was the only one who had easy access to a paper tape reader," Mr. Sokol recalled recently.
The act outraged Mr. Gates, who saw nothing in the stunt but the outright victimization of his company, which then spelled its name "Micro-Soft." He wrote an angry letter to the computer hobbyists. "As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software," the letter said. "Hardware must be paid for, but software is something to share. Who cares if the people who worked on it get paid?"
This initial confrontation between Mr. Gates, then 20, and an anarchic cadre of programmers and hardware tinkerers was the forge of a basic tension that is still shaping the computer industry.
On one hand, the valley has long been motivated by what the author Michael S. Malone called "The Big Score" -- or more simply put, greed. Indeed, it was not long after the Homebrew Club's first meeting in Menlo Park that it began spawning companies -- with names like Apple, Osborne, Cromemco and Northstar -- owing their roots, directly or indirectly, to the enthusiasm that was captured in the initial club meetings.
On the other hand, the valley also continues to be driven by a more ethereal and in many ways purer motive -- what is called "the hacker ethic," a reference to the values of passionate programmers, and not, in a more modern definition of "hacker," to an outlaw subculture.
That ethos finds its clearest expression today in Linux software -- a freely available operating system that has been developed and supported by volunteer programmers and now has about a 25 percent share of the computer server market. It is also evident in the commitment of the so-called open source movement to the shared ownership and development of computing tools, and in the patent protection and copyright issues facing the music and e-commerce industries.
The PC industry "began with people who had a passion for computers," said Paul Freiberger, co-author of "Fire in the Valley: The Making of the Personal Computer" (McGraw Hill, 1999) "They were followed by people who had a passion for money. It's the mixture of those passions that defines Silicon Valley."
On a rainy night in March 1975, it was the original hacker spirit that captivated a small group of young men who were drawn early on to the potential of powerful personal computers. One of them, a Hewlett-Packard technician named Stephen Wozniak, has long maintained that he had no intention of creating a company when he built his first computer, but that he rather was intent on building a machine he could show off to the members of the Homebrew Club.
By happenstance, Mr. Sokol sat next to Mr. Wozniak at an early club meeting. "He bemoaned the fact that he couldn't get any parts to make his computer from H-P," Mr. Sokol remembered. "So I told him to come by my company, and I found a shoe box full of parts that became the components used in the first Apple I computer."
 There was no initial-public-offering gleam in either man's eye.
"We were interested in playing with toys," Mr. Sokol said. "People looked at our hand-wired computers and laughed at us and asked, 'What are you going to do with it?' "
THIRTY-TWO people showed up at the first meeting after a peace activist named Frederick Moore Jr. rode his bicycle around Palo Alto and Menlo Park, tacking up small 3-by-5-inch notices on bulletin boards and telephone poles.
"I slipped Fred $5 and he went to the copy store and printed up a bunch of fliers," recalled Gordon French, an engineer who along with Mr. Moore is considered a co-founder of the group and who held the first club meetings in his Palo Alto garage.
The tiny flier read in part: "Are you building your own computer? Terminal? TV Typewriter? I/O device? Or some other digital black magic box? Or are you buying time on a time-sharing service? If so, you might like to come to a gathering of people with like-minded interests. Exchange information, swap ideas, help work on a project, whatever . . ."
One person who saw the flier on a telephone pole was Alan Baum, who became an early employee of Apple Computer. He called his friend Mr. Wozniak, and the two agreed to attend.
In fact, Mr. Wozniak had already heard about the meeting from another friend, John T. Draper, even then a legendary figure in the Bay Area. Mr. Draper had been nicknamed "Cap'n Crunch" after he discovered that the whistle prize in the cereal box would unlock the AT&T long-distance system by generating a specific tone; he was considered a pioneer "phone phreak," part of a subculture of hobbyists who explored the inner workings of the telephone network in the 1960's and 70's.
Mr. Wozniak and his friend Steven P. Jobs had met Mr. Draper several years earlier, in Mr. Wozniak's dormitory room at the University of California at Berkeley. From him, they learned about devices called blue boxes that could be used to make free telephone calls.
Briefly, Mr. Wozniak and Mr. Jobs sold blue boxes. But after Mr. Jobs realized from the Homebrew Club meetings that there might be an enthusiastic market for PC's, the two men founded Apple Computer.
By the third meeting, the Homebrew Club was bursting at the seams and had outgrown Mr. French's garage. It ultimately settled for many years at the Stanford Linear Accelerator auditorium, where as many as 750 computer enthusiasts would gather twice a month.
Neither graphics nor sound were common computer features in those days, so when a hobbyist, Steve Dompier, demonstrated at the fourth meeting that he had laboriously programmed his new MITS Altair computer kit to play the Beatles' "Fool on the Hill," the assembly gave him a wild standing ovation.
TYPICAL Homebrew meeting began with a "mapping" session. The moderator -- for many years Lee Felsenstein, a political activist turned computer hardware engineer -- would point to people around the room, and each would describe what they were working on. A formal presentation would follow. The meeting would conclude with a "random access" session in which people with similar interests would cluster to share information.
It was at one such meeting, in the fall of 1981, that the transition from the hobbyist era of computing to today's booming world of corporate computing took place -- though virtually no one in attendance realized the shift.
Mr. Felsenstein pried open the case of the first I.B.M. PC, examined its motherboard and pointed with glee to three "blue lines" -- wires that were evidence, he proclaimed, of a hastily patched-together computer that had been rushed to market.
 It was a sweet -- if momentary -- vindication for the assembly that blended several hundred computer hackers with the vibrant counterculture and antiwar movement that had come to define the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1960's and 70's.
I.B.M., of course, overcame whatever early assembly problems it faced, and the broad sale of its PC's gave rise to an industrial explosion unmatched in American history.
The advent of the I.B.M. PC also marked the birth of the commercial software industry. Until its rise, software had been largely developed in the image of the Homebrew Club -- as a freely shared resource used to breathe life into computer hardware. Now it was being converted into a powerful economic force that would swiftly transform society. And Mr. Gates's software, in particular -- the operating system of I.B.M.'s machine -- secured a controlling position that it still has not relinquished.
So even today, an uneasy tension remains between the get-rich-on-Internet-time fever that has swept the valley and the original hacker ethic.
"Information wants to be free," said Stewart Brand, the author and social commentator who coined the term "personal computer" in 1973, "and information also wants to be very expensive."
Many of the new Linux start-ups -- companies like Red Hat and Corel -- are grappling with precisely that paradox by creating businesses in which new software is shared and free, while service and support are for sale.
MR. SOKOL'S career has mirrored the same tension. Shortly after the birth of Homebrew, he decided that it was time to get out of the semiconductor industry, which was then under assault from foreign competition.
"I could read the handwriting on the wall," he said. "I couldn't tell what it said, but I could see it was written in Japanese."
Although Mr. Sokol kept his passion for computers and continued to tinker with them, he left the industry and worked in the video business in Texas for a number of years. But he remained a close friend of Mr. Wozniak -- the two men have always found time to explore the latest computer technologies -- and in 1987 he was lured back to the valley as a software consultant.
Seated in his office recently in San Francisco's South of Market district, surrounded by three computer screens and three Macintosh computers, Mr. Sokol was the very image of the computer hacker, bearded and wearing a Hawaiian print shirt, baggy army pants and running shoes. But that also made him all but indistinguishable from most any Silicon Valley chief technology officer who had just closed the $9 million second round of financing for his start-up.
Indeed, with his partner Kirk Knight, Mr. Sokol has had a string of start-up ventures over the last decade -- a company to create interactive movies, for example, and a Web infrastructure company with technology to speed up the Internet. Neither was a success.
THEIR latest venture may have a much better chance of taking off. Called Cobaltcard, the company is marketing an Internet debit card for teenagers; it has solid financial backing and a tie-in with Visa, the credit card association.
If it succeeds, it will be because Mr. Sokol has managed to straddle the contradictions between the world of the hacker and that of the entrepreneur.
As in the Homebrew Club's early days, it remains an uneasy balancing act. Twenty-five years after Mr. Gates's broadside, Mr. Sokol is still righteous about those days of software anarchy.
"Bill Gates owes his fortune to us," he said. "If we hadn't copied the tape, there would never have been an explosion of people using his software."

The Lower East Side Seeks Honor for Humble Tenements

BYLINE: By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
Landmark designations typically reflect history's grandest aspirations: Grand Central Terminal, the Chrysler Building and Trinity Church are but a few examples.
But now several groups are seeking to bestow the honorific on the Lower East Side, an area better known for tenements that housed waves of working-class immigrants. 
 The proposed historic district would include the narrow corridor between Allen and Essex Streets from East Houston to Canal Streets. The district would also extend five blocks along East Broadway and include parts of Seward Park and its adjoining library. In total, it would encompass 31 blocks comprising more than 500 buildings, the oldest of which date back to around 1827.
The district already includes several official landmarks, including the Orthodox Eldridge Street Synagogue, built in 1887. But most of the structures are nondescript tenements from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, often built without private toilets.
The Lower East Side Business Improvement District, which submitted the proposal, says the designation is a way to honor the area's rich history and boost its economy.
"So many groups got their start here," said Andrew Flamm, the organization's executive director. "It was their first stronghold on American soil. Whether it's Park Avenue or this area, it is important to recognize that history."
Protestant families first developed the neighborhood in the 1820's, followed by German and Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. By the early 1900's, the area was considered the world's largest Jewish community. The district began to diversify in the 1920's as tides of Italians, Sephardic Jews and others settled into the tenements and took over the shops.
Renee Epps, vice president of the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, said that the area has continued to attract new immigrants, and today included recent arrivals from China, Malaysia, Russia, Puerto Rico and India.
Some community groups, however, expressed concern that the historic status could cause problems for current immigrants.
"Would it hinder the area or benefit growth?" asked Huey-Min Chuang, director of business outreach for the Chinatown Manpower Project. "I'm in favor of historical value, but I'm more interested in how it will help the area grow."
In response, Mr. Flamm pointed out that his group was not seeking designation as a city landmark, which would require approval for building changes, but rather recognition under the National and State Registers of Historic Places. It is "another means for us to promote this whole area," he said.
The proposal has the support of State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and several groups interested in New York history. Others, including Community Board 3 and Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, remain undecided.
"Now that the area is becoming prosperous, many of the old stores are getting kicked out," Ms. Freed said. "This could guarantee more of the same. In one sense, you are keeping the facade but changing the tenants." DENNY LEE

Apply Now. But Learn The Interest Rate Later.

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
IN recent years, consumers have found plenty of reasons to complain about companies that issue credit cards. High interest rates. Less time to pay bills (and hefty penalties for being a day late). Fees for exceeding credit limits. Balances computed in new ways, to the customer's disadvantage. New, sometimes more onerous terms when accounts are sold to another company.
Now there is another: difficulty in shopping for the best deal. 
 Since 1989, federal law has required that issuers disclose interest rates and other key conditions to potential card holders. But recently, various companies have taken to listing a wide range of rates for one or more of their cards and not committing to one until a credit check is made. It is akin to a rental car company asking for all sorts of information before it tells you how much it costs to rent a midsize car in Phoenix -- but then making you wait two weeks to find out.
No one is saying that the practice is illegal; indeed, it seems patently reasonable to base the cost of credit on a borrower's creditworthiness. But critics contend that listing multiple potential rates -- a practice called risk-based, or tiered, pricing -- is not what Congress intended.
"We are seeing a radical shift" in card marketing, said Ken McEldowney, executive director of Consumer Action, an advocacy group based in San Francisco. "Banks don't quote rates until it's clear whom they are dealing with. It looks like the free marketplace is being shuttered, replaced instead with targeted offers based on your credit history."
Some experts say that tailoring rates to creditworthiness may be a result of a welcome democratization of credit, in which consumers with black marks like garnishments or liens on their records are no longer necessarily rejected. "Even people like that now can get a credit card," noted Janis Smith, spokeswoman for the Comptroller of the Currency. The rise of the Internet, which brings applications from people who have had no pre-screening, has added to the incentive for lenders to keep offers vague.
Federal regulators say they have not received enough complaints for this issue to register; the 1,620 complaints last year over national banks' disclosures of credit card terms were mostly about rate increases on existing accounts.
Still, a consumer is at a disadvantage when applying for a card without knowing its exact terms. Comparison shopping becomes difficult.
Consider the Aria cards, Visa cards that Providian Financial offers only via the Internet. "You apply -- and then we tell you what you qualify for," Laurie Cole, a spokeswoman for Providian, said of the four types of Aria cards, which have interest rates of 7.99 to 23.99 percent. "In order to offer credit to such a broad spectrum of people, we need to know something about them."
Ms. Cole said that Providian's direct-mail solicitations, to people who have been at least minimally screened, offer only one rate, but that balance transfers still need to be, as she put it, "customized."
Wells Fargo also bases rates on its judgment of risk. Current rates for its three main credit cards are 12.75 percent, 16.15 percent and 18.15 percent. It typically takes two or three weeks after applying to learn which rate will be imposed.
The lesson, Ms. Smith said, is that consumers cannot assume that all issuers are alike -- or that they can skip reading the fine print.
"More and more banks are setting individual terms," she said.
A consumer who is stuck with an unattractive rate, however, has an option: canceling the card. He should not let it sit in his wallet; besides accumulating possible annual fees, the card represents potential borrowing power that could give other lenders -- say, for a mortgage -- distinct pause.

HEADLINE: Children of the Killing Fields

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
HE would try to catch some sleep between the press of bodies, sometimes 20 of them packed into the van. In winter, the windows fogged up with their heat. In summer, he couldn't distinguish the smell of other people's sweat from his own. On most mornings, someone squeezed onto his lap.
His name was Phalla Huoth (pronounced pa-LAH HOOTH). His Cambodian parents had brought their eight children to the Fordham section of the Bronx in 1985. They were fleeing a country in which nearly two million people had died at the whims of a dictator, a land where human bones jutted from the earth. 
 Whatever Phalla Huoth had once imagined about America, it certainly didn't entail getting up at 6 every morning, waiting for the factory van and sleeping on the 45-minute trip to New Jersey. The same van took him and his Cambodian co-workers back home at midnight. During the trips, he would slouch down in his baggy jeans and untucked shirt, a Yankees cap pulled over a face lightly scarred with acne.
Mr. Huoth, now 18, has gone through five minimum-wage factory jobs since dropping out of high school in 1998. Packaging bottles of body lotion. Placing eggs into a carton. Stocking shelves with boxes of pet food. It was all a blur.
"It's hard to survive here," he said. "I went through my childhood and didn't have any fun. I regret it. I never went through my teenage life."
He is one of thousands of children of Cambodian and Vietnamese refugee families who came to New York starting in the early 1980's. Most of the families gathered in the northwest Bronx, transforming the neighborhoods of Fordham, University Heights and Bedford Park into the city's largest concentration of Southeast Asians.
From 1983 to 1999, about three-quarters of the 2,000 Cambodian refugees who came to New York, and more than half of the 6,000 Vietnamese arrivals, were resettled in that area, according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services. (Nearly 40 Laotians were also relocated there.) Unlike most landlords in other boroughs, many in the Bronx kept rents cheap and allowed families of up to a dozen people to crowd into one- or two-bedroom apartments.
Today, after calculating births and recent migrations, the City Planning Commission estimates that 2,000 Cambodians and 5,000 Vietnamese live in the borough. And they are young. With families averaging six to eight children apiece, the 21-and-under generation makes up the bulk of the population.
For the most part, the teenagers deal with the same issues that other young immigrants do. Most of their families depend on welfare, they often encounter discrimination and they are sometimes hobbled by language difficulties, all as they confront the travails of adolescence.
But these young people also face a host of distinctive problems. Their families, uprooted from their tropical homelands, have farming skills that are useless here. Few community groups exist to help out new arrivals. And even if schools and workplaces offer bilingual programs or translation services, the Southeast Asians are so few that their language needs are seldom addressed.
Moreover, the parents, who have suffered greatly, often hide their past from their children, creating unspoken tension in the family.
Like many immigrant parents, they bristle when their children start doing things like dating, collecting Pokemon cards and listening to hip-hop music. But those same parents often refuse to talk about their history, even when their children witness their nightmares, insomnia and depression.
"For a lot of parents, it's not easy to express their feelings to their children," said Sarah Phok, a Cambodian mental health worker at Montefiore Medical Center in Fordham. "They hide their pain, and it's not easy to talk to your children about that unless you have support or someone to sit down with you."
 
The Terror of the 70's
If the Cambodian parents do discuss their past, they might begin with the Communist revolutionary named Pol Pot. After seizing power in 1975, he ordered his followers, the Khmer Rouge, to kill intellectuals, clear out cities and eradicate religion. By the time the Pol Pot regime collapsed in 1979, nearly a quarter of the country's seven million people had died. Hundreds of thousands of survivors fled to refugee camps in Thailand, just west of Cambodia.
Meanwhile, the North Vietnamese Communists triumphed in their war to unite the country. Saigon fell in 1975, the United States withdrew its military forces and hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese went into exile, many on makeshift boats.
Most of the Southeast Asian refugees who made it to New York arrived wearing slippers and carrying a single bag stuffed with clothing. Many young people came without fathers, who had been killed. Most of the adult survivors had the equivalent of a third-grade education. They had left behind verdant fields and slow-flowing rivers for a concrete labyrinth.
Phalla Huoth and many of the other children who boarded planes for the United States were too young to understand why they were being juggled from bombed-out villages to refugee camps to low-rent apartments halfway across the world. Others were born here shortly after their parents arrived, or came under the sponsorship of relatives.
Unlike Chinese and Korean immigrants, these Southeast Asian refugees landed in a city where their people had yet to build an infrastructure of neighborhood organizations, churches and other institutions that typically aid new arrivals. They had no enclaves like Chinatown or Koreatown, and no tradition of entrepreneurship. Even today, there are only two Cambodian grocers in the northwest Bronx.
Many Asian-American advocacy groups say that the "model minority" stereotype of Asian immigrants as hard-working overachievers has blinded society to the harsh conditions under which Southeast Asian refugees are living.
Those families are more dependent on welfare than are most immigrant groups. About three-quarters of 250 families polled in the northwest Bronx received some form of public assistance, according to a 1998 survey by the Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence, a Manhattan group that works with young people in the Bronx. A 1994 study by two research groups in Los Angeles found that nationally, Southeast Asians had the highest welfare dependency rate among all ethnic groups, with more than 30 percent of such households relying on welfare.
Many of the Bronx children have grown up working long hours in the garment industry, in nail salons or at factories in New Jersey. While this country may have provided their parents with a haven, the young people often say it has yet to meet the American ideals of economic and racial equality.
"America didn't give my parents what they expected," said Rom Chy, 17, a senior at DeWitt Clinton High School in Norwood. "It gave them a minimum. It gave them freedom, support from the government and the opportunity to live. They were satisfied with those, but I know this country has so much more to give."
 
Rats, Roaches and Reality
When Narin Prum and his Cambodian family first moved into their one-bedroom apartment in Fordham in 1984, rats and roaches scrambled across the floors. Pipes dripped water through the ceiling of a closet. Mr. Prum's baby brother became ill from eating peeling paint.
Their parents bought a sewing machine and set up shop in the living room, getting up at 7 a.m. and shutting down 14 hours later. Because space was tight, the family came to an arrangement. For two years, the parents would sleep in the bedroom and their five sons in the living room. Then they would switch.
"We still weren't as bad off as other families," said Mr. Prum, 17. "They had a lot of terrible stuff, like rusty water out of pipes. But that's reality."
His home was typical of those in which many Southeast Asians grew up. In the late 1970's, during a wave of white flight from the Bronx, one-bedroom units rented for under $200 per month. Landlords jumped at the chance to lease cramped and dingy apartments to refugee families.
In these mostly Hispanic neighborhoods, the Southeast Asian families have claimed a few spaces as their own. In Fordham and University Heights, there are two houses that have been converted to Cambodian and Vietnamese Buddhist temples. In warm weather, the swath of green known as Devoe Park becomes a meeting place for refugee families. Old men play cards, food vendors sell shish kebab, and parents and children unfurl picnic blankets a world away from their crowded apartments.
"If you were poor in Cambodia, you still had your own land," said Leang Kulen Lang, founder of the Cambodian temple in Fordham. "You had your mango trees and banana trees. Here, poor is really poor."
The young people quickly discovered a world outside their apartments. Narin Prum said his older brother, Sokhon, began skipping school and hanging out with two dozen other teenagers on the block. Flaunting baggy jeans and gold chains, they sat on doorsteps and smoked cigarettes.
"They saw school as boring," said Mr. Prum, who often wears the shirt-and-tie uniform of the Roman Catholic high school he attends on a scholarship. "They thought everything they needed was on the block. If they needed money, they could sell drugs or get a job at McDonald's."
The other boys made fun of Mr. Prum, taunted him for wearing glasses and not having $200 sneakers. He found comfort in family outings to Orchard Beach and the Bronx Zoo. He studied hard, determined to become the son who would make his parents proud.
His older brother moved to Philadelphia at 18 to make a clean break and take college classes. Mr. Prum stayed home, but he carved out his own niche away from his apartment and his family. He hung out with classmates from school. He joined a community outreach program called the Youth Leadership Project. And he began meeting several dozen other Southeast Asian teenagers for a football game every Sunday at Harris Field, near the Bronx High School of Science.
Sometimes boys got hurt when they slammed each other into the ground. Sometimes they formed rivalries. (One team dubbed itself the Factory Workers in an expression of blue-collar pride.) But it was their game, a game they started despite everything else that went on in their world. That was what mattered.
"Without this game, there would be no unity among the people who play," Mr. Prum said. "The game keeps us together, to make sure we stay as friends. The game represents a bond with all of us."
 
Thrust Into Adulthood
If being the oldest child affects one's destiny, then Linh Duong's fate was altered when an older brother she never knew died in infancy on the boat trip from Vietnam. He fell ill, and there was no medicine. His mother sat helpless among the waves, as torn up inside as the country she had just left.
Ms. Duong, 17, quiet with flowing black hair and a quick smile, was born the year her parents arrived in the United States. Perhaps being thrust into the role of eldest child made her more willing to watch out for those around her.
For the last few years, she has listened as other Vietnamese parents talk anxiously to her mother about being dropped from welfare rolls. Because the adults speak little English, Ms. Duong often calls their caseworkers for them. "No one ever picks up," she said. (A spokeswoman for the city said that the welfare center might have had telephone problems.) Ms. Duong has also heard other stories, such as the one about a woman who visited a local welfare center and was forced to wait for hours.
For refugees, welfare issues became more pressing after changes to federal and state benefit laws in 1996 resulted in many immigrants losing food stamps, cash assistance and health benefits. Those Southeast Asians who scrambled to apply for citizenship found few English-language and citizenship classes geared toward them. Add to that the chaos created by the state's welfare-to-work program, and the result was a population in turmoil.
Like many Southeast Asian children, Binh Ly, 18, and her five siblings grew up working alongside their parents to supplement the family's welfare check. The clatter of sewing machines was the music of their childhood.
From 1992 to 1997, the Vietnamese family used part of their two-bedroom Kingsbridge Heights apartment as a scrunchie factory, churning out the elastic hair bands seven days a week. The mother's feet swelled up from sitting at the machine until midnight, sometimes until dawn when a shipment was due.
The pay was not a fortune, but it was at least enough to survive on. When the family started, a Vietnamese contractor paid them $2 per dozen scrunchies. By the time the parents moved to Texas five years later to join relatives, they received half that.
Ms. Ly said her mother cooked only chicken because other meats were too expensive, and she forbade her children to go to the movies because the family could not afford the price of a ticket.
"I didn't like working all the time," said Ms. Ly, a Fordham University freshman who wears tortoise-shell glasses and speaks in energetic bursts. "On the weekends, my friends would go out, but I couldn't go with them."
"But I'm really good at making scrunchies now," she said with a grin. With nimble fingers, she showed how she used to put the fabrics together into a loop and then string a rubber band inside. After a few seconds, she held up the imaginary product. "There, you have a scrunchie."
 
Turning Off and Dropping Out
When Rom Chy was 11, he and a dozen other Cambodian youngsters spent a summer playing in the weed-infested backyard of a nearby apartment building. The boys joked with one another in Khmer, the Cambodian language. They built fires to grill hot dogs and raw meat. They boasted that they were a gang, and a gang had to have a name. They called themselves the Cambodian Connection.
Then summer faded, and Rom Chy returned to school. He knew his mother would punish him if he ever cut class. But he also knew the sacrifices his parents had made for the family. He had heard stories of the corpses they had stumbled across in Cambodia. Once, his father went to a lake to get water, only to find it filled with blood.
But the boy watched as seven of his friends from that summer dropped out of school.
"They felt socializing was better than school, where you've got racist kids and bad teachers," said Mr. Chy, 17, in a soft voice. "They thought school was nothing. Drugs would come into their lives. Then they would get stuck."
Keeping Southeast Asian teenagers in school is one of the biggest challenges facing teachers and community workers. Although there are no statistics on school attendance among Southeast Asians, there is general agreement that cultural hurdles, household stress and poverty have contributed to high dropout rates. The temptation to hang out with friends in pool halls and on street corners is always there, as are opportunities to earn money through low-wage labor.
"For some of the kids, their self-esteem was affected when they first came to this country," said Sister Mary Burke, who runs an after-school tutoring program at Theodore Roosevelt High School in Fordham. "They're in a new environment with a new language. Some of the parents, they need to support their children, but they might be overwhelmed with other things."
More than a decade ago, the principal of Theodore Roosevelt, which has 3,000 students, sought help from St. Rita's Asian Center, a group that helps refugees in the Bronx. Teachers had found that many Southeast Asian students were not adapting well to school.
In response, the center started a daily tutoring program. These days, the program helps young people from all backgrounds, but Vietnamese children are still the largest ethnic group, making up more than a fifth of the 133 students.
Even with such services, some community organizers say that School District 10, which covers the northwest Bronx, should try harder to provide interpreters for Southeast Asian parents. In the grades up to high school, Southeast Asians are the third-largest group in the district's English classes for non-native speakers, according to the Board of Education.
Last November, the Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence accused school officials of reneging on promises to print Khmer and Vietnamese flyers and to hire interpreters for parent-teacher conferences. Local youth staged a protest. School officials recently agreed to translate fliers and print a directory of interpreters for teachers to use.
Binh Ly said having interpreters at school might have helped her parents realize sooner that her older brother was dyslexic. Her mother would berate him for being "lazy and stupid," Ms. Ly said, but she never attended parent-teacher conferences because she couldn't speak English. Not until Ms. Ly interpreted for her mother at a meeting did her mother realize her son had a learning disability.
"It was really discouraging for my brother," Ms. Ly said. "He would get mad at himself. And I'm sure he's not the only one who's fallen through the system."
 
A Moment in the Spotlight
As the host this particular day, it was Phalla Huoth's job to work the crowd. He strutted across the stage of a former convent in Fordham, flashing the audience a smile as he announced the break-dancing show. He leaned over and clicked on a strobe light. The speakers thumped. The walls shook. Three of his friends began twirling on the floor.
Mr. Huoth had recently quit his latest factory job and was working a few hours each week at the Youth Leadership Project, an outreach group. On this bright, chilly afternoon, the members were giving a community party to celebrate 15 years of Southeast Asian history in the Bronx.
The menu included chicken curry and noodles. A show featured traditional Vietnamese and Cambodian dances. About 50 people, mostly teenagers, sat at tables in the cavernous meeting hall.
At the youth program, Mr. Huoth said, he had met "good people, people who go to school, different than the friends I hang out with." He swore never to go back to the factories. Maybe he would get a high school equivalency diploma. Maybe he would find another job soon.
But for now, there was the stage, the music, the crowd. The beat ended. Applause thundered through the room. Someone cut the strobe light, and he swaggered off the stage.
"I was waiting for this day," Mr. Huoth said after slapping a friend's hand. "I wanted to take part in something I could have fun in. And I wanted everybody to be involved. This is something special for me."

Will Chinese Food Go the Way of Pizza?

BYLINE: By JOEL KOTKIN; Joel Kotkin is a senior fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy. His column on the Main Street economy appears the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail: grassrts@nytimes.com

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.

 BODY:
IT is a long way from any kind of Chinatown to the Fashion Square Mall in this upscale Phoenix suburb. But to Richard L. Federico, the usually-packed flagship restaurant in the P. F. Chang's China Bistro chain, nestled close to Nordstrom's and convenient to the multiplex, is more representative of Chinese food's future than are the tens of thousands of mom-and-pop Chinese restaurants that pepper the Main Streets of America.
If he is correct, mass marketing, Wall Street financing and professional management will finally have broken through in what has long been a chain-resistant segment of the retail economy. Like independent department stores, local burger joints and dozens of other entrepreneurial businesses, the independent ethnic restaurant may soon find itself, if not headed for extinction, well on the way to marginalization. 
 In many ways, Chinese food has been one of the last redoubts. Donna Gabaccia, a historian at the University of North Carolina who examined the mainstreaming of ethnic food in her 1998 book, "We Are What We Eat," said Chinese food presents unique obstacles to mass marketing compared with, say, Italian or Mexican cuisine. Individually owned Chinese restaurants were among the first to offer fast orders, takeout and delivery, she noted, leaving little room for a franchise fast-food approach to take hold, as it did in hamburgers, chicken, pizza, tacos and other categories. And the complexity of Chinese food preparation, whose tools and techniques have little in common with European cuisine, makes it less susceptible to standardization.
Mr. Federico, president and chief executive of P. F. Chang, dismisses those concerns. "In this business, the attitude was that there was a Chinese restaurant on every corner, and the idea was you could not penetrate the Chinese segment," he said. "But they said the same thing about Italian 20 years ago."
Professionally managed companies made inroads long ago into other ethnic food categories, with mass chains like Chili's (Mexican and Tex-Mex, 637 restaurants) and Olive Garden (Italian, 464). In many suburban and Sun Belt communities, chains like these often became the standard-bearers for their categories, sometimes by default. Their success told Paul M. Fleming, founder of P. F. Chang and now a consultant to the chain, that "authentic" roots were far from a prerequisite for success in ethnic food.
Mr. Fleming, 45, had a background in chain restaurants, notably as owner and operator of several Ruth's Chris Steak House locations. On a business trip to Los Angeles, he once enjoyed a meal at the swank Mandarin Restaurant in Beverly Hills, but afterward could not find similar quality food in Phoenix, his hometown. He got in touch with Phillip Chiang, owner of the Mandarin, in 1992 and asked him to lend some culinary expertise to a new chain.
Mr. Fleming started with Mr. Chiang's recipes and ingredient-buying instructions, but he made some adjustments that he hoped would enhance the food's appeal to a more mainstream market. He concentrated on the most familiar menu selections, lowered the oil content a bit and aimed to hold prices to an average bill of $17 a person. He also developed an extended wine list, unusual in Chinese restaurants, and chose a sleek modern decor that avoided Chinese cliches.
Mr. Fleming believed that starting in a suburban mall rather than in a cosmopolitan urban setting would be a better way to test the concept for an eventual national rollout. "Phoenix may not be a recognized center for Chinese cooking," Mr. Fleming said, "but it is a good barometer for the rest of the country."
Opened in 1993 with a name that melds Mr. Fleming's initials and a version of Mr. Chiang's surname that Middle America could readily spell and pronounce, P. F. Chang's took off, and soon expanded to Southern California, the Boston area and to Westbury, N.Y., on Long Island. There are now 39 open nationwide and 13 in development. In 1996, with the chain growing and more managerial expertise needed, Mr. Fleming brought in Mr. Federico, 46, a veteran of the Bennigan's and Macaroni Grill chains of Brinker International, to run the operation with a new chief financial officer, Robert T. Vivian. Mr. Fleming remains on the board, and Mr. Chiang continues as a consultant and minor shareholder. The new executives took the company public in December 1998 at $12 a share; the stock closed on Friday at $32.75.
As Prof. Gabaccia might have predicted, the toughest challenge in expansion was transmitting cooking expertise to new chefs and staff members, especially because the chain had no intention of restricting itself to places where native Chinese workers could be recruited.
The responsibility for maintaining chainwide food quality falls on P. F. Chang's executive chef, Paul M. Muller, a German-American native of Oakdale, N.Y., with experience in the kitchens of the distinctly non-Asian Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Manhattan and the Old Ebbit Grill in Washington. Having been schooled in Chinese cuisine under Mr. Chiang's direction, Mr. Muller puts new chefs through six to eight months of training before giving them restaurants to run.
Only 8 of the 39 head chefs at P. F. Chang's restaurants are Asian. "The skills can be taught to gwei-lo's for sure," Mr. Muller said, using a Cantonese slang expression for Caucasians. "It just takes a different mentality and a kind of passion."
Critics of the chain approach say the mentality and passion are not so easily cloned, just as knowing how to daub paint doesn't make someone a pointillist. Theresa Lin, a of Chinese-food critic and a restaurateur based in Los Angeles, said P. F. Chang's and ventures like the New York-based China Grill could compete effectively only where mainstream diners have not been exposed to the work of native Chinese chefs.
"These kinds of businesses are good at marketing, but when the mainstream people discover the real authentic food, they will go for it," said Ms. Lin, who was born in Taiwan and now owns three upscale restaurants in Las Vegas, Miami and Santa Monica, Calif.
MR. FEDERICO concedes that at the luxury end of the spectrum, Ms. Lin may well be right. P. F. Chang's may never be the first choice of sophisticated diners who enjoy sampling Chinese fare in meccas like Manhattan, San Francisco, the Flushing neighborhood of Queens or the San Gabriel Valley east of Los Angeles. But as his chain expands across the country, Mr. Federico said he believes the great majority of consumers will come to think of the food at places like P. F. Chang's, not the traditional, mom-and-pop eateries, as setting the standard.
"In the future, for a lot of people of my kids' generation," he said, gazing out at the crowd in the Scottsdale dining room, "this will be the real definition of a Chinese restaurant."

Action Plan For a Reluctant Greenspan

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
FOR all those who doubt that a speculative bubble hangs dangerously over the economy -- and the doubters number in the tens of millions -- Robert J. Shiller's new book is sobering. He describes a market so out of control that the run-up in the Roaring 20's looks like a molehill, compared with the Mount Everest of the 90's.
Mr. Shiller, a Yale University economist, called his book "Irrational Exuberance," borrowing the phrase coined by Alan Greenspan in December 1996. The Federal Reserve chairman has tried ever since to soften stock prices, but investors -- that is, nearly half the population -- have laughed in his face. The Fed notches up interest rates and stocks rise anyway, as if they were an addiction like cigarettes or liquor, just as much in need of a warning label. 
 Posting such a label -- in this case, coming right out and saying that we are in a stock market bubble -- would be the sort of government intervention that Mr. Greenspan resists. But stocks today are greatly overvalued -- perhaps by more than $7 trillion, Mr. Shiller says -- and even free-market economists wonder about the efficacy of the Fed's interest rate strategy.
"Some of us believe that the speculation has gone so far that there is no easy or painless way out," said one such economist on Wall Street, Albert Wojnilower. "The question is whether to acknowledge this and open the floor to other solutions. That is what Greenspan would be doing if he declared that speculation is driving up stock prices."
Mr. Greenspan said in 1996 -- and he continues to say today -- that irrational exuberance might be driving up stock prices. But he has never stepped over the line and bluntly stated that it is. Instead, he has kept one foot firmly planted in the camp of those who regard the market's performance as rational. Rising productivity and the prospect of rising corporate profits, he says, bring investors tumbling sensibly into stocks in anticipation of future gains.
Mr. Greenspan has acquired enormous prestige for his astute nurturing of the economy in recent years. But he is in danger of dissipating that prestige by insisting on rational monetary policy -- the notching up of interest rates -- to discipline an irrational situation. Why should investors be deterred from borrowing money at 6 or even 10 percent, Mr. Wojnilower asks, when they believe that stocks bought with the borrowed money will go up 20 percent by year-end? Getting interest rates high enough to stop that fervor would bust the economy.
What would happen if Mr. Greenspan declared bluntly that irrational exuberance controls the market and is running roughshod over all the sensible reasons for owning stocks? For one thing, such frankness would encounter resistance. The Clinton administration, in an election year, prefers to view the market as reflecting corporate America's strength and profitability. And most Wall Street traders like Mr. Greenspan's current ambivalence.
But public recognition of the bubble might finally propel America into vigorous debate about ways to control the market fever.
THERE are a half-dozen remedies besides higher rates. On everyone's list is tightening margin requirements. Investors could be required to put up 60 or 70 percent of the purchase price of a stock, instead of the present 50 percent. Mr. Greenspan objects that small investors, the biggest users of margin debt, would be forced more than big investors to pull back. But they would also be saved from painful losses in a market sell-off.
Bank regulators could put up another obstacle to the purchase of securities on credit. They could require banks to increase the capital that backs such loans, which by one measure rose to $23.4 billion in February from $18.1 billion just last November. The government, in effect, would be allocating credit, a role shunned in Washington today.
A transaction tax on all stock trades, of the sort once proposed by James Tobin, the Nobel laureate in economics, would slow trading. So would an old Warren Buffett idea: a 100 percent capital gains tax on stocks held for too short a term, say less than a year. That would encourage people to invest for the long term, more cautiously.
The so-called suitability rules could also be extended. These require brokers to check that a customer's investment goals are in line with his income, net worth and the like. A broker is bound by the rules to discourage a grandmother from sinking all her savings into a profitless Internet company. Suitability rules do not now cover day traders and online investors, though formal proposals already exist to extend them.
Remedies like these might sap the speculation without bringing down the economy. But even proponents worry that it is already too late to prevent a damaging market crash or a painful sell-off -- the denouement in the past of speculative bubbles that have gone unrecognized for so long.

The Idea That Almost Got Away

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
NINE years after patenting a helicopter-deployed fishing net, Kent Thomas finally went fishing last month in New Zealand's Bay of Plenty.
Mr. Thomas, a veteran helicopter pilot, used a specially designed net to encircle a cloud of fish called trevally. The fish had little to fear, though, because the net's closure mechanism failed. Mr. Thomas had been waiting six months for the right fishing conditions while his net sat idle at an airfield; unknown to him, grass had grown through some of the lines and snarled them. 
 Disappointments and delays don't faze Mr. Thomas, an entrepreneur who has nursed his idea for an environmentally friendly fishing net with persistence, self-sacrifice and a willingness to change course.
Even though it failed to capture any fish, the "drop net" developed by Mr. Thomas's Ocean Friendly Company of Signal Hill, Calif., is described by some people in the fishing world as a breakthrough. Moreover, fishing regulators, who helped finance the net, consider it an economically and environmentally promising alternative for an industry facing restrictions on more and more declining species.
"This is the first real innovative fishing technique in decades," said James M. Meehan, a tuna biologist for the National Marine Fisheries Service, which imposed curbs last April on coastal catches of shark, Atlantic tuna and marlin.
When dropped from a helicopter, the net forms a sort of mid-ocean aquarium. A 38-foot-wide hexagonal ring of floats supports a strong, light cylindrical net weighted at the bottom. Five tons of fish may be caught when the three-story cylinder is twisted closed.
In earlier tests, the net had closed properly, but in empty water. The latest test failed to trap fish permanently, but it did show how they would react inside the enclosure.
"It was an unknown," Mr. Thomas, 54, said in a telephone interview from New Zealand. "They were just swimming; they didn't have a clue!"
As a boy growing up on California's Santa Catalina Island, he saw firsthand the collapse of sport fishing as commercial fleets depleted the waters of bait fish. After serving in Vietnam as an Army helicopter pilot, he flew commercially, spotting fish for tuna boats. Wasteful methods -- the indiscriminate killing of juvenile fish and protected species along with the desired catch in mile-long purse seine nets -- galvanized him.
He designed a net to improve a boat's yield of a single species. Traditional nets kill the fish they snare, but the drop net keeps them alive, allowing unwanted fish to be sorted out and returned to the sea.
And though the net's potential volume is less than that of traditional nets, its live catch is suitable for aquariums, sea farming or demanding sushi chefs, and thus has higher value. The concept was endorsed by the executive director of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission in La Jolla, Calif., which sets fishing limits in the eastern Pacific.
Ocean Friendly got a $170,000 federal research grant for the project, one of the few backed annually by the Commerce Department. Reducing the "bycatch" -- unintended netting of dolphins, sea turtles and other species -- is a top concern of the agency's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
"We're just funding the best of the best," said Joseph M. Bishop, a Commerce official. "Japan is at the cutting edge," using infrared imaging devices to seek the birds and dolphins that are a telltale sign of tuna, he said.
Ocean Friendly's prototype nets, finished in September 1998 by Ocean Spar Technologies, a Seattle maker of sea cages, met a chilly reception from American fishermen.
Mr. Thomas thinks that an unwillingness to try new methods unraveled a pledge by a Tacoma, Wash., shipowner to permit a crucial sea trial of the drop net from one of its tuna trawlers. When the company stopped returning his calls, Tom Meneghini, an Ocean Friendly vice president, met the boat as it pulled into dock in Guam in December 1998. "There's no way that drop net is coming aboard," the boat captain told him, according to a report Ocean Friendly filed with the Commerce Department.
The fishing company's president, Joseph S. Martinac, said the test was aborted because of potential liability issues as well as the skipper's reluctance.
AS Ocean Friendly scrambled for another option, and the money to pay for a demonstration, Commerce officials agreed to let the net be tested outside American waters. Mr. Thomas settled on New Zealand, where migrating fish often school close to land; he calculated that a helicopter could carry a net a few miles from shore to the fish; no reluctant boat captains would be involved.
Tangled lines did not figure in his thinking, however. Nor did running out of money. When the grant ended in September, Mr. Thomas tapped some of his 28 private investors. For his personal needs, his sister lent him $400. He raised $4,000 by selling his Volkswagen van.
"I'm always concerned he's going to starve to death," said Leon La Porte, a Commerce official. "We funded him as far as we can," he said, adding that Mr. Thomas has resisted fresh rounds of venture capital to avoid ceding control.
Other governments may help. The Green Party of New Zealand wants the minister of fisheries to consider support for Ocean Friendly and has scheduled a presentation. Indonesia, which granted Ocean Friendly fishing licenses, has also asked for a presentation from Mr. Thomas.
But none of this is certain. "I'm having difficulty getting a read on the potential for support from the governments of New Zealand and Indonesia," Mr. Meneghini said. "They are long shots, in my opinion."
During the years that Mr. Thomas has been proving his concept, new methods for managing fish resources have been emerging -- a change that could benefit his company. Besides the familiar Norwegian salmon farms, aquaculture is taking hold in countries like the Philippines, Australia and Japan.
Gary F. Loverich, chairman and senior engineer of Ocean Spar, says the drop net -- which his company made for $18,000 -- is a reasonable fit with aquaculture, particularly for countries short of cash. "You don't have to buy big boats," he said.
Mr. Loverich figures that Ocean Spar will soon be making Ocean Friendly nets. "This would not have happened without Kent," he said. "He's got a Ph.D. in tenacity."

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.;
For Putin and Markets, the Hard Part Starts

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
BORIS G. FEDOROV, the former Russian finance minister and one-time head of the state tax service, knows an expatriate Russian couple who put a large chunk of their money into Russian stocks in December. Since then, they have doubled their stake and bought a house.
Unfortunately for Americans, who have probably been avoiding volatile Russian stocks, the couple's good fortune means that much of the easy money has been made. 
 The market rally has come as the Russian economy is rebounding from its plunge during the financial crisis of August 1998, when the ruble was devalued and the government defaulted on its foreign debt. The Russian economy grew 3 percent last year -- a pace that is expected to continue, if not accelerate, this year. The turnaround was spurred by a tripling of oil prices, which also bolstered government revenue, and the ruble's devaluation, which made domestic companies more competitive.
Investor interest is also perking up. For example, cash flow into the $68.6 million Lexington Troika fund, which invests in Russia, was a heavy $9.1 million for the first two months of the year, according to Lipper estimates. The Morgan Stanley Dean Witter office here, headed by Rair R. Simonyan, a Russian investment banker, will be host for a conference for foreign investors in mid-May. And last week, the head of the Russian Federal Property Fund, which controls the remaining government stakes in Russian companies, met with potential investors in London and New York.
This year's rally, however, may have more to do with the New Year's Eve resignation of the unpredictable Boris N. Yeltsin as president. The Russian Trading System Cash index jumped 17 percent in the wake of the announcement and is now up 39 percent for the year.The stability that people see coming with the expected election today of the acting president, Vladimir V. Putin, has also helped.
Some analysts here say the stock-market rally was powered by local investors just waiting to sell when foreigners piled back in. In any event, much of the good news is already in the market.
Once the election ballots are counted, a new uncertainty may emerge: Will Mr. Putin be a reformer, and, if so, can he make the changes he wants? The needed tax, regulatory and legal reforms are daunting. There is corruption to deal with, and the rich and powerful oligarchs. Mr. Putin has been difficult to gauge; no one can say what he will do about these issues.
Alexander Kim, Morgan Stanley's strategist for Russia, said people were still uncertain about who, precisely, the new policy makers would be and what reforms would be carried out. "It is always implementation that has failed," he added.
Mr. Fedorov, now an author, said, "Once oil prices go down and devaluation effects go away, things will be tough for Putin."
"More stability will not carry the market," he added, referring to investors' hope that Mr. Putin's strong hand will prove enough to keep stocks rising. "By the end of the year, there will have to be other actions."
Dmitri V. Vasiliev, the former head of Russia's version of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has a long list of what the country needs, including laws and regulations that treat investors and companies equally, lower taxes and improved collections.
Now the head of a shareholders rights organization, backed by institutional investors with $10 billion in Russian stocks, Mr. Vasiliev said, "Today, rules are so unclear that there are so many opportunities for bribery."
Before the financial crisis, he said, investors looked at Russia through "rose-colored glasses" and bought everything; after the crisis, Russia was viewed through "black glasses" and nothing was bought. Now, he said, investors need to ponder opportunities here through "clear glasses."
That means "deep investment analysis" of companies is necessary, he said, especially concerning the honesty of executives and any links to the oligarchs or organized crime. Foreign investors face not only the risk of a tumbling stock market, but also of maneuvers by Russian executives that could undermine the value of a company or dilute the value of a stock.
That kind of analysis, he allowed, "is not easy, of course."

HEADLINE: Alleviating Famine

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Natural Born Killers" (column, March 22), Paul Krugman overlooks two important points when offering genetically modified foods as an "escape" from poverty and starvation in developing countries. 
 First, the economist and Nobel laureate Amartya Sen has demonstrated conclusively that famine does not result from underproduction of food, but rather from distribution problems. Second, the multinational companies developing these genetically modified crops have patented the crops, which drives up seed prices. Genetically modified food does not offer a solution to poverty.

HEADLINE: Merrill's Bull in China's Shop

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
ON a sultry Sunday evening earlier this month, Taiwanese death-metal rock music echoed from a party in a hillside apartment far above the ribbon of headlights snaking through the skyscrapers below. The living room was emptied of all but a couch, a table and a couple of pairs of socks balled up in the corner. Over the din, a dozen young Internet entrepreneurs swapped business plans and financing tips, gushing over the millions they hoped to make when their companies went public.
Such soirees were unheard of a year ago, as was Matei Mihalca, an Internet analyst from Merrill Lynch who was the host of these festivities. His unbridled enthusiasm, and his embrace of the Net culture, have quickly made him a favorite among Asia's new cyber jet set. That and the fact that he can help make them all very, very rich. 
 "Ehr-fei! You have to meet these guys!" Mr. Mihalca shouted across the room, charging toward Ehr-fei Liu, a Merrill technology banker, two Web design executives in tow. "They already beat their revenue forecasts for the year. This is a real growth story! Huge. I mean huge! This company is all about opportunity!" Then the cell phone in his pocket rang, and Mr. Mihalca walked away, lost in the next big opportunity, leaving the three men behind to exchange awkward hellos.
Asia is sick with dot-com fever. But no one has the bug so badly as American investment banks hoping to take Asia's new Internet companies public. Asian economies, left for dead two years ago when the tumbling dominoes of a currency crisis brought the region's growth to an abrupt halt, are being reinvented overnight. Or, at least, Asia's stock markets are. As many as 50 Internet concerns in countries like China, India and Singapore are likely to go public this year alone, more than double the number that did so last year. Fueling that boom is the rising number of people in Asia going online, projected to more than triple over the next four years.
Expectations like those attract opportunists. So for investment banks that largely missed the technology boom in the United States over the last five years, lagging behind the powerhouses Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Goldman Sachs, Asia has become a place to reinvent themselves, too.
Merrill Lynch is among them. The technology practice of Merrill, one of the world's biggest brokerage firms, pales when compared with its peers over that period. Merrill ranks seventh worldwide in the number of Internet businesses it has taken public, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. One reason is that Merrill has been slow to foster the oversized personalities necessary these days to attract high-profile, big-name clients. It has no technology analysts, for example, with the renown -- and entree -- of Mary Meeker, who helped put Morgan Stanley's practice on the map.
But with Asia awakening to the Internet, Merrill sees the possibility for a fresh start. "The idea was: It's a land grab, and we wanted to be there," said Adam Quinton, Merrill's former head of Asia-Pacific research, who now helps coordinate telecommunications research in New York.
So last year, Merrill began the task of grooming Mr. Mihalca into an Internet celebrity. He seems the unlikeliest of candidates -- a 30-year-old former Communist from Romania with no technology background to speak of and little finance expertise. Even his mother is surprised at the transformation. "It is something of a paradox that somebody who was raised in a Communist state went on to work for a Wall Street firm," said Doina Bochis, who still lives in Romania. "He was always so literary, like me, with a very strong, developed mind."
But he is eager, and willing, to avail himself of a public and a business culture chasing dot-com fantasies. Mr. Mihalca is a tireless traveler who visits as many as 25 companies a week and often takes the lead in wooing potential clients into Merrill's fold. If he is successful, it will mean millions of dollars in lucrative initial public offering fees for his firm, and a bigger salary for him.
His hunger to put Merrill Lynch and himself on the map, though, raises a fundamental question for investors in both Asia and the United States who rely on analysts like him to be their trail guides through the vast plains of the Internet's Wild Wild East: When does boosterism end and critical analysis begin?
Even in the United States, the line between research and salesmanship -- that is, between the traditional roles of stock analyst and investment banker -- has blurred. Here, it has all but been erased.
Mr. Mihalca has no quibble with that. "In many places, people think this is a conflict," he said. "I see it as working together." If he doesn't believe in a company, he added, he simply won't recommend taking it public.
Such boldness concerns those who see Asia's Internet market as immature and driven mostly by hype.
"I remember reading a report from a guy talking about philosophy and love, and that's because analysts are at a complete loss," said J. Mark Mobius, who as managing director of Templeton Asset Management has spent years searching the world for undiscovered companies.
It is more difficult finding sound investments in Asia, because there is little in the way of a venture capital community to ferret out the best ideas, he said. The danger is that untested businesses will be sold to a ravenous public, with only investment bankers as a buffer against speculative excess.
It is too early to tell if Merrill's gamble on Mr. Mihalca will pay off. So far, he has yet to make any headline-grabbing stock predictions like those of his American colleague Henry Blodget, who made his name more than a year ago by predicting that Amazon.com would hit $400 a share months before it did.
And it may not be long before Mr. Mihalca follows in the footsteps of other Merrill up-and-comers who have left for venture firms or dot-com companies. He has been approached by a handful of start-ups, and rivals say privately that in the past he has talked about making a switch.
Opportunism, after all, is not just for institutions. "Now that there is attention being paid to this one sector, there is a pedestal to step on," said Jay Chang, who competes with Mr. Mihalca as an Internet analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in Hong Kong. "So, why not?"
 
The Analyst as Salesman
It was 1:15 p.m. on March 8, a Wednesday, and the last day of a technology conference Merrill had put on for Asian investors. Mr. Mihalca was nowhere to be found. A dozen or so journalists were milling around the ballroom lobby of the Island Shangri-La Hotel, eagerly awaiting his arrival at a news conference. Mr. Mihalca, nicknamed "the mad scientist of Internet analysts" by colleagues because of his quirky ideas, was found napping on a couch. The reason? He had spent all night writing a research report on an Internet portal company that Merrill was hoping to take public.
"It is an experiment in selling," Mr. Mihalca said of the report after he showed up in the lobby, quaffing a cup of coffee as he rubbed sleep from his bloodshot eyes.
For an analyst, Mr. Mihalca talks a lot about selling: selling stocks to investors, selling companies on Merrill, selling himself to all of them. In February 1999, just when the cyberworld in Asia was beginning to take off, Merrill needed a bold and articulate spokesman to better its image among journalists and potential clients. "The objective I gave him was to raise his profile in the corporate world as quickly as possible," Mr. Quinton said. "If someone wanted to interview someone who was knowledgeable, he would be the person the media turned to."
Never mind that his relevant experience was limited. He was a fluent Mandarin speaker and well-versed in Asian culture and politics, a necessity in countries where government and business are so closely intertwined. And he showed an early affinity for writing; his father was a journalist in Romania.
After a brief stint at the United States Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan, Mr. Mihalca was hired by Merrill in 1997 as an analyst. He was not a natural fit at first, so was hired on a temporary basis, Merrill executives said. But he showed promise, particularly as a skilled networker. "He seemed to know more people in Taiwan in one year than I did in 10," said Peter Kurz, the director at Merrill in Taiwan who hired him. "He is disarmingly honest, and people trust him for that reason." After first covering the semiconductor industry, he was appointed head of Asia-Pacific Internet research last year.
Soon after that, Merrill began its Mihalca campaign. He was introduced to reporters at major media outlets, some of whom he knew already from his stint freelancing for The Asian Wall Street Journal. Merrill took out newspaper advertisements touting his research and included his e-mail address. He made himself a regular visitor to the CNBC studios on the 25th floor of the Asia Pacific Finance Tower in central Hong Kong, eight floors above his own humble cubicle.
"I promote myself," he said unabashedly in a recent interview. Last month, he moderated an hourlong panel on CNBC Asia about the Internet there. That was a result of an elevator conversation with a "Squawk Box" anchor, Bernard Lo.
And he always returns reporters' calls. When America Online and Time Warner announced plans to merge in January, for instance, he was disturbed at midnight by a reporter seeking comment.
"I was happy about that," Mr. Mihalca said. "You have to put yourself in the customer's shoes."
But who, in fact, are Mr. Mihalca's customers? Some may still think that analysts are the eyes and ears of investors, or at least their brokers. But in truth, analysts like Mr. Mihalca labor to suit the companies their bankers court.
Thomas Rosenthal, a fan and president of MeetChina.com, a business-to-business Web site in China, said of Mr. Mihalca: "I see him as a salesman. He is out there getting the business." Mr. Mihalca recently offered to broker an introduction between MeetChina executives and a potential partner interested in setting up a joint venture. He is also a trusted confidant; after an investor meeting, Mr. Mihalca said he gently suggested that a MeetChina executive refrain from talking about his colleagues' wives.
Mr. Mihalca connects with young entrepreneurs in tradition-bound Asia because he, like many of them, is an outsider. On a recent Sunday morning, Mr. Mihalca, along with his Taiwanese wife, Ching-Fang Hu, and Rajesh Jain, an Indian entrepreneur who recently sold his Internet company for $115 million, took the ferry from Hong Kong island to Kowloon for breakfast. The two men had met only once last October, but they greeted each other with smiles and a hearty bear hug.
"When I first met Matei, we talked for three hours at a Bombay hotel," Mr. Jain said over a breakfast of Egg McMuffins (a favorite of Mr. Mihalca's) and coffee. "I met someone who was as excited as I was and really understood what I wanted to do."
Such exuberance is rare on Wall Street. One colleague teased that David Komansky, Merrill's chief executive, would grow pale if he knew about the all-nighters Mr. Mihalca spent at the office. Mr. Mihalca waves goodbye with two hands, and the floor shakes under his gait as he runs down the hall.
"Personally, I think there is something neurologically wrong with him," joked Duncan Wooldridge, a Merrill senior economist in Hong Kong. "One of the great things is that his excitement and enthusiasm are contagious. He likes to talk about ideas. If you don't have free time, don't go by his desk."
But can Mr. Mihalca adapt his style to more traditional clients, particularly as the Internet sector matures? His discomfort with established society became apparent hours after his meeting with Mr. Jain. Mr. Mihalca and his wife were invited to the exclusive Hong Kong Jockey Club for a private party held by Champion Technology, a multibillion-dollar communications concern. It was Derby Day, the equivalent of the Kentucky Derby in the United States. Clearly Mr. Mihalca was not on familiar terrain.
"Nice carpet," he said sarcastically, pointing to the burst of purple and orange on one of the floors. The guest list was a who's who of Hong Kong's diplomatic corps and business society. They had arrived in private cars, while Mr. Mihalca took a cab because he missed the train. His khakis and tweed jacket looked pedestrian compared with other guests' tailored suits and dresses. And while Champion's chairman, Paul Kan, held court with older, more polished investment bankers, Mr. Mihalca was briefly introduced when he arrived.
To him, the business culture of the jockey club's patrons was a curiosity to be studied and understood. Theirs is a social structure being displaced by newer entrants. And to comprehend where society was going, one had to understand from where it had come.
"Sure, I felt more comfortable this morning with Rajesh," he said later, during the cab ride home. "But you have to understand this world, too. You can't turn your back on them just because it is not comfortable."
 
'I Am a Lone Cowboy'
Mr. Mihalca was born on April 5, 1969, an only child, and lived in the small Romanian mountain town of Baia Sprie, 100 miles from Bucharest. Food was scarce under the tyranny of Nicolae Ceausescu, and the lights in young Matei's house ran on a car battery.
He remembers his mother, a hospital psychiatrist, treating "depressed people who swallowed detergent and stuff." (His stepfather, Mircea Bochis, an artist, married his mother 24 years ago.)
"I am a lone cowboy," Mr. Mihalca said. And at times that has cost him.
"He had problems in school because he spoke against the system," his mother recalled. "He presented himself openly as an anti-Communist. I always said, 'Shut up! Be quiet!' "
Despite his views, Mr. Mihalca joined the Communist Party in 1988. If he hadn't, he said, he might have missed the opportunity that has defined his career: a chance to study Chinese in Beijing in 1989, as one of a handful of students plucked from the University of Bucharest for a summer exchange program.
Turmoil seems to chase him, or he, it. Then just 20, he arrived at the Beijing Language Institute on June 7, days after the massacre at Tiananmen Square. Armored vehicles rolled past his dormitory-room window. Many foreign students had returned to their embassies, and as their mail piled up in the dorm lobby, he spent his summer skipping classes, reading Western magazines and learning to ride a bicycle. Six months later, back in Baie Sprie, he and his family huddled around a television set and watched the Ceaucescu government crumble.
Mr. Mihalca returned to Beijing and was later accepted into a doctoral program at Harvard University to study history and East Asian languages. He spent five years there but never finished his dissertation. In Cambridge, too, he had a difficult time getting along. Nikolas Gloy, a Harvard friend and next-door neighbor, said Mr. Mihalca openly criticized the research of fellow students and corrected the grammar of native Chinese speakers.
When pressed to reflect, Mr. Mihalca acknowledges that those were not happy days. "Being a Romanian guy studying Chinese in America did not work that well," he said. He paused for a moment, deep in thought, the memory seemingly raw. "In a way I am like my father, somewhat cold. I do not feel the need to be sentimental about my past."
If anyone best understands Mr. Mihalca, it is probably his wife, Ms. Hu. The two met in Taipei in 1997, where she was editor in chief of Playboy Taiwan, for which she now consults.
Having a dialogue with society is important to her husband, she said. And at Merrill Lynch, he gets the attention he craves. "He has a childish side -- like a baby, naughty," she said. "He needs a lot of love. He is like a complicated child who is always thinking, and it is hard to get to the heart of where his mind is."
 
How Long Can a Star Shine?
It is still early in the race to take Asia's Internet industries public. Among investment banks, Lehman Brothers, an also-ran in the United States, has captured much of the attention here so far with two high-profile offerings last year. One was for Chinadotcom, the other for Pacific Internet. Ravi Sarathy, Lehman's chief Internet analyst and an early dot-com celebrity in Asia, played a key role in attracting that business.
Like many other Wall Streeters, he has since departed to create his own online start-up. But he remains a consultant to Lehman clients.
Other aspects of the banking business here are as peculiar. Some analysts are also entrepreneurs. Eric Gan, who works for Goldman Sachs Japan, is also co-founder of eAccess Ltd., an Internet service provider in which Goldman has invested, said a spokeswoman for the firm.
As long as Internet stocks keep going up, there seem to be few complaints about such arrangements. The real test will come when companies begin to stumble. Then, the true Internet stars will shine, the analysts and bankers who can separate the novas from the black holes.
Clients and investors say Mr. Mihalca's strength is understanding a concept -- and, even better, marketing it. But as the investing world comes to focus more on revenue and profits, the ability to sell a story will hold less appeal. Then the plodding, less glamorous, but more incisive analysis will prevail.
That may prove uncomfortable to Mr. Mihalca and others like him who are making young Asian entrepreneurs rich today, but will be duty-bound to chastise them if they fail to execute.
"If it were to happen, it would be a personal disappointment," Mr. Mihalca said. "You invest a lot of time and energy and personal commitment." But by then, he added, he may have a large-enough staff to help him work through the numbers. "How I delegate the nitty-gritty to our team members," he said, "is something I will have to learn."
He is acutely aware that if Asia's Internet companies fail to deliver, his 15 minutes in the spotlight are up. But in this market, where everything is a "buy," he does not seem to worry.
"If you pick companies that go up in flames, well, it is everyone who goes up in flames," he said. "Then it is not about you anymore. The story is fairly sound. If the Internet as a whole doesn't work out, it is not my problem."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS: A Weapon for Consumers;
The Boycott Returns

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
NOT since the 1970's, when grape workers and the anti-apartheid movement were holy causes for millions of Americans, have so many groups embraced the boycott as a weapon.
In the most prominent boycott in years, the N.A.A.C.P. has called on tourists and conventions to shun South Carolina to pressure that state to remove the Confederate flag atop its Capitol. Also facing an N.A.A.C.P. boycott, the Adam's Mark luxury hotel chain agreed last week to pay $8 million, seek minority customers and give its employees diversity training to get the boycott dropped and to settle race discrimination lawsuits brought by some offended black guests and the Justice Department. 
 Gay groups have proposed a boycott of Paramount over a planned television show starring Dr. Laura Schlessinger, who has called homosexuals "biological errors" and "sexual deviants." Groups seeking to restore democracy to Burma are sponsoring boycotts against Best Western, Unocal, Suzuki and other companies that do business there. Among the companies that labor unions are boycotting is Kaiser Aluminum, which locked out 2,900 unionized workers 14 months ago. And the Southern Baptist Convention is pressing a boycott against Disney, charging that it is too sympathetic to gays.
"The times may be ripe for more consumer boycotts," said Jeff Faux, executive director of the Economic Policy Institute, a research group in Washington. "We have more of a consumer culture, and people see themselves more as consumers today. While people are participating less in the political process, as consumers they see that one way they can exercise power is by where they spend their money and where they don't."
The boycott takes its name from an economic war waged by Irish farmers in the 1880's against an English land agent, Charles Cunningham Boycott, who refused demands to cut rents during a time of poor crops. Their subsequent refusal to work his land or sell him goods forced him to return to England.
In the late 1880's American farmers were already shunning railroads charging exorbitant rates. In 1885 alone, American labor unions carried out 196 official boycotts.
One boycott that made a profound impression on 20th-century America was the Montgomery bus boycott, which came after Rosa Parks famously refused to sit in the back of the bus in 1955 because she was black. Since then civil rights activists have repeatedly embraced boycotts. Two months ago, the television networks agreed to increase minority hiring after the N.A.A.C.P. threatened a boycott, charging that few shows featured minority actors.
But sometimes boycotts, which require organization and consumer awareness, fail. Most Americans do not realize that the United Farm Workers' 1984 grape boycott remains in force. Begun when growers refused to sign new union contracts, it has largely failed because the union stopped promoting it when it failed to catch on. Union officials say it remains in effect because lifting the boycott would give a victory to the grape growers. In sharp contrast, the original boycott called by Cesar Chavez in 1967 persuaded millions of Americans to give up grapes and pressured California growers to recognize unionized workers and raise wages.
Boycotts can hurt the very people they intend to help. When anti-sweatshop groups threatened a boycott against apparel from Bangladesh in the mid-1990's because many factories employed child labor, the factories simply fired the children, pushing some into begging and prostitution. Anti-sweatshop groups now generally oppose boycotts.
The N.A.A.C.P.'s president, Kweisi Mfume, said his group never rushes into boycotts. "This is a trigger you don't want to pull until all else has failed," he said. "In the case of South Carolina, after 38 years of negotiating even the N.A.A.C.P. has a limit to its patience." As a result, the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce says, more than 100 conventions and other events have been canceled in the state, which has lost at least $18 million in tourist dollars.
BUT Howard Hunter Jr., the chamber's president, said the boycott might backfire because it has caused some lawmakers to dig in. "One group of legislators," he said, "has used the boycott very effectively for not taking action, saying: 'We're being blackmailed. If we succumb this time, what are they going to ask for next?' " The business community, Mr. Hunter said, has been working to resolve the problem.
LOOKING for less controversial tools than a boycott to pressure Paramount to drop its "Dr. Laura" plans, gay groups have deluged the corporation with calls and e-mail. "Paramount would never host a talk show where someone said such nasty things about blacks or Jews," said John Aravosis, who has organized the stopdrlaura.com Web site.
Companies react to boycotts with either compliance or defiance. After several groups boycotted Pepsi over its Burma ties, the company stopped doing business there. "When customers and consumers contact us, we definitely listen," said David De Cecco, a Pepsi spokesman, who added that the company's action was consistent with American foreign policy.
But Unocal has reacted differently to a boycott over its investment in a natural gas consortium in Burma. "We sympathize with the boycott's goals," said Michael Thatcher, a Unocal spokesman. "We want to see democracy and economic improvement in Myanmar. We feel that the way we're doing it is much more likely to bear positive results than their way, which is to pull out and isolate the country."
During the South Africa boycott, the apartheid regime made similar arguments, saying sanctions were hurting the nation's blacks in particular. But Archbishop Desmond Tutu rejected those arguments, saying: "You get all sorts of people saying all sorts of things about sanctions: That they will hurt the people you are trying to help. Twiddle! It's baloney of the first order! Because you are speaking about people already suffering, and you are saying you are trying to find some way that is a nonviolent strategy for bringing about the change that everybody says they want."

HEADLINE: Russia Votes: Will Democracy Win?

BYLINE: By Jack F. Matlock Jr.; Jack F. Matlock Jr., a former ambassador to the Soviet Union, is a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study and the author of "Autopsy on an Empire."

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
If enough people bother to vote today in Russia, Vladimir Putin is expected to be elected president by a wide margin. What then? Is he the inscrutable "black box" some observers have described, or even a Russian Pinochet determined to establish order by whatever means required? Or will he turn out to be a democratic reformer, eager to get on with the changes Russia needs to become a just and prosperous society?
Of course, neither Russians nor outsiders can be certain what Mr. Putin will do. But one guide we might consider is Boris Yeltsin's motives in setting him on the succession track. 
 In a meeting in Moscow last December, President Yeltsin's spokesman told me that his boss was determined to go down in history as the person who made the restoration of Communism impossible. By the spring of 1999, I was told, Mr. Yeltsin had become worried that Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, his ostensible successor, had become "too close to the Communists." Mr. Yeltsin had therefore dismissed Mr. Primakov and named Sergei Stepashin as prime minister, only to be convinced within weeks that Mr. Stepashin probably could not win a presidential vote.
So he had replaced Mr. Stepashin with Mr. Putin, the spokesman told me, since he believed Mr. Putin was the man most capable of winning and preventing any return to Communist rule or other authoritarianism. Two weeks after the Kremlin aide told me this, Mr. Yeltsin resigned, which automatically made Mr. Putin the acting president and moved up the election by three months. There could hardly have been a more powerful assist to a candidate.
The aide's explanation may have been tailored for the listener. Nonetheless, the important question about Mr. Putin is whether he is capable of keeping Russia on the democratic track and devoted to doing so. In that sense, Mr. Yeltsin's purported judgment seems well founded.
Mr. Putin has condemned Communism, saying, "It was a blind alley, far away from the mainstream of civilization," and has described his goals as building a strong democratic state and encouraging growth. He has warned against "restoration of an official state ideology," adding: "Our people have accepted such values as freedom of expression, freedom to travel abroad and other fundamental political rights and human liberties."
His rhetoric on democracy has been unequivocal: "History proves all dictatorships, all authoritarian forms of government, are transitory. Only democratic systems are not transitory." He has also said, "The main threat to human rights and freedoms emanates from the executive authority."
His economic prescriptions include encouraging the growth of small and medium-sized business and reforming the financial system through realistic budgets, tax reform, monetary stability and the creation of "civilized" markets. He has called for "integration of the Russian economy into world economic structures" and, specifically, for membership in the World Trade Organization.
He insists that Russia must remain a great power, but he has specified that "ensuring a high level of people's well-being" is more important than military strength. He also emphasizes that Russia has nothing to gain from confrontation with the West and that development will be more rapid if Russia attracts foreign investment.
Not only has Mr. Putin said the right things; he has also shown a remarkable capacity for political maneuvering. After backing the hastily organized Unity Party in the December parliamentary elections, Mr. Putin turned around in January and arranged a surprise deal with the Communists that effectively prevented Mr. Primakov from being elected speaker. Although many Westerners attacked Mr. Putin for reaching out to the Communists, there is no evidence he made substantive compromises. The Communist committee chairmen will get their BMW's and their dachas while they may finally back the banking and tax reforms that they have long blocked.
Mr. Putin's record is not without blemish. A former K.G.B. official, his reliance on former agency colleagues as advisers raises legitimate questions. And he has gained much from the support of super-rich "oligarchs," particularly Boris Berezovsky, whose television network savaged the Primakov team before the parliamentary elections and last week attacked Grigori Yavlinsky, a liberal presidential candidate, saying that he was backed by Jews, homosexuals and foreigners.
Most worrisome is the brutality of the war in Chechnya, and the Russian government's efforts to block objective news coverage and cover up atrocities. But most Russians consider Chechnya unique. Russian popular sentiment has long considered Chechnya the most lawless and corrupt region in the country. No other province is suspected of sponsoring terrorism in the rest of Russia. Many Russians will condone actions there that would not be tolerated elsewhere.
Although Westerners may think the war is the sole cause of Mr. Putin's popularity, that is not necessarily the case. During recent trips to Moscow and St. Petersburg, most people I spoke to who supported him praised his youth, his "businesslike" manner and his reputation for getting things done. Few mentioned Chechnya.
Westerners have criticized Mr. Putin's reluctance to talk more specifically about his plans. (When a Russian magazine asked about his programs, he replied, "I won't tell you.") But his reasons are obvious. To carry out his goals, he will have to take on some powerful interests. Why provoke their opposition before the vote? No Western politician would do so.
The truth is, the changes in Russian society since 1991, including political decentralization, economic privatization and increasing independence of the courts, would make it very difficult for any leader to impose Soviet-style authoritarian control.
It is time we stopped making Russia the receptacle of either our dreams or our fears. We should congratulate the people on a peaceful and orderly transfer of power. We shall learn soon enough whether Vladimir Putin's supporters or detractors are correct.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS: Flash Points;
Global Trade Meets The Lure of the Gun

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOR seven years now, Bill Clinton has been chanting the mantra that countries that invest in education and focus on the Web are far more likely to prosper than those that measure their power in kilotons and argue over bleak pieces of real estate.
He made the case again last week in India and Pakistan while his top aides were delivering variations on the theme in Beijing. A third major flash point, the Middle East, was on his agenda for today.
But the argument that seemed so reasonable just a few years ago -- that plugging into a dynamic world economy will bring prosperity and tame nasty nationalistic tendencies -- is proving a hard sell as Mr. Clinton races around the globe in the last 10 months of his presidency. 
 The world's most economically isolated nations, like Pakistan and Syria, see no hope of catching up with their more economically advanced competitors, and those well on the road to global competitiveness, like India, China and Israel, believe more than ever that their economic potential must be married with military strength.
Take India's Parliament, which swooned when Mr. Clinton talked excitedly of the booming software houses of Bangalore and when he predicted that, as India makes the inevitable choice between "the hand loom or the hyperlink," its standard of living could sextuple in the next two decades. Yet as soon as Mr. Clinton suggested that India's economic progress is being undercut by its nuclear testing and territorial battle over Kashmir, his hosts got their backs up.
Just because our future is etched on a silicon chip, they shot back, in effect, don't think we're about to give up the Bomb.
In Beijing, meanwhile, hard-liners were using the election of an independence-leaning president in Taiwan to bolster their case that it was time for "economic integration" with the world to take a back seat to the assertion of China's sovereignty over what they see as a breakaway island. It is still unclear whether the generals will retake the upper hand from those who argue that the real business of the Communist Party is business.
Then there was Syria's president, Hafez al-Assad, whose waffling on a peace accord with Israel prompted Mr. Clinton to schedule a face-to-face meeting today in Switzerland. For years now Mr. Clinton has been sketching out his vision of the Middle East's economic potential if only it could stop arguing over security and territory. But now a great deal of that vision hinges on his ability to persuade a reclusive and ailing Syrian leader increasingly preoccupied with creating a family dynasty.
Each of those disputes, of course, is driven by its own emotional history of ugly conflict. But they all serve to illustrate the dangers of too simplistic a faith in the lure of the market when nationalistic impulses flare up.
"We Americans often see a rigid tradeoff between economic success in an age of globalization and increasing your old-style military power," said Paul Bracken, a Yale professor whose book "Fire in the East" (HarperCollins, 1999) explored the growing nuclear threats in Asia and the Middle East. "The rest of the world doesn't see it that way. And in fact, their growing nationalism is a counterweight, in their minds, to the other strains they are feeling as their worlds are changed" by borderless competition.
NATIONALISM isn't the only factor at play. All three flash points are made more complex and unpredictable by the fact that nervous authoritarian regimes are facing off against some variety of democracy -- a mix that can produce political miscalculation when one side misunderstands how the other makes its decisions. Witness how China's heavy-handed threats, aimed at intimidating Taiwan's voters, backfired to the point that the Taiwanese elected the candidate who until recently had talked of asserting independence.
And in each dispute, Washington's own motives are suspect. Americans often view themselves as neutral arbiters, only seeking to spread peace. But from Delhi to Shanghai to the Persian Gulf, suspicions are greater than ever these days that the sole military and economic superpower is using its "neutral" role to create a world that plays to Washington's commercial and geopolitical advantage.
Why has a seemingly persuasive argument -- that it's wiser to invest in education and broadband networks than in nuclear reprocessors -- run up against such opposition both in unplugged nations and in the most plugged-in?
Pakistan and Syria are good places to start. Both are about as disconnected from the world economy as you can get.
But, while both countries harbor enormous reservoirs of native talent, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the leader of Pakistan, and Mr. Assad in Syria understand the nature of the poison pill: if they took Mr. Clinton's advice, the medicine that would be good for the country would eat away at their own holds on power. Among major authoritarian regimes at the turn of the century, only China's Communist leaders have made the bet that they can loosen controls on the economy, allow in the Internet and still exert iron control over the nation's politics.
So Pakistan holds on to nukes for the same reason that NATO did in Europe: as a guarantee against a much larger force across the border. Add to that nationalistic pride. But what about India? Doesn't it see that a nuclear arms race drains resources that could be better spent conquering new cybermarkets?
"It's exactly the opposite," says Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management, who as a top Commerce Department official peddled a lot of Mr. Clinton's networks-not-nukes message. "In the first half of the 20th century, countries wanted well-rounded power. The cold war, though, created an odd sense that only a couple of countries would be both economic and military powerhouses. Now the pendulum is swinging back."
So India wants both. As does Israel, and both China and Taiwan. Indeed, countries look at the one nation that was supposed to exercise "soft power" through economic and technological prowess alone -- Japan -- and they see a pitiful excuse for a superpower. Once the economic magic went away, so did the global diplomatic influence.
The disconnect between analog and digital nations is worsened when the former are authoritarians and the latter are some variety of democracy. This has long been a problem in the Middle East. President Assad's rhetoric regularly frays the fragile coalition keeping Prime Minister Ehud Barak in power in Israel. Nothing new there. But Mr. Barak has long promised that any peace deal with Syria will be put up to a national referendum in Israel, and that means final adoption could be unpredictable.
But for real miscalculation, pop back and forth between Beijing and Taipei. China's leaders have what one senior American official last week called a "near-perfect ability to miscalculate" the effects of their words on the Taiwanese electorate. Yu Maochun, a professor at the United States Naval Academy who specializes in cross-straits relations, was sitting in a noisy Taipei restaurant earlier this month when the television broadcast a warning to Taiwan from China's premier, Zhu Rongji. The mainland, he said, was willing to "spill blood" to prevent independence. "People stood up and yelled" in the restaurant, Mr. Yu said, making vivid the backlash that was felt throughout Taiwan.
Why would a man as sophisticated about the world as Zhu Rongji, China's leading economic reformer, make such a blunder?
"The Communist Party, when it comes to big problems, is elitist," says Mr. Yu. "It is accustomed to sitting down behind closed doors with a Nixon or a Kissinger and solving a problem. Now it is faced with a whole different kind of foreign policy challenge. And they can't handle the politics."
DEMOCRACIES miscalculate, too. It was India that inflamed the long-running sore with Pakistan two years ago when it uncorked nuclear tests. Some Indian elites now concede that the nuclear grandstanding -- a great crowd pleaser at home -- paved the way for the rise of General Musharraf in Pakistan, who had engineered some of the horrors in Kashmir, then took command in a coup. Now, American officials believe, he figures that if the war at the top of the world gets splashed on enough front pages, India will be forced to accept what it has long rejected -- outside mediation from Mr. Clinton.
The general may be proved wrong, but maybe not. With not much to do at home, Mr. Clinton is moving from hot spot to hot spot, arguing that all involve areas in America's strategic interest. The problem is that Mr. Clinton envisions himself as an umpire, while the rest of the world sees Washington as a player with its own agenda.
There is suspicion in Beijing, for example, that America is using all its weapons -- from the Seventh Fleet to its influence over the World Trade Organization -- to contain China's power. The Indians share a similar suspicion, even as they flocked to shake Mr. Clinton's hand.
And so for all the happy talk, the Indians had no intention of signing on to Mr. Clinton's non-proliferation agenda. After all, they said, that other great symbol of democracy -- the United States Senate -- rejected the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty last year, proving that even the most powerful economy on earth wasn't willing to forgo its nuclear options.
So why, they asked, should they?

HEADLINE: RECKONINGS;
Deficit Attention Disorder

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
A long time ago, in an economic universe far, far away, people cared about the trade balance. When the U.S. trade deficit passed $100 billion for the first time, there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth. Doomsayers warned of an imminent "hard landing" in which a crashing dollar would precipitate economic crisis. Even calmer types regarded the unprecedented red ink as a warning sign.
But a funny thing happened on the way to the 21st century: people lost interest in the trade balance. In January, the Commerce Department announced last week, the United States set a new world record: the biggest monthly trade deficit ever. (Is this a great country, or what?) Measured as a share of G.D.P., last year's current account deficit (the broadest measure of the trade gap) was wider than ever before. But the markets couldn't have cared less. They were more interested in the accounts of MicroStrategy (a high-flying tech stock that lost two-thirds of its value in one day when it adopted a new accounting standard) than in those of the United States. 
 In some ways this lack of interest is a good thing. Obsession with trade balances has historically been a source of bad economic policies. It's probably for the best that state governments don't know whether their trade with other states is in surplus or deficit; their ignorance keeps them out of mischief. And not paying attention is almost as good as not knowing.
Still, perhaps we shouldn't be quite so indifferent.
At the moment the U.S. trade deficit is good, not bad, for our economy. It doesn't cost us jobs because we already have more than enough domestic demand. We aren't having any trouble paying for imports: the inflow of money from investors eager to buy into our miracle economy has easily matched the outflow to pay not only for all those Lexuses and BMW's, but for the suddenly more expensive oil they burn too. And this inflow of capital helps keep stocks high and interest rates low.
Besides, by any other measure the United States is performing superlatively compared with every other major economy. We have the highest growth, the lowest unemployment, the biggest budget surplus. To focus on the trade deficit, you might argue, would be like short-selling a rapidly growing company because it doesn't pay dividends.
But just as even the newest of new economy companies must eventually justify its existence by returning money to investors, even the most successful economy must sooner or later export enough to pay for its imports. Our current position, where we pay for many of our imports by attracting inflows of capital -- in effect by selling the rest of the world claims on our future exports -- cannot go on forever. And as the late economist Herbert Stein declared, "If something cannot go on forever, it will stop."
The most likely scenario is that the trade deficit will eventually be reined in by a decline in the foreign-exchange value of the dollar. The great dollar slide of 1985-87, precipitated by a trade deficit that was actually smaller compared with G.D.P. than the deficit today, reduced the value of a dollar by 40 percent in terms of German marks and Japanese yen. And there is no obvious reason why the same thing can't happen again.
But if that is the way it will play out, at least some of the money we are now pulling in is being brought in under false pretenses. Right now foreign investors are willing to hold 10-year U.S. government bonds, even though they pay only a slightly higher interest rate than their European counterparts. Those investors seem to believe, in other words, that today's strong dollar will persist for another 10 years. But the size of our trade deficit makes that unlikely. So foreign investors, and therefore the value of the dollar, are arguably doing a Wile E. Coyote -- one of these days they will look down, realize that they have already walked over the edge of the cliff, and plunge. And when they do it will come as a rude shock not only to them, but also to American financial markets that have become accustomed to big inflows of foreign money.
The trouble, you see, is that in economics, as in life, what you don't pay attention to can hurt you.

HEADLINE: New York City's New Dreams

 BODY:
The headlines nowadays are filled with ambitious proposals to transform New York City's landscape. One day, planners unveil a scheme to stage the Olympics in the city, with a new stadium on the West Side and apartment houses for athletes on the Queens waterfront. Another day, Albany debates plans to connect the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal or build a new Second Avenue subway. Clearly boom times are producing dreams for big projects, opening a potential new chapter in the city's self-renewal. But dreams also entail tough decisions. It is far from obvious how best to use limited resources for urban growth.
There is, of course, continuing pressure for New York City to use its regular capital budget to repair schools, bridges and the infrastructure. But the city's history also illustrates the importance of grand projects that spur economic growth and enhance New York's reputation as a cultural and business mecca. The need for planned expansion of existing public and private facilities is illustrated daily by crowded subways, high-priced apartments and squeezed commercial space. It is equally evident that there is room for quality development around rail yards, in old manufacturing areas and in underused waterfront districts. The problem for elected officials is how to sort through competing plans and find the best way to continue the tradition that has produced past successes from Rockefeller Center to Lincoln Center and Battery Park City. 
 Four overarching goals are already evident. The city government should try to open up Manhattan's West Side to development. It should also revise the city's residential zoning to protect the character of existing neighborhoods. The other two goals are the upgrading of transit links and development of the waterfront and other vacant areas. Shaping projects around these goals will involve complicated choices about the mix of public and private funds and the feasibility of various stadium proposals. Those choices, in turn, will be influenced by the outcome of the effort to recruit the Olympics. Here is a rundown on the major issues:
The West Side. The biggest opportunity for apartments and offices is in Manhattan, west of Eighth Avenue and south of 42nd Street, an area developers have eyed for years. The main impediment is a lack of transit access. The committee that proposes to bring the 2012 Olympics to New York has some imaginative suggestions. One proposal is to build a stadium over the rail yards near the waterfront, and link the site with the No. 7 subway line, the Long Island Rail Road, Metro North and the Amtrak trains to New Jersey.
The Olympic bid is supported by Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who also wants a West Side stadium for the Jets and the Javits Convention Center. Madison Square Garden is also said to be interested in moving west. A valuable new neighborhood could rise one day from what is now largely parking lots, warehouses and wasted space. The stadium proposals deserve serious study. But any new facility should have multiple uses, and no potential user -- whether the Olympics or a sports franchise -- should be handed a blank check.
The West Side is also being looked at by a team of business leaders put together by Senator Charles Schumer and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. They want to find room for high-tech and other business expansion in other parts of the city as well.
The Olympics. The Olympics do not always produce the economic activity that sponsors promise. But the Olympics group has laid out an intriguing scheme in which a stadium just might work. Its projections show that a public investment in a train stop and platform over the railroad tracks -- with or without a stadium -- could be paid for by tax revenues from new office, hotel and residential buildings. Over all, projected revenue from the Olympics would pay for more than $1 billion in new athletic facilities throughout the city. The Olympics proposal also calls for an athletes village to be built on the Queens waterfront and later converted to apartments. The entire proposal foresees improvements in housing, public facilities and transportation that would outlast the Games.
Transit. In New York City, of course, grand schemes often spark big squabbling. The state budget is now being held up by a fight over Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's demand that more money be spent for a Second Avenue subway line. There is no question that the Second Avenue subway is a priority, but financing that line should not preclude bringing the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central or extending the No. 7 subway line to new West Side development.
Residential preservation. All these ideas for growth reinforce the city's responsibility to protect its neighborhoods. One initiative to accommodate construction of new apartments without destroying existing places is being put forward by the New York City Planning Commission under its chairman, Joseph Rose. It would revise the residential zoning code to encourage buildings on the scale of existing neighborhoods, and discourage blasting down existing street blocks for empty plazas and big towers like the one Donald Trump is constructing near the United Nations. This commendable proposal is going through a review with the city's community boards and should be adopted.
All these activities reflect New York's optimistic new spirit. Even in these affluent times, however, the public must spend its resources wisely. Recent proposals for Columbus Circle and a new Penn Station have proved that there still is a role for the government to facilitate and, in some cases, subsidize exciting new projects. The same attitude can create still more possibilities for the future. We intend to address the specifics of all these proposals in coming weeks. For now it is important to salute the promise of ideas for a new chapter in the constant journey of a city reinventing itself.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Pinochet's Revenge: Oliver North, You'd Better Watch Out

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
IMAGINE that the year is 2005 and that Oliver North, the retired Marine lieutenant colonel and former National Security Council staff member in the Reagan White House, is on trial in Lebanon. He has been arrested while vacationing in Switzerland on an international murder warrant issued by Lebanon. The charge is that he helped direct the 1986 bombings of Libya that killed 31 people.
Libya had long sought his arrest, but in the end it was a Lebanese judge who obtained it, by joining the case and requesting that the Swiss authorities detain Mr. North and then extradite him to stand trial in Beirut on charges of crimes against humanity and aggression. 
 Imagine further that Mr. North is then convicted and the headline in one American newspaper roars: "Military Aide to Reagan Convicted of Murder for Official Act."
The events have not happened, of course, but international legal experts say that in the wake of the near-extradition of Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile to Spain, it is no longer so hard to imagine a situation in which a former high American official could be arrested while traveling and then tried in any foreign country, for crimes alleged to have been committed anywhere in the world.
Notwithstanding the notion, the likelihood that any nation would be so brazen is another matter. Issuing an indictment as a propaganda ploy is one thing; indeed, Libya has one out already on Mr. North. But these days, following through on it could subject the Libyans to far more than a writ of habeas corpus.
That is because a law of force still operates in the world, and it is not hard to imagine another set of headlines: "U.S. Demands Release of North; Economic Sanctions Threatened; Warships Maneuver."
Still, it is worth considering what might happen to someone like Mr. North when thinking about the recent rulings -- and precedents set -- in the Pinochet case by the British House of Lords. In 1998 General Pinochet, in London for medical treatment, was arrested after a judge in Spain issued an international warrant based on charges related to his actions while he was the leader of Chile. The Lords ruled that he was not immune from prosecution.
If the British home secretary, Jack Straw, had not freed General Pinochet earlier this year because of his deteriorating health, he would have had to face trial in Spain on charges of torture and political killings during his 17-year rule in Chile.
Widely praised by human rights organizations, the rulings have more quietly raised some eyebrows among former American officials who now wonder whether they too could some day be extradited -- let us say, if the United States lost its position as the world's sole superpower -- and tried any time any judge in the world accuses them of human rights violations.
In an interview, Mr. North said, "It limits my travel to certain countries."
It has some legal experts asking: Could Henry A. Kissinger be put on trial overseas as an architect of policy during the Vietnam War, which included bombings of Cambodian villages and intensive bombings of Hanoi?
What about President George Bush or his secretary of state, James A. Baker III? Could they be held responsible for deaths tied to economic sanctions related to the Persian Gulf war in Iraq? Or what about President Clinton? After he leaves office, could he face trial for the bombings of a factory in Sudan that was mistakenly believed to be a chemical weapons plant?
Some Congressional Republicans have argued against the expansion of international criminal courts, which they say could hamstring American leaders who fear being prosecuted after they leave office for official acts they committed. The legal rulings in the Pinochet case rejected an argument that the general was immune from prosecution by virtue of his official status, and legal experts say the case also expands the power to criminally prosecute certain human rights violations -- that occur anywhere -- to the courts of every nation.
"What we have done is restricted the travel opportunities for people like Henry Kissinger, Wesley Clark and Bill Clinton," said Michael Byers, a professor of international law at Duke University. "We have reduced their options in traveling to rogue states and their allies."
Robert Vieteretti, the managing director of Kroll Associates, the New York-based international security firm that provides personal protection, said his company is now much more concerned "with a country's laws, its alliances and anything our clients may have done to anger those nations."
Privately, some former American officials said that the F.B.I. has warned them not to travel to some countries, including some in Europe, where there is a risk of extradition to other nations interested in prosecuting them.
For now, Professor Byers says that former American officials do not need to worry "unless they are foolish enough to travel to some place like Iraq." Experts say that the reason is simple. If, as the saying goes, to the victor go the spoils, so too with history: the triumphant get to tell the story of what happened and to name the heroes, the pardonably mistaken and the villains when the conflict has ended.
"The political reality is that it is very remote," said Jonathan Charney, a law professor at Vanderbilt University and the editor of the American Journal of International Law. "Why? Because we are the superpower. It would be dangerous for another country to do that economically, politically and otherwise."
In an interview last week, Mr. Kissinger said he believed that the "very complicated" issues surrounding the Pinochet rulings needed further study. But he added that he was not concerned. "I don't think the well-known people are as much in danger," he said. "I certainly don't worry."
But Mr. North said that all it would take would be the slightest change in the political winds.
GENERAL PINOCHET was supported by the British when he was their ally in the war against Argentina over the Falkland Islands. "Here is this person who aided and abetted their cause, helped bring about democracy," Mr. North said. "And now because of this political sea change in Great Britain, now the country is going to turn him over to a third-party country to have him prosecuted. That's disgusting."
Patricia Derian, the first assistant secretary of state for human rights, said she could foresee the day when American officials would be prosecuted for acts similar to those that might be attributed to Mr. Baker, Mr. North or Mr. Kissinger.
"It is a stretch right now with the current rules of war and diplomacy, but I think it is going to come," said Ms. Derian, a Carter appointee. "It would be interesting to see what would happen if Kissinger went to Cambodia, or they just put out an international warrant for his arrest."

Wall Street Shrugs Off Higher Rates Hike? No Problem

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO 

 BODY:
It was a winning week for both technology and industrial stocks after the Federal Reserve met Wall Street's expectations of a modest increase in interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average, adding to its recent gains, ended the week at 11,112.7, up 517.5 points. The Nasdaq composite index rose 164.9, to 4,963.03. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, meanwhile, moved into record territory every day last week, except Monday, ending at 1,527.46, up 62.99. 
 Investors have reached the conclusion that in time the economy will slow to a much more moderate, sustainable pace, a soft landing, " said Hugh Johnson, chief investment strategist with the First Albany Corporation in Albany.
The Fed raised short-term rates an additional quarter-point last week, pushing up the key federal funds rate to 6 percent. It was the central bank's fourth rate increase since June.
Mr. Johnson said investors snapped up technology shares, taking advantage of a sharp decline in prices earlier this month. They're still not cheap, but they're about as good a bargain as you're going to get in the world of technology, he said. VIVIAN MARINO

The United States, OPEC and Oil: A Snapshot

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
On Monday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet to decide whether to open the oil tap and relieve the tight supply conditions that have driven up fuel prices worldwide.
The world oil market has become so integrated that the effects of its decisions would be felt in the United States even if it imported only 1 percent of its oil -- or even if it exported oil, in fact. But in industrial countries that export oil, like Britain, a price increase is a windfall for producers. For the United States, once a giant producer and now a giant importer, higher prices mean exporting more money. 
 The phenomenon is more pronounced today, because more than half the country's oil needs are met by imports; the figure was only one-third at the time of the oil shocks of 1974 and 1979.
 Most of the oil that the United States imports comes from the Western Hemisphere, not the politically turbulent Middle East. But another effect of global integration is that an interruption in pumping anywhere is an interruption everywhere -- that is, a disruption from any producing nation would be felt by all importers.

HEADLINE: Mysterious Force Attacks Small Western Tribe's Young in the Womb

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SHOALWATER BAY INDIAN RESERVATION, Wash.

 BODY:
The tiny tribe that lives here on a wind-battered, rain-swept spit of land hard by the Pacific Ocean knows something about fighting for survival.
Members of the Shoalwater tribe fight the heavy erosion that over the decades has eaten more than half of the one-square-mile reservation created in 1866 when President Andrew Johnson signed an executive order removing the tribe from nearby villages. And they fight for economic survival, their latest battle a feud with federal marshals over the number and type of slot machines they may keep at a casino that is their main source of income. 
 But the most difficult battle is for the women who live here, who are up against an unseen foe, a killer that seems to come and go over the years, though no one can even prove it exists. For some reason, it is frighteningly difficult to give birth to a living child here.
The worst year was 1998, when all but one of nine known pregnancies on the reservation ended in a miscarriage or stillbirth. Since then, eight pregnancies have lasted 12 weeks or longer, and half of them have ended in miscarriage.
"You look around the village and you start asking yourself, 'Where are the children?' " said Lisa Shipman, who had a stillborn son in 1990 and whose sister-in-law, Vernita Norman, has miscarried three times and recently left the reservation, in fear, when she became pregnant.
Mrs. Shipman and her husband, Michael, finally had happy news last April when a healthy daughter, Kaylee, was born. "This was everybody's pregnancy," she said. "She is the community baby. Everybody dotes on her. But you still wonder, where are all the others? Where is the next generation coming from?"
It is a question that neither tribal leaders nor federal investigators can answer for sure. The national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called in after the 1998 calamity to study the alarmingly high rate of fetal deaths, issued a report this year that confirmed the fears of the tribe, one of the smallest, with 204 members, and poorest in the West.
The agency's study pegged the miscarriage rate after an established pregnancy at 50 percent to 67 percent, roughly three to four times the expected rate. But while such a cluster of health afflictions is disturbing, the study cautioned that it was dealing with such a statistically small sample that a definitive problem could not be proved -- nor, as is the case with other federal studies here, did it find a cause.
The killer could be lurking in the environment. Pesticides are routinely sprayed on cranberry bogs north of the reservation, on forestland to the east, and even into Willapa Bay, to control parasites that attack the oysters that are a big industry.
It could be a genetic flaw, though marriage among tribal members is rare and several of the miscarriages have been experienced by nontribal women married to Shoalwater men. It could stem from poverty and poor diet. Alcohol or drug abuse are often a factor in miscarriages, but the federal study found no evidence of either problem here.
And several women on the reservation talked of the meticulous care they took during their pregnancies, down to drinking bottled water and even avoiding any food grown here or plucked from the nearby sea. Still, there were miscarriages.
And, of course, it could be just an awful run of chance, though no one seems to believe that is the case.
"It would almost be easier to take if it was just a random occurrence, just a stretch of terrible luck," said Gale Taylor, the tribal health director, a non-Indian who had a miscarriage. "That would be nice because you think, well, it could stop. The fact of the matter is, though, every day I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. One month here, we lost four pregnancies. It was like a war zone."
The tribal chairman, Herbert Madzu Whitish, who also owns a convenience store on the reservation, said he was frustrated by the lack of answers and worried about both "the generation that is missing here" and the women on the reservation who wanted to bear children.
"A lot of people are afraid of pregnancy," Mr. Whitish said. "Instead of it being the most joyous time of their lives, it's like they're on pins and needles, worrying that something is going to happen."
The tribe concluded there was a serious problem when its records showed that from 1988 to 1992, at least 10 of 19 pregnancies had ended in miscarriage or stillbirth. The miscarriage mystery has only been compounded, Ms. Taylor said, by the fact that those babies who have been born are generally healty.
A clinic was built, largely with federal dollars, to provide more immediate care and monitoring of pregnancies. State and federal environmental reports found high levels of three pesticides in the drainage areas of the cranberry bogs, but did not find the tribe's drinking water to be unsafe.
The problem slipped from public attention when the tribe had several healthy births from 1993 to 1996; by 1998, though, the level of miscarriage was at its highest in memory, and the fear returned.
"I did everything I thought I could possibly do to have a healthy baby," said Kim Zillyett, the business manager at the tribal clinic here, who has miscarried twice in the last two years and is expecting a baby in May -- an event she alternately views with joy and worry.
"It's not over till he's out," Ms. Zillyett said, referring to a boy whom she and her husband plan to name Teegan, an Irish name they found in a baby book. "It's not over until he's here and he's healthy."
The tribe, which was created a century and a half ago when several bands of Lower Columbia Chinook Indians were put together after refusing to sign a treaty with the United States government and live on a reservation with the rival Chehalis Tribe, "is not going down without a fight," Mr. Whitish said.
It has applied for federal money for more extensive environmental testing of reservation land and greater monitoring of all pregnancies. It has an extensive grief-counseling program, including a series of art projects in the log-frame tribal center here that allows the Shoalwaters to express grief over the tribe's mysterious affliction.
"These people are survivors," said Dr. Kristen M. Swanson, a professor of family and child nursing at the University of Washington, an expert on dealing with miscarriage who has been invited by the tribal council to study the community's response to the miscarriages.
"They've had a lot that they've had to survive," Dr. Swanson added. "And the chairman has been very clear whenever I've met with him that they will do all they can to get through this. In a lot of ways you have to stand in admiration as to how the tribe has not let this roll over them. They've gone to the Centers for Disease Control, they've gone to the universities, they've gone to the Indian Health Service, they're fighting for what they need."
And yet there remains enormous frustration that no one has a clear answer for why the problem has arisen. "When the recent report came out, I was glad that, yes, they recognized there were significant problems," Mr. Whitish said. "But they didn't offer much in the way of any kind of answers. I guess I got caught up in the TV version. I thought the investigators could ride in here and give us the answer."
Ms. Taylor, the tribal health director, is also dismayed that she cannot give certain answers when women ask how to improve their chances of a healthy pregnancy.
"When you have to tell people that maybe the water they drink is the cause, or just walking on the beach is a cause, or that maybe there's no cause at all, that's frightening," she said. "A lot of women feel, if you want to stay pregnant, get the hell out of the reservation. It's hard. We're losing our land on one side, and we're losing our babies on the other. It's not a great way to live."

HEADLINE: Deep Political and Religious Rifts Disrupt the Harmony of Nigerian Towns

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: ABA, Nigeria

 BODY:
In a corner of this city in Nigeria's Christian heartland, where every other car seems to affirm the driver's love for Jesus, Muslim migrants from the north had managed to become landowners.
The corner was known as Ama Hausa, or gathering place of the Hausa, who make up one of the country's three main ethnic groups, along with the Igbo and Yoruba. But after Igbo rioters destroyed this street corner in Nigeria's recent religious conflicts, graffiti scrawled on a wall of the gutted mosque reclaimed the land: Ama Igbo. 
 Thousands of Hausa have since packed up their belongings and left for the north. Many headed to Sokoto, at the country's geographic and cultural opposite end, where a similar exodus was taking place.
In Sokoto, the historic site from which a Muslim holy war succeeded in spreading the religion through West Africa two centuries ago, many Igbo were seen at the main bus station scrambling to buy the $15 tickets that would take them back to Aba and other cities in southeastern Nigeria.
Nigeria's recent politically driven religious conflicts have claimed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of lives and destroyed countless churches, mosques and houses. President Olusegun Obasanjo has described these clashes as attempts to undermine the nation's 10-month-old democracy, and many Nigerians from different parts of the country agree that several states' attempts to introduce Shariah, the Islamic penal and social code, have more to do with politics than religion.
But the conflicts are rooted in all-too-real hatreds and divisions, like the abyss between Sokoto and Aba. These hatreds and divisions are staggeringly complex, fueled by the misrule and corruption that have left most residents of one of the world's top oil producers in poverty. What is more, these rifts have been encouraged and exploited by the country's rulers, from the British to the military governments to the European and American oil companies that pump crude in the Niger delta, an area largely abandoned by the federal government.
Heaps of garbage, some of it on fire, littered the main road in Aba on a recent day. The garbage contractor had been dismissed for corruption, and a new contract had yet to be awarded. Nationwide, the unreliable national electricity system collapsed recently, plunging the Nigerians who could not afford generators into darkness and forcing Mr. Obasanjo to declare an emergency.
As Igbo were killed in the north and thousands returned here, the events recalled those leading up to the civil war of Biafra. Three decades ago, following massacres of Igbo in the north, the ethnic group tried to secede from the rest of Nigeria. The war was one of the most brutal in Africa's postindependence history -- a million died -- but a successful postwar reunification policy knitted greater ties among Nigerians. With the recent surge in hatreds, it is unclear whether those ties are stronger than the divisions.
"I cried when I heard what had happened to my people," the Rev. Prince Benny James, 29, an Igbo and associate pastor at the Living Church here in Aba, said of the recent killings of Igbo in the north.
Over the course of reprisal attacks against Muslim Hausa in Aba, Mr. James sheltered 10 Hausa who escaped eventually. But on the first morning, Mr. James said he was present at an attack against some Hausa. He did not participate, he said.
"But somehow I was happy these things were being done to them," he said. "In my heart, I was saying: 'Yes, do that to them! Go ahead! Go ahead! Right!' I gave my support by being there. If I had not enjoyed it, I would have returned to my house."
The locals began attacking the Hausa after corpses of Igbo killed in the north were brought back to Aba. But what began as a battle between Muslims and Christians in the north became an ethnic witch hunt here, as Igbo searched for anyone who might be a northerner.
At Mr. James's Living Church, the security guard, Andy Petei, 25, hid in a hole under the altar for three days after some youths came looking for him. Neither Muslim nor Hausa, Mr. Petei is a member of an ethnic minority from a north central state. He had nevertheless become a target because he was from the north.
"Some people said I may be Hausa," said Mr. Petei, a Christian. Religion is one of the great fault lines in Nigeria, an ambitious creation of British colonialists. Ethnicity is another. But Nigeria's divisions are so treacherous because the cleavages can shift from one region to another, from one day to another.
Almost all Igbo are Christian; almost all Hausa are Muslim. The Yoruba, on the other hand, are divided almost evenly between Muslim and Christian. And yet the Islam practiced by the Yoruba is a much more easygoing variety than that practiced by the Hausa.
"For the Hausa, Islam is a total way of living," said Julius Okolo, an Igbo and professor of political science at Usman dan Fodio University in Sokoto. "For the Yoruba, it's not a total way of living. The cultural aspects of the Yoruba are stronger than religion, whether it's Christianity or Islam."
Indeed, Yoruba Christians and Muslims marry each other without a second thought. It is not unusual for Yoruba to have members of both faiths in their families; some even practice both religions.
But among northerners, being a Christian Hausa, a closely related ethnic group, is considered a contradiction in terms.
"We're seen as people who have sold out," said Emman Usman Shehu, who heads an organization for Christians in Sokoto. "In the north, once we have left Islam, where the political, social and economic aspects are all tied up, we become classless citizens."
In Lagos, the commercial capital in the Yoruba southwest, deadly clashes between Yoruba and Hausa have occurred in recent months. But in the recent riots in the northern city of Kaduna, some Yoruba seemed to have escaped injury because of their religion or ethnicity.
Suraj Najimu, an 18-year-old student and a Yoruba Muslim, said he was surrounded by a group of Hausa youths ready to assault him. "But after I recited some Koranic passages, they let me go," he said.
On a Muslim street in the predominantly Christian slum of Kaduna, Christians destroyed all the houses except a few belonging to Yoruba. Most of the Yoruba were Christian. But even one who is Muslim, Shehu Garba, was spared, apparently because in this particular instance, ethnicity was more important than religion.
President Obasanjo has said that he wants to avoid taking the issue of Shariah to the Supreme Court, which would rule clearly on the matter. A political solution, he said, "will end up without any victor or vanquished."
"No victor, no vanquished" was the slogan adopted to reunite Nigerians after the Biafran civil war -- a policy regarded by many historians as one of the most successful reconciliation attempts in recent history. And indeed, over the years, despite all of Nigeria's fissures, the country has grown more interdependent.
The building of more roads, increasing urbanization and economic exchanges have all pushed ever more Nigerians to leave their historic home regions for other parts. Many of these Nigerians fell victim to the recent violence.
Mr. James, the associate pastor here, said he personally knew a Hausa man who was killed here. "He was married to an Igbo woman," he said.

HEADLINE: OPEC Gives Scant Signs That Oil Flow Will Increase

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: VIENNA, March 25

 BODY:
Despite unusually public pleas by the Clinton Administration for relief from high oil prices, there were few signs of support for a big increase in oil production as ministers from petroleum-exporting countries arrived here today for crucial meetings.
Two days before the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is scheduled to consider an increase in output, members of the eleven-nation cartel remained divided and were girding for grueling negotiations throughout the weekend. 
 "I think it is too early to decide now," said Obaid bin Saif Al-Nasseri, the United Arab Emirates' oil minister, as he entered his hotel early this afternoon. "We have not discussed all the possibilities and all the options. My recommendation is to wait for some time."
Still amazed themselves by the extraordinary roller coaster in oil prices, from $11 a barrel one year ago to $34 three weeks ago and now back to about $28, many oil ministers are adamantly against moves that would trigger yet another plunge.
"I am worried about a decline in demand," said Chakib Khelil, the oil minister of Algeria, one of the more hawkish members of OPEC. "I am not sure we need an increase."But, he added, "if there is a consensus, we will support it."
As in the past, the most important disagreements are between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the two largest producers within OPEC. Saudi officials have been pushing for an increase in production of between one million and 1.5 million barrels a day.
Iran has repeatedly argued for much smaller increases, and its position has hardened as oil prices have retreated from their recent highs.
Iran has also lashed out at the United States, where Congressional lawmakers are pushing for sanctions against OPEC countries and whose Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, has lobbied OPEC producers on a whirlwind tour.
"OPEC should not opt for a big increase under political pressure," said Iran's oil minister, Bijan Zangeneh, on his country's state radio before departing for Vienna today.
Warning that a rash increase could lead to a "catastrophe," Mr. Zangeneh said OPEC nations "must move with the market and seek stability. We hope OPEC will make a decision based on economic justifications, not political."
Even boosting production by one million to 1.5 million barrels a daywould not necessarily have much impact on oil prices. Analysts say the crucial question is whether the increase comes on top of or merely substitutes for the cheating on oil quotas that is already taking place.
Industry analysts estimate that OPEC countries and the four nations that joined in the production cuts one year ago -- Mexico, Russia, Oman and Norway -- are already overshooting their target of 23 million barrels a day by about one million barrels.
If OPEC leaders agree to increase quotas by 1.5 million barrels but clamp down on cheating, the net effect would be negligible.
Even if the increase comes on top of the current over-production, most analysts believe the impact on oil prices were be modest and the reduction in gasoline prices could be no more than a few pennies a gallon.
Philip Verleger, a veteran oil economist at the Brattle Group in Newport Beach, Ca., noted that inventories of crude oil have declined to dangerous new lows at the same time that an acceleration in global economic growth is expected to increase demand.
The International Energy Agency, a research agency in Paris funded by oil-consuming countries, has predicted that worldwide demand for oil will climb by 4 million barrels a day, to 75 million, between now and December.
If worldwide inventories are not re-stocked, Mr. Verleger argued, consuming nations could find themselves under increasing pressure to turn to Iraq. Iraq, which remains under United Nations sanctions, is currently allowed to produce as much as it can under tight restriction on what it is supposed to buy with the revenue.
"If we don't increase inventories now, we may need Iraq's oil by Christmas," Mr. Verleger said.
But even non-OPEC countries are extremely worried that any big increase in production will send prices plunging back to the levels of a year ago -- $11 a barrel.
Olav Akselsen, Norway's oil minister politely rebuffed Mr. Richardson on Thursday after meeting with the American energy secretary in Oslo.
Although he acknowledged the need for some sort of increase, Mr. Akselsen said Norway did not support rolling back all of the production cuts that sent oil prices rising.
"Total suspension of today's production regulations will have a negative impact on the market and work against price stability," Mr. Akselsen said."Both too high and too low oil prices will lead to more instability."

HEADLINE: For Giuliani and City Council, Priorities Clash in a Battle of the Budget

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
The bottom line figures are only 1 percent apart, but the $37 billion budget packages that have been served up by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council make clear the competing priorities -- and politics -- that divide the two wings at City Hall.
The Council's $37.2 billion spending plan, released last week, would direct income-tax cuts toward the middle class and the poor. The Council also proposes new tax credits for people 65 and older and working parents. On the spending side, it would add money to help defend tenants facing eviction, to expand library hours and book collections and to retrain city police officers. 
 The mayor's $36.8 billion spending plan calls for an income-tax cut that is about the same size as the Council's, but more than half of the money would go to the 13 percent of city taxpayers who make more than $125,000 a year. Mr. Giuliani, as in past years, has advocated cutting the library, parks and cultural budgets. His spending initiatives are directed at intensifying the police crackdown on aggressive driving and youth gangs and at hiring school safety officers. He also wants to offer some parents vouchers to send their children to private or parochial schools.
Council leaders call their budget proposal a step forward for the middle class. They say that if the city does not take steps to reduce the tax burden on the middle class, New York City will eventually become a city dominated by the wealthy and the poor as more moderate-income residents are forced to move out. They contend that the spending changes are essential to maintain the quality of life in New York.
"Anyone who uses a New York City public library, visits one of New York City's great cultural institutions, raises a child in New York City, pays taxes in New York City or has lost faith in the New York City Police Department will find our budget a welcome document," Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone said.
The Giuliani administration says the Democratic-controlled Council is overestimating how much tax revenue the city will raise in the coming year. The projected figure is essential to the Council's plan to restore $159 million in program cuts advocated by Mr. Giuliani and to add $196 million in new programs, like hot weekend meals for the elderly.
"It is indicative of a philosophy," Deputy Mayor Robert M. Harding said. "Their approach is to be overly optimistic, and then they have to worry about the consequences about being overly optimistic."
The new budget does not go into effect until July 1, so the mayor and the Council have until June to resolve their differences. The next step is up to the mayor; in April, he must deliver a final budget proposal. Ultimately, compared with some past budget disagreements when the economy was not so flush, the differences between the mayor and Council this year are not that extreme.
Charles Brecher, research director at the Citizens Budget Commission, an independent fiscal monitor, noted that although the details still had to be resolved, both the Council and the mayor supported several major tax cuts in principal.
Both sides want to eliminate the 14 percent surcharge on the personal income tax imposed in 1991, a cut that will save taxpayers about $800 million once it is fully in place in 2002. They also both want to reduce and gradually eliminate the commercial rent tax, a levy that few, if any, other cities impose. The mayor and the Council also are both supporting a plan to rebate part of the unincorporated business tax, paid by people who are self-employed or work for law, accounting, advertising or other types of partnerships.
"All of those taxes contribute to the drag in competitiveness of the New York economy," Mr. Brecher said. "Getting rid of them should help further stimulate job growth in the city."
But even within these areas of agreement, differences pop up that point to the competing agendas.
Under the mayor's income-tax cut, all taxpayers would get the same percentage tax break, meaning the 14 percent surcharge would be wiped off every taxpayer's bill. For a filer earning $60,000 to $70,000 a year, the average savings would $230. Because the most affluent city residents pay much more in taxes, their savings would also be much higher. For example, taxpayers who earn $1 million or more make up only 0.8 percent of the filers, but would reap 27 percent of the savings, or an average of $14,856 a year.
The Council wants to restructure the tax rates so the savings would be weighted more to the middle and lower-income classes, meaning a taxpayer with an income of $40,000 to $50,000 would see a decrease of nearly 20 percent in the personal income tax bill, while those earning $1 million or more would see just a 2.9 percent drop. This plan would give those earning $1 million or more a smaller tax cut, averaging $3,401.
There is a similar distinction in the proposed reduction of the commercial rent tax and the unincorporated business tax. The mayor wants to cut the rent tax for every business that pays it, but the Council wants to direct the cut to smaller businesses that pay less in rent. The Council plan would give a rebate on the unincorporated business tax only to resident taxpayers with incomes of less than $150,000, while the mayor would provide the rate cut regardless of income and place of residence.
The proposals that would benefit older New Yorkers and working parents also reflect this split. The Council has proposed a tax credit for taxpayers 65 or older with a household income of $50,000 or less who live in rental units. The average credit would be $64 a year, costing the city about $19.2 million in the next fiscal year. To help working parents pay for child care, the Council wants to offer a tax credit worth as much as $96 or $492 a year, depending on a family's income, costing the city a total of about $25 million. The mayor has so far not backed either of these plans.
The deciding factor for many Council plans may be the final revenue estimates, which the mayor by law has the power to establish. The Council is estimating that the city will have about $1.2 billion more in available money next year than the mayor has predicted, mostly from higher tax revenue. Mr. Harding said that the Giuliani administration must decide whether to revise its revenue estimates before negotiations can formally begin. But he said he does not support restructuring the personal income tax rates as the Council has proposed.
Legislative approval from Albany is required for the tax changes, and officials there have made it clear that any changes must be supported by both the mayor and the Council.

HEADLINE: DaimlerChrysler Nears Deal To Buy 33.4% of Mitsubishi

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

 BODY:
In another big move toward the global consolidation of the automobile industry, DaimlerChrysler of Germany is to announce a deal tomorrow to acquire 33.4 percent of Japan's Mitsubishi Motors for about $1.3 billion, people close to the companies said yesterday.
The deal would make DaimlerChrysler the world's third-largest automaker, behind General Motors and Ford. All three will now have large shares of the three main markets: Western Europe, Japan and the United States. The other giants of the auto industry, Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda and the Renault-Nissan alliance, still are weak in at least one of these markets. 
 The agreement also marks the second time in the past year that a Japanese carmaker has ceded management control to a foreign competitor. Renault of France acquired a 36.8 percent stake last year in Nissan Motors. If the DaimlerChrysler-Mitsubishi deal is completed, Japan would be left with only two major independent car companies -- Toyota and Honda -- with the rest partly or entirely under the control of western manufacturers.
Mitsubishi has been in financial distress and is saddled with about $16 billion in debt. And though it has a presence in Southeast Asia as well as Japan, the company has only 2.3 percent of the Japanese market. Mitsubishi had been sought a partnership to shore up its capital position in the face of brutal worldwide competition in the market for small and medium-sized cars.
The Mitsubishi stake would give DaimlerChrysler the right to name several members of Mitsubishi's board and veto power over major decisions. And because the German-American carmaker would provide a crucial capital infusion, it expects to have the leverage to hammer out a strategy to bolster the two companies' presence in Asia and in the small-car market worldwide.
But the move poses plenty of risks for DaimlerChrysler. The automaker has already seen its stock pushed down in the past year, partly because of investor fears about the financial drain of taking command of a small-car producer and concerns about the lower profit margins of small cars in comparison with DaimlerChrysler's core businesses -- Mercedes-Benz luxury cars and Chrysler sport utility vehicles, light trucks and mid-sized American family cars.
People close to the talks between the two companies said Katsuhiko Kawasoe, president of Mitsubishi, was in Frankfurt yesterday to sign a letter of intent with Jurgen E. Schrempp, chairman of DaimlerChrysler.
Under the deal, DaimlerChrysler will take no stake in Mitsubishi's truck business, of which Volvo of Sweden owns 19 percent.
Cultural differences are often the biggest barrier to international auto mergers. But DaimlerChrysler and Mitsubishi may have an advantage, because Chrysler and Mitsubishi have worked together closely for many years. Mitsubishi makes the Dodge Avenger and Chrysler Sebring coupes for DaimlerChrysler at a factory in Normal, Ill.
For Mr. Schrempp of DaimlerChrysler, the Mitsubushi deal would appear to finally satisfy a goal he has had since engineering the takeover of Chrysler two years ago: to gain a major presence in Asia.
Though the Asian car market has been in disastrous shape for the last several years, thanks to the lingering effects of the financial crises in Southeast Asia and Japan's intractable recession, industry experts still believe it will be one of the biggest sources of growth in years ahead.
At one point last year, Mr. Schrempp was in advanced negotiations to acquire a stake in Nissan and was competing against overtures by Renault.
But after Daimler executives scrutinized Nissan's enormous financial and structural problems, Mr. Schrempp bowed out of the talks and Renault ultimately struck a deal with Nissan instead.
People close to Daimler said yesterday that Mitsubishi brings with it some good technology, including in the highly competitive area of direct-fuel injection diesel engines.
Mitsubishi also owns a stake in Proton, the Malaysian automobile company, and that stake in turn could give DaimlerChrysler improved access to the Southeast Asian market.

HEADLINE: Race Draws Unexpected Attention

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
A special election for a State Senate seat, especially one that comes just a few weeks after a high-profile presidential primary, rarely draws much attention. And if one candidate is a Democrat in a heavily Democratic district who has also been endorsed by the Republican, Conservative and Working Families Parties, the race would seem a sure bet for obscurity.
But not this race. Politicians and voters in a wide swath of southeastern Queens are paying close attention to the vote this Tuesday in the 10th Senate District because the Liberal Party candidate, Andrew Jenkins, is a convicted felon who is seeking to reclaim the very Senate seat he held for eight years and was expelled from in disgrace in 1990. 
 The race is a special election to fill the seat vacated by Alton R. Waldon Jr., a Democrat who Gov. George E. Pataki nominated for a judgeship on the State Court of Claims last summer and was confirmed by the Senate in December. Mr. Jenkins, an administrator at York College, is running against the Democratic candidate, Malcolm A. Smith, a real estate developer.
Mr. Jenkins was a well known politician in the district, which spans Cambria Heights and Hollis to the Rockaway Peninsula. But his incumbency came to an abrupt end 10 years ago when he was convicted on charges stemming from an F.B.I. sting in which he agreed to launder $150,000 in cash through a bank in Zaire. He was expelled from the Senate and served a year in prison.
Mr. Jenkins, 58, said voters would view his past legal problems as old news and most would recognize that the charges against him had been politically motivated and that he was innocent of the crime. Meanwhile, he said, his campaign has focused on the need for more housing for middle- and lower-income people and enhanced employment opportunities for people in the district. "The economy has improved, yet we are seeing high unemployment in the district," he said. "There is nowhere for our young people to find work."
Mr. Jenkins is inclined to talk about his achievements when he was in the Senate and the Assembly, where he held a seat in the early 1980's. He mentioned the work he did in bringing suits more than a decade ago to create districts that would be carved to include more black and Hispanic residents.
"I talk to people about the issues they care about," Mr. Jenkins said. "I talk about police brutality -- I was one of the first people to hold hearings on police brutality when I was in the Senate."
Mr. Smith, 43, said that in his campaign appearances, he has found that "the issues are education and economic development."
He added that he saw his endorsement by so many parties as a sign that he could forge relationships across broad ideological lines and that he would be an effective member of a Republican-controlled Senate. ' "I want to be viewed as someone who can bring people together," he said.
Mr. Smith has been closely affiliated over the years with several Queens politicians. Most recently, he managed the district office of the Rev. Floyd H. Flake while Mr. Flake was a United States Representative for the area.
Before that, he was chief of staff to City Councilman Archie Spigner. And in addition to being endorsed by the Republican, Conservative and Working Families Parties, Mr. Smith has secured the endorsement of nearly every politician in the southeast Queens community.
Tuesday's race will be Mr. Smith's third attempt at elected office.
He ran unsuccessfully for the same Senate seat after Mr. Jenkins's conviction in 1990 and in the following year lost a Democratic primary for City Council to Juanita E. Watkins.
While most politicians in the area expect Mr. Smith to prevail easily, he cautioned that anything could occur in a special election because turnout is typically low and the race is largely determined by the candidate that better organizes his core supports.
"This is a serious race," Mr. Smith said. "Andrew Jenkins is a former senator, and his name recognition is still out there. He has been out there and has been elected to office before, and I haven't. So for me, it's a very serious race."
Mr. Jenkins acknowledges that he is facing a difficult contest. "It's always a tough race when you're not the organization's choice," he said. "But I think that the people are smart enough to vote for the person and not the party."

HEADLINE: In a Replica of a Famed Slave Ship, Lessons From the Past

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: MYSTIC, Conn., March 25

 BODY:
A hand-built replica of the Cuban schooner Amistad, whose cargo of rebellious African slaves galvanized pre-Civil War abolitionists and made the ship an enduring symbol of freedom's triumph, was launched with great fanfare into the Mystic River today.
The vessel, reconstructed with painstaking attention to historic detail -- from the golden eagle figurehead on the bow, along its sleek black hull with a single white stripe, to the elegant lettering on its transom -- will be used as a floating classroom, traveling from port to port to teach the Amistad story. 
 More than 7,000 people attended today's festivities at Mystic Seaport, home to the nation's largest maritime museum and the shipyard where the Amistad was built over the last two years. Scores more spectators dotted the Mystic River in a colorful array of canoes, kayaks and other small craft.
"Today we have an opportunity to see a piece of history that has been recreated," Lt. Gov. Jodi Rell said at a ceremony that was punctuated by the music of traditional African drummers. "We are proud of the role Amistad will play in history not only today but for generations to come."
Shortly after 12:30 p.m., the launching ceremony began with the tolling of a bell 53 times in honor of each of the captives held on the Amistad. A ceremonial chain was cut, a bottle of water broken across the bow and six white doves released.
Then, with the push of a button, automated winches lowered the lift-dock holding the Amistad into the water. As it reached a depth of 10 feet, the wooden ship, flying the American flag but still without masts or sails, floated free, and the crowd erupted in loud cheers and applause. The HMS Rose, a tall ship anchored nearby, fired its cannons.
There was no such ceremony when the original Amistad entered Connecticut waters 161 years ago, carrying a cargo of slaves who had been kidnapped in Africa and sold at auction in Havana. Seized by a Navy brig off Long Island, the Amistad was towed to shore in New London, Conn.
The slaves, in a mutiny, had killed the ship's captain and chef but failed in an effort to return to their homeland in what is now Sierra Leone in West Africa. After 63 days at sea, they were charged with murder and jailed in New Haven, where they waited for American courts to consider their fate.
President Martin Van Buren hoped to extradite the prisoners to Cuba, where they would have been enslaved once again. But abolitionists took up the Africans' cause and organized a defense that eventually led to John Quincy Adams, the former president, arguing their case before the United States Supreme Court.
In March 1841, three years after the ship's capture, the court ruled that the Africans had been kidnapped illegally and ordered them freed. The 35 survivors eventually returned to their homeland, their saga fixed in American history.
The idea of recreating the Amistad grew out of a parade of tall ships in New York Harbor to celebrate the American bicentennial in 1976. The parade included a ship that had been temporarily renamed Amistad, which caught the attention of Warren Q. Marr II, then editor of Crisis, a journal of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
His interest led to the creation of Amistad America, a nonprofit educational foundation formed in 1996 to recreate the Amistad. The project also got a huge lift in publicity and interest from the 1997 Steven Spielberg movie "Amistad."
Construction of the $3.1 million replica, paid for by corporate sponsors and a $2.5 million grant from the State of Connecticut, began in March 1998 under the direction of Quentin T. Snediker, a captain and master shipwright.
Mr. Snediker, who has the look of a classic seaman, with a white beard and denim sleeves rolled up to expose an anchor tattooed on his left forearm, led the research into the details of the original Amistad that had been little noticed by historians interested in the ship's story, not its nautical design.
A research team scoured the National Archives and other historical repositories throughout New England. A treasure trove of information came from documents related to the sale of the ship after the court case was resolved, including details about the sails, rigging and fastenings.
In guiding visitors around the new ship, Mr. Snediker stresses that Amistad was a workaday cargo schooner, not one of the infamous Middle Passage slave ships that carried captives from Africa to the Americas. This, he points out, is one of the historical lessons to be taught about slavery in America.
"Amistad was just a freight vessel," he said. "But still she was so embroiled in this international incident that it shows how the whole economy was based on the labor of enslaved people. Every aspect of New World life was in some way complicit. Part of her power will be to help people understand the complexities of the past and how they continue to manifest in some of the issues of racism that we still face."
Mr. Snediker is also careful to point out that hidden behind the 85-foot ship's historic facade are all of the amenities of large modern sailing ships, including two 135-horsepower engines for auxiliary power and state-of-the-art navigational instruments. It meets all Coast Guard safety requirements.
When it is fully equipped to sail -- the masts and rigging will be installed by mid-April -- the Amistad will weigh about 136 tons. It includes 150,000 board feet of wood, including African iroko that was donated by Sierra Leone, and will feature 50 tons of ballast and 5,000 square feet of sail. The Amistad's inaugural voyage will be to New York Harbor to join a parade of tall ships called OpSail2000, July 3 to 9.
The ship, which is owned by Amistad America, will have its home port in New Haven, which is the reason for one of the visible differences between the reconstruction and the original. Regulations require a ship's home port to be printed on its transom, so the new ship has "New Haven" where the original showed "Principe," for Puerto Principe, its home port in Cuba.
Under an agreement with the state, it will spend half the year in Connecticut waters and the other half traveling. It will have classrooms as well as accommodations for overnight passengers. Captain Bill Pinkney, a yachtsman who in the early 90's was the first black man to make a solo trip around the globe, will be at the helm.
In the ceremony's keynote address, Samuel H. Pieh of Tennessee, a descendant of Sengbe Pieh, the slave known as Cinque who led the Amistad mutiny, told the crowd that the ship should be a symbol to combat the racism that still pervades society. "The same motivation that led people to enslave my ancestors are the same motivations today that are plaguing America and the world," he said. "We still have those kinds of leaders who will ignore the average man, the average woman, who will ignore the great strength in our diversity."
Other featured guests included the actors Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, and the Sierra Leone ambassador, John E. Leigh. Several praised the multiracial cooperation on the Amistad project, noting that the ship's name means friendship in Spanish.
Before today's ceremonial events, Elaine Warmsley of Middletown, Conn., a ninth-generation descendant of slaves, walked up the steps on the lift-dock and ran her hand over the Amistad's wooden rails, then looked up at the sky in a moment of prayer. "I hope it's really a learning tool," she said afterward. "People need to know. People need to see."

HEADLINE: Companies Try Dipping Deeper Into Labor Pool

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo.

 BODY:
Unable to find enough workers in the booming economy, American corporations are trying to expand the labor pool.
Until recently, employers had met their labor needs by hiring people who were already employed or at least wanted to work. But as this pool shrinks, they are increasingly recruiting from among the 36 million working-age people in the United States who had not sought a job, or even thought about taking one. 
 Conrad Bell is one of these new workers. Mr. Bell, a college junior, did not need a job. Living at home, he had enough pocket money, and the first payments on his school loans were still in the future. But when a notice went up on a campus bulletin board that H & R Block was hiring students skilled in computers to trouble-shoot problems called in from Block offices around the country, Mr. Bell applied and got one of the jobs. "Most of my friends now work," he explained.
The company has gone out of its way to accommodate the 23-year-old student, juggling schedules so that he can carry four courses at the DeVry Institute of Technology and still work 25 hours a week. Between semesters, he worked on Tuesdays, then switched to Mondays to attend Tuesday classes. Nearly 200 other students hired for the tax season get similar flexible treatment at Block's new technical center here.
In addition to students like Mr. Bell, companies are stepping up recruiting of the urban poor, retirees, homemakers, men and women mustering out of military service, the handicapped, women coming off welfare and illegal immigrants not already counted in the labor force. People with jobs are being recruited to moonlight in second jobs, and part-timers are adding hours more easily than in the past. To get workers, some companies even relocate to pockets of relatively high unemployment.
The recruiting poster and the promise of flexible hours were what landed Mr. Bell despite his mother's resistance. "She does not want me to work while I'm in school," he said. Aside from flexible hours, companies are offering subsidized transportation, child care, store discounts, free meals, family outings, tuition subsidies, and, in one case here, an $80,000 softball field -- everything, but significantly higher pay.
"We really are in uncharted territory," said Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard University. "The last time we had such tight labor markets, in the 1960's, the baby boomers were beginning to take jobs, and they fed the labor pool. We don't have them today, and we really don't know how many people we can draw."
The economy may ride, or fall, on the answer. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, argues that the pool of people still available to take jobs has dwindled to the point that employers will have to pay higher wages to compete for workers and then will push up prices to cover the higher labor costs. Citing this inflationary danger as one reason for their actions, the Fed's policy makers have moved interest rates up a quarter percentage point five times since last June to slow the economy, with the latest increase coming last Tuesday.
But Mr. Greenspan's estimate of the number of people still available for jobs relies on the Labor Department's monthly employment surveys, which do not count as available the people who say they are not interested in working. Many of these people are now being recruited, including Mr. Bell, who was busy being a student until he saw the H & R Block poster and popped into the labor force. In addition, the Fed chairman's concerns about inflationary labor shortages do not reflect the extent to which workers are settling for intangible benefits, rather than higher wages.
Certainly inflationary wage increases are not evident in national wage statistics or in the Kansas City metropolitan area, where the unemployment rate of 3.2 percent is nearly a percentage point less than the nation's 4.1 percent and employers are offering all the new lures, short of big raises.
That is especially the case at Block's recently opened technology center. A quarter of the 800 people working there in the tax season are students like Mr. Bell, who is earning $11.54 an hour, barely up from last year's rate. Another 200 are low-skilled customer call-center operators, some of whom commute by municipal bus from an impoverished neighborhood nearby. H & R Block has put the new center, and its jobs, near enough for the operators to get to a job, one that pays $8 to $9 an hour, good pay in their world.
"We have not been pressured to raise wages because of the labor shortage," said Frank L. Salizzoni, the company's chief executive.
Even some officials in the Clinton administration, despite its hands-off policy vis-a-vis the Federal Reserve, are challenging the Fed's view that an inflationary labor shortage is developing. Martin Bailey, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said, "We don't see wage pressure coming from the labor market at this time." More bluntly, the labor secretary, Alexis M. Herman, declared in a recent interview: "I tell everybody Alan Greenspan is a wise man, and I don't comment on Fed policy. But this is a balanced economy that can continue to perform at a very solid and steady pace."
Part of the difference lies in how the experts tally the number of available workers. Ms. Herman counts at least 13 million people across the nation available for jobs, including 3 million part-time workers who have told surveyors from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that they would take more hours if they could get them.
Mr. Greenspan's more conservative estimate of 10 million people available for jobs leaves out the part-timers. He focuses on the nearly 6 million people who are listed as officially unemployed because they are actively looking for work, as well as 4 million others who tell the bureau's surveyors that they have not looked for work lately but would like a job or might like one in the right circumstances.
Mr. Greenspan's estimate of 10 million would-be workers has declined from 13 million in January 1996. But both his estimate and Ms. Herman's miss those who are not thinking about working but can be lured into jobs. Most of them are among the 36.3 million civilians between 16 and 64 who are busy in other activities and see themselves as not available for work, unless, like Mr. Bell, a company is able to change their minds.
In Kansas City's poorest neighborhoods, the statistics miss hundreds of families "who don't respond to surveyors or answer the door or any of that stuff, but want jobs," said Clyde McQueen, president of the Full Employment Council.
The council is a publicly subsidized organization that tries to get people in poor neighborhoods into jobs, mainly by training them and then paying for transportation, including bus fare to H & R Block's new center and similar job sites. "The first thing people here want to know," Mr. McQueen said, "is what is the shift time, does the bus get there and what happens if I have an emergency at home."
Nowhere in Kansas City is the sweep for new workers more on display than at Station Casinos, a Las Vegas-style hotel and casino complex that is the biggest of the four casinos along the Missouri River.
The casinos opened in 1997, and almost overnight 5,000 new jobs appeared in greater Kansas City, a considerable impact on a work force that then numbered 916,000 and now numbers more than 965,000. The casinos initially bid up wages, offering low-skilled workers $7.50 to $9 an hour. That drained people from other employers, including customer call- center operators at Sprint, then earning less than $7 an hour.
"We lost a lot of folks to the casino boats," said Mary M. Hogan, manager of Sprint's call center in suburban Lenexa, Kan., "but it is not an issue now."
Sprint has raised its starting pay to $8.25 an hour. It has also eased the wage pressure by employing more college students and offering them nonwage benefits like flexible part-time schedules and tuition subsidies of $5,250 a year if they stay at least that long. Station Casinos, employing 2,120 people, has also soft-pedaled wage increases.
"More and more we compete on the whole package," said John V. Finamore, president of the casino.
Apart from health insurance, that package includes a child care center, 10 percent discounts at local merchants, free meals once a month served by executives, gifts at Christmas, a talent show for employees and their families and, most recently, the softball field.
"These are soft labor costs that are much more easily absorbed than fixed wage increases and can be shed more easily," Mr. Finamore said.
To find workers, Station Casinos uses specialized employment agencies that recruit immigrants from Latin America, Africa, Russia, Vietnam, Cambodia and elsewhere. Ninety employees came out of retirement and 270 others work at the casino as a second job, often as weekend blackjack dealers earning $15 an hour, most of it in tips. For a while, the casino's vans brought people from poor neighborhoods to work in the hotel, but now a municipal bus -- known as the Casino Cruiser -- makes the run every half-hour.
"You cannot compete on wages," Mr. Finamore said. "All you do is raise the bar across the city."

Trail Blazers Trying To Regain Their Path

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., March 25

 BODY:
In Joe Kleine's 15-year career, he could not remember a regular-season game more hyped and anticipated than the one between the Portland Trail Blazers and the Los Angeles Lakers on Feb. 29.
Vying for home-court advantage throughout the playoffs, the teams came into the game tied with the National Basketball Association's best mark at 45-11. "The greatest regular-season game in the history of the N.B.A.," bellowed Bill Walton, the NBC analyst and the former Blazer center, before the matchup.
"I'd never seen anything like it," Kleine, Portland's reserve center, said of the buildup. "I don't want to blame that game on everything that happened, but obviously it had something to do with it. It was like everything just came to a standstill."
Including the beleaguered Blazers. They have not been the same since, going 5-5 since that defeat. They havelost four of six at the Rose Garden after winning 16 straight. They blew fourth-quarter leads to Minnesota and Detroit. Toronto recently beat the Blazers on their home floor by 19 points, their worst loss of the season.
As the Blazers prepared to entertain the Knicks on Sunday, the question was: could they find their rhythm and heart before the Lakers run away with the Western Conference championship?
"With the 82 games, it's inevitable that no matter how good you are, sooner or later you're going to hit a funk during the year," said Kleine, who has played on six teams, including a championship team in Chicago. "Very rarely does a team not go through one. You lose your way and eventually you find it again. But sometimes to find it, you need a good slap in the face."
Coach Mike Dunleavy added: "Certainly when you have a big loss, there is a residue to it. But more than that, we've really missed Brian Grant. Especially his toughness and rebounding."
Grant, a power forward, was activated last Friday after missing most of March with an injury in his foot. He also had off-season knee surgery. Instead of Rasheed Wallace being the anchor off the bench, he has been forced into a starting role.
The Blazers also lost Arvydas Sabonis last week after the center severely sprained his right foot. He is expected to miss two to three weeks.
Before the season, the Blazers were unanimously tagged as favorites to succeed the San Antonio Spurs as champions. In some quarters, the Spurs were picked to repeat, and the Lakers were seen as a greater long shot than any Eastern Conference team. But mostly, Portland was the team spoken of most highly.
The Blazers had the talent, experience and, most of all, the depth. Acquiring Scottie Pippen, Steve Smith and Detlef Schrempf during the off-season not only took oodles of Paul Allen's money but also the maneuverability of Bob Whitsitt, the team president.
After ridding themselves of Isaiah Rider and Jim Jackson, the Blazers' $50 million starting lineup was not as much about cash as it was cachet. And for the first four months, the Blazers seemed polished and poised, on the cusp of distinguishing themselves from the pack.
But gradually the problems began to surface. If it was not Wallace blowing a gasket and leading the league in technical fouls, it was poor decision-making on offense. Portland's lack of a genuine go-to player at the end of a game has also been raised.
Yet the biggest reason for their shortcomings is clear to see on the court: the Blazers are not mentally or physically strong enough to compete for a title. It's not just Wallace; many players think all of humanity is out to get them after a questionable call. They do not play through the whistles. Instead of saving their nasty disposition for their opponents, they direct it at the referees.
Having already won 50 games, the Blazers are the second-best team in the league. They are not in grave danger and have a few weeks to fix the leaks. But less than two months ago, Portland was considered a lock to wind up in the conference finals and dispatch the Lakers. Now, they are just another slumping N.B.A. team struggling to find its identity.
"We definitely still have a chance to get there and win it," Kleine said. "You can't say that about a lot of teams. But it's not going to be easy. The problems we have are fixable. We, as a team, complain too much. We've got to be a lot tougher, mentally and physically."
Dunleavy said: "My wish was to have us healthy by now. That didn't happen. So we just have to find a way to get it done."
 
The Carter Conspiracy
Less than a month ago, Vincesanity was the catchphrase used to describe the sweeping popularity of Vince Carter, and how the All-Star forward of the Toronto Raptors had made the casual fan again pay attention to the N.B.A.
But then Butch Carter invoked a number of conspiracy theories that could thwart Toronto from keeping his star player under contract. At one point this week, the Raptors coach accused both the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League of tampering and the N.B.A. of possibly trying to steer Carter toward an American city after he becomes a free agent.
The Toronto Sun actually spoke with a highly placed league official who essentially told the newspaper that the N.B.A. would be better off if Carter ended up on a team in the United States. It was an anonymous quote that a league spokesman referred to as "moronic" and "stupid" and not at all indicative of the league's stance.
Butch Carter apologized for his comments after he was chastised by General Manager Glen Grunwald. But he added, "I think there are forces out there that have been and will be destructive to our situation in Toronto. I don't think it will be anyone in the league office."
For simple economic reasons, the league needs high-profile players in its major markets. Yet the notion the N.B.A. wants Carter anywhere else than Toronto is a bit shortsighted.
The Raptors, regardless of their locale, are currently helping resuscitate NBC's sagging N.B.A. ratings. If Toronto could somehow negotiate its way through the Eastern Conference finals and into a championship showdown with the Lakers, neither the network nor Commissioner David Stern would fret. They would be overjoyed.
The immediacy of the Internet and television almost negate modern, big-market hyperbole. Witness the phenomenon of the Sacramento Kings over the past two seasons. In the old days, Vince would have had to go to Hollywood or Madison Avenue for maximum exposure. Now, they go to him.
Also, the N.B.A. is so concerned about its Canadian presence that the team owners recently unanimously rejected the ownership application of Bill Lurie, the St. Louis billionaire. After all the efforts that went into North American expansion, they did not want Lurie transplanting the Vancouver Grizzlies to the Midwest until that N.B.A. market was deemed a failure over a longer period of time.
If Carter's appeal could truly cut into the consciousness of a hockey nation over the long haul, would not investors in Ottawa or Montreal eventually give credence to N.B.A. teams in their own cities?
Finally, one of the main issues fought for and won by owners in the last round of bargaining was more restrictions on player movement. They want people to stay with their teams. Continuity -- Michael in Chicago, Larry in Boston, Magic in L.A. -- is still a valued asset in the N.B.A.
Unless Vince Carter -- and only Vince Carter -- wants to play somewhere else, he will remain a Raptor.
 
The Children of 76ers
Mike Dunleavy has been watching his son, Michael, play for Duke in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. Harvey Catchings has been watching his daughters, Tamika and Tauja, play for Tennessee and Illinois, respectively, in the women's tournament.
Nearly 25 years ago, the two fathers were teammates.
"If you take all the players' kids off that team, you'd have a pretty good team right there," Dunleavy said.
Indeed, the 1976-77 Philadelphia 76ers fell to Bill Walton's Portland Trail Blazers in the finals, but they should also be an All-Genetic Dream Team.
Beyond Catchings and Dunleavy, that 76ers team featured Henry Bibby, whose son, Mike, starts at point guard for the Vancouver Grizzlies, and a reserve forward with a decent vertical leap, Joe (Jellybean) Bryant, father of Kobe Bryant.
There was also Doug Collins, whose son, Chris, starred at Duke, and Steve Mix, who has a daughter playing college basketball.
"It's one of those amazing coincidences," said Pat Williams, the general manager of that Sixers team. "I can't remember a team of players whose children turned out to be so good."
 
Teens Like Knick Trio
And you thought it was just fed-up adults who wanted Patrick Ewing to stop shooting so much and make way for the new generation. According to Inside Stuff, the teen magazine of the N.B.A., Latrell Sprewell, Allan Houston and Marcus Camby were named the league's top trio -- the three teammates who work the best together on the floor.
The three Knicks edged out Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice; Ray Allen, Glenn Robinson and Sam Cassell; Chris Webber, Jason Williams and Vlade Divac; and Alonzo Mourning, Tim Hardaway and Jamal Mashburn.
The voting actually was not done by kids. Rather, the magazine's editorial board made the selections.

HEADLINE: CLINTON ENTREATS PAKISTAN TO TREAD LIGHTLY IN KASHMIR

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, March 25

 BODY:
In an effort to defuse tensions in a region that he has described as the most volatile in the world, President Clinton today asked the military leader of Pakistan to show restraint in Kashmir, where Pakistan and India most recently battled last summer, and to reopen a dialogue with his Indian neighbors.
But after more than an hour and a half with Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Mr. Clinton received no assurances, said a senior administration official who participated in the meeting. 
 "We broke no new ground on Kashmir," the official said after the session. "We heard no new assurances from the general."
Administration officials had expected little if any immediate progress from the talks with General Musharraf. Pressed on terrorism, the spread of nuclear weapons and when he would return Pakistan to democracy at the national level, the general offered nothing new, the White House official indicated.
Pakistan and India, the world's two newest nuclear powers, regularly skirmish in Kashmir, which has been the main issue between overwhelmingly Muslim Pakistan and Hindu India since the two nations were created from the British Raj in 1947, leaving the status of the Himalayan territory unresolved. The Clinton administration believes that incursions by Pakistani-backed militants into Indian-held Kashmir have the potential to escalate.
Last summer, battles in the Kargil region of Kashmir were regarded as the first direct combat between two nuclear powers -- fighting that was halted after Mr. Clinton persuaded Nawaz Sharif, then Pakistan's prime minister, to back down. Three months later, Mr. Sharif was ousted by General Musharraf.
Mr. Clinton, who decided to come to Pakistan after intense disagreement within the administration, spent barely six hours in this country, arriving from an extensive five-day tour of India under some of the most elaborate security precautions ever devised for his travels.
After his meeting with General Musharraf, Mr. Clinton made a direct appeal to the Pakistani people in a live television broadcast in which he addressed them as friends of the United States. Instead of looking toward a future of economic collapse and potential war, the people should choose the path of economic security and peace, the president said.
"With the right vision rooted in tomorrow's promise, not yesterday's pain -- rooted in dialogue, not destruction, Pakistan can fulfill its destiny as a beacon of democracy in the Muslim world," Mr. Clinton said. If Pakistanis choose this path, he promised, "The United States will walk with you."
The administration official said the president had stressed to General Musharraf that there could be no military solution in Kashmir by incursions across the Line of Control, the de facto border between Pakistani- and Indian-held territory.
Mr. Clinton had asked specifically for "restraint, respect for the Line of Control, rejection of violence and return to dialogue," the official said.
There was not much movement on other issues, either.
Mr. Clinton asked the general to take action against terrorist groups operating in Pakistan and to help pressure the Taliban government in Afghanistan to bring to justice, Osama bin Laden, the terrorist whom the United States believes is responsible for the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa.
The general, as he has in the past, said he would work with the Taliban leadership on the Osama bin Laden case, the official said.
Speaking to reporters as Mr. Clinton was leaving Islamabad, General Musharraf said he and the American president got along very well.
There were, however, no photographs of the two leaders together, and the general -- as planned -- held a news conference alone.
When asked whether he had given Mr. Clinton assurances that Pakistani-backed infiltration into Indian-held Kashmir would cease, the general replied: "There were no assurances because there was no question. We are not involved in sending any kind of people across the Line of Control."
On the Taliban, the general said he assured Mr. Clinton "that I would like to engage the Taliban in Afghanistan and take up the issue of any sanctuaries for any terrorists or training that might be going on in that country."
On the question of nonproliferation, the general pledged Pakistan would not be a source for the export of nuclear technology, the administration official said.
As the official ticked off the list of items on the president's agenda, it was clear there was a recitation of long-held views on both sides.
Still, said the official: "We've made an effort to make our position clear at the highest level. We didn't expect to come in an hour and persuade the leadership of the wisdom of our position."
Indeed, one point of the hotly debated stop in Pakistan, White House officials said, was to try and keep the lines of communication open. Should the situation deteriorate sharply in Kashmir -- as the administration fears -- President Clinton is now in a better position to deal directly with General Musharraf, they maintain.
Mr. Clinton also brought up the trial of the former prime minister, Mr. Sharif, who is accused of hijacking, treason and attempted murder. If convicted, Mr. Sharif could face the death penalty, and Mr. Clinton today asked the general not to execute him. The general explained that he was not vindictive, but that the matter was up to the courts.
As he did in New Delhi, Mr. Clinton made clear to the general that the United States would not mediate in the Kashmir crisis, the White House official said. This was also a message that General Musharraf did not want to hear: unlike the Indians, the Pakistani leader would like the Kashmir dispute to be settled by international mediation.
The signals from General Musharraf in the days before Mr. Clinton's arrival were not promising. The Pakistani leader missed an opportunity to send a positive message on his national day on Thursday when he made a major speech.
Instead of announcing that local elections would be held this year, as he had indicated earlier, the general pushed the date back to next year.
Also, the general has consistently talked in recent weeks about the Islamic militants in Kashmir, who the administration says are backed by the Pakistani regime, as freedom fighters committed to a jihad, or holy war. The administration regards several of these groups as terrorist.
Pakistan asserts that Kashmir, with a large Muslim majority, should have the right to vote on whether to join India or Pakistan. Secular India claims Kashmir as one of its states.
The emotions behind the issue were vividly on display in some of the banners along the route taken by Mr. Clinton's motorcade. "You were fair in Kosovo," said one, referring to NATO's bombing campaign to deter Serbian repression against Kosovo's largely Muslim Albanian majority. "Be fair in Kashmir."
It is politically untenable for a Pakistani leader to appear as though he is bending to an American diktat. Mr. Sharif's decision to pull back behind the Line of Control last summer is thought to have been one factor behind his ouster. And behind the general stands another, perhaps even tougher, commander, Gen. Mohammad Aziz, the chief of general staff of the Pakistani Army, who Clinton administration officials assert was the brains behind the fighting in Kargil last year.
Mr. Clinton arrived from Bombay under elaborate security precautions. At the Bombay airport, he walked to the door of a military C-17 aircraft, shook hands with dignitaries as though he was going to board that aircraft, and then slipped around the front of the plane to board an unmarked, smaller white jet that was parked nearby. This aircraft, an Air Force version of a Gulfstream, known as a C-20, flew Mr. Clinton, his national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, the secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, and several other advisers to Islamabad.
From the Islamabad airport, Mr. Clinton drove in a motorcade through deserted streets to the presidential palace.
Mr. Clinton's unmarked plane was accompanied by another Air Force Gulfstream, which was painted with the familiar blue and white of Air Force One and marked "United States of America." This was the decoy plane with Secret Service agents on board and arrived first, followed soon after by the president's plane. Many of Mr. Clinton's staff and reporters covering his trip were flown in on a military C-17 aircraft.

HEADLINE: Invasion of Laptops Spurs a Revolution In College Teaching

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.

 BODY:
During his economics seminar the other day, Sean Leary, a freshman at Wake Forest University, scanned stock prices, browsed basketball updates from ESPN, checked his e-mail, and perused pictures of "beautiful girls" on www.acewallpapers.com in search of a new backdrop for his laptop computer screen.
It seems Mr. Leary, who had already taken one economics course in the fall, was bored by the discussion of marginal benefit and cost. But no matter. This is a laptop classroom, where each student sits behind an open machine, sometimes posting answers to the professor's queries on a virtual chalkboard, sometimes, well, doing something else. 
 "I haven't skipped this class once," noted Mr. Leary, 18. "Even if there's something in class that's boring, there's other stuff you can do."
Wake Forest is one of more than 100 colleges and universities across the country where a computer is now required to matriculate. Not only has this created new forms of in-class distraction and revolutionized campus communication, but it has begun to transform teaching itself.
For example, Gordon McCray, a Wake Forest business professor, turned all of his lectures into a streaming video CD-ROM, essentially doubling his class time by forcing students to watch the lectures (or read a transcript) on their own. He thereby freed class time for group exercises.
Others have students do Web research in class to supplement discussion or use software for homework and quizzes that help tailor syllabuses to individuals. Professors say this way they are now serving a broader spectrum of learning styles.
The very hours of learning have also been extended beyond the classroom through online discussion groups -- often including experts in the field or alumni. Where only a handful of students typically take advantage of once-a-week office hours, instructors are now in constant contact with their students by e-mail, even in the wee hours.
"It's not just added on to the old curriculum -- it's a whole new curriculum," said Bill Moss, a professor of mathematics at Clemson University in South Carolina, where he started a laptop project for 250 engineering majors this year. "You've got old guys like me who've been teaching for 30 years who've got to throw out stacks of yellow notes and start a whole new pedagogy."
Arguing that computer literacy is now an essential part of a liberal arts education, small colleges and professional schools now scratch for spots on Yahoo's annual ranking of America's "most wired" colleges.
The first colleges to require computers were the military academies, which started putting a desktop in every cadet's room in 1983.
But the current wave began a decade later at the University of Minnesota-Crookston, an outpost of 2,464 students on the western edge of the state, and has erupted over the last five years, from Seton Hall in New Jersey to Sonoma State in California, from the University of Virginia's business school to the tiny Shepard Broad Law Center at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
Now the trend is spreading to large public institutions: the University of Florida in Gainesville, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Michigan State University have all recently approved computer requirements.
Experts estimate that 80 percent of college students now bring a computer with them to campus. Making it a requirement means the cost can be factored in for financial aid; it also allows the university to impose uniformity, which makes technical support much simpler. (Some colleges, like Wake Forest, have raised tuition and mail the laptops to students shortly after acceptance letters.) In most cases, students pay about $3,000 for a laptop fully loaded with software specially designed for the institution, then trade it for a new model their junior or senior year.
Universities are also spending millions of dollars to upgrade classrooms so there are plugs and Internet connections at every seat -- though some are experimenting with wireless technology -- as well as laser disc players and video screens up front. There are added costs for expanded computer help desks, work-study jobs for students who provide emergency technical assistance in dormitories, and training for reluctant, old-fashioned faculty.
"The students believe we've given them an edge as they go out into the marketplace," said Joseph D. Harbaugh, dean of the Nova law school, where students use legal case-management software to file their assignments and mock-bill their time. "This has set us apart as we go out into the market for students and for faculty."
At Clemson, English classes keep their compositions in electronic portfolios posted on the Web. At Western Carolina University in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains, literature professors are able to use primary source documents in their lectures, displaying Web images of the handwritten notes of a minor British poet from an archive hundreds of miles away at Princeton University. In Jonathan Zittrain's class on Internet and Society at Harvard Law School, students respond each week to a question posted on the Web, and the answers are automatically routed to another student -- or, perhaps, the author of the pertinent article -- for comments.
At Oberlin College in Ohio, a class on the industrial revolution is using university-owned laptops kept locked in a newly wired classroom. One day they browse an online archive of correspondence between spouses in 19th-century Pennsylvania, another they analyze data from the 1870 census in Cleveland.
"We're experiencing something of the same sense of upheaval," said Gary Kornblith, the professor, aware of the irony of his technique and his topic. "I see a lot of parallels, and I hope my students will see parallels."
Here at Wake Forest, where the class of 2000 was the first to receive laptops, only a handful of professors regularly use computers in the classroom, but nearly all of them incorporate technology into their teaching.
Students in Patricia Dixon's Musical Protest in the Americas class consulted Pete Seeger himself in an online chat (and later corrected the professor by supplying Mr. Seeger's eyewitness view of events).
Rick Matthews, chairman of the physics department, said a circuit-maker program has elevated his electronics class. Before, students would draw a circuit, he would find a couple of mistakes -- probably miss one or two -- and give the paper, say, an 82. Now, students can test the circuit to see whether current would actually flow; everyone gets a zero or 100, because no one turns the assignment in until it works.
"The homework before wasn't teaching them anything -- it was merely documenting what they knew and didn't know," he said. "Now, they're putting four times as much time in as they did before, they're enjoying the homework more, learning 50 percent more electronics."
David G. Brown spearheaded Wake Forest's computer initiative while he was provost, and now is dean of the university's International Center for Computer Enhanced Learning.
"The computer is like the library," said Dr. Brown, an economist who uses laptops every day in class, having students type answers into a chat room rather than raise hands, or prepare an instant presentation doing Web research. "It's an intellectual resource. If you don't have it, you've got to dumb down your course, you've got to dumb down your research."
There are, of course, potential pitfalls.
There is the astronomy professor at Wake Forest who posted his lectures on the Web -- so most people stopped showing up for class. And there are the students at Columbia University School of Business who spend their time in class trading stocks -- occasionally interrupting the lecture with whoops of joy or sighs of pain over their trades. And there is the incessant clicking on campuses everywhere as students take notes on their machines or use them to write exams.
"It can't make up for a good teacher," said Heath Baumgarten, 20, a Wake Forest junior from Freeport, Me. "It has changed the social body. It's harder to meet people. A lot of people are inside a lot now."
As the first laptop class graduates from Wake Forest this spring, Mr. Baumgarten said he, for one, plans to leave his computer behind.

Re "Looking for the S.U.V. Vote" (Week in Review, March 19): While many economists would argue that the best way to improve fuel efficiency is to increase gasoline prices, such a move would disproportionately affect less affluent drivers.
The income gap between sport utility vehicle owners and sedan owners suggests that the way to encourage demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles is to impose a "gas-guzzler tax" on all new vehicles sold in the United States that exceed the average fuel economy of the American auto fleet by a certain percentage. 
 Such a targeted tax would encourage consumers to shop for more fuel-efficient autos, and manufacturers would seek to meet this changing demand over time. The tax is justified because the general public bears the environmental costs of those who choose to indulge their taste for fuel inefficiency.

HEADLINE: Political Briefing;
Gas Prices the Talk Of State Campaigns

BYLINE: By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 

 BODY:
The steep rise in gasoline prices has mainly provided political fodder for Republicans going after Vice President Al Gore, who likes to boast that the country has never enjoyed better economic times. But more and more the gas issue is filtering down into Congressional and state races.
In Virginia, former Gov. George F. Allen, a Republican trying to oust Senator Charles S. Robb, a Democrat, says Mr. Robb has to go because he once called for a 50-cents-a-gallon increase in gas taxes. 
 In Nebraska, George Grogan, a Republican businessman running for the Senate, is broadcasting advertisements in which he accuses President Clinton of knuckling under to OPEC and urges cuts in the federal gas tax and more oil exploration.
In Connecticut, the state's Republican Party recently ran advertisements in which Gov. John G. Rowland called on voters to press state legislators, particularly reluctant Democrats, to pass a 7-cents-a-gallon cut in the state's 32-cents-a-gallon gas tax. Democrats worry that this cut would cost the state treasury too much.
And in New York?
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani says the blame for the price spike should be laid "completely at the feet" of Hillary Rodham Clinton's husband.

HEADLINE: On Park Bench, Another Jolt In a Bumpy Life;
Moved Along by the Police, A Soviet Emigre Vanishes

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Some Soviet dissidents became international symbols of human rights. Nikolai G. Tolstykh, like thousands of others, served his political imprisonment in obscurity. Confined for years in labor camps for anti-Soviet propaganda in the 1980's, Mr. Tolstykh was nearly 40 and estranged from his wife and son by the time a thaw in the cold war cracked open his cell door and sent him to America.
He had studied medicine, psychiatry and law in the Soviet Union. But in New York City, where his name became Tolstich, his broken English and bad health left him struggling in temporary jobs as a home health aide. He was depressed, friends said, and he drank. In late 1998, a decade after Mikhail S. Gorbachev ordered him freed, Mr. Tolstich entered a Manhattan homeless shelter. 
 By all accounts, he still cut a professorial figure on Dec. 6, when he sat down on a bench in a Chelsea park at noon in a light rain. A thin, neatly dressed man of 51 with short hair and a goatee, he had beside him a briefcase holding a Russian-English dictionary, a book of philosophy and a few personal items, including a hairbrush.
But two New York City police officers had reason to suspect he was homeless. His bench was one of a dozen in the park on Ninth Avenue and 28th Street across from the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen, where 1,000 homeless people eat daily. Sure enough, when the officers demanded identification, Mr. Tolstich produced a homeless shelter ID card.
Mr. Tolstich said they ordered him to put his briefcase on the ground, stood him against a tree, frisked him and searched his pockets, according to an affidavit he signed on Dec. 29. Then they issued him a summons for a violation -- "obstructing park bench" -- because he had the briefcase on it. This month, lawyers for the homeless added Mr. Tolstich's affidavit and summons to a 1997 federal class-action lawsuit that has challenged the constitutionality of the Giuliani administration's crackdowns on the homeless.
But Mr. Tolstich himself has disappeared.
He was last seen at the 30th Street Men's Shelter in Manhattan on Jan. 7 -- three days before his court date to contest the violation. Letters from his elderly mother in St. Petersburg collect at the social service agency where he received his mail. And after fruitlessly searching the jails and shelter system, his lawyer and Soviet emigres who knew him say they are worried that Mr. Tolstich may have found the revival of old fears unbearable.
In his affidavit, he wrote: "I now associate that park not only with the experience I had on Dec. 6, but also with my experience in the Soviet Union. There, because it was a totalitarian state, the police could treat anyone the way the police treated me on that day. On Dec. 6, I felt treated like somebody in the Soviet Union, because I am homeless."
A Police Department spokesman, Lt. Stephen Biegel, would not comment on the incident because a judge has not ruled on it. But he said the police received many neighborhood complaints about homeless people spreading belongings on benches. Park regulations prohibit the use of a bench in a way that interferes with its availability.
Douglas Lasdon, executive director of the nonprofit Urban Justice Center, who met Mr. Tolstich at the soup kitchen's legal clinic, said that during the month Mr. Tolstich prepared his affidavit, he was sober and reliable, keeping three appointments. The former dissident, who studied in Leningrad at the prestigious Academy of Arts and at the Medical Institute before being sent to hard labor in prison camps, was in a workfare job at the time, records show, cleaning doors on Wall Street in exchange for weekly relief of $11.25 and $32 in food stamps.
Mr. Lasdon said he told Mr. Tolstich the park bench violation was likely to be dismissed, but warned that a failure to appear in court would generate an arrest warrant. He noted that the police had been raiding shelters to round up homeless people with outstanding warrants. For now, no warrant has been issued for Mr. Tolstich, because the clinic's lawyers have won three adjournments on his behalf.
To the fraying circle of former Soviet dissidents, Mr. Tolstich's case is an emblem of how the post-Communist world has forgotten their sacrifices. "A lot of them have come to no good end," said Edward Kline, the president of the Andrei Sakharov Foundation. "They haven't found a place for themselves in the West and they can't really go back -- they're unwanted in both places."
Is it likely, as Mr. Tolstich's Jan. 10 court date drew near, that memories of being locked up overwhelmed him? "Of course, yes, absolutely," said Yuri Fedorov, a veteran of Soviet political imprisonment and president of the Gratitude Fund, which helps Soviet dissidents. "He's not a very strong man," Mr. Fedorov added. "He used to be a very good man."
In 1986, Soviet exiles placed Mr. Tolstich's name on a list of political prisoners. Veterans of those days read volumes between the lines of his entry: 1980-83, imprisoned under fabricated criminal charge. Arrested spring 1985, Article 70. Publication of his works abroad. Tried December 1985-January 1986. Political camp. Mr. Yarim-Agaev said that fabricated criminal charges were especially commonplace in 1980, during a three-year campaign by the K.G.B. to eliminate dissent. After rounding up all the visible activists, he said, the secret police arrested little-known dissenters and put them with criminals. "That is part of the tragedy of Nikolai," he added.
The works that got Mr. Tolstich in trouble are long forgotten -- probably articles in the Russian-language press of Europe, experts say. But they were enough for charges under Article 70, which outlawed "anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda." Pretrial detention was harsh in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), whether in a K.G.B. prison known as "the gray house," or in Kresty, the infamous czarist-era fortress with punishment booths that only had room for a man to stand.
His conviction under Article 70 meant punishment in a political labor camp, with even more severe physical conditions than in the criminal camp, said Mr. Yarim-Agaev, who called it "the second circle of hell."
Mr. Tolstich was one of 200 political prisoners released by decree of Mr. Gorbachev in late 1987, and among those expelled from the country, his affidavit said. Within days of arriving in New York, he came to the Center for Democracy in the U.S.S.R. in Manhattan, which Mr. Yarim-Agaev had founded in 1985. Later, Mr. Tolstich contributed articles to various publications including Novoye Russkoye Slovo, the major Russian language newspaper in New York, others said.
"He wrote a lot," Mr. Yarim-Agaev recalled. "He was -- he is a very cultivated and educated person, a person with humanitarian inclinations." But adjustment to a foreign country was difficult after years in a prison camp, he added. "A person after that hardly feels full of energy for new labors and new beginnings."
Many dissidents had imagined that coming to America would feel like coming home. Instead, they found what Catherine A. Fitzpatrick, executive director of the International League for Human Rights, calls "a constant disconnect" between their ideals and reality. And when the Soviet Union collapsed into economic chaos, gangsters and old K.G.B. hands seemed to get rich and powerful on United States aid, the former dissidents said, while their kind slid into impoverished irrelevance.
The Center for Democracy was disbanded in 1991. For a few years, Mr. Tolstich's acquaintances saw him at birthdays and funerals in the old circle, but eventually lost track of him. By the mid-1990's, the downward slope of his life steepened into a succession of unstable living arrangements and short-lived jobs he listed for his lawyer: mechanic's assistant, clerk, security guard.
At one point, acquaintances said, Mr. Tolstich roomed in a squalid ground floor apartment in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn with Boris Khurgin, a newspaperman described by former colleagues as a brilliant poet who drank himself to death at 48.
On a hot summer night a week after Mr. Khurgin's death in 1995, a colleague was sent to their apartment to look for poems to save. What he found was a wake without end in two tiny, barely furnished rooms where several men sat half-naked, sweating and drinking vodka with "terrible, bluish faces." One was Mr. Tolstich.
At the end of 1997, Mr. Tolstich entered the city's shelter system for the first time, returning in late 1998, Department of Homeless Shelter records show. But last year, when Mr. Fedorov encountered him again, he was pulling his life together. He said he had been living for months at the 30th Street shelter and attending an alcohol treatment and counseling program for Russian immigrants.
"He said he quit the drinking and tried to find a job," Mr. Fedorov said. "It was true. I asked him, 'Why didn't you call me when you had a problem with this?' But he said, 'I was ashamed.' "
Mr. Fedorov last saw him on Dec. 28, at a nursing home where they visited another former political prisoner, who was dying of cancer at 58. Friends say that they believe that Mr. Tolstich was shaken by that man's death a few days later, and that it might have contributed to his disappearance.
On a recent afternoon, a few worn-looking men rested in the part of Chelsea Park where the police had stopped Mr. Tolstich. There is a small patch of asphalt surrounding a World War I memorial to "the soldiers and sailors of Chelsea." The site of the former dissident's humiliation resonated with some.
"Dissidents are like soldiers," Mr. Yarim-Agaev said. "They're veterans of the war for human rights. Even Nikolai, I would not consider a failure -- he has already won his struggle. He deserved to live decently the rest of his life for what he already accomplished."

HEADLINE: Holbrooke's Campaign

BYLINE: By James Traub; James Traub is a contributing writer for the magazine, for which he has written about Kofi Annan, Rudolph Giuliani and others.

 BODY:
Richard C. Holbrooke has a taste for melodrama and derring-do that is practically archaic in the modern world of diplomacy. One epigram Holbrooke uses in "To End a War," a cliffhanging account of his role in the negotiations to end the war in Bosnia, is a quotation from Melville: "I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts." Holbrooke has a whole stock of literary passages and phrases he likes to quote. Another one comes from Yeats, and has to do with "the fascination with what's difficult." Holbrooke, who since last August has been the United States ambassador to the United Nations, told me that he recited this one to his staff in November as his plane was landing in East Timor. Since the United Nations had authorized a major peacekeeping operation in East Timor, Holbrooke had a perfectly valid reason to fly halfway around the world in order to spend two days there. But East Timor was also the most barbarous coast he could find. Holbrooke has to go looking for danger these days. His current job calls for him to spend most of his time in Manhattan and Washington.
Holbrooke's central task on these two fronts is to end the antagonism that has grown up between the United States and the United Nations over the last six years or so. It is a job whose degree of difficulty is approximately equal to that of the Bosnian negotiations, even if it lacks forbidden seas. Perhaps the dramatic high point came in January when Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, addressed the United Nations Security Council, which Helms had spent years abusing as a threat to American sovereignty. Holbrooke, who had invited Helms, hoped that he would find it impossible to continue demonizing the institution once he encountered it in human form. On the other hand, he worried that the senator would launch an outrageous attack on, say, the Chinese, who would then respond in kind, precipitating some kind of awful incident. Many diplomats felt that a Helms visit would be insulting to the United Nations; some Clinton administration officials felt that Holbrooke was handing Helms a free pass to trumpet his views. Helms did, in fact, give a Helmsian speech, which included a threat that the United States would withdraw from the United Nations; but he didn't name names. 
 When I saw Holbrooke the next day, I asked him if the Helms speech had been a success. His chief press aide, Mary Ellen Glynn, happened to walk into the office with a sheaf of clippings. "Mary Ellen," Holbrooke said, "what's the lead?" Glynn looked at an Associated Press story on top of her pile and read the headline: "Helms Offers Hand to U.N. . . . " Holbrooke slapped the table gleefully. "That's the headline he wants," Holbrooke cried. Indeed, one of Helms's aides later told me that the visit brought "closure" to "the running battle with the U.N.," and later, in mid-March, Helms himself opened a new chapter by inviting the Security Council to visit the Senate.
Holbrooke had advanced the cause, as well as, perhaps, his own prospects. It is a virtual axiom of Washington life that Richard Holbrooke wants to be the next secretary of State, though Holbrooke himself professes to scorn any such ambition. Holbrooke is very close to Al Gore; in 1996, the vice president pushed hard to have Holbrooke nominated as secretary of State to succeed Warren Christopher. When Holbrooke invited the vice president to address the Security Council 10 days before Helms did, it was widely assumed that he was doing a favor for Gore and for himself. Should Gore become president and the Republicans retain control of the Senate, Holbrooke would need Jesse Helms's good office to ensure his confirmation. Several Clinton administration officials say that Holbrooke had not made it clear that the senator was to address the Security Council publicly, rather than in a closed session. "This was something Holbrooke did at the last minute," says one, "and he did it rather cravenly to curry favor with Helms."
Those are fighting words, and they afford some idea of the enmity, and perhaps envy, that Holbrooke routinely provokes. There is no other figure in the world of diplomacy who excites people's feelings the way Holbrooke does, or who so thoroughly incarnates the turbulence and glamour that once attached itself to the making of foreign policy. Leon Fuerth, who is the national security adviser to the vice president and a fan of Holbrooke's, says of him: "He's brilliant, imaginative, a strategic thinker. He's a very complex man who has a very strong impact on people -- they either love him or they hate him."
Not long after Holbrooke took up his new job last summer, he attended a budget committee meeting at which the British ambassador to the United Nations, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, remarked, "The United States has muffled its voice and stained its reputation" -- an intentionally stunning blow from America's staunchest ally. Nancy Soderberg, one of Holbrooke's top aides, says that when she proposed an extension of a peacekeeping project, the answer typically came back: "What do you care? You don't pay anyway." The United States was used to being resented in the United Nations, but scorn -- that was something new.
The main reason for this dismal state of affairs was that the United States had fallen so far behind in its annual payments to the United Nations that it was in danger of losing its vote in the General Assembly -- a fate that has never befallen a major Western nation. This was taken, correctly, as a sign of American nonchalance, or hostility, toward the United Nations. From the outset, Holbrooke said that nothing he did would really matter unless the Clinton administration could persuade Congress to pay the United Nations $926 million for the United States' arrears. (The United Nations put the figure at $1.6 billion, but Washington wasn't using that figure.) "We can't ignore it as it's been ignored in the past," Holbrooke told me early last fall. Then he heard the implied slight to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and corrected himself: "Or, not ignored, but not given enough emphasis. If we can't afford to lose we might as well throw ourselves body and soul into the effort, like a skier in a downhill race just going flat out -- you're either going to win or fall."
In October, Holbrooke started traveling to Washington to lobby Congress. The image that came to mind during these trips was not so much the downhill race as the full-court press. His staff kept a running tally of total Congressional contacts -- 23 one day, or 24 if you count the senator he buttonholed on the Capitol subway. One afternoon, when Holbrooke and the entourage that always seems to be trailing him tumbled out of the Capitol for a meeting in one of the House office buildings, Barbara Larkin, the State Department's Congressional liaison, whispered, "That's Steve Largent -- go get 'im!" Largent is a young conservative from Oklahoma. The man in the suit there on the sidewalk actually looked a little short to be Largent, a former National Football League wide receiver, and as Holbrooke closed on him, the man stuck out a hand and introduced himself as Bob Weygand, a Rhode Island Democrat. Holbrooke didn't miss a beat. He began talking about how many Rhode Islanders he had on his staff, and soon the two were trading gibes about the Brown University football team. As Holbrooke walked away, he started laughing, and then he turned to an aide and told her to set up an appointment with Largent.
Holbrooke never tried to defend the United Nations to a Republican in the United Nations' own language of mutuality and moral obligation. "It's about national security," he would say. It was precisely because the United States could not serve as the world's policeman that it needed the United Nations to intervene in crises around the world. Holbrooke invariably mentioned East Timor, where the United Nations had for once acted quickly in the face of mass violence. The multilateral force that the Security Council authorized involved, as Holbrooke never failed to note, no Americans and very few dollars. When he testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in early November, Holbrooke propped up a chart showing that only 36 American soldiers were serving in United Nations peacekeeping forces -- one-tenth the figure from the high-water mark of six years earlier. "We have learned the lesson of Somalia," he reassured the senators.
Holbrooke was able to exercise direct influence only on the White House. The Clinton administration had always favored paying the arrears, but never cared enough to force a confrontation on the issue with Congressional Republicans. Holbrooke's great fear last fall, which he would never express in public, was that the president's domestic-policy advisers would agree to barter away the arrears at the 11th hour to get in return something that actually mattered politically to them. Holbrooke spoke out constantly on the subject, and administration officials give him credit for raising the profile of the issue, though they give as much or more to Secretary of State Albright.
As for Congress, Holbrooke understood that the only figure who really mattered was Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert. And Hastert wouldn't return his calls. Holbrooke spotted Hastert one day at a White House ceremony and trapped him against a statue of Ulysses S. Grant. "I pinned the coach!" he told me exuberantly a few days later. (Hastert used to be a high-school wrestling coach.)
But Holbrooke knew that the only way he could influence Hastert was to persuade individual Republicans that the United Nations was too important to be held hostage to the abortion debate, which it had been since 1997. It was then that a New Jersey congressman named Christopher Smith saw to it that two pieces of legislation essentially having nothing to do with each other were linked: his bill prohibiting the administration from financing any foreign organization using its own funds to perform or lobby for abortions anywhere in the world, and legislation providing for the payment of United Nation arrears. (Smith's amendment was attached annually to legislation financing the United Nations, thus ensuring a stalemate.) And Holbrooke discovered that many of the people he talked to had never spoken even to a midlevel State Department official, much less a United Nations ambassador; he made an impression just by taking the trouble to visit. Holbrooke's predecessor, Bill Richardson, was a former congressman, but Holbrooke turned out to be by far the more effective lobbyist of the two. One American official who worked with both men says: "Richardson wasn't nearly so relentless; he stopped when he encountered resistance from the White House. Holbrooke made a pest of himself, as he also did on the Hill."
By early December, both the White House and the Republicans were ready to compromise. The original Smith amendment required foreign recipients of United States funds to certify that they would not use their own money for abortions or abortion lobbying. Negotiators from both sides agreed to narrow the range of prohibited activities and to allow the president to set aside the requirement, for up to a total of $15 million -- which is probably all the government would have spent anyway. When I went to visit Holbrooke in his office a few days after the agreement was reached, he was in a triumphant mood. "We got 90 percent of what we wanted," he said. On the other hand, he added, "the women have emphasized the 10 percent we didn't get." Holbrooke saw this as feminist purism. As we were talking, a call came in from one of Washington's most prominent women. Holbrooke picked up the phone, tried to talk and recoiled as if from a percussive shock. He made a wry face at me; we were complicit. "O.K., I don't know what I'm talking about," he said. "I've spent the last eight weeks talking to members of Congress I didn't know existed. . . . No, we beat Chris Smith. . . . Look, the United Nations is the biggest family-planning agency in the world. . . . You know I love you; otherwise I wouldn't scream at you."
All the while, Holbrooke was mugging for me and stealing glances at the TV, which was tuned to CNN. His chief of staff, Rosemarie Pauli, was whispering that he had to get off the phone for a meeting to thank his staff for its help, and then he had to go home and dress for a dinner he was giving for Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO supreme commander. But Holbrooke couldn't, or wouldn't, end the conversation. Finally, he leaned into the phone with a seductive grin and said, "Are we going to have trouble getting the votes from you?" He listened for a moment, smiled and said, "Ahhh."
Holbrooke and I had lunch one afternoon in late January at the Ambassador Grill, the unofficial commissary of the United Nations elite. He drank a glass of white wine and began talking about his monthlong stint as president of the Security Council, which was just ending. Holbrooke has an oddly soft voice for so ebullient a character, and a confiding manner that is designed to seduce. Suddenly, apropos of very little, he said, "I hate personality-driven pieces." He had, he said, only agreed to talk with me because Mary Ellen Glynn thought he should do it. He probably wouldn't agree to pose for a picture. Holbrooke said that he had to leave in a minute. Until this moment, Holbrooke's manner toward me had been either flattering or bantering; now I wondered if I had committed some blunder. Then Holbrooke told me how much he had enjoyed an earlier article of mine. Had he mentioned it before? (Twice, actually.) Then he said, "No one has ever written about my refugee work," and he proceeded to shine a light on this overlooked corner of his career. Nor, he observed, had any writer properly described "the Wall Street part of my career." There was much to say on this subject. Holbrooke talked and talked and talked as a man vacuumed the carpet first to one side of us, then the other. We were the last customers left in the Ambassador Grill.
Holbrooke has had to endure a really remarkable amount of ridicule for a man with his record of achievement. Some of it is envy; but Holbrooke gives the envious ammunition by being so very transparent in his self-aggrandizement and so unconscious of the effect he produces. "I love Dick, but he is his own worst enemy," says one American diplomat who has known Holbrooke for a quarter-century. "We all spin, but Dick just can't stop. He hits a clean double, and then he wants to stretch it into a triple."
Holbrooke is notorious for looking over shoulders at cocktail parties, calling hosts at the last minute to cancel in favor of a better offer, shamelessly name-dropping, ladling praise on media stars and stepping on toes on his way to the top. His enemies consider him ruthlessly self-serving, while his friends speak of him with mordant irony, if also with genuine fondness. Most of them feel that he would make a truly great secretary of State, and they don't doubt that he feels that way himself. If Al Gore is elected president and does not choose Holbrooke as his secretary of State, says one, "That's when he'll need his friends." Holbrooke's cultivation of Gore is the stuff of legend. "He doesn't have a dinner party where he doesn't invite Karenna," says another friend. (For the record, Karenna Gore Schiff was invited to only one of the three dinners I attended.)
Mike McCurry, President Clinton's former spokesman, says: "It was amazing to behold how relentlessly self-promotional Holbrooke was. But it was never offensive. The president was wryly amused. He liked watching the Holbrooke show."
Holbrooke is a show. He is, at the age of 58, a big man, with big gifts, big foibles and the kind of big commitments that have fallen out of fashion, as domestic policy has supplanted foreign affairs. "There is a field of energy around Dick Holbrooke," says Fouad Ajami, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Johns Hopkins University who has observed the man largely from a distance. "He harks back to an age when American power had great confidence about itself and a belief that America could do well and do good at the same time. He embodies the innocence and activism and hubris and nervous energy of that time. You compare him to Sandy Berger or Strobe Talbott" -- the national security adviser and the deputy secretary of State, respectively -- and they pale. They don't evoke in us that image of American grandeur."
Holbrooke speaks often of Henry Kissinger, and there is something in the way Holbrooke bestrides the world that can put you in mind of him. Like Kissinger, Holbrooke wants to be on the inside of everything -- every debate, every decision, every juicy secret and every desirable party. He is, like Kissinger, a social animal, equally sought-after as a guest and a host. Indeed, a Holbrooke dinner party is an exercise in seduction at the very highest level, not least for the journalist invited to watch. Almost everyone there is some kind of star -- a media star, political star, diplomatic star. The explicit function of these events, which are staged at the United States ambassador's official residence on the 42nd floor of the Waldorf Towers, is to introduce the elite of New York and Washington to what Holbrooke calls "the U.N. Village"; their distinguishing feature is the heady mixing of cultural and political power with moral glamour. Tom Brokaw, meet Nelson Mandela; Senator Rod Grams, meet Kofi Annan.
Everyone is flattered by everyone else. Forty people sit at four round tables; the guest of honor sits next to Holbrooke's wife, Kati Marton, a Hungarian refugee, journalist and herself a glittering presence. And Holbrooke delivers a toast that mingles high seriousness, flattery and wit. At a dinner earlier this month, he made gentle fun of Bernard Kouchner, the embattled head of the United Nations mission in Kosovo, for publicly begging for funds, and then he described him as the most talented figure in the United Nations and evoked the impossible conditions in which he worked -- as Senator Warner will have described to you, Barbara." Leave it to Holbrooke to offer a lollipop to Barbara Walters in the middle of a description of the Kosovar nightmare.
That quality in Holbrooke -- the lavishness of character, the theatricality -- seems a throwback in today's America. But Holbrooke often points to the fact that both of his parents were refugees, his mother from Germany and his father from Russia. Holbrooke's father, a doctor, was a cultured, Old World figure, but he fell ill when the boy was 7 and died when he was 15. During those years, Holbrooke's mother was preoccupied with caring for his father. This may help explain why Holbrooke sometimes seems semisocialized. As Kati Marton says: "Many of the things that we learn at home he didn't learn. He went out into the world, and the world was very quick to reward his brain, but the world was very put off by the man's lack of formality." This last phrase may be taken as a wifely euphemism.
It also may have been the loss of his father that led Holbrooke to look to much older and more powerful men for both guidance and sponsorship. His best friend growing up was David Rusk, the son of Dean Rusk, who was to become President Kennedy's secretary of State. The elder Rusk, the first of Holbrooke's mentors, persuaded him to take the foreign service test; he passed. This was in 1962, and Holbrooke, who has some sort of inner sense for where the action lies, asked to go to Vietnam. "There was a war going on, and it was the far end of the world," Holbrooke says. "It didn't interest me to be a third secretary in Europe or Asia."
Holbrooke began as an economic development officer in the field and then was assigned to Saigon, first as an aide to Gen. Maxwell Taylor and then as assistant to Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge. Holbrooke was immediately recognized as a junior member of the Best and the Brightest. Frank Wisner, a career diplomat who is Holbrooke's closest friend, says: "Dick loved the interaction of American politics. He loved matching wits with McNamara, Bundy, Lodge. And he worked with and came to know the next generation of foreign policy leaders" -- Cyrus Vance, Anthony Lake and others. Inevitably, Holbrooke got himself assigned to Averell Harriman's staff for the fruitless early stages of the Paris peace talks. Harriman became another mentor and guide, as later did Clark Clifford.
Holbrooke left the foreign service in 1969; he says that he couldn't work for Richard Nixon, but his friends from that time say that he simply found the foreign service too confining. During the years of Republican rule, Holbrooke went from the Woodrow Wilson Center at Princeton to the Peace Corps in Morocco to the editorship of Foreign Policy magazine. He came to know Jimmy Carter through the superestablishment Trilateral Commission, of which he was a member. Holbrooke left Foreign Policy to join the Carter campaign in early 1976 in what turned out to be a very nimble piece of political handicapping. When Carter became president, Holbrooke's entire Vietnam cohort rose a full notch; Holbrooke himself became assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. He was, at 35, the youngest assistant secretary in decades.
Holbrooke suddenly found himself in a very difficult position. Jimmy Carter had promised to moralize American foreign policy, and he created the new post of assistant secretary of State for human rights. His appointee, Patricia Derian, fought with all the regional assistant secretaries, but since right-wing dictators abounded in the Asia of the 1970's, she fought with Holbrooke most of all. The two tangled bitterly over President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, and Holbrooke would later be accused of serving as Marcos's chief defender in the Carter administration.
Holbrooke seemed offended when I raised this with him. He sees himself as a profoundly moral figure who at the same time scorns traditional American moralism as nave. Neither a Henry Kissinger on the one hand nor a Woodrow Wilson on the other, he is, in his own mind, a hard-headed idealist. "You have to deal with your responsibilities for the overall national interest," he said. "In 1978, to use our leverage in the Philippines to try to overthrow the president of the Philippines without any idea of what would follow, without any viable Philippine opposition, would have been very strange."
When the Republicans retook the White House, Holbrooke returned to civilian life. He had two sons from a first marriage, and he had gone through a second marriage as well. Now he made a tidy little fortune at Lehman Brothers while he played the social lion in New York. He also churned out a steady stream of op-ed pieces, testified before Congress and showed up at the big foreign policy events. Holbrooke had high hopes when the Democrats returned to power in the person of Bill Clinton. He had helped prep Clinton on foreign policy issues during the campaign. But he hadn't gotten in early enough. Worse still, the new secretary of State was Warren Christopher, the incarnation of the cautious, rulebound lawyer-diplomat, and back in the Carter State Department, Christopher had taken a dim view of Holbrooke. (Christopher had also served as chairman of the department's human rights committee.) Holbrooke was shut out of all three top jobs at State, while the job of national security adviser went to his old friend and rival, Tony Lake. It was, Holbrooke's friends say, a very bitter moment for him.
Holbrooke's temperament had, in effect, trumped his talents. Another man might have slunk back to Wall Street and contented himself with wealth and the company of beautiful women. But Holbrooke couldn't bear to be away from the action. What Holbrooke was finally offered was the ambassadorship to Germany; it was a small and rather distant perch, but he accepted. In the summer of 1994, after a year in Bonn, he was asked to return to Washington as assistant secretary for European and Canadian Affairs. This must have been yet harder to accept, for he would be returning to the same pay grade he had reached almost 20 years earlier; but again, he agreed (because the president personally asked him, he says).
Holbrooke would oversee NATO expansion, but it wasn't just about NATO. Nobody at State or at the White House wanted to take responsibility for the Balkans; Christopher had called it "a problem from Hell." And that was exactly why Holbrooke wanted it. Holbrooke's lightning dashes to the region, his all-night confrontations with Slobodan Milosevic, his shouting matches with the Bosnians, his virtuosity and almost comic machinations at Dayton and his ultimate success in getting the three warring factions to accept a divided country are all the stuff of legend by now, thanks in no small part to Holbrooke's own wonderfully superheated memoirs. Even Holbrooke's detractors concede that Dayton, which ended the violence in Bosnia -- though it scarcely brought peace -- was an extraordinary achievement.
The Dayton marathon was perfectly suited to Holbrooke's iron-man metabolism, as well as to his love of dizzying orchestrations. What is also true, however, is that Holbrooke took to the negotiations a historical consciousness and a sense of moral dimensions that had been missing before. He described the Balkans as "the greatest collective security failure of the West since the 1930's." And of course by invoking Munich, he was conjuring up the magnitude of the evil perpetrated by Slobodan Milosevic and by the Bosnian Serbs. Holbrooke hitched a ruthless pragmatism to a genuine moral imagination. Leslie Gelb, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a close friend of Holbrooke's, says: "To achieve truly important things you have to be willing to put your personal reputation on the line in a very skillful way, and Dick is one of the few people I've met in my life who has the courage to do that. It's not nutso ambition; it's courage." Gelb, Elie Wiesel and the Columbia historian Fritz Stern nominated Holbrooke for the Nobel Peace Prize.
According to Mike McCurry, President Clinton seriously considered nominating Holbrooke for secretary of State in 1996, though he wasn't sure how he would fit with the foreign policy team he planned. So Holbrooke was left out in the cold once again. The following year the president asked him to return to the Balkans to try to advance the peace process. In June 1998, Clinton named Holbrooke ambassador to the United Nations -- a job he finally assumed after a long confirmation process. Holbrooke insists that he would be perfectly happy if this were his last job in the government, and when I raised the subject of ambition, he bristled. "I can't do anything about the story line," he said, "and maybe some of my own actions contributed to it. But I can tell you if my goal in life was simply to be secretary of State, I would not have behaved the way I behaved over the last 20 years. I was interested in policy, and the people who got the secretary of State job were usually much more careful about policy."
That's a fair point. At the same time, no one is betting against Holbrooke now that Al Gore's electoral fortunes are rising. One State Department official says: "People have begun saying, 'That was a brilliant comment Holbrooke made the other day.' And then someone else will say, 'I can't believe how that guy is already sucking up to Holbrooke.' And then we spend the rest of the day chewing over that."
Of course, Al Gore may lose or look elsewhere, and we'll never get to know what kind of secretary of State Richard Holbrooke would have made. Holbrooke's private views are probably not far from Clinton administration policy on most matters, though he felt that a more deft negotiator -- himself, perhaps -- could have avoided a war in Kosovo. In broad terms, Holbrooke says, "My greatest concern is the gap between rhetoric and resources." Republicans generally argue that the United States should tone down its rhetoric to match its modest resources; Holbrooke takes the opposite view. 
But this view is also an implicit criticism of the Clinton administration, which has been known for using grand moral language without making solid commitments. International relations in this post-cold-war era have become increasingly technocratic and mercantilist. Holbrooke is saying that our commitments must be equal to our power.
Holbrooke has watched most of the great negotiators of the last few generations, and he has, he says, borrowed from all of them - Cy Vance's precision, Bob Strauss's use of humor, Kissinger's complexities and creativity, Harriman's tenacity." When Holbrooke describes his own style, he tends to talk about the difference between jazz and architecture -- which is to say, the difference between open-ended improvisation and being bound to a prior design. Holbrooke operates by feel and trusts to his instincts as much as to his analytical understanding. "He walks into a meeting with nothing -- no talking points," says one State Department official. "He's like Muhammad Ali -- he's yakking and talking; he's jiving. The first time you see it you think it's just bull; in fact, he's psyching out the other person and reading the reaction. He has this great talent of figuring out what the other person's bottom line is. His diagnostic skills are really remarkable. And when he sees the thread, he just goes after it. It's almost comical, it's so transparent. But it really works."
I had a chance to watch Holbrooke in action in mid-November, during a break he took from laying siege to Capitol Hill. He had invited the three Bosnian co-presidents to the United Nations to commemorate the fourth anniversary of Dayton. They had reluctantly agreed to negotiate several major issues that had not been settled in Dayton and that had since stalled in Sarajevo. And so at 5 p.m. on a Sunday, Holbrooke and his aides sat down on one side of a conference table in Holbrooke's official residence at the Waldorf Towers, while the presidents sat on the other -- the Muslim, Alija Izetbegovic; the Serb, Zivko Radisic; and the Croat, Ante Jelavic. They were joined by their aides and by Milorad Dodik, the prime minister of Republika Srpska, a Serb "entity" inside Bosnia. The presidents almost never met together; they sat stiffly side by side and spoke to Holbrooke even when addressing one another.
Holbrooke began by persuading an extremely grudging Izetbegovic that the Bosnian presidency couldn't function effectively without a staff, which Izetbegovic had blocked because he wanted the staff to consist mostly of Muslims rather than equally of the three ethnic groups. Izetbegovic agreed to a staff of six people -- two, two, two." Holbrooke got him up to 9, then 15. Holbrooke decided to quit while he was ahead, but he inserted the words "initially" and "at least" into the draft.
Another thing Bosnia lacked was a border service. Local police were guarding the borders, and black market goods were pouring through. This would be a much tougher issue. For one thing, Jelavic had to answer to Croatian black-marketeers, and Holbrooke's aides feared that he had been instructed to stall. Jelavic delivered a long and intransigent speech, and then Radisic delivered another speech. Then for an odd moment everyone appeared to agree, and then it became clear that no one agreed. Holbrooke rode it along for a while, then he abruptly shifted gears. He smacked the table good and hard and shouted, "Stop!"
Here, for a moment, was the fabled Sir Richard of Belgrade. Holbrooke looked hard at the three men and said, "Is this a misunderstanding about what the police do, or an attempt to prevent an agreement from happening?" That produced a sheepish moment, and then more bickering. The problem was somewhere else. Holbrooke motioned to Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian ambassador and an old sparring partner from Dayton, who whispered to him that it wasn't Jelavic but Milorad Dodik who was blocking the agreement. Holbrooke summoned Dodik and a translator, and they left the room for 20 minutes. I don't know what Holbrooke promised him, but when Dodik came back, he no longer had a problem. Holbrooke, who kept passing me notes and beckoning me over during the talks, told me that he likes to walk out during negotiations to force the other parties to move forward on their own.
The three presidents ultimately signed a document strongly resembling the "New York Declaration" that the American team had drawn up in advance. Tom Miller, the United States ambassador to Bosnia, told me later that Holbrooke had come in from his weekend place in Bridgehampton (there's also a ski house in Telluride) an hour before the meeting and was basically winging it.
There is a widespread feeling in and around the United Nations that in the aftermath of the disastrous intervention in Somalia in 1993, Madeleine Albright, then the ambassador to United Nations, concluded that the easiest way to get her ticket punched to become secretary of State was to attack the United Nations. It wasn't hard; the United Nations had experienced one disaster after another, and the secretary general, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, was a highly unpopular figure in the United States. (A good deal of bitterness toward Albright still lingers in the organization.) Richard Holbrooke was hardly known as a friend of the United Nations; he had been brutal on the organization's dithering on Bosnia and had in fact banned the United Nations from Dayton. And so when he arrived, diplomats and United Nations officials were waiting to see if he, too, would take to bashing the organization. Holbrooke took a trip to Kosovo just before taking up his official duties in New York, and while there he made a point of praising Bernard Kouchner, who had been the subject of high-level sniping inside the Clinton administration. Then the East Timor crisis blew up, and Holbrooke played a small but critical role, calling around to Security Council members and insisting that the Council pass a resolution instantly to prevent further bloodshed.
And Holbrooke earned a lot of points inside the institution when Congress agreed to begin paying the money the United States owed. "It makes a difference to us to have an American figure who can operate at the highest level," says Sir Jeremy Greenstock. "He's able to project power to a point."
There is some grumbling about Holbrooke from some of the professionals in the United Nations Secretariat, but very little from the diplomats themselves, who seem to be less obsessed with matters of etiquette than you might think. "What I like about Holbrooke is that he's not very diplomatic," says Peter van Walsum, the Dutch ambassador. "He's willing to use the word 'evil' when it's appropriate."
Holbrooke also seems to have forged a very close relationship with the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, whom he praises as lavishly in private as he does in public. Annan returns the favor, giving Holbrooke major credit for the fact that "the standoff and the taboo have been broken." The Holbrookes and the Annans see one another fairly often, and a few weeks ago, at the end of a women's lunch that Kati Marton gave for Annan's wife, Nane, the two husbands suddenly popped out of the elevator on a surprise visit, having sneaked out of some high-level lunch of their own. They made an odd pair of conspirators: Holbrooke stood there beaming and cackling, his arm around various power females, while Annan stood by his wife's side with his typical air of serene and almost royal benevolence.
Nothing is more typical of Holbrooke than his decision to dedicate his entire month as president of the Security Council in January to Africa and to even give it a tag: "month of Africa." It was a public relations stunt with a profound message. The very idea of a "month of" was almost unheard of, especially for any of the five permanent members of the Council. So Holbrooke got credit for entrepreneurship. But Holbrooke also understood the special potency of Africa, a place that absorbed much of the United Nations' attention and resources and virtually none of the United States'. "The Africans," I once heard him tell a visitor, "are obsessed with their theory that we only care about Europe and Asia." Boutros Boutros-Ghali had described the Balkans as "a rich man's war." Thus the "month of Africa" was Part 2 of Holbrooke's mission of re-engagement: first, pay the arrears, and second, take an activist role. (Part 3 is to reform the organization to make it more effective, as Congress has demanded.)
Holbrooke's plan was to use the month to concentrate maximum publicity on the African continent, on the United Nations and on the United States' role in the United Nations. He arranged a series of star turns -- first Gore and then Nelson Mandela, who had agreed to come to brief the Security Council on his efforts to defuse a pending civil war in Burundi. Holbrooke instructed his aides to make sure that the galleries were packed for both men. He was just sitting down for a staff meeting to plan out the month when a phone was brought over. It was Mandela, who was calling with suggestions for the dinner party Holbrooke would be giving for him.
Holbrooke devises dinner parties with the care of a celebrity hostess, mixing and matching from his bottomless store of stars, wise men, experts and whatnot. Now he was writing down names -- the actress Alfre Woodard, the actor Denzel Washington. Holbrooke, who has developed a joshing relationship with Mandela, said: "Mr. President, you know HBO has bought my book on Bosnia, and I want Denzel Washington to play me in the movie. . . . I know what you're thinking -- he's too young to play me." Holbrooke knows precisely how much irony he needs to leaven his own vanity.
Throughout the early part of the month, Holbrooke met with diplomats and United Nations officials to plan negotiations over Congo. A peace agreement, known as the Lusaka Accord, had already been signed the previous summer by Laurent Kabila, the president of Congo, as well as the heads of six neighboring states. But the deadlines in the agreement proved meaningless. Holbrooke's inspiration was to bring the signatories together in New York, offer them a chance to make a statement before the Security Council and then induce them to sign a new and much more specific version of the accord's military annex, which dealt with the withdrawal of foreign forces. Both United Nations and State Department officials were skeptical of this grand venture, but Holbrooke argued that without Lusaka Plus, as he dubbed his hypothetical agreement, the United States Congress would never sign off on the United Nations peacekeeping resolution that the signatories themselves craved.
I heard Holbrooke explain this line of reasoning in a meeting with the ambassadors from the signatory nations. They all seemed very enthusiastic, and Holbrooke lavished his usual hyperbolic praise on them -- this is the most valuable group of any group I've met with" -- but as they went around the room, the Zimbabwean ambassador, Tichaona Jokonya, said that his president, Robert Mugabe, was coming to New York to get a peacekeeping resolution, not to renegotiate Lusaka. Holbrooke turned away in disgust. "Mugabe is indispensable to this process," he said to the group. And then he proceeded to dilate on Mugabe's greatness, as if that would help matters somehow.
Holbrooke began making the case for Lusaka Plus to journalists and diplomats in more and more fervid terms. Congo was becoming, in his mind, a crucible for the international system, as the Balkans had been before, and perhaps as Vietnam had been before that. "The Congo has been the graveyard of the United Nations, literally and figuratively," he said to me one day. Dag Hammerskjold, the sainted secretary general, died in a plane crash on a failed peace mission to Congo in 1961. "If we don't get it right in the Congo," Holbrooke said solemnly, "we're going to go down."
Holbrooke seemed to be getting carried away with his own melodrama. But Holbrooke always raises the stakes, both to flatter the reluctant and to make intransigence seem immoral. Working with Kofi Annan, African diplomats and American ambassadors, Holbrooke succeeded in persuading all seven heads of state to come to New York -- a highly improbable achievement all by itself. On Jan. 24, the Lusaka signatories made a magnificent entrance to the Security Council. Secretary of State Albright was there to introduce them, and Annan himself escorted each of them to a seat at the Security Council -- a bit of pageantry that Holbrooke had seen to personally.
Unfortunately, the private discussions were not working out as well as the public pageantry. Holbrooke and his staff drew up another New York Declaration for Kabila and the other heads of state to sign, but no one was in a mood to sign or even to negotiate. The discussions may have produced more harm than good, according to one person who was involved, since several of the heads of state experienced Holbrooke's rather brisk cajolery as bullying: "They viewed it as a bit of an insult to be asked to come to New York and be told to sign something when they got here. Mugabe, especially, just blew up like a Roman candle."
Mugabe was so angry that Holbrooke crashed a dinner party being held in the president's honor in the hope of mollifying him. When it became obvious that he was failing, he ducked out, called Secretary Albright, who was at the Waldorf, and she then came and calmed Mugabe down. Unlike in Bosnia, these heads could not be knocked. As Holbrooke's aide on African issues, Alex Laskaris, says: "Lusaka is one of the few things they've ever agreed on. They view opening it as more destructive than constructive, even though they're extremely frank about its limitations." The Congo negotiations exposed the dangers of a diplomacy of activism and hubris and nervous energy.
Kabila did, in fact, reiterate his willingness to engage in a "national dialogue" with all segments of Congolese society; and all the signatories rededicated themselves to the process of a negotiated withdrawal. At the same time, Kabila apparently did not feel particularly bound by whatever language he signed on to, since his army continued violating the cease-fire. The Africans, though delighted by Holbrooke's activism, were not very pleased by the outcome of the talks. Joseph Mutaboba, the Rwandan ambassador, describes the United Nations session as "yet another meeting" in which the signatories repeated what they had said elsewhere and accomplished little of substance.
When I asked Holbrooke what happened, he conceded that he hadn't gotten the specific timetable he had wanted, but insisted that "we got enough so that we didn't need that." Lusaka Plus, he said, was really about "going in the right direction" rather than about the particulars that he had not long ago considered indispensable. Here, truly, was Holbrooke's gift for improvisation; he was redefining success as he went along.
On the other hand, if you want to err on the side of caution, then you're wasting your time with Holbrooke. If there is such a thing as a Holbrooke Doctrine, it probably has less to do with an overarching theme of engagement than with a predisposition toward engagement itself. Holbrooke once expounded the theory to me as follows: "Henry Kissinger's view is that you don't get in these things unless your chance of success is 85 to 90 percent, because you're putting the American national interest on the line, and you can't pay the price of failure. I understand that view insofar as during the cold war any setback to the United States was a gain for the Soviet Union, but in the post-cold-war world, where the United States is the single leader and great things are expected of us, we should try even if our chances of success are less than 50 percent. When we went in to Dayton our chances were about 20 percent, maybe 30 percent. In the Congo today, they're less than 50 percent. The downside equation is different from the one Kissinger taught us to live by, and which many of my colleagues still live by."
In other words, tuck those ski poles under your arm, tug your hat down and head for the bumps. It's a nervy and rather attractive formulation. And the inference, of course, is that this is the moment to give it a try -- that is to say, Richard Holbrooke's moment.

Under the Knife
 How a Wealthy Negro Surgeon Wielded Power in the Jim Crow South.
 By Hugh Pearson.
 Illustrated. 249 pp. New York:
 The Free Press. $24. 
 THIS is the story of a search, a quest narrative in which the author follows a trail of research toward reckonings about himself. Such is the premise that Hugh Pearson, a former editorial page writer at The Wall Street Journal, holds out as he travels from New York to southwest Georgia, the land of his forebears, seeking to understand his great-uncle Joseph Griffin, a powerful and esteemed physician, long since dead. Pearson prepares us for shocks to come as he reflects on "the price of shoring up, providing a few more bricks to the facade we Afro-Americans construct to maintain our dignity rather than tell the world or even ourselves everything about who we are."
Pearson comes from a long line of doctors; his father left the South to practice in Indiana. Looming large in the family lore was Uncle Joe, who was graduated from medical school in 1915 and established a practice in the town of Bainbridge, where he built the largest hospital for black people in the state of Georgia. He also became a millionaire.
In excavating his uncle's past, Pearson discovers caves of moral ambiguity. Griffin was a philanthropist in his community, a man whose economic power exacted respect from whites. He amassed his fortune, at least in part, by getting clients to deed over property when they could not pay for medical treatment. "All told, over a 50-year period there were 268 property purchases by or collateralizations to Joe Griffin in Decatur County, to say nothing of the surrounding counties," Pearson writes. In many cases, "he foreclosed and acquired the property of those unable to meet their obligations."
He also performed countless abortions at his hospital. Many of the pregnant women where white, including students from colleges in Florida and Georgia. "The revelation about the abortions my great-uncle performed," Pearson writes in one striking passage, "was the principal reason my father decided not to go to Bainbridge to practice medicine, something he didn't tell me until I began investigating the abortion issue." He says little more about this; his father's moral concerns dissolve into a kind of spin on Uncle Joe: "He had no problem because that meant one less child who had to go through the hell of living in this world. . . . Who knew more about the hell of living in this world than a Negro physician in the small-town Jim Crow Deep South? . . . It was a hell that no doubt hardened him, made him cynical. . . . Or if it was an ambitious Negro girl or coed he was performing the abortion for, maybe he was only too glad to ensure she could become something more than another embarrassing, depressing poverty statistic ending up with a little dirty, naked, potbellied Negro kid among the many dirty, naked, potbellied Negro kids he had delivered and cynically watched grow out of infancy."
It is hard to imagine Griffin not being cynical; it is also easy, thanks to Pearson's reporting, to imagine Uncle Joe's cynicism as handmaiden to his greed. The man who weathered legal problems with people whose property he consumed ended up facing criminal charges in 1967 (six years before Roe v. Wade) for performing abortions. He was 79 years old.
The closer Pearson gets to the character of Uncle Joe, the more ambivalent his own self-searching becomes. Griffin was tried on three counts of performing abortions and convicted of one; the results of that nightmare are dispensed within half a page. The potential in a trial sequence, and all kinds of fireworks about Griffin's character, fade quickly. Instead, Pearson quotes those who knew him. Paul Kwilecki, a Jewish photographer whose family did business with Griffin, and respected him, reflects: "An abortion at that time was worse than illegal. It was considered a very heinous, unscrupulous act for a man who had taken the Hippocratic oath. . . . Dr. Griffin's life poses a question, this business of ambition driven by insecurity, or whatever it was driven by, versus principles and so forth and how we maneuver and skirt around obstacles like right and wrong to reach our destination. All of the elements of classic Greek tragedy are involved in his life."
Pearson extends this idea of tragedy by drawing memories from family members and neighbors who knew Griffin and comment upon his life as the action plays out. It is a measure of Pearson's honesty that he acknowledges his inability to put hard question to those he loves. At a crucial moment, he can't get the words out to Uncle Joe's daughter, now an elderly woman. He wonders if she feels she must atone for his life. "Does she pray for his soul, under the belief that your offspring must pray for you, asking God's mercy for the sins you committed during your life?"
As the question hangs, Pearson embraces the forgiveness so elemental to familial life. And so comes a poignancy transcending issues of race. "Some part of me was still proud of him, in fact, the lion's share of me," he reflects. "I felt bad for anyone who lost their land to my great-uncle. But the larger part of me thought of the robber barons and the legions of other millionaires who ruthlessly exploited or did something illegal on the way to their wealth. . . . I concluded that there aren't too many ways to become very wealthy, minus a certain ruthlessness and willingness to bend the rules."
In developing the biographical portrait, Pearson reflects on the lynchings, violence and economic deprivation that blacks suffered in the segregated South. There is an admirable candor in Hugh Pearson's weighing of of his own privilege -- an Ivy League education, access to reporting jobs -- against the harrowing experiences of his father's family in the South. These passages invest the narrative with a power and sense of urgency, and magnify Pearson's historical reportage on the struggle of early-20th-century black medical schools and physicians.
And yet, what might have been a graceful prose voice is marred by the author's relentless use of "Caucasian" and "Afro-American." The labels supersede words like "white" and "black" and come off as clunky, one page upon another, pounding the message that this book is about racial identity. Pearson's tendency to be preach weakens the strength of his message. A good literary scalpel would have improved the work. One closes this book with a curiosity about the author. "Under the Knife" is a moving passionate story that set Hugh pearson on a road to self-discovery. that search, that wrestling with his own identity, seems a beginning more than an end.

HEADLINE: Thinking Like a Town, Working Like a Region;
From Economic Development to Traffic Flow, Municipalities Learn to Join Their Neighbors

BYLINE: By EMILY BAZELON 

 BODY:
FOR hundreds of years, Connecticut government has been organized along town lines, often set by the distance of a comfortable Sunday horse-and-buggy drive to church on the central green. The result is that Connecticut still has 169 towns and no regional branch of government to link them.
So when a town taxes residents, sets up a fire department or just orders fertilizer for the green, municipalities tend to go it alone. Acting together as a region has been almost unheard of. 
 But towns are learning that such Yankee independence has a price. Planning experts say it results, for example, in traffic jams because of no coordination in planning roads, wasteful duplication of services and worse, makes it harder for towns to attract new businesses.
The latter problem has really gotten the attention of officials, and lately regional cooperation has begun to take root, with more and more towns working jointly on attracting new businesses, restoring river banks, police communication and even thinking about sharing tax revenue.
 "Businesses start to ask: 'What's the best and most efficient way to pick up trash, or run a police department, or collect taxes?" said Theodore Hershberg, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. "Sometimes, efficiency will mean doing these things regionally rather than locally."
 Economic growth experts worry that the continued reliance on home rule by many states like Connecticut undermines the way they run and their future prosperity. The experts said the global economy is pushing businesses to search for lean government, which can often be found in younger parts of the country like Phoenix that have centralized decision-making over a metropolitan region.
Persuaded by such logic, some Connecticut towns are trying out a new form of collective problem-solving. In a series of big and small experiments, towns are cooperating to bring in new business, paying collectively for services and pooling resources to unsnarl problems like traffic.
What's happening is a patchwork throughout the state. Twenty-nine towns around Hartford save money by collectively buying goods like natural gas and grass fertilizer, and are jointly planning to train workers. Last year, 670 police cruisers in the region got laptop computers so officers from different towns could talk to each other.
A group that includes elected officials and business leaders from 15 towns around New Haven is pointing biotech business, a potential plum, toward a 70-acre West Haven site on Route 34.
"Attitudes have changed," said Tony Rescigno, first selectman of North Haven. "If a business comes to me, I have no hesitation saying you may be interested in what Madison or West Haven has to offer."
In the northeast part of the state, eight towns market themselves at trade shows as a regional package. "With so many people trying to get their attention, businesses don't have time for one small town. But as a region, they'll look at us," said Elizabeth Murphy, director of Putnam's economic development commission.
Out-of-state businesses said they've benefited from a nonprofit organization funded by 22 towns, including New London, Old Lyme and Stonington, in the southeastern part of the state. The organization handles inquiries from businesses interested in relocating to that area. "They made our job so much easier," said Nancy Tyrrell, director of business development for Medichem, a Chicago-based pharmaceutical research company that recently opened a New London office. "It was completely different from dealing with New Jersey, where we had to struggle just to get information."
The organizational tools for regional cooperation come in many forms, and what actually gets accomplished varies greatly. Towns threaded along the state's major rivers have tried to coordinate restoration of a shared waterway. For example, 30 towns in the northern part of the state are at work on a project to restore the Quinebaug River.
In the state's rural outposts, towns tend to be skittish about getting sucked into the orbit of the nearest big city, but they are beginning to join with neighboring small towns.
Then there are the regions around Hartford, New Haven, Bridgeport, and New London, in which suburban towns circle a core city. Elected officials work with business leaders on boosting economic development through a "council of government" and a "regional growth partnership." The idea is to get a region's major players behind a big plan, like Hartford's Adriaen's Landing, and to share responsibility for stumbling blocks like a bad highway interchange that prevents suburban employees from getting to work in the city.
"There's more understanding on the part of the wealthier suburbs that success for an urban center can mean success for the suburbs and that if the core city initiatives fail, some of the problems are necessarily going to move outward," said Marc Ryan, secretary of the State Office of Policy and Management.
Still, resistance to regional takeover runs deep. Connecticut was the first state to establish counties in 1666, and the first and only state to abolish them in 1959, after Gov. Abraham Ribicoff denounced county government as patronage-ridden and outmoded.
When the state legislature stripped the counties of all authority, with the exception of sheriffs' departments, towns started handling regional problems piecemeal. The result is a quilt of districts to manage water, sewage, public transit, and other services. Critics said the districts are inefficient and lack accountability.
"We have all these different shadow regional entities, and no one knows how much gets spent by all of them and who exercises the power," said Lawrence J. DeNardis, a former state senator and congressman.
Traditionally, towns cooperated on services like water and sewage when each clearly stood to gain and saw little threat to local autonomy. It's not hard to see why the towns of Weston and Wilton began operating joint emergency medical services last year. But that argument gets harder to make when the subject is which town gets to host a new business.
When towns compete for new businesses, their rationale is simple: While a company in Vernon may create jobs for some Manchester residents, it pays taxes only to Vernon. Pooling tax revenue has long been unthinkable in Connecticut, particularly to suburban towns that want to shield their better-off tax bases from poorer neighboring cities.
Yet with the support of the public-private growth councils, some towns are taking steps toward regional tax-sharing.
To raise $1.5 million a year for a riverside park system that runs through Hartford and East Hartford, the residents of eight neighboring towns agreed to small increases in water bills last year.
Such agreements could become more commonplace if the legislature passes a bill backing voluntary tax-sharing between towns. Supporters said the bill would help concentrate development in a region's most appropriate sites.
"If the small towns in northeast Connecticut could share in the property tax gain from a development in the Killingly industrial park, then they wouldn't have to change their rural character. And maybe their support is what keeps the development in Killingly," said Joel Cogan, director of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.
The voluntary tax-sharing bill passed the State Senate in 1998, but never came to a vote in the House. Mr. Cogan is hoping for widespread support this year. But tax sharing has been on the legislative agenda before and gone nowhere. One often-heard concern is that allowing voluntary agreements now will open the door to compulsory ones later.
Some people who support regional cooperation see voluntary tax sharing as a litmus test. If Connecticut isn't ready to take this relatively easy step, they ask, how will towns ever cooperate on affordable housing and education, where the interests of small municipalities and larger cities clearly diverge? "On the really tough issues, the towns retreat to localism," said Emil Frankel, a former state transportation commissioner.
Others stress the importance of starting somewhere. "My hope is that we're building the trust that will allow us to tackle the difficult ones later," said John Crawford, chairman of the New Haven area's Regional Growth Partnership.
The modesty of many of the 900 cooperative examples on a state-compiled list -- for example, two towns jointly buying trash bags or training paramedics -- shows that in comparison to states with big metropolitan areas or well-established counties, Connecticut doesn't offer much in the way of regionally based services. Continuing ambivalence about the issue is expressed by Richard Lee, the mayor of New Haven in the 1960's: "Towns and cities are cooperating on a far greater scale now than they did 40 years ago, and that's good. But if I were mayor today, I'd be perfectly content with the existing structure."
Despite such skepticism, advocates are beginning to promote a more ambitious kind of regional thinking than Connecticut has tried before, one that cuts across state as well as town lines. They're shopping a map that expresses this new perspective. The map ignores town and state boundaries, and instead divides the region along three market roues with hubs in New York, Boston and Albany.
"The regional growth councils have been helpful, but they don't help you think about the relationship between Hartford and Springfield, or between New Haven and Bridgeport," said Mr. Ryan of the State Office of Policy and Management. "The new economic regions have nothing to do with cities or towns or states. That's really a unique thought in Connecticut, but it's where we need to get to."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
Cisco Takes Internet Phones to Next Stage

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
It was a year ago that John T. Chambers, chief executive of Cisco Systems, said he wanted the traditional telephone on his desk to be gone in 12 months.
That has not happened; the old phone is still there. But today, Cisco intends to announce an office telephone system based on Internet technology. 
 The system, which transmits voice calls in the electronic language of the Internet, could push the company to the top of the budding Internet-telephone market. Proponents say such systems bring new convenience, efficiency and cost-savings to corporate communications.
While North America's traditional office telephone powerhouses, Lucent Technologies and Nortel Networks of Canada, are also developing Internet phone systems for offices, Cisco may have the early edge.
Merrill Lynch intends to make Cisco's the main phone system at a new campus in Hopewell, N.J., with 5,000 of the new phones to be installed over 18 months.
In addition, Texas Instruments is experimenting with about 500 of the new phones in an international test. Executives from both companies are giving the new Cisco system positive reviews.
For all of the ways in which technology has changed how people live and how companies do business, the final frontier of the first Internet revolution will probably be the humble telephone.
Many communications companies are promoting so-called Internet telephony as a low-cost long-distance alternative for consumers. But the sound quality of phone calls over the public Internet is generally inferior to that of calls over traditional telephone systems. The technologies and systems are not yet in place to allow the Internet to reliably transmit high-quality phone calls for millions of people.
Office networks, however, are in some ways much more stable than the public Internet, perhaps making them more amenable to early Internet telephone efforts.
Most offices now have two communications networks, one for computers and another for telephones. Many companies maintain separate staffs for each. Cisco's vision is to allow companies to use a common Internet-based network for both computers and telephones internally, reducing cost and complexity and adding new functions to the telephone.
"The networks that can't do data, voice and video are dinosaurs," Mr. Chambers said in an interview on Friday. "We're going to see open standards for any new telecommunications or computer product to connect to one network. This is the first gauntlet thrown down in that direction."
Cisco's new Internet phones connect to an office's Ethernet data network using a jack like those on the back of a standard office computer. One of the most attractive features of the system is that the phone can identify itself to a corporate network regardless of its location. A worker from New York, for instance, could take his or her phone to a corporate office in San Francisco and be reached as easily as in Manhattan.
"You can plug the phone into any connection, and it will keep the same number you had," Brian J. Bonner, chief information officer and a vice president at Texas Instruments, said. "You can take your phone and plug it in at a T.I. office in Germany, for instance, and I can dial your number, which looks like Dallas, and it rings in Germany."
When a worker changes offices at a company that uses a traditional phone system, a technician must generally reconfigure the phone system so that the worker's old phone operates correctly at the new location. An Internet phone system can eliminate that effort and cost, leading some of Cisco's customers to believe that the Internet system would be much cheaper to operate.
"There are some very compelling economics associated with I.P. phones relative to traditional phones," said John A. McKinley, chief technology officer and an executive vice president at Merrill Lynch, referring to Internet protocol, the language of cyberspace. "Ultimately, I think this represents the next stage in growth for Cisco."
Mr. Chambers must think so, too. The traditional phone by his desk shares space with one of his company's new creations.

HEADLINE: Big Spring Seen for Art Sales

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
As news of the federal antitrust investigation of Sotheby's and Christie's broke at the end of January, these auction houses were right in the middle of trying to convince sellers that it was the time to put their prized works of art in the houses' big May New York sales.
"We did get calls from people asking how the investigation would affect the market," said David Norman, head of Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art department in New York. "And I'm sure some people held back. But not many." 
 The investigation centers on allegations of price fixing between the two major auction houses and has resulted in the resignations of both companies' chief executives and biggest business getters: Diana D. Brooks of Sotheby's and Christopher Davidge of Christie's. But their departures have not hurt consignments yet, although no one is saying if any of the best paintings this spring were actually promised many months ago.
Now, as the catalogs for the Impressionist, modern and contemporary art auctions are about to go to the printers, experts say this spring's important sales are as strong as they have been in years past. (Sotheby's and Christie's will each be offering well over $100 million worth of paintings, drawings and sculptures in their Impressionist art sales alone.) All that is missing is a large estate.
"We haven't seen the major estates that we saw in 1995, '96 and '97," said Christopher Burge, Christie's honorary chairman in North and South America and its principal auctioneer. "But people are realizing that the market is strong and that it hasn't necessarily peaked. It's a good time to sell, especially for longtime collectors who bought years ago."
Rather than the usual tug-of-war between the two powerful auction giants, this season has been marked by the appearance of a new and rich presence that has aggressively invaded Sotheby's and Christie's turf: Phillips, the sleepy, 206-year-old auction house that was bought by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton in October. Now, with the deep pockets and competitive instincts of its chairman, Bernard Arnault, officials at Phillips have been offering sellers huge guarantees -- an undisclosed sum promised to a consignor regardless of the sale's outcome -- in order to put together an auction on a par with Sotheby's and Christie's. As a result for the first time in its history Phillips will have $80 million worth of Impressionist and modern art to sell on May 11.
But those who have been around the auction business remember when a little-known Geneva-based auction house named Habsburg Feldman opened a Manhattan office in a grand town house on the Upper East Side in the late 1980's and began holding auctions of fine art. While the market was hot, so was Habsburg Feldman. But as soon as the economy hit the skids in 1990, Habsburg Feldman fell apart. 
While experts say Mr. Arnault, with his endless sums of cash, will not let that happen, the manner in which Phillips has been handing out large sums to sellers is staggering. In some cases when officials at Sotheby's and Christie's made offers to sellers, they said they simply did not feel comfortable trying to match the offers Phillips had made. Experts at both companies say Phillips is getting some material they would have liked to sell, but neither was prepared to risk the kind of money that Phillips has offered.
Both dealers and auction house experts are envisioning a number of outcomes. One is that with the scarcity of great material on the market, if things go well for Phillips, sellers will start demanding unrealistically high estimates that could artificially inflate the market. Another is that in today's market buyers are savvy enough to find out what things are worth and bid accordingly. And since in some cases Phillips is paying far more than the true market value, this could mean Phillips's sale could be a disaster.
Dan Klein, the international executive director at Phillips, declined to discuss either the estimates or the guarantees, saying only, "It will all become clear when the catalog comes out." (The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs requires auction catalogs to disclose any financial interest the house has in the works it sells.)
But Mr. Klein was happy to talk about some of the sale's top paintings. There will be a group of works from Japan that include a Cezanne landscape, "The Surroundings of Gardanne" (1886-1890). It is expected to sell for $8 million to $10 million.
Phillips's star attraction, however, is Malevich's "Suprematist Composition," an austere abstract composition that until recently has been hanging on the walls of the Museum of Modern Art. The artist's 31 heirs won a claim to get the painting back last year, and they have given it to Phillips to sell.
While the auction house says the painting dates from 1919, curators at the museum say it was painted later, from 1923 to 1925. The difference in dating is important, experts say. If it was made in 1919, it is far more valuable. Just how much it is worth is anyone's guess. Even Phillips refuses to say, but experts at other auction houses believe the company has given the heirs a $15 million guarantee.
Officials at Sotheby's and Christie's maintain they have been conservative about the amount of financing they have offered sellers this spring. Christie's star painting -- and what is expected to be the season's blockbuster -- Picasso's "Still Life With Tulips," a 1932 portrait of the artist's mistress Marie-Therese Walter, does have a guarantee, though no one will say how much. The painting, which will be offered on May 9, comes from a European collector who wishes to remain anonymous and who has owned it since 1957. Christie's estimates it will sell for between $25 million and $30 million.
Franck Giraud, head of Christie's 19th- and 20th-century art department worldwide said that this season he had been able to put together a stronger sale of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art, but that 20th-century material has been harder to find. On May 8 Christie's Impressionist and Post-Impressionist auction will feature several big-ticket paintings.
There is a spectacular Caillebotte, "Man on the Balcony, Boulevard Haussmann" (1880), which depicts the back of a man who experts think was the artist's lawyer, Albert Courtier. It carries an estimate of $6 million to $8 million. The painting has been included in several major Caillebotte exhibitions in the United States and abroad.
A Gauguin that had been hanging in the Dallas Museum of Art as part of the Wendy and Emery Reves Collection, "Farm at Le Pouldu" from 1890, is also in the sale. Nicholas Maclean, head of Christie's Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art in New York, said it has been suggested that the painting is part of a triptych, with the other two in the National Gallery of Art in Washington. It is expected to sell for $7 million to $9 million.
Christie's sale also includes an unusual 1894 portrait by Renoir of the artist Berthe Morisot seated and painted in profile with her daughter, Julie Manet, standing behind her. The painting is being sold by descendants of Morisot and is estimated to sell for $9 million to $12 million.
Also carrying a $9 million to $12 million estimate is one of Monet's famous "Waterlily" series. This one, dated 1906, is a particularly luscious image. A similar one sold at Christie's in November for $22 million. Little wonder that Christie's has estimated this one could well sell for $20 million to $25 million.
Sotheby's is also selling a Monet "Waterlily," although a work done two years later and therefore less valuable. It, too, explores the visual effects on the surface of the artist's famous pond at Giverny and is expected to bring $7 million to $9 million. But another well-known Monet image, that of Rouen Cathedral, painted between 1892 and 1894, will be the top lot of Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art sale on May 10. Painted in the midday sun, it is expected to bring between $15 million and $20 million.
Sotheby's also has a 1932 Picasso, but rather than a portrait this is a still life, "Guitar and Fruit Bowl," which has imagery that suggests the body of Marie-Therese Walter. The painting belonged to Douglas Cooper, the collector whose works were sold at Christie's in 1992. Eight years ago the painting sold for $3.85 million. Now Sotheby's believes it will bring $10 million to $15 million.
Among the more contemporary offerings this spring there is a stunning Rothko, "Yellow Over Purple" from 1956, that is the star of Sotheby's contemporary art sale on May 17. Its canvas, a wash of yellows and oranges, is "everything you could possibly want in a Rothko," said Tobias Meyer, director of Sotheby's contemporary art worldwide. It is expected to bring $7 million to $9 million. The sale is filled with blue-chip artists: Warhol and de Kooning, David Hockney and Gerhard Richter from a mix of well-known European and American collectors.
"Buyers are hungry for great material," said Mr. Meyer. But he added: "In this strong economy no one is selling out of financial need. This material is coming from people who know the market is hot right now, and they're eager to take advantage of it."

HEADLINE: I.B.M.-Qwest Deal on Internet Data Centers

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
In a move to expand its ability to manage Web sites and software applications for corporate customers, I.B.M. intends to announce today that it has struck a multibillion-dollar deal with Qwest Communications International.
The pact calls for I.B.M. to build and help operate Internet data centers for Qwest across North America, executives from the two companies said on Friday. 
 One of the fastest-growing segments of the electronic economy is the so-called hosting business, in which information technology companies manage computer systems that run Web sites or internal software programs for corporate customers. The idea is that by allowing an outside concern to act as host for those computers, rather than managing them internally, companies can focus on their core business while receiving expert technical support.
"Customers are starting to get serious about using the Internet, about the use of e-commerce and about building the core processes that businesses run around what can be done on the Internet," said Douglas T. Elix, senior vice president of the I.B.M. unit involved in the effort. "This alliance expands our ability to meet those needs."
As basic communications lines become largely a commodity market, communications carriers of all sizes and descriptions are trying to expand into more sophisticated markets that can carry richer profit margins, like Web hosts. In recent years, Qwest, the upstart long-distance carrier, has announced alliances with companies including KPMG, the consulting firm, and Oracle, the database company, as it tried to expand its hosting business.
Now, Qwest has enlisted I.B.M. as perhaps its most significant partner. I.B.M. is already a leader among Web and computer-applications hosts, generating about $1 billion in annual revenue from those businesses. But managing complex computer systems -- I.B.M.'s forte -- often also requires managing complex communications networks.
"Keeping up with demand in this market is always a challenge, especially in finding qualified people," said Lewis O. Wilks, Qwest's president for Internet services. "Teaming with I.B.M. is a huge leap for us."
Under the deal, I.B.M. has agreed to build 28 North American data centers, each having at least 100,000 square feet of space, for Qwest over the next three years. The first four are to be in Dallas, Philadelphia, Sterling, Va., and near San Jose, Calif. Over the next seven years, Qwest intends to pay I.B.M. $2.5 billion in construction costs and management fees.
I.B.M. intends to lease about 25 percent of the space in the sites that it builds for Qwest. And over the seven-year life of their contract, I.B.M. intends to pay Qwest $2.5 billion for that space and for use of Qwest's fiber-optic communications network.
The two companies will generally continue to market their host services separately, but Mr. Elix and Mr. Wilks said that I.B.M. and Qwest would potentially collaborate and act as subcontractors for each other on certain projects.
The two executives declined to estimate how much revenue the deal would help their companies generate from outside customers.
In recent years, I.B.M. has appeared to ignore many other big communications carriers while announcing a series of strategic agreements with AT&T, whose chairman, C. Michael Armstrong, is a former I.B.M executive. By reaching a major deal with Qwest, one of AT&T's big competitors, I.B.M. may be trying to demonstrate that it is serious about forming partnerships across the telecommunications industry.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Uses Webcasts to Give Opinions Directly to Investors

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
Interviews with analysts have been the stock in trade of financial television broadcasts for years. Now the large brokerage companies like Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber and others that have provided the analysts are putting them directly before clients, via their own Web sites.
Using streaming video technology, which is essentially broadcasting over the Internet, the financial service companies are experimenting with daily programs that resemble half-hour newscasts but feature the companies' own analysts, reporting on market trends and recommending hot stocks. 
 Wall Street Webcasting stands to further blur the line between financial service companies and the traditional media -- a process that began years ago when some of the big brokerage firms started sending television stations recorded interviews with analysts and video news packages featuring the firms' big clients. The self-generated Webcasts also raise questions about maintaining objectivity, when the primary purpose of the information being given is to attract clients and sell services.
The new Wall Street Webcasts are an example of how "the walls that have separated e-commerce from the media are coming down," said Mark A. Thalhimer, director of the Future of News project at the Radio and Television News Directors Foundation.
"What's happening now is that the news provider, to a much greater degree than before, has a financial stake in the transaction that is being presented to the public," Mr. Thalhimer said. "I wonder how consumers will view that, and how they will make the distinction between the news and someone so closely associated with selling something."
For their part, the financial service companies see no conflict. They consider what they are providing to be information that helps both their large investor clients and the typical individual investor.
"What we're providing is not just content, but context," said Frank Zammataro, first vice president of the Digital Business Development Group at Merrill Lynch.
Still, there is no question that the brokerage firms are competing with Internet stock-trading services like E*Trade for investors' attention. "If you understand how consumers are making decisions, then using the Internet this way presents an opportunity to shape those decisions," Mr. Zammataro said.
What Merrill Lynch provides is not really news, company officials say, but information and opinion to help investors. "What we feature can be newsworthy, but we are not a news organization," said Fred Yager, director of Merrill Lynch Global Broadcast Service.
Merrill Lynch is far ahead of the other financial service companies in Webcasting. Since last March the firm has put out two daily menus, one on its general Internet site (www.merrilllynch.com) for casual browsers and another just for clients.
"We were getting calls from clients asking, 'How come I've always got to see your analysts on CNBC -- why can't you get them to us first?' " Mr. Yager said.
The Webcast on the company's general Internet site, which is available starting at 11 a.m. each day the stock market is open, includes streaming video reports about industry trends. Securities regulations force Merrill Lynch to stop short of discussing particular stocks, because the audience is too broad.
At the end of the reports, however, viewers are told that if they want to know what Merrill analysts think about individual stocks in the featured industry, they should follow a link to the client site, askmerrill.com, which includes what is called the Global Investor Network. Once there, they have access to the complete Webcast. They can try a 30-day subscription, and get free permanent access by opening an account.
While the company has spent only an estimated $2 million on the Global Investor Network, it can put out a half-hour report using Merrill Lynch analysts on trading floors in New York, London, Hong Kong and Frankfurt. The heart of this Webcast is the summary of Merrill Lynch's morning call, the 7 a.m. meeting at which analysts discuss the most widely held and active stocks of the day. There are also segments on mutual funds, international investing and personal finances, all with Merrill Lynch analysts who talk about stocks they recommend.
With high-speed Internet connections, the Webcasts resemble television broadcasts, and once put on the site they can be downloaded by clients at any time. The connections tend to get clogged, which affects the video quality. At slower speeds, the images are hazy and movements quite jerky.
Mr. Yager, a former reporter and television producer, said that since the project began last March, viewership had increased from a few thousand a day to more than 100,000 daily hits.
In a few weeks, the site will be overhauled. Mr. Yager said that under the new format, clients would be able to switch from Webcast reports on one company to archived reports on other companies in the same field. They also will be able to download the text of complete research reports done by Merrill Lynch analysts on related stocks.
Merrill Lynch has long been involved in television production. Through its television network, it provides video interviews with Merrill Lynch analysts to hundreds of local television stations around the world that subscribe to the service.
Much of the production is handled by Bob Plunkett, a former Fox network television reporter who runs his own production company. Mr. Plunkett said the main difference between preparing a news segment for Merrill's Internet site and one for network television had to do with packaging. "When you're putting something out on the Web, you're basically giving it a lot more raw, straight objective data because we know who the audience is," Mr. Plunkett said. "If I was back at Fox, my audience would have been so broad that I'd have to present the material so that it could be understood by a big investment banker and the guy who shines his shoes."
Other financial service companies that do not have small clients do not have to put on separate Webcasts the way Merrill Lynch does. Goldman, Sachs, for example, plans to start a Webcast soon, but it will be directed toward its institutional investors.
PaineWebber expects to begin a trial of a daily Webcast this summer, according to Dennis M. McCann, the firm's director of marketing communications. Clients will also be able to pay bills and transfer funds while viewing the analyst report.
One of the biggest Wall Street firms, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, took a tentative step into streaming video earlier this month when it put on a widely publicized special Webcast about, appropriately, Internet stocks. The firm says it will follow up with other special Webcasts as warranted, but it is not ready to put out a daily report that includes video on demand.
Bear, Stearns & Company is already using streaming video to take the place of the investor roadshows it puts on in cities across the country to drum up support for new stock offerings. Peter D. Cherasia, head of e-commerce for Bear, Stearns, said he was discussing a deal with CNBC to use the firm's Web site to rebroadcast interviews done with its analysts after they appear on television. Once the company generates enough content, he said, it will revamp its Web site to include its own daily Webcast and other services.
"We want to make our site as sticky as possible," Mr. Cherasia said, using a term that refers to visitor retention, "so clients will have a reason to stay on or come back throughout the day."
Even as financial service companies seem intent on moving onto the terrain of the traditional media, broadcasters and news agencies are finding their way into financial services. In September, CNBC bought a 12.4 percent equity stake in Archipelago, a large electronic communications network that has applied to be registered as an Internet stock exchange. Other investors in Archipelago include Goldman, Sachs and Instinet, another electronic trading system that is part of the Reuters Group, the parent of one of the oldest news services in the world.
The president of CNBC, William L. Bolster, said there was currently no plan to take CNBC in that same direction. He noted that General Electric, CNBC's parent company, already has a financial arm -- GE Capital. "The CNBC business model doesn't envision that," he said in a telephone interview. "I'm saying no, but I can't categorically say that it will be no forever."

Liberty Media Plans to Take $130 Million Stake in IDT
Maintaining its drive into the telecommunications industry, John C. Malone's Liberty Media Group has agreed to invest $130 million for a stake of almost 10 percent in IDT, the communications carrier based in Hackensack, N.J.
Until AT&T's acquisition of Tele-Communications last year, Liberty was TCI's television programming unit. But over the last year, the company has shown interest in telecommunications. IDT regularly takes a leading role in creating communications niches. Page C8. 

OpenTV Plans to Buy Spyglass
OpenTV, which provides software that enables television viewers to go directly from TV shows to related Web sites, said that it would buy Spyglass, a pioneer in Internet browser software, in a $2.5 billion stock deal. C2.
 
Movie Systems for Deaf and Blind
Translucent screens that can carry text and images, but can also be seen through, are being introduced as a way to let deaf filmgoers view subtitles that are not visible to other patrons. The technology, along with a separate system that lets blind people use headphones to hear a description of the on-screen action, has been developed by the National Center for Accessible Media, which is trying to adapt existing systems to enable the deaf and the blind to go to conventional theaters.

A Drawback to Airline E-Tickets
The potential strike by flight attendants at US Airways, which was averted over the weekend, exposed one drawback of the electronic ticket not bought through a travel agent. While other airlines and even Amtrak said they would try to accommodate passengers with paper tickets, travelers with e-tickets could not expect such service. Computers at different airlines do not yet communicate well enough to share information on e-tickets. C15.
 
A Shift, Perhaps, in Online Vision
The only vision required to make zillions of dollars in the Internet economy is nearsightedness. The stock market remains so irrationally exuberant that almost every dot-com company can pick up $10 million or so in venture capital and make a bundle either on a quick initial public offering or acquisition, with nary a glance toward long-term viability -- or long-term investors. But the view may be shifting, with more emphasis placed on the creation of substantial businesses, common sense and ethics. Digital Commerce. C4.

HEADLINE: Through a Lens, Digitally;
Polaroid Girds for the New Era In Instant Photography

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
There is a paradox here somewhere.
Last year, Polaroid not only outsold its competitors in the growing digital camera field, it even turned a slim profit on those sales. Since analysts say that no one else is making money on digital cameras, it was a coup. 
 But talk to Polaroid executives and they shrug off digital cameras as simply Polaroid's way of marking time. They expect that a few years down the road, people will be snapping pictures with cell phones, Palm Pilots and the like -- and, they hope, printing them out on wireless Polaroid printers.
"The cameras are just another way of capturing images, many of which we hope people will want to print," said Gary T. DiCamillo, Polaroid's chief executive.
The accuracy of this forecast could determine Polaroid's chances for survival in a digital world.
Polaroid has always sold cameras pretty much at cost and made its money from chemical-and-paper film that develops itself in a minute or two. Since digital photography is essentially an electronic form of instant pictures, Polaroid is either in a special position to move into this field -- or specially suited to be rendered obsolete by it.
Of course, Polaroid executives stress the opportunities. "I laugh when people are surprised we're doing well in digital cameras," said Brian D. Poggi, senior vice president for North America. "After all, they're really the same as instant cameras: they provide an affordable and immediate picture."
But industry experts wonder whether the similarity will translate to sales. Many note that, even as film sales shrink, companies like Fuji and Kodak can still do a thriving business in sales of coated papers, which can be used to make high-quality prints of digital photos.
But a Polaroid customer who switches to digital photography is lost to the market for the company's self-developing film -- unless those customers use Polaroid printers or hybrid digital/instant cameras to make prints.
"It is not clear to me what long-term digital strategy can really replace what they are generating from film-based instant prints," said Steve Hoffenberg, a digital photography market analyst with Lyra Research in Newtonville, Mass.
Wall Street has similar concerns. Eastman Kodak and Polaroid have both had earnings problems that have driven their stock prices down in recent years. Kodak's stock remains mired in the $50's -- well below the nearly $70 it traded at a year ago. But many analysts say the company has cleaned up its digital portfolio and brought its costs under control, making its stock a good buy right now. Few are as upbeat about Polaroid, even though that company's stock closed at $25.1875 on Friday -- nowhere near the price of $60.25 it reached in July 1997, but a nice rebound from its low of $17.25 in December.
"Digital cameras, scanners, picture CD's, Web sites, they are all geared toward one thing -- driving output," said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. "And the competitive picture for Polaroid in a digital world is a lot less clear than it is for Kodak."
Certainly, as the only instant photography company in the country, competition is not something Polaroid is used to. (The Fuji Photo Film Company sells instant cameras and film overseas, but when Kodak tried to do so here, the courts upheld Polaroid's patents.) But as the digital revolution is wooing many people from the 35-millimeter film camp, Polaroid could grab customers long loyal either to Fuji or Kodak.
"We used to be the only show in town for people who wanted instant gratification on their pictures, and yes, we've lost that," said Paul E. Lambert, Polaroid's senior vice president for research and development. "But for the first time, we can really tap into the conventional photography market."
Rather than try to capture a high-end digital market -- the strategy that Fuji and Kodak have pursued -- Polaroid has farmed out its production to overseas manufacturers, which make Polaroid-branded cameras that sell for as little as $99 and rarely top $300.
"Digital cameras are just their mechanism for building shelf space," said Michael Ellmann, an analyst with Schroder & Company.
True to its mass-market roots, Polaroid already is spewing forth products to fill those shelves. There is a portable scanner that can upload images to the Web. There is a digital camera with a built-in modem that can send pictures over the Web to Polaroid for transfer to prints, T-shirts or other items.
In February, Polaroid announced an alliance with PictureWorks Technology, a software company, to develop more Internet-related products. One on the drawing boards is a product to help dermatologists keep a digital-image record of a patient's progress during treatments for skin disorders and plug the pictures into insurance claims forms.
On the wireless front, Polaroid recently demonstrated a wireless printer that can receive images transmitted by radio waves from up to 50 feet away. "This makes the process truly portable, because digital cameras are no longer tethered to PC's," said Ulysses Yannas of Buckman, Buckman & Reid.
In fact, many of Polaroid's planned digital cameras will double as makeshift printers. The company already sells a combination instant-print and digital camera, aimed at teenagers, that is little more than two cameras glued together; the user cannot instantly print an image captured digitally. Within a year, though, Polaroid intends to introduce a hybrid camera that will collect images electronically, but will also generate an instant print with the press of a button.
And the company's chemists are working on a new type of paper for printing pictures that they claim will yield the same quality as the silver halide films that Fuji, Kodak and Polaroid now use, but at a much lower cost. By now, many inkjet printers can yield high-resolution 8 1/2-by-11-inch prints on photo-quality paper for less than a dollar each. Although conventional Polaroid instant film could be modified for use in a desktop printer, prints would cost several dollars apiece.
In the past, Polaroid's attempts to reduce costs were hamstrung by the need for a chemically treated paper that can both capture an image and print it; now, digital cameras take care of that first step. "If we don't have to worry about capturing the image, we can optimize how we print it out," Mr. Lambert said.
Polaroid is divulging few details about its research, and its new paper is at least two years from market. Still, what has leaked out excites analysts. "They're talking a few cents per print," Mr. Yannas said, "so they could capture a big share of the home print market."
That market promises to be huge. Indeed, photo processors already say digital cameras have increased, not decimated, their business. "Digital photography has created a whole new customer base for us," said Mitchell B. Goldstone, who owns 30 Minute Photo in Irvine, Calif. "People use less film, but they make more prints and enlargements."
But conventional photography companies will not give up market share without a fight. Kodak is researching non-silver-halide media for prints. Last week, it said it would soon begin selling lower-priced digital cameras. And it recently introduced a digital camera that can snap onto a Palm Pilot and transfer images to the device's memory.
Kodak also has a prototype digital camera that can e-mail images over a mobile phone. "The person receiving that e-mail image is likely to print it out, or send it to Kodak via the Internet to get prints," said Willy C. Shih, president of Kodak's digital imaging business.
Fuji, meanwhile, has been selling to photo processing labs a printing method that uses lasers and heat, rather than a wet process, to transfer images to paper. The company is now introducing a similar, scaled-down, dry-process photographic printer for home use. Unlike Polaroid and Kodak, Fuji is manufacturing its own digital cameras.
"Digital imaging is an industry unto itself, and we want to provide a cradle-to-grave solution in that space," said Manny Almeida, general manager of digital imaging at Fuji Photo Film USA.
There are still opportunities that no photography company has yet nailed down. B. Alexander Henderson, who covers the photographic industry for Prudential Securities, contends that all the photography companies should be promoting their corporate Web sites as places where customers can store their electronic photographs, with an eye toward making prints in years to come.
"Fuji, Kodak, Polaroid -- they could all generate repeat business in prints, and enough traffic to generate advertising revenue on their Web sites," he said. "The holy grail of the Internet is controlling content, yet none of them are doing it."
But then, all of the companies do have breathing space to get their digital acts together. Conventional photography is still growing fast in emerging economies like China. And the Photo Marketing Association says that amateur photography is a $15 billion annual market in the United States. Polaroid's own research shows that 90 percent of American households own cameras, but only 6 percent own digital cameras.
"Conventional cameras may get squeezed out within our lifetime," Mr. Almeida of Fuji said. "But in the next few years? No way."
Polaroid, too, says that sales of its conventional instant cameras and film are at a high. Last year, the company sold 9.7 million instant cameras, topping its 1978 record of 9.4 million. Its total sales hit $1.98 billion in 1999, up from $1.85 billion the previous year. And its net earnings were $9 million, a nice improvement from 1998, when weak demand in emerging markets combined with smaller orders from mass marketers in the United States to cause a net loss of $51 million.
Polaroid has been concentrating its marketing efforts on the youth market -- it just signed a sponsorship agreement with Britney Spears, the popular singer -- and its cameras have become hot sellers among teenagers. The company's I-Zone camera, a $25 item that yields postage-stamp-size pictures, was the best-selling camera in the country last Christmas season. "There's no question, Polaroid's instant cameras are going gangbusters," said Mr. Hoffenberg of Lyra Research.
But the excitement is clearly in digital products. "Instant photography will represent the majority of our business in the next five years," Mr. DiCamillo said, "but digital will be the fastest growing area."
That will probably be true in Polaroid's troubled commercial business as well. In contrast to its robust consumer sales, Polaroid's commercial sales, which in the past represented half its revenues, have been flat, and profit margins razor-thin.
Polaroid is banking that its mass market products will be used for commercial ends. A hospital in Canada, for example, uses Polaroid I-Zone cameras that yield sticky-backed prints to affix pictures to admissions records. "Half of our products are used in business, even if they're bought at Wal-Mart," said Stephen Golden, director of marketing for consumer electronics.
Of course, Polaroid does have strictly commercial products as well. Its digital microscopy camera, which captures what is seen through a microscope, is selling well to research labs, despite price tags that start at $6,000. Polaroid already is the world's largest supplier of photo ID cards, and it has its sights on becoming the company for digitally produced identification.
It is ready to introduce a system, particularly intended for the passport photo market, that would take and store photos digitally, but print them out on Polaroid film. Polaroid already produces the driver's licenses for 37 states, and it is testing a program in West Virginia for snapping and storing digital photos of children that police can use to help locate a missing child.
The company also has new technologies for incorporating fingerprints and facial recognition into ID cards. One system enables states to check whether someone has a driver's license in another name. And Polaroid just introduced a product, for sale to computer keyboard manufacturers, that would let people use their fingerprints in lieu of passwords and log-ons, by pressing their index fingers against a little window.
Polaroid also is using the Internet to expand its base of customers. It has begun accepting ID information and images via the Web, mailing back ID cards within 48 hours.
"This now makes us accessible to small businesses that don't want to spend thousands for an ID system," Mr. DiCamillo said. "I appreciate technology, but I'm a market-driven manager. And our strategy, now and in the future, will be driven by understanding what customers want."

Charts: "Growing Share"
Polaroid, which dominates the instant film and camera market, has much to lose if digital cameras replace instant. But it is increasing its share of the United States market, in which some 1.7 million digital cameras and related pieces of equipment were shipped in 1999.

Another Call for the Quarterback of Political Persuasion

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IF William M. Daley ever needs to be reminded why President Clinton made him secretary of commerce, he need only hike across his office. On the far wall of the great rectangle, past the sofas, the generous hearth and the boardroom dining table, hangs a small photograph of the Oval Office with Mr. Daley and Mr. Clinton standing shoulder-to-shoulder inside. Inscribed across the bottom, in Mr. Clinton's curly scrawl, is a note of thanks to Mr. Daley for heading the Lazarus Project.
In the Clinton era, such biblical code is reserved for sensitive political missions. Mr. Daley headed one of Mr. Clinton's most successful: getting the North America Free Trade Agreement through a wary Congress in 1993. Mr. Daley, then working as a lawyer, was hired to salvage Nafta from what was seen as probable defeat. 
 "He thought I raised it from the dead," Mr. Daley said one recent afternoon, explaining how the project got its name and how he, a bit reluctantly, got his niche. "I enjoy the politics stuff, but you do get pounded with it."
Day to day, Mr. Daley oversees commerce duties like forecasting weather, counting how many people live in the nation, promoting United States goods abroad and collecting data on the national economy. But despite a self-conscious effort to thrive as a wonk -- as second son of the Chicago mayoral dynasty, he hopes to be remembered for something other than campaign savvy -- Mr. Clinton uses him as political offensive coordinator, especially when it is third and long.
So, in the twilight of Mr. Clinton's presidency as in its dawn, Mr. Daley is driving a White House legislative crusade. Along with Steven Richetti and a team of aides in every corner of the executive branch, Mr. Daley is trying to persuade Congress to grant China permanent normal trade relations. Mr. Clinton has called it his top remaining foreign policy goal. Mr. Daley, however he handles this year's census, has his reputation riding on a "yes" vote.
Like Nafta, it is an uphill struggle. Union pressure on Democrats, Republican loyalties to Taiwan and bipartisan concerns about human rights abuses have turned many lawmakers against extending permanent trading rights to China.
Mr. Daley calls the vote too "mushy" to predict.
The quarterbacking comes instinctively to Mr. Daley, who is 51. Like his father and his brother, the past and present Chicago mayors, politics runs in his blood. White House officials said Mr. Clinton trusts Mr. Daley's political intuition more than that of anyone else in the cabinet.
With brother Richard always first in line to fill the family shoes in Chicago, Mr. Daley practiced law at the Chicago office of Mayer, Brown & Platt and sought his fortune in national politics, working for Walter F. Mondale and Michael S. Dukakis before joining Mr. Clinton's presidential campaign.
The hoped-for payoff, a cabinet post, did not materialize in the first Clinton administration. But in early 1993 he was asked to move into the Old Executive Office Building next to the White House and mobilize support for Nafta. It was a paltry consolation prize -- his friend Dan Rostenkowski, then the Ways and Means chairman from Illinois, called him crazy for accepting -- but Nafta squeaked through Congress. And after the commerce secretary, Ronald H. Brown, died in a plane crash in 1996, Mr. Daley was offered the post.
IN an administration with many workaholics, Mr. Daley is known as an especially sober worker bee. His wife remains in Chicago, where their children are in school. He says it is easier that way because he is usually at the office when not on the road. He keeps the same long hours investment bankers do and dresses the way they used to. His close-cut blue suits and pinched shirt collars make him look prim even by Washington's atavistic standards of attire.
Mr. Daley would clearly prefer to enjoy the challenges and trappings of commerce secretary than the grind of a six-month legislative campaign. He said he is especially proud of little-noted achievements, like straightening out accounting practices in commerce's many units. With trademark deadpan, he said he hopes his legacy will be "getting out of here without hiring a lawyer."
Yet over a working lunch (chicken noodle soup in a plastic foam bowl, Diet Coke from a can) in his Olympic-pool-sized office, Mr. Daley says that shaping the China debate and cajoling members of Congress has become his new full-time job. His strategy: Link China trade to America's national security and the fate of China's reformers.
"The economics of this are great," he says. "But if this fight stays on economics, we lose. It has to be about Chinese politics, Taiwan and our position in the world. It's a big vote. Congress is just going to have to walk the plank."
To manage the process, Mr. Daley moved David Lane, his chief of staff, across the Mall to the White House. There, they set up a "war room" that monitors everything China and commands a remarkable chunk of Mr. Clinton's own schedule. He makes sure nearly every nanobyte of good news about bilateral relations -- a first-time export of oranges, China's decision to release the names of some political prisoners -- gets out to the press.
But Mr. Daley spends most of his time in one-on-one meetings with members of Congress. Some days he sees as many as six or seven members in their offices. He is taking 30 of them on an Air Force jet to China next month on a three-city, six-day lobbying tour that includes meeting with leaders in Beijing.
Will it work? Mr. Daley's efforts to get Congress to approve fast-track trade negotiating powers failed recently. But, having been through Nafta, he seems cautiously optimistic that he will prevail on China.
If not, he begs, only half in jest, please remember what he did to improve bookkeeping at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

HEADLINE: ELECTION IN RUSSIA: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Washington Nail-Biting

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Monday, March 27

 BODY:
When Acting President Vladimir V. Putin met behind closed doors last month with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, he made an unusual appeal that Russia be considered a member of the Western club.
Mr. Putin said he liked to eat Chinese food, knew how to use chopsticks and regularly practiced judo. 
 "But that's exotic stuff," Mr. Putin said, according to aides who attended the session. "That's not our mentality. Our mentality is European."
The Clinton administration has a lot riding on a Putin victory and has been heartened by his remarks about the need to integrate Russia with the West.
Administration officials are not only anxious to get American-Russian relations back on track after a year and a half of drift since the collapse of the ruble in August 1998. In an election year, they also want to silence Republicans who have charged that Russia fell off the path of economic reform on President Clinton's watch.
And they would like to seal the Clinton presidency with a major arms control accord, one that would slash long-range nuclear arms and enable the United States to field a new network of antimissile defenses.
But Mr. Putin's autocratic instincts have cast a shadow over Washington's hopes. Setbacks on human rights or fresh reports of Russian atrocities in Chechnya would be major obstacle to closer relations, especially in an American election year.
"Clinton would like a strong leader he can work with but not one that is unleashed," said Toby T. Gati, who was a senior State Department official during the Clinton administration. "The hope is that Putin will turn out to be a reformer. The president and his advisers want to show Yeltsin left a legacy of reform that Putin can build on. They want to rebut the critics who say their Russia policy was a mistake."
With a complex agenda of overlapping and competing interests, there is no simple answer to what a Putin presidency could mean for Washington.
The prospect for closer ties is more favorable in the economic sphere, where Mr. Putin's goals overlap with Western interests, than in the area of security and human rights issues, where the two sides often collide.
On economics, Mr. Putin has signaled that he wants to establish the foundations of a modern capitalist state, not because he has a romantic infatuation with the free market, but because he understands that Russia must attract foreign investment and overhaul its rust belt industries to become a world power.
"A country where weakness and poverty reign cannot be strong," Mr. Putin wrote in an open letter to the Russian people.
To that end, Mr. Putin and his top aides have talked about overhauling the tax code, protecting the rights of shareholders, phasing out subsidies to money-losing enterprises and tackling politically dicey issues such as establishing the right to own land.
American officials have been impressed by Mr. Putin's talk of economic change, including his insistence that he wants Russia to be integrated into the world economy. They say he appears interested in achieving concrete results and understands that a boom in oil prices that has helped the Russian economy is not a substitute for reform.
Much will depend, of course, on Mr. Putin's willingness to challenge the tycoons who dominate much of the Russian economy so that he can level the playing field for business and investors.
Clinton administration officials are already discussing steps the West might take to demonstrate its support if Mr. Putin does undertake serious reform.
They include expanding assistance by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, rescheduling Russian debt and having the United States Export-Import Bank step up its efforts to encourage investment in Russia.
"I hope the 'Who lost Russia?' debate is behind us," Thomas R. Pickering, an under secretary of state and a former American ambassador to Moscow, recently told a business group in Washington.
But economics is just one part of the agenda. Arms control and foreign policy are also important. And while Mr. Clinton has said Mr. Putin is someone "we can do business with," Mr. Putin's nationalism, his background as a K.G.B. officer and his domestic constituency may make him less cooperative than Washington would like.
Administration officials are pleased that during his February meeting with Secretary Albright, Mr. Putin dispensed with diatribes against Washington's plans for a limited antimissile defense.
Instead, Mr. Putin said his goal was to preserve the principles of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972. Administration officials hope that this vague formulation reflected a new, if cautious, sense of pragmatism -- one that might open the door to a grand bargain on offensive and defensive systems in which the treaty would be modified to accommodate the American antimissile program. Even if the Russians are willing to negotiate over the matter, though, the discussions may prove difficult.
The Russian military is strongly opposed to the antimissile program. And though Mr. Putin recently restored ties with NATO, the political climate in Russia is not conducive to wrenching compromises with the West.
The percentage of Russians who believe that Washington's hidden goal is to take advantage of their country's weakness is at a new high, the Clinton administration's own survey of Russian opinion indicates. The recent survey reports that 81 percent of Russians believe that the United States wants to reduce Russia to a second-rate power, up from 59 percent in 1995.
The mistrust stems from NATO's decision to expand eastward, the Western alliance's war with Serbia and the generally harsh indictment of Russia by Western politicians and the Western news media.
"Maybe the West thinks it knows what Putin will do on the ABM treaty, but it is wishful thinking," Georgi A. Arbatov, the veteran specialist on American-Russian relations, said about the arms control treaty. "We really don't know what Putin has in mind. The attitude in Russia is against building of antimissile defenses."
There is also Chechnya. The brutal war has been temporarily pushed out of the news by the Russian election, but it is still raging.
The West has denounced the indiscriminate attacks against civilians there but has been careful not to link the issue with the question of assistance from the monetary fund or other policy objectives.
But even with the best of intentions, a strategic alliance between the United States and Russia remains a remote possibility. The 47-year-old Mr. Putin is not only likely to re-energize relations with the West. He is likely to intensify diplomacy on other fronts, including former Soviet republics as well as Iran and China.
Clinton administration officials are also well aware of Mr. Putin's talent for telling his audience what it wants to hear. And some take his talk of Russia's fondness for the West's mentality and values with a large grain of salt. Just imagine, they say, what Mr. Putin will say about the United States when he meets with the Chinese.

HEADLINE: Kuwaitis Are Exasperated By America's Oil Politics

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: VIENNA, March 26

 BODY:
Wearing an impeccably tailored charcoal pin-striped suit as he relaxed in his sprawling hotel suite here tonight, Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah of Kuwait was feeling distinctly worn out by American politics.
As oil and gasoline prices have soared in the last several months, members of Congress have charged that Kuwait has been enriching itself at the expense of American consumers and that it has blithely forgotten that the United States fought a war to liberate it from Iraq. 
 Now, under heavy American pressure, Kuwait and other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are reluctantly planning to raise production and to bring modest relief.
But as Kuwait's oil minister, Sheik Saud was far from happy about that and granted a rare on-the-record interview to The New York Times to make his case.
"Today's price is fair and reasonable as far as we are concerned," he said. "What really made the difference was that in April 1999 people in the United States could buy gasoline for 98 or 99 cents a gallon. When prices corrected, there was an uproar."
Far from enjoying an unearned windfall, he asserted, Kuwait was barely recovering from the disastrous decline in prices in 1998 and early 1999.
"Unfortunately, we are in an election year," the sheik continued, referring to the American campaigns for president and Congress. "We are in a situation where Republicans are trying to upstage Democrats. We don't want to become entangled in domestic American politics, but we are becoming entwined."
This has not been a particularly good decade for oil producers. Adjusted for inflation, oil prices have consistently slumped far below the heights reached in OPEC's heyday in the 1970's. Analysts estimate that OPEC lost about $65 billion in revenue last year as a result of declines in oil prices, to as low as $11 a barrel.
For Kuwait, a tiny country sitting atop some of the world's biggest oil reserves, the downturn had a huge impact. With 93 percent of its revenues coming from oil, the government's $4.4 billion budget was short $2 billion in both 1998 and 1999.
"To balance our budget, we need to sell Kuwaiti oil at about $21 or $22 a barrel," said Sheik Saud. "We're not even talking about a surplus. Is that too much to ask for?"
The talks in Vienna this year have been unusually sensitive because oil prices have nearly tripled in the last 12 months and American gasoline prices have soared from about $1 to well over $1.60 in many cities.
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest producer and the country that overshadows all other OPEC members, has been the leading proponent for an increase in production of about 1.7 million barrels a day. Kuwait and other gulf states like the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have been less enthusiastic but prepared to follow the Saudi lead.
"It is completely exaggerated," Sheik Saud contended, for Americans to complain that Kuwait is ungrateful for American willingness to lead the Persian Gulf war and to force Iraq out of Kuwait after its invasion in 1990.
"Had the United States not intervened to help Kuwait then, Kuwait would not have any oil to export now," he said. "We don't want to harm the United States. We just want to defend our own interests."
On Thursday, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would urge the administration to consider cutting off aid and military sales to OPEC countries that try to push up oil prices by constraining demand.
President Clinton has opposed the bill, arguing that it is much too heavy-handed. But the energy secretary, Bill Richardson, has toured the capitals of many oil exporting countries in the last few weeks in an effort to persuade them of the need for big increases in oil production.
The fact that oil prices could take another plunge is not the least of the sheik's worries. Two years ago, prices plunged after OPEC agreed on modest increases in production. A year ago they soared far beyond all expectations after new cutbacks.
In the last two weeks, prices have once again started sinking, though at $28 a barrel on Friday they were at levels that most producers would consider close to nirvana.
"We would like to know," the sheik said, "What price do the Americans consider acceptable? We feel as if we are between a rock and a hard place."

HEADLINE: OPEC Oil Increase Likely to Fall Short Of Clinton's Target

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: VIENNA, March 26

 BODY:
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is on the verge of an agreement to increase its oil production limits by about 1.7 million barrels a day, officials from several oil exporting countries said today.
That would be a larger increase than many analysts had expected, although the exact amount was still being debated and it would be less than the 2.5 million barrels sought by a Clinton administration worried about the ramifications of high gasoline prices. The rise could reduce the price of oil by several dollars a barrel, but when that would happen and whether it would be passed on to consumers remained unclear. 
 One senior OPEC official said the increase would just about reverse the production cuts the cartel agreed upon one year ago, which sent oil prices soaring and ignited a political uproar in the United States as American gasoline prices surged to more than $1.60 a gallon in many cities.
"We believe this number will result in bringing back market stability," the official said. "It is a reasonable increase, a very reasonable increase to make sure there are reasonable stocks in the second quarter." Asked if there was much uncertainty about the outcome when OPEC oil ministers meet here on Monday, he firmly shook his head.
The oil ministers are also expected to announce plans for a follow-up meeting in June at which they could choose to raise production levels again if the price stays near $30 a barrel. Saudi officials want to get the price down to about $25 a barrel.
Iran, OPEC's second largest producer after Saudi Arabia, is among several countries still opposed to such a big boost in production. But other OPEC officials predicted that they would agree on an increase of at least 1.5 million barrels a day -- but more likely 1.7 million -- levels that have been urged by the Saudis.
"What is being discussed is a return of the 1.7 million barrels that were removed from production last year," Kuwait's oil minister, Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah, said in an interview here tonight. Although he described an increase in production as a move driven by politics rather than economics, he predicted that the agreement would be close to the levels sought by Saudi Arabia.
Sheik Saud added that oil prices were likely to fall: "The market will look at this as an increase, and will react by reducing prices."
The surge in gasoline prices has become a major election-year topic in the United States. Lawmakers in Congress have lambasted OPEC countries in recent weeks and accused Saudi Arabia and Kuwait of paying no heed to the role the United States played in rescuing Kuwait during the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
George W. Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee, has called for a big reduction in gasoline taxes. Vice President Al Gore, the expected Democratic nominee, has been peppered with complaints and the Clinton administration has waged an intense lobbying campaign to persuade OPEC countries to agree to a large increase.
Oil ministers from the 11 nations in OPEC will meet in Vienna on Monday to formally discuss the plan. But the countries have been talking for weeks and have held intensive meetings in the last few days.
Analysts cautioned that the expected increase would probably have only a modest impact on gasoline prices, probably no more than 10 cents a gallon.
Nonetheless, said Gary N. Ross, president of PIRA Energy Group, an oil industry consulting firm, the increases would have a tangible impact and coincide with unexpectedly weak demand for oil in the first months of this year. "They have made it clear they want to see lower prices," Mr. Ross said, referring to the Saudis. "They want to get oil out of the newspaper headlines."
The last two years have shown that oil prices are notoriously difficult to predict, for OPEC or for anybody else. Few analysts, if any, expected prices to plunge as low as $11 a barrel one year ago; just as few, if any, predicted the abrupt surge to about $28 a barrel today.
Peter Ginoux, head of the oil trading desk at Salomon Smith Barney in London, said increasing OPEC's quota by 1.7 million barrels is inherently less than it appears because OPEC nations are already cheating on their own restrictions, overshooting their official limit of 23 million barrels a day by about 1 million barrels.
But because the limits are always exceeded to some extent, he said, the real net increase could be about 1 million barrels a day. And though cheating could continue at nearly the present pace, many smaller OPEC producers are already producing at nearly their current capacity.
"Non-compliance can only come now from the big guys, and they are the ones who are charged with keeping prices up," Mr. Ginoux said today. "If we take the net new supply to be 1 million barrels a day, I am horribly afraid that this will go to restocking -- and probably keep prices right where they are."
Within OPEC, the view is considerably different.
Iran has argued loudly that OPEC should not raise production by more than about 700,000 or one million barrels a day. And even pro-Western countries like Kuwait are worried about a repeat of the catastrophic decline in prices that came after OPEC raised production modestly in September 1997.
"I am worried," said Kuwait's oil minister, Sheik Saud. "The market has already dropped by $5 a barrel. I don't see any compelling reason to increase production other than to be political, to be quite honest."
In reality, the total increase in production extends beyond the official OPEC quotas. Mexico, Norway and Oman, who are not members of the oil cartel, moved in tandem with OPEC last year, slashing their combined production by about 400,000 barrels a day.
Mexican officials have said they plan to raise their output by as much as 300,000 barrels. Norway said it would decide the issue after OPEC meets, but it would probably go back to its earlier levels as well.
On top of that there is Iraq, which is part of OPEC but is allowed to pump at maximum levels under a system regulated by the United Nations sanctions program installed after the gulf war. Iraq cut its production by about 700,000 barrels a day last year, complaining that it could not get the parts it needed. But after conciliatory moves by the United Nations, Iraq announced last week that it would go back to full production in the next few months.
American officials refused to comment tonight on OPEC's likely production increases, saying it would be premature. Although the increases are expected to be less than those advocated by Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson, the Clinton administration will likely express relief.
At the same time, many OPEC countries that have good relations with the United States were angry at the Americans' pressure in recent weeks. "It is strange that the champion of the free market economy is acting in a way that would put Marxists to shame," the daily Saudi Gazette said of threats by Congress to impose sanctions if OPEC did not raise production. The editorial called the effort "an atrocious proposal which violates the norms of the market and defies common sense."

Tracking the Toll After 2 Breadwinners Lose Jobs

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
For a decade, Bill Moyers has been tracking the downs and ups of two blue-collar Milwaukee families, the Neumanns and the Stanleys. Both were hit hard in the early 1990's, after Tony Neumann and Claude Stanley lost their jobs at Briggs & Stratton, which, like other industrial mainstays, gave way to recession. The company cut some 4,000 jobs in Milwaukee.
The Neumanns are white and the Stanleys are black, but when bad times struck, color proved less decisive than economics. Suddenly the recently well-paid workers found themselves scrambling for minimum-wage jobs as bills mounted. They ran behind on mortgage payments and had to accept handouts of food. 
 Along with battling to make ends meet, both families watched their neighborhoods deteriorate, with increasingly dangerous streets posing risks to their children . A bout of illness could play havoc with the household budget; a fever sent Claude Stanley to a hospital for two months in 1997, leaving him with a $30,000 bill not covered by insurance. Raising college tuition for an ambitious son, the first Stanley to get a college degree, required juggling credit-card debt at an interest rate of 23 percent.
Terry Neumann and Jackie Stanley pitched in, but earning $6 an hour while they paid $1.50 an hour for child care didn't ease matters. The children -- five Stanleys and three Neumanns -- felt the impact as they tried to help out with odd jobs and adjusted to homes with both parents working and with domestic tensions rising.
The choice facing both women, as Terry Neumann puts it, was "Either we make ends meet, or we stay home with the kids." She found a job at a school cafeteria, which paid only $20 a day, but allowed her to get home before her children. Working a double shift, Tony Neumann hardly saw them or Terry. "We don't sleep together anymore," he tells Mr. Moyers. "It stinks."
The program's title, "Surviving the Good Times," is a comment on the gap between an America that was prospering during the heady 1990's and hard workers like the Neumanns and Stanleys who were not able to share in the prosperity. But this report is also a tribute to the resilience of their close-knit families and the efforts of all members to pull together. Terry Neumann became a truck driver; Jackie Stanley went into selling real estate, not easy for a black woman whose potential clients are limited to the inner city.
As the program ends, the Stanleys are hopeful but still haven't caught up to what they made in the Brooks & Stratton years. Prospects are brighter for the Neumanns, with Tony making $18 an hour and Terry looking ahead to a Teamsters job at $19 an hour. "If the money's there," she says, "that's where I'll be."

Africa: Aid or Harm?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
I wrote recently in support of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, a bill designed to provide sub-Saharan African countries with duty-free access to the U.S. for their textile and apparel exports. The act, now being debated by Congress, is embarrassing for U.S. unions, such as the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and Unite, because they are opposing any duty-free access for Africa even though studies show it would create jobs in Africa and scarcely affect employment here.
Afterward I was bombarded with letters from union officials, who didn't like having their opposition to African imports exposed. The letters from Unite and the A.F.L.-C.I.O., though, really stood out. Both asserted that the U.S. unions were against this bill because it harmed African workers -- who were also against it. 
 "Wow," I thought, "am I urging passage of a bill to help create investment and jobs in Africa that Africans don't want?"
To find out, I first called Roble Olhaye, the Ambassador to the U.S. from Djibouti and the dean of the African ambassador corps. He said: "There are people in the U.S. who have vested interests in not letting anything from Africa be imported, but they don't want to say that, so they say that Africans don't want it. Let me tell you, there is not a single leader in Africa who is not supporting this bill -- without reservations."
Then I phoned Ebrahim Patel in Cape Town, South Africa, who heads the Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers' Union, the biggest textile union in southern Africa. Mr. Patel respects the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and Unite. They supported South African workers in the struggle against apartheid. He said he would never want to do anything harmful to them. But he also made clear that his union favored duty-free access for African textiles and apparel to the U.S. market, as part of a broad strategy for promoting development.
"We support the concept of duty-free access for Africa in textiles and apparel," he said. "As with all the poorest economies of the world, one way to raise our development quickly is for you to give us preferential access to your markets."
While Mr. Patel endorsed duty-free access for African textiles and apparel, he expressed reservations with three clauses in the Growth Act. First is the condition (written in by the U.S. textile lobby) stipulating that if African countries want duty-free access to America they must first buy all the cloth and yarn in America, then ship it to Africa to be sewn, then ship it back. Mr. Patel said Africans need to be able to use their own cloth too, otherwise there would be little economic benefit for them.
Second, said Mr. Patel, African unions are concerned about demands in the bill for African states to adopt more corporate-friendly, free-market policies in return for duty-free access. "Some of these demands infringe on our sovereignty," said Mr. Patel.
Third, he said, African trade unions want to ensure that any African factories given duty-free access to the U.S. be required to meet the core labor standards of the International Labor Organization, with union involvement in monitoring and verification. (The act already meets the I.L.O. standard, but does not yet include provision for monitoring by unions.)
"I believe Unite and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. are committed to a fair global trading system," said Mr. Patel. " But as regards any duty-free arrangement for Africa, I think that if we were to interact with them, in a warm way, we could structure adequate worker rights conditions, in such a duty-free arrangement, that would improve the number of jobs in Africa, and the standards in the workplace, in a way consistent with the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s global mission."
That is good advice. Africa's workers desperately need duty-free access to our markets to create jobs. The African unions have concerns about some side issues that should be addressed. The U.S. unions, though, oppose any duty-free access for Africa under any conditions -- but they don't want to say that. So they take these African side concerns, highlight them, and then say that even Africans don't want this duty-free bill. That is simply untrue.
There is a way for Africa to gain duty-free access in textiles to the U.S. market, without harming U.S. workers or worker standards in Africa, but it takes a will to find it. Africa's unions have that will. How about ours?

HEADLINE: Greenspan Endorses Paying Down U.S. Debt

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, sought to bolster Congress's resolve today to save huge government surpluses for use in paying down the national debt. Nothing would have a more beneficial impact on the nation's ability to meet the expenses of baby boomers' retirements, he said.
"Saving the surpluses -- if politically feasible -- is, in my judgment, the most important fiscal measure we can take at this time to foster continued improvements in productivity," Mr. Greenspan said in testimony before the Senate Special Committee on Aging. 
 He said, however, that he had no strong views on whether future income taxes should be transferred directly to Social Security and Medicare -- something that President Clinton has proposed. Republicans and some moderate Democrats object to a direct transfer.
Mr. Greenspan also sought to minimize concerns expressed by some lawmakers that a recent increase in fuel prices could have a negative effect on the overall economy or on projected surpluses.
"Currently, we do not as yet, and emphasize as yet, see any significant indication that crude oil price increases are in the process of embedding themselves in other areas of the economy and inflating the general price structure," he said.
Mr. Greenspan said, however, that such an effect would not be impossible.
He said it was unclear what level of energy inflation would be needed before price increases would begin to spread to other areas of the economy.
Promising future income tax surpluses to Social Security and Medicare could create a political incentive for lawmakers to follow through on paying down the national debt, Mr. Greenspan said.
"Given that our record of sustaining surpluses for extended periods of time is not good, any device that might accomplish this goal is worth examining," he said.
The Fed chairman also raised concerns that promising more money to the retirement programs "could take the steam out" of efforts to make money-saving changes he said should be considered, like increasing the retirement age and improving health care systems.
Mr. Greenspan raised the possibility that limited, short-term income tax transfers to Social Security and Medicare "would not necessarily eliminate all fiscal responsibility."
Today's committee hearing was intended to address a crucial issue facing Congressional budget makers this year: whether surpluses that come from income taxes, rather than from the special payroll taxes that finance Social Security and Medicare, should be dedicated to the programs.

HEADLINE: Sales of Existing Homes Rose in February

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
Americans pushed up sales of existing homes in February after two consecutive months of declines caused in part by higher mortgage rates.
Sales of existing single-family homes bounced back by a modest 6.7 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.75 million units, the National Association of Realtors said today. 
 With plentiful jobs, rising incomes, stock market gains and low inflation, Americans are feeling wealthy and in a mood to buy despite an upswing in mortgage rates, economists said.
"The higher-interest-rate story is being overridden by the amount of wealth potential homeowners have amassed," said Richard Yamarone, an economist with the Argus Research Corporation.
Last week, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the fifth time since June 30.
The Fed did this to slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation under control. Given continuing strong growth, many economists believe the central bank will increase interest rates again on May 16.
The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 8.33 percent in February, up from 8.21 percent in January. In February 1999, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage was 6.81 percent.
"The fact sales improved in the face of continuing increases in mortgage interest rates demonstrates the very high demand for housing in the United States," said Dennis Cronk, president of the realtors association.
Even with the gain, however, February's sales are 7.6 percent lower than the sales rate of 5.14 million posted in February 1999.
In January, existing-home sales fell 13.4 percent, sharper than previously reported. Economists had blamed the earlier-reported higher mortgage rates and a record low 2.6-month supply of homes available to sell in January. In December, existing-home sales dropped 0.2 percent.
The stock of existing homes for sale rose in February but remained at a low 2.8 months, meaning it would take 2.8 months to exhaust the supply at February's sales pace.
By region, the South saw existing-home sales rise 10.7 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.97 million units.
In the West, sales rose 8.7 percent, to a rate of 1.12 million units, and in the Midwest they grew by 5.7 percent, to a rate of 1.12 million units. But sales fell 6.9 percent in the Northeast, to a rate of 540,000 units.
The median existing-home sales price, meaning half sold for more and half for less, was $131,100 last month. That was 0.8 percent lower than the January median price but was 2.3 percent higher than the median price recorded for February 1999.

 BODY:

EUROPE
 
NORTHERN IRELAND: BLOODY SUNDAY INQUIRY -- The British government opened a new investigation into the 1972 shooting of Catholic civil rights demonstrators by British soldiers on a Londonderry street. Shortly after the event, a tribunal exonerated the soldiers and implied that the 14 people killed had been involved in terrorism. Brian Lavery (NYT)
 
BRUSSELS: COMMERCIAL SPYING -- Green Party deputies in the European Parliament said they had gathered enough signatures to begin an inquiry into accusations that the United States uses an electronic surveillance system, known as Echelon, for industrial espionage in Europe. The creation of a committee of inquiry is rare in the European Union. The last one looked into so-called "mad cow" disease and extracted proposals from the 15-nation bloc about tighter food safety. (Reuters) 

AFRICA
 
ZAMBIA: EXIT FROM POLITICS -- Former President Kenneth Kaunda, who led Zambia to independence from Britain in 1964, stepped down as leader of the United National Independence Party, ending a political era that spanned more than four decades. Mr. Kaunda, 75, is expected to seek the role of an African peacemaker, following in the footsteps of Julius Nyerere, the former president of Tanzania who died last fall. (Reuters)
 
SOUTH AFRICA: RIGHTIST'S APPEAL -- Eugene Terre'Blanche, leader of the far-right Afrikaner Resistance Movement, faces at least a year in prison after the Appeal Court ruled that he could challenge only the attempted murder part of a six-year sentence for assault and attempted murder. He was convicted for striking a black employee at his security firm in 1996, causing brain damage. (Agence France-Presse)
 
ZIMBABWE: ELECTIONS POSTPONED -- Parliamentary elections will be held in May and not April as earlier scheduled, to allow voter registration to be completed, President Robert Mugabe said, adding that a clearer date would emerge once the voters' roll had been updated and constituencies adjusted. His ZANU-PF party, in power since independence in 1980, is facing its stiffest challenge at the polls from the broad-based Movement for Democratic Change. (Reuters)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
CANADA: OPPOSITION TRANSFORMED -- The Reform Party voted itself out of existence, re-emerging in Parliament as the Canadian Alliance. The new party, Canada's second largest and the official opposition in Parliament, seeks to create a conservative coalition to battle the Liberals in next year's elections. It will choose a leader in June. James Brooke (NYT)
 
COSTA RICA: ARREST IN KILLING -- The police said they arrested a 16-year-old boy, whom they did not identify, as a suspect in the shooting deaths of two American women. The bodies of Emily Eagen and Emily Howell, both 19, were found March 13, 90 miles east of San Jose. (AP)
 
UNITED NATIONS
 
UNITED NATIONS: NARROW ESCAPE -- Under Secretary General Joseph Connor said that the United Nations had managed to step back from the brink of financial disaster at the end of last year, in large part because of American payments totaling $452 million. But he warned that this year is likely to see a sharp rise in peacekeeping bills, to nearly $2 billion, and that could overrun the earlier gains. The United States still owes about $1.6 billion in back dues. Barbara Crossette (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
SRI LANKA: REBEL OFFENSIVE -- The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a separatist ethnic Tamil group, said they had begun a sea and land assault against army bases in the northern part of the island. This comes as the country's two main political parties -- long bitter rivals -- are trying to agree on a peace plan that would give Tamils greater regional autonomy, but that the rebels call a ruse to give the government time to bolster its military strength.

MALAYSIA: LEADER AFFIRMED -- Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad won the nominations of 133 out of 165 of his governing party's local divisions, assuring him of retaining the party's leadership and thus the post of prime minister. His deputy, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, was reported to have secured enough nominations to retain the number two spot in the party, known as Umno, when it meets later this year. Seth Mydans (NYT)
 
JAPAN: SELF-CRITICISM ON NUCLEAR ACCIDENT -- The government released a report criticizing its reaction to the nation's worst-ever nuclear accident last year, saying it was too slow in gathering and disseminating information to local governments, ministries and agencies, and in issuing directions. More than 400 people were exposed to radiation last Sept. 30 at a uranium-processing plant about 70 miles northeast of Tokyo. One worker died, the first victim of a nuclear accident in Japan. (AP)
 
JAPAN: SUED BY OKINAWA -- Residents of the Japanese island of Okinawa filed a lawsuit against the governments of the United States and Japan seeking $56.2 million in damages for noise pollution and other disruptions related to American military bases. The lawsuit comes as a political embarrassment to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who hoped to hold a trouble-free meeting of the world's leading economic powers in Okinawa in July. Howard W.

IRAQ: TO THE POLLS -- Iraqis voted in the second parliamentary elections since the 1991 Persian Gulf war. Among the candidates was the eldest son of President Saddam Hussein, Uday, making his formal political debut.

HEADLINE: OPEC Leaves Question Of Oil Increase on Table

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: VIENNA, March 27

 BODY:
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries adjourned its ministerial meeting here tonight without an agreement on modest production increases, and delegates agreed to reconvene on Tuesday.
But as they grappled with how to reach an accord, one question looming behind almost all their talks was whether anybody was really in control of oil prices. 
 Though American consumers have been shocked to see gasoline surge to $1.59 a gallon from an average of $1.27 six months ago, oil producers in and out of OPEC have been on a roller coaster in the last two years.
And for all the mystique of private meetings between Middle Eastern sheiks and technocrats from Mexico and Venezuela, the 11 nations of OPEC produce only 40 percent of the world's oil and have been repeatedly blindsided by market forces.
The obstacles to price "stability," a buzzword embraced as warmly by the United States as by Saudi Arabia, have been numerous: chronic cheating within the cartel on its self-imposed output restrictions; inaccurate estimates of demand and inventories; poor forecasting; and the inevitable surprises induced by weather, war and other calamities.
In the fall of 1997, Saudi Arabia persuaded OPEC to increase production by one million barrels a day. Prices then sank to the low teens in 1998 and hit $11 a barrel a year ago.
Panic-driven production cuts of 4.3 million barrels a day in 1998 and 1999 helped prices climb back. They surged to $34 in early March.
Since then, they have slipped back to about $28.
Today, fear of causing another steep plunge prevented OPEC members from completing a deal to increase their daily production quota by 1.5 to 1.7 million barrels.
After several informal and then formal meetings, oil ministers adjourned with plans to meet again on Tuesday morning. Officials on all sides of the debate publicly predicted that they would agree on a plan to raise production, but Iran continued to push for less than the 1.7 million barrels that Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states want to add.
"We are not opposed to an increase," said Iran's oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zangeneh, shortly before oil ministers met at OPEC offices here this evening. "I won't talk on numbers, but we don't want a market shortage."
Many OPEC leaders now say their target price is $25 a barrel, and American officials have implied that they can live with that level.
But the larger question remains unanswered: does OPEC, or any other group, have enough influence to keep oil prices within a tight range?
"Total world production is 75 million to 78 million barrels a day, but sometimes all you have to do is be off by a million barrels," said Joseph A. Stanislaw, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. "That's how much they increased production in 1997, but they increased right when demand was about to go down."
The memories of that miscalculation are still vivid for many oil ministers here, especially those who felt themselves dragged into the increase by Saudi Arabia's power as the world's largest producer.
"When I talk about these questions with the Saudis, I ask them if they think their forecasts are better this time than back in Jakarta," said Sheik Saud Nasser Al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister.
Saudi officials admit that they miscalculated, principally because they failed to anticipate that the Asian financial crisis would reduce world oil demand as sharply as it did.
"We are trying to avoid volatility, but this is something that you cannot guarantee," said a senior Saudi official here on Sunday.
Beyond the unpredictability of the world economy, data about the oil market and even something as simple as OPEC production itself is often inaccurate.
Members of the cartel chronically overshoot their official quotas, though the price collapses of 1998 and 1999 prompted them to adhere to discipline more closely than they had in the past.
Cheating on quotas is so persistent and so important to oil prices that numerous organizations make monthly estimates by monitoring oil tankers and pipeline activities.
OPEC itself does not even have its own statistics on its production, partly because members do not trust each other to provide reliable data. As a result, OPEC officials rely on research provided by outside companies and organizations.
The most widely watched estimates are those of the International Energy Agency, a research organization in Paris funded primarily by the United States and other Western countries. The agency estimates that OPEC countries are cheating by about one million barrels a day.
But estimating cheating is still a nebulous art, prone to errors. Even more difficult is the job of estimating oil inventories, which are held by oil producers around the world as well as petroleum refiners, traders and distributors.
The International Energy Agency and private researchers admit that they seriously overestimated the reduction of inventories in January.

Little Inflation Seen
 By The New York Times
 WASHINGTON, March 27 -- Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today that higher oil prices are not generating inflation in the United States, and that the country is better able to absorb rising energy costs than it was two decades ago.
"We do not, as yet -- I emphasize as yet -- see any significant indication that crude oil price increases are in the process of embedding themselves in other areas of the economy and inflating the general price structure," Mr. Greenspan said in response to a question at a hearing before a Senate committee.
Mr. Greenspan said that as long as average oil prices remained roughly where they are now, he doubted that they would be sufficient to set off a surge in inflation. But he warned that a big, sustained jump in prices could still be harmful to the American economy, as well as, in the long run, to the oil-producing nations.

Treasury Prices Manage Only a Modest Rise

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose modestly yesterday, restrained by the belief that the Federal Reserve might need to raise interest rates repeatedly to keep inflation from gaining any foothold in the economy.
The central bank has raised rates by a quarter-point five times since June, with little effect so far on the pace of growth. 
 "The Fed is a long way from being done here, and most people would agree that we are looking at at least one and probably two more tightenings and this will continue to put pressure on interest rates," said Bill Kirby, co-head of government trading at Prudential Securities.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 7/32 , to 10326/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.98 percent from 5.99 percent on Friday.
With a light calendar of economic data this week, Treasuries turned their attention to the potential for sharper rate increases. The market also focused on a Vienna meeting of world oil ministers. The officials are expected to ease output limits, which should allow some decrease in the price of oil.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said that recent oil price rises had not yet ignited general inflation and were unlikely to do so if the price of oil settled in the mid-$20-a-barrel range.
Oil for May delivery fell 23 cents yesterday, to $27.79 a barrel, down from more than $30 a barrel earlier this month.
Nervousness about prospects for more aggressive rate increases by the Fed sent bond prices sharply lower on Friday, and this anxiety also caused price swings yesterday.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

OPEC Pricing Revisited: What a Difference 20 Years Makes. Right?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
As the oil ministers met in Vienna, there was great concern about whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would give the rest of the world a break and do something to restrain high oil prices. Reporters were hanging on every word from the ministers, some of whom had felt intense American diplomatic pressure. Iran took a militant position, while Saudi Arabia was more accommodative, and the meeting was extended as agreement proved elusive.
So it was nearly 20 years ago, when OPEC met in the fall of 1980. And so it was yesterday. 
 But there are important differences between then and now. Then, inflation was widely feared in the developed world, and it was believed that oil prices were sure to rise for years to come. Then, widespread efforts at energy conservation were having an effect, and oil companies were intensifying their search for new oil fields.
Now all those factors have changed. Complacency has replaced urgency on Main Street, on Capitol Hill and in the executive suites of major oil companies. All expect prices to fall, and therefore see little need for action.
In part the changes reflect the way the world economy has changed. Oil is less important to economic growth in the information age than it once was, and inflation has declined sharply. We have seen that cartels are very hard to hold together, and that widespread cheating on oil production quotas has often made it very hard for oil exporters to keep prices up.
But while many things have changed, the fact is that relatively high oil prices have persisted many months longer than the experts forecast, and they could continue to do so -- particularly if there continues to be little indication of a determination to act to fight high prices.
In retrospect, four things helped to end the era of high oil prices. Recessions and sluggish growth in the developed world helped to cut demand. So did energy conservation efforts, including government-mandated fuel economy standards. The world's energy companies spent heavily to find new oil supplies and to seek alternative sources of energy. And oil producers cheated on quotas.
Of those, only one is still around. There is reported to be cheating on the OPEC quotas, of around 1 million to 1.5 million barrels a day. So far efforts to agree on a quota increase have failed, although some agreement is expected today. Whether or not cheating will increase, assuming there is a deal, will be a subject of widespread speculation.
But the other factors are all gone. In 1980, oil companies were earning profits that one politician called obscene and their share prices reflected wild enthusiasm. Drilling for oil was going on at a formidable rate, with 3,099 oil rigs operating in this country, according to figures from Baker Hughes. Now oil profits are also good, but share prices have shown little strength, in large part because it is generally believed that the profits will fade as oil prices inevitably fall.
Moreover, the lesson that the oil companies have learned from recent history is that they would be foolish to ramp up their exploration efforts. They did that in 1997, when oil prices were above $20 a barrel, only to suffer when prices plunged. Exploration budgets are being held down across most of the industry. Budgets are up a bit from 1999, but "we're well below the 1998 level of spending," said Frederick P. Leuffer, an oil analyst at Bear, Stearns.
The United States rig count, at 768, is less than it was in the summer of 1998, when oil prices were half what they are today. But the companies are announcing large repurchases of their own shares, and some are expected to raise shareholder dividends.
Nowhere is the atmospheric difference greater than in Washington. In 1980, there was debate about raising gasoline taxes and taking other steps to limit demand for gasoline. In fact, by then the rising price of gasoline had prompted Americans to search for vehicles with better fuel economy. Now, Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, is suggesting that federal gasoline taxes be temporarily removed, the better to ease the pain for drivers.
That pain is real, but so far it has not done much to affect consumer behavior. In a booming economy, most motorists are willing to spend more rather than move to more fuel-efficient vehicles. Sport utility vehicles, which are far from fuel efficient, now make up 17 percent of total sales of cars and light trucks, up from under 2 percent in 1980. The average fuel economy of cars and light trucks sold in the 1981 model year was 24.1 miles a gallon. In the 1999 model year, the latest for which figures are available, it was 23.8.
Gasoline prices now are about 25 cents a gallon higher than they were in September 1980. But those figures are not adjusted for inflation, and in real terms the price of gasoline is far lower.
Six months ago, when oil climbed above $24 a barrel, there was virtual unanimity that the price could not hold. The futures market forecast that oil prices would fall 13 percent within six months. Instead, they rose, peaking above $34 earlier this month before coming down to $27.79 yesterday, on expectations that the OPEC meeting will raise production. But one thing has not changed much. Prices are now expected to fall 11 percent over the next six months.
Oil prices went up for a variety of reasons. Weather was part of the story, as was economic strength. So, too, was a widespread belief that prices would come down because of OPEC cheating. That left the entire industry, from international companies down to neighborhood fuel oil dealers, hesitant to maintain high inventories that were likely to decline in value. When things did not go as expected, those low inventories accelerated the price rise.
In the long run, it is in the interests of Saudi Arabia in particular to avoid letting oil get so expensive that it stimulates the search for alternative fuels and leads consuming countries to slash their demand. But for now, there is no sign either is about to happen. As a result, oil prices could stay relatively high far longer than most experts anticipate.

Treasury Secretary Wants New Stress on Latin Poverty

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, March 27

 BODY:
Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers called today for sweeping changes in the way international aid agencies try to combat poverty in Latin America, amid signs that robust economic growth there has left more people behind than many economists expected.
Mr. Summers, speaking to Latin American finance ministers and development experts at the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank, said the United States wanted the bank to conduct a full review of its lending programs, to raise the interest rates it charges its wealthiest borrowers, and to adopt more effective ways of increasing education levels and fighting poverty. 
 The Washington-based international agency, financed by leading industrial nations, makes about $7 billion in development loans to Latin America each year. Together with lending by the World Bank, it is the main vehicle for the United States and other wealthy nations to help alleviate poverty in the region.
Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and other major Latin American nations have all grown faster in the last year than economists anticipated. They recovered swiftly from financial crisis, and bank officials estimated today that the region would grow at a pace of 3 percent to 4 percent in 2000, compared with an estimated 0.3 percent last year.
Yet the recession erased some progress in fighting poverty from the boom years of the early and mid-90's, and inequality has remained stubbornly high -- increasing by some measures. The situation has frustrated international financial officials, who expected that Latin America would follow the pattern of the Asian recovery and that rapid economic growth would lift all boats and ease social tensions more than it has.
"Latin America's economic success in recent years has not been associated with a reduction in inequality," Mr. Summers said in an interview. "The pressing economic problem for Latin America is to create an environment in which all people have a chance to benefit from growth."
A study by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America found that 15 percent of the region's people live in extreme poverty, a level it said had barely budged in two decades. And the Inter-American Development Bank released a report saying that 150 million people in the region live on $2 a day or less, and that the gap between rich and poor widened in the 1990's.
This persistent income gap, some fear, may threaten the consensus that has brought Latin American economies closer to world levels in the last decade, especially at a time when globalization is under attack by some labor unions and nongovernment organizations.
Though most of the pressure against global integration comes from interest groups in industrial nations, protesters in third world countries argue that free trade and international financial agencies benefit the rich at the expense of the poor.
Low-key demonstrations against the Inter-American Development Bank occurred today. Three protesters slipped into the opening ceremony for delegates, unfurling a banner that read "Shut Down the Bank," before they were evicted.
Mr. Summers and many of the other finance ministers maintained that high and sustained economic growth still constituted the best antidote to poverty and had already improved living standards for millions throughout the region. But they acknowledged that growth alone had fallen short of achieving Latin American social goals, and there appeared to be broad agreement that the development bank should shift its priorities accordingly.
"Our countries are changing, our markets our changing and our social needs are changing, so the I.D.B. must also change," Jose Angel Gurria, Mexico's finance minister, said in an interview. "At a time when most countries in the region have better access to private capital, this should free up resources at the bank that can be used for poverty programs."
While Mr. Summers noted that the Inter-American Development Bank had already begun redirecting resources away from big projects, like power plants, to support poverty reduction, he said that more could be done. He declined to pass judgment on individual lending projects, but suggested that some of the largest loans the bank was considering, including one to finance a Brazilian dam, could deplete capital that was better devoted to smaller, more specific poverty-fighting efforts.
The United States is pushing the bank to establish performance benchmarks that measure the effectiveness of its poverty programs.
The Treasury secretary also urged the bank to conserve its resources in good times to be better prepared to increase spending when times are tough and the poor need help most.
The changes are part of an overhaul Mr. Summers has proposed for all the major lending institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and regional development banks. Mr. Summers has sought to blunt an attack on the I.M.F. and the banks by some members of Congress, who argue that they have outlived their usefulness and may do more harm than good.
Last week, he said the World Bank should refocus its efforts toward reducing poverty in the poorest nations and leave most commercial projects to private business, particularly in countries with good credit ratings.

HEADLINE: Robust Economy Is Contributing To a Loss of Affordable Housing

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
While the nation enjoys continuing prosperity, affordable housing for many of the working poor has become harder to find, a federal report said today.
The report, issued by Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development, found that 5.4 million low-income families were paying more than half their income for housing or living in dilapidated units, a rise of 12 percent since the economic expansion began in 1991. 
 The government regards housing for low-income people affordable if it consumes less than a third of a family's income.
"This is the highest need for affordable housing since we have been taking numbers," Mr. Cuomo said.
Low-income housing, he said, "is getting old, it is coming out of service, it is being knocked down."
He cited several factors for the squeeze on the working poor, including the rising economy.
In the past, building owners accepted low-income tenants whose rent was paid from their own earnings and from subsidies from a government voucher program known as Section 8. But because of the continuing prosperity, Mr. Cuomo said, many property owners have found that higher-income tenants have bid up the prices of apartments beyond the poorer tenants' ability to pay, even with the Section 8 subsidies.
Mr. Cuomo also criticized Congress's refusal to approve more Section 8 housing from 1995 through 1998, "when we went out of the housing business."
He blamed the Republicans in Congress for the lack of new Section 8 units, saying, "We had proposals in the tens of thousands for every year and Congress said zero."
Representative Rick Lazio, the New York Republican who is chairman of a housing subcommittee, said a Republican objection during that time had been a "take one, take all" provision that required landlords accepting any families with vouchers to accept all families with them.
Republican complaints were satisfied, Mr. Lazio said, and 50,000 new housing vouchers were approved for 1999 and 60,000 more for this year.
As to President Clinton's request for 120,000 more for next year -- which would cost $6 billion -- Mr. Lazio said he had introduced a measure for 100,000 units, "so we are very close." But he said that the administration had to show where the money would come from.
Told of Mr. Lazio's comments, Mr. Cuomo said his call for 100,000 new vouchers was "a tad disingenuous and misleading." While Mr. Lazio may push a bill seeking the new vouchers, Mr. Cuomo said, the Republican leadership has said it will not approve the money for them.
Mr. Cuomo said the added 120,000 vouchers would help ease the "cruel irony" of the strong economy hurting the poor by driving up rents.
Asked if his agency should not share in the responsibility for the shortage, he said, "If there was any failure, it was our failure to persuade Congress to provide funds."

HEADLINE: Putin Tells Advisers to Prepare 'Weighty' Economic Plan

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 27

 BODY:
On the day after his decisive victory in a field of 11 candidates in the presidential election on Sunday, Vladimir V. Putin told his cabinet today that it was time to put "all our work" on a new economic program into one "weighty document" by the time he is sworn in and appoints his new government in early May.
Mr. Putin's reference to an economic blueprint that he steadfastly refused to discuss during the campaign was a pointed reminder that planning was well under way for his presidency. 
 Tonight, Mr. Putin met with former President Boris N. Yeltsin and received warm praise from the patron who plucked Mr. Putin from political obscurity last fall as the head of the country's intelligence agency, appointed him prime minister, and then announced that the 47-year-old ex-K.G.B. officer would make a good successor. Mr. Yeltsin resigned on Dec. 31, appointing Mr. Putin acting president.
With more than 95 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Putin had polled nearly 53 percent of the ballots. The Communist Party candidate, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, was a strong second in the crowded field with almost 30 percent.
A number of world leaders, including President Clinton, President Jiang Zemin of China and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, spoke with Mr. Putin by telephone today, extending congratulations and expressing their own hopes for Russia's future. Mr. Clinton urged the new Russian leader to strengthen democracy and its international ties, while Mr. Jiang urged him to deepen the "strategic partnership" between Russia and China. The New China News Agency said Mr. Putin had agreed to visit China this year.
Mr. Clinton also expressed the hope that Mr. Putin would carry out "impartial and transparent investigations of reported human rights violations" during the military campaign Russia has waged in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
Mr. Putin met with his security advisers for an update on the war in Chechnya. He also sent a greeting to the Interior Ministry troops who, along with the Russian Army, have been fighting in Chechnya. "Your bravery and dignity are a safe guarantee that this region will be freed of the bandits and that peaceful life will be restored there," it said.
The strong showing by the Communist candidate, Mr. Zyuganov, drew considerable notice here. A number of commentators saw it as evidence of the enduring strength of the Communist opposition, which has consistently garnered close to a third of the national vote, and suggested that Mr. Putin might seek a collaborative relationship with it.
Mr. Putin will need to avoid political conflicts that would hamper efforts to move forward with difficult reforms of the banking system, taxation and land ownership. The Communists, for their part, are interested in sharing power and attracting new partners after losing the coalition through which they dominated Parliament in the last five years.
Leonid Dobrokhotov, an adviser to Mr. Zyuganov, said tonight that the Communist Party would consider working with Mr. Putin's allies in Parliament if the president accepted the party's demands on "raising the living standards" and strengthening industry, agriculture, and education.
"The popularity of the Communist Party is the result of the suffering of the people," Mr. Dobrokhotov said. "We don't want to fight with the party in power. We want to solve the social problems of the people."
Boris Makarenko, deputy director of the Center for Political Technology, a consulting firm, said today that the new government would be more centrist, with the Communists as a "junior partner," adding, "This is a new role for the Communists."
At the same time, the poor showing of Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the Yabloko Party leader, who polled less than 6 percent of the vote, reflected the disarray of Russia's liberal politicians. It suggested that Mr. Yavlinsky's personal base of support was shrinking, and reflected the fact that many liberal voters fell in behind either Mr. Putin or one of several liberals who ran as independents, including Konstantin Titov, the progressive governor of the Samara region, or Ella Pamfilova, the Women's Party candidate.
One of the strongest new liberal forces is the Union of Right Forces, which made a surprisingly strong showing in parliamentary elections in December. But its leaders, who include prominent reformers from Mr. Yeltsin's governments, decided not to field a presidential candidate, and then quarreled publicly over whether to endorse Mr. Putin, as most eventually did.
In general, most Russian political organizations other than the Communist Party have usually been groupings around specific leaders, and not national parties. Mr. Putin has not identified himself with any of those, though last fall the Kremlin helped form the Unity Party, an amalgam of mayors, governors and other regional officials.
But the only party with longevity, ideology and a national following remains the Communist Party. Michael McFaul, senior associate of the Moscow Carnegie Center, called this circumstance "sad progress for democracy and its legacy."
By any normal standard, Mr. Putin's victory with nearly 53 percent of the vote, compared with just under 30 percent for Mr. Zyuganov, would be considered a landslide. But the fact that Mr. Putin's popularity, which had hovered around 60 percent this winter, sagged in the final weeks of the campaign while the Communists rallied left a haze of uncertainty over the Kremlin, where Mr. Putin and his advisers were trying to figure out what kind of mandate they had received.
But it also appeared that Mr. Putin's victory was broad-based. Where Mr. Yeltsin in 1996 managed to carry only 57 of Russia's 89 administrative regions, Mr. Putin won majorities in all be six, including Mr. Zyuganov's home district.
"What is important is victory," said Aleksandr Voloshin, the presidential chief of staff, putting the best face on the results in an interview with the newspaper Izvestia to be published on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Clinton Wishes Putin Well And Brings Up Chechnya

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
President Clinton congratulated President-elect Vladimir V. Putin today on his victory in the Russian election, but also reiterated in a brief telephone conversation White House concerns about Russia's continuing conflict in Chechnya.
Mr. Clinton placed the call this morning after it became clear that Mr. Putin had received enough votes in the balloting on Sunday to avoid a runoff next month against Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist leader, who finished a distant second. Mr. Clinton's remarks reflected the administration's optimism toward Mr. Putin but also its wait-and-see attitude toward the former intelligence officer who has spoken of being a reformer and of integrating Russia into the world community. 
 "President-elect Putin has an opportunity to translate his electoral mandate into concrete steps to advance economic reform, to strengthen the rule of law, to intensify the fight against crime and corruption, and to join with us on a broad common agenda of international security including arms control, nonproliferation and regional peace and stability," the president said in a statement.
He added that during his 15-minute conversation he "emphasized the importance to Russia and the world of strengthening the foundations of Russia's democracy and deepening its international integration."
What remains to be seen, according to administration officials, is whether Mr. Putin follows through on his plans to reform the Russian tax system and judiciary, introduce land reform and fight corruption, and whether he institutes law and order without cracking down on human rights.
Today's conversation did not delve into the key issues between the two nations, such as the administration's effort to persuade the Russians to modify the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. But on the subject of Chechnya, where the brutal fighting continues, Mr. Clinton said he did raise his concerns about Russian aggression.
"I stressed to President-elect Putin the importance of launching impartial and transparent investigations of reported human rights violations and providing prompt and full access for international organizations and the press," he said.
But Mr. Putin, whose tough handling of Chechnya was considered an asset in the campaign, gave no signs of altering Russia's military campaign, aides said.
The two leaders last spoke on New Year's Day after President Boris N. Yeltsin announced that he was stepping down and that he was appointing Mr. Putin, then prime minister, as acting president. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Putin met face to face last year in Oslo and New Zealand.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
A Man Who Gives Credit Where It's Due

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
HERBERT STURZ is not a name readily recognizable to 98 percent of New Yorkers. This pleases Mr. Sturz.
But inquire of the remaining 2 percent -- public- and private-sector types alike, who have left their own crater-size footprints in criminal justice, real estate development and social welfare policies in the city -- and the booming response is inevitably, "Oh sure! I've known Herb for 30 years!" This pleases Mr. Sturz, too. 
 For one secret of his startling ability to have jump-started so many ideas in those areas, including his latest, a George Soros-sponsored after-school program now in 100 city schools, is his shrewdness in knowing the right people to beseech and then publicly giving them credit.
"The more you take credit, the less able you are to do something the next time," said Mr. Sturz, 69, who is regarded as much for his penetrating social vision as for his sly-fox strategies for applying bricks and mortar to his ideas. His two-year-old Soros project, the After School Corporation, is a three-to-one matching fund that contracts with community programs to provide 26,000 New York City schoolchildren, so far, with activities in their schools until 6 p.m. Similar initiatives are rapidly taking hold around the country.
Mr. Sturz holds no degree in law, urban planning or education, areas in which he has made his name, or rather, other people's. But "I know a few people," he said with a smile.
As both a deputy mayor for criminal justice during the Koch administration and in such private-sector positions as founding director of the Vera Institute of Justice, Mr. Sturz has nudged into being a bail-reform project for the indigent that became a national model, aid for the city's crime victims, services for mentally ill and addicted offenders, and the award-winning Midtown Community Court. (In recognition for his criminal justice activities, the Correctional Association of New York is honoring him tonight.)
"I was able to engage the idealism of a lot of wonderful people," said Mr. Sturz, whose selling style has been described by admirers as graciously flattering and by the dubious as a touch unctuous. But his mild demeanor is only a kindly cover for a tough-minded, ambitious thinker who is also a wickedly good poker player. When facing a politician, developer or community leader who might oppose his project, Mr. Sturz says he tries to figure out, "Where does that person's enlightened self-interest lie?"
Mr. Sturz had another life, as chairman of the city planning commission under Mr. Koch. During his seven-year tenure as chairman, a period of economic boom, Mr. Sturz helped curb development on the East Side of Manhattan while spurring it on the West Side and in downtown Brooklyn. Though the new Times Square was not his idea -- he is, typically, quick to underscore that point -- he brokered the deal in its embryonic stage.
ADD to his teeming resume a stint in the late 1980's on the editorial board of The New York Times, followed by the hard-won development of a 43-story moderate-income co-op in Hunters Point, Queens, and, more recently, helping to establish a Soros matching fund for 50,000 new homes in South African townships, and Mr. Sturz, son of an immigrant tavern owner in Bayonne, N.J., may indeed be congratulated for having tabled an indifferent career as a fiction writer.
(He did publish a now vanished novel about a Spanish fishing village, where he lived in the 1950's with his Texas-born co-author and girlfriend, Elizabeth, to whom he has been married for more than 40 years.)
Mr. Sturz, who spoke in his office at Mr. Soros's foundation, the Open Society Institute, in Manhattan, was at a loss only when asked what had shaped his restless, imaginative and compassionate thinking.
"My father was lovely, giving and decent and he never cared much for what I might accomplish," Mr. Sturz recalled. "His love was much more elemental." Mr. Sturz's promising tennis and track future was cut short during his senior year in high school when he contracted polio, which permanently weakened his arms and hands. "Even today," he said uncomfortably, "it's hard to know what impact it had on me, except that I became more serious."
After getting a master's degree in English from Columbia, Mr. Sturz worked in a mental ward and in youth homes, lived in Europe, and then returned to become an editor at Boy's Life magazine.
His series on law and justice was read by the philanthropist Louis Schweitzer, who, with Mr. Sturz brainstorming, sponsored a think tank that tackled seemingly intractable problems in the courts. Mr. Sturz's earliest efforts with the Vera Institute of Justice included ways to set reasonable bail for poor defendants and the diversion of Bowery alcoholics from the courts to clinics.
At first glance, Mr. Sturz's current schools project, on which Mr. Soros has spent $20 million, seems a distance from his criminal justice background. But in giving students activities until their parents can pick them up, the project seeks to reduce juvenile crime and help parents on welfare join the work force: issues addressed by Vera satellites.
"I always start narrow when I'm learning about a new subject, but it usually leads me to ask, 'Is this a solution for other problems?' " Mr. Sturz said. "What makes you think I've gotten everything done that I've wanted to?"

HEADLINE: After Shootings, Livery Drivers Keep a Wary Eye in the Mirror

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Judging by statistics alone, New York is relatively safer these days for its more than 41,000 livery-cab drivers, the drivers who make up the only cab industry in most of the city, cruising the streets where yellow cabs are rarely seen.
During the first four years of the 1990's, for example, 139 livery drivers were killed in shootings, stabbings and beatings, in a crime wave so stunning it provoked taxi drivers to stage a protest that tied up traffic for hours in Manhattan. By contrast, 8 livery drivers were killed in 1998, 11 were killed last year, and robberies have fallen almost 64 percent since they peaked in 1992. 
 But try to tell Lakhwander Singh that his job is any less dangerous.
Yesterday, Mr. Singh was propped up in bed in Richmond Hills, Queens, with two bullet holes in his bandaged right shoulder. And the only reason he was alive, he said, was because the two men who robbed him of $50 on Sunday night had trouble aiming after he stepped on his accelerator to race for help and crashed into a truck.
"I said, 'Please take the money and don't shoot me,' " Mr. Singh, 40, said, sitting stiffly in a sparse bedroom he shares with his cousin, also a livery driver. "And they took the money, and they shot me anyway."
Mr. Singh was one of three livery cab drivers shot in a 24-hour period Sunday, and he was the lucky one. Mohammed Chahon, 42, was in serious but stable condition at Bellevue Hospital Center, shot in the face, buttocks and stomach after he picked up a passenger who tried to rob him near the Brooklyn Navy Yard early Sunday morning. Rafael Cruz, 58, was in guarded condition at Brookdale Hospital and Medical Center in Brooklyn after he was shot in the head by a man he had driven to Brownsville, Brooklyn, on Sunday evening. Mr. Cruz clung to consciousness and drove himself to the hospital.
The police say that just since the beginning of the year, four livery drivers have been shot and killed in robberies, and three have now been critically injured.
As in the past, murders and robberies involving livery drivers far outpace those involving yellow cabs, which tend to operate in much safer neighborhoods and now all have bulletproof shields.
And so even before the latest round of shootings, drivers say, a climate of fear and anger had returned to the livery industry, one unlike any seen since the early 1990's. Car services that rely on radio calls have become more careful in the screening of passengers, sometimes rejecting calls that sound the least bit suspicious, or calls that come from streets considered dangerous.
Livery drivers who try to make ends meet by picking up passengers on the street -- a violation, since only yellow cabs may legally accept hails -- say they have been refusing more people in hardscrabble neighborhoods in the Bronx and Brooklyn. Such refusals are common among livery services, but people who are passed by can complain to the Taxi and Limousine Commission.
But livery drivers say that even when their guts tell them they are safe, there is no way to be sure. "I always try to pick up nice guys, guys who don't look like they will give me any trouble," said Mr. Singh, whose brother was also robbed, and pistol-whipped, two months ago while driving a livery car. "These two guys, they looked good to me," he said of the robbers, who hailed him at the Long Island Rail Road station in Jamaica, Queens, and rode to East New York, Brooklyn, where one put a gun to Mr. Singh's head when he stopped.
The sharp spike in crime against livery drivers prompted the police to create a task force last month to work with the industry, the first such publicized focus by the police in several years.
The Taxi and Limousine Commission also said that, starting Saturday, it would vigorously enforce a requirement that many livery drivers, like yellow cab drivers, have bulletproof partitions between their front and back seats. The commission's rules say that livery cars operated by more than one driver -- typically cars owned by livery companies -- must have the partitions. Cars owned and driven by individual drivers, which account for 90 percent of all livery cars, are allowed to have either the partitions or tiny infrared surveillance cameras installed beneath a driver's rearview mirror.
The different requirements for the two groups, said Allan J. Fromberg, a spokesman for the taxi commission, came about because many individual driver-owners also use their livery cars as family cars, and the commission decided that requiring a partition would have burdened them unfairly.
Mr. Fromberg said that, especially after the latest round of shootings, the agency intended to try harder to make sure that livery drivers were doing what they needed to do to protect themselves.
Many livery drivers -- especially the driver-owners, who have less money than the livery companies -- have resisted protective measures because of the cost. Even cheap partitions cost about $300, and the surveillance cameras can cost from $600 to $1,000.
"I would say we're going to be rededicating our efforts to this," Mr. Fromberg said.
Drivers say that in addition to helping themselves, they need more help from the police and the legal system. Yesterday, about 100 livery cab drivers carrying placards demonstrated in front of the Bronx Criminal Court building, calling for more serious charges to be filed against Gerard Soricelli, 40, of Eastchester Road in the Bronx, who was indicted on assault and robbery charges in connection with the robbery and beating of a livery driver, Ramon Burgos.
Mr. Burgos, 38, a Dominican immigrant and father of three girls, said he picked up Mr. Soricelli and another man near Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx on Feb. 18, and they later robbed him, nearly strangled him with a rope, and hit him in the head with a metal pipe, opening a gash that required 50 stitches. "I thought I was going to die," Mr. Burgos said yesterday.
Fidel F. Del Valle, the chairman of the taxi commission from 1991 to 1995, said he thought the rise in such brutal crimes had come about because the improved economy had put more liveries on the streets, and with business better, criminals tended to see the cabs as "rolling banks."
"The awareness of this was so high for so long," Mr. Del Valle said. But he added that drivers and the police "have tended to -- I don't want to say slack off -- but they're not as vigilant." He added, "I think we're seeing the results."

HEADLINE: Ex-Comptroller Regan to Head CUNY's Baruch College

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Edward V. Regan, who was New York State's comptroller for 14 years, was appointed yesterday as the next president of Baruch College in Manhattan, which has become one of the City University's most selective campuses.
As comptroller from 1979 to 1993, Mr. Regan oversaw the growth of the state pension fund to $56 billion from $10 billion. As he invested more of the fund in the stock market, he got to know many of the money managers on Wall Street, a plus that helped him win a job that increasingly requires a talent for raising funds. 
 Mr. Regan said yesterday that he relished the opportunity to join Baruch.
"Telling the Baruch story will be great fun," he said. "Taking first- and second-generation students and lower- and middle-income students and giving them a career ladder is what New York City does, and that is what Baruch does extremely well."
He said fund-raising "will be a big part of the job."
Since stepping down as comptroller, Mr. Regan, 69, has been chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the watchdog agency that monitors New York City's finances, and a fellow at the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College, and has served on a variety of boards.
The City University trustees also named a new president for Queensborough Community College: Eduardo J. Marti, an immigrant who fled Cuba shortly after Castro's takeover. He has been president of Corning Community College since 1994 and, before that, headed Tompkins Cortland Community College, both campuses in the State University system.
Dr. Marti, a biologist who earned his doctorate at New York University, taught at CUNY's Borough of Manhattan Community College from 1966 to 1979 and was associate dean of the faculty there.
He said he was attracted to Queensborough by the opportunity to help immigrant students. Nearly half of Queensborough's 10,400 students are immigrants. Corning has 5,300 students.
These appointments represent the first two permanent senior appointments since Matthew Goldstein became CUNY's chancellor last summer. Although the CUNY trustees formally appoint all presidents -- they approved these two during an executive session yesterday afternoon -- Dr. Goldstein recommends candidates to them.
Dr. Goldstein, who has been eager to cast CUNY more favorably following the brutal battles it faced over remedial instruction for under-prepared students, has a particular interest in Baruch. As president, he built it into one of CUNY's most prestigious colleges and brought in more than $50 million in gifts. He left Baruch in 1998 to become president of Adelphi University.
Dr. Goldstein said that although they are very different, Mr. Regan and Dr. Marti were both strong additions to CUNY. They will start on July 1.
"Ned Regan has a record of extensive and impeccable public service and can blend the political arena and the world of academe," he said. "Eduardo Marti is smart and focused and cares about advancing the goals of students."
What also pleased him, Dr. Goldstein said, was that CUNY had "an exemplary pool of candidates" to choose from. He halted a nearly-completed search for Baruch's president last year and initiated a new one because he did not think the group of candidates was broad enough.
Some at Baruch applauded Mr. Regan's appointment yesterday, saying that they expected him to be a strong fund-raiser.
Sidney I. Lirtzman, the former dean of Baruch's Zicklin School of Business and now the college's acting president, called Mr. Regan a great choice.
"He's well connected, and he knows the city and the state," Mr. Lirtzman said. "This should allow us to raise large sums of money to support the college programs that require private support."
Business and public administration are two of Baruch's primary programs.
Mr. Regan, who has a law degree from the SUNY law school at Buffalo, said that he had wanted to become more involved with academia. He said he had written more than 30 scholarly articles on government and financial issues, and has served as a trustee at Marymount College, New York University's Stern School of Business and New York Law School, and as an adjunct professor at Stern, Canisius College and the SUNY College at Buffalo.
When he heard last fall that the Baruch post was open, he expressed interest to Jack Nash, a former Wall Street executive with whom he shared an office for several years. A Baruch graduate and a major donor to the school, Mr. Nash recommended Mr. Regan to the search committee.
Mr. Nash expressed delight yesterday that the post was finally being filled and that Mr. Regan would fill it. "He'll do a good job," Mr. Nash said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Shares Close Lower on Declines by Microsoft and Banks

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Major stock market averages moved lower yesterday, dragged down by financial service and bank stocks and by a big decline in Microsoft, as it slumped on reports that it remained far from any agreement to settle the government's antitrust lawsuit.
Microsoft, part of the Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard & Poor's 500 index and the Nasdaq composite index, fell 7 5/8, to 1041/16 . 
The software company's drop was responsible for 37.9 points of the 86.87 decline in the Dow. That index closed at 11,025.85, down 0.8 percent from the close on Friday.
The Standard & Poor's index fell 3.60, or 0.2 percent, to 1,523.86. The decline in Microsoft shares was offset in part by gains in several other large technology issues, including America Online and Sun Microsystems.
The Nasdaq composite index fared better, closing at 4,958.56, down 4.47 points, or 0.1 percent. Gains in stocks like Qualcomm, Yahoo and Nextel tempered losses in JDS Uniphase and CMGI, as well as Microsoft.
Also, the Russell 2000 small-stock index dipped 3.6, or 0.1 percent, to 573.66.
Traders and analysts said there was no real trend to yesterday's action. Activity was light, the end of the first quarter is fast approaching and there is little in the way of economic news to be reported this week that seems likely to move financial markets.
"If there is one theme, it is that the larger-capitalization stocks are dominant again," said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in Stamford, Conn.
"Unless the bond market really falls apart," he added, "the stock market is likely to do all right until first-quarter earnings reports start to come in."
The bond market was fairly quiet yesterday, with little or no change in interest rates. But that did not prevent stock traders from pounding bank and brokerage stocks.
J. P. Morgan, a Dow component, fell 511/16 , to 131 1/8. Citigroup, which is also in the Dow, lost 1/2, to 601/16 . Mellon Financial declined 7/8, to 30 5/8. And Chase Manhattan dropped 1 1/2, to 9411/16 .
Mr. Meehan said that troubles at Finova Group might have caused jitters among holders of other bank stocks.
Yesterday Finova, which lends to midsize companies, warned that it would miss first-quarter profit goals because of a bad loan. The company also said its chief executive was retiring for health reasons.
Finova's stock price slid sharply, closing at 19 7/8, down 121/16 .
Brokerage stocks, which have been red hot lately, also slumped.
Their dive was led by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, which fell 99/16 , to 57 3/4, after the stock was downgraded by a Morgan Stanley analyst.
As it turns out, Morgan Stanley was also one of the biggest losers in the S.& P. 500. The stock closed at 90, down 513/16 . Charles Schwab slumped 5 1/8, to 5913/16 . And PaineWebber fell 3 1/2, to 439/16 .
Many big technology companies were immune from the problems that plagued Microsoft.
I.B.M., for one, closed at 126139/16 , up 597/16 . Hewlett-Packard gained 31513/16 , to 14635/16 . And Intel rose 3 5/8, to 1421147/16 .
Peter Canelo, an investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and a longtime optimist about the direction of stock prices, issued an even brighter assessment yesterday.
Before the market opened, Mr. Canelo raised his estimates for both the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite.
"We think oil prices have clearly peaked, and will fall to the mid-$20 a barrel range," he said in an interview. "Also, bond yields have fallen to the level where they are not competitive with stock market earnings. And I am positive about earnings. We have raised our earnings estimates for the S.& P. 500 to 15 percent from 12 percent for the calendar year."
Mr. Canelo said the market was likely to broaden beyond technology stocks into energy, financial services, capital goods and cyclical stocks that would benefit from an improving global economy.
By midsummer, he projects that the the S.& P. 500 index will be comfortably above 1,600. And he added that the Nasdaq composite had the potential to rise another 10 percent.

HEADLINE: Florio, Senate Hopeful, Runs Against Boom

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 27

 BODY:
Running against motherhood or apple pie you could almost understand. But running against the boom?
With the nation's economic expansion entering its 109th consecutive month and much of New Jersey awash in prosperity, it seems like an odd strategy. 
 But in New Jersey's United States Senate contest, unlike any other major political race in the country, a convergence of unusual circumstances has transformed the Democratic primary into a race that has put the economic boom on trial.
 Jon S. Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, has swathed himself in the flag of prosperity, asserting that his work on Wall Street helped New Jersey companies create and retain hundreds of thousands of jobs. If elected to the Senate, Mr. Corzine says, he will use his business acumen to spread that wealth to the poor by offering a banquet of expansive social programs.
Those arguments have prompted his opponent, former Gov. Jim Florio, to warn voters that a dark cloud has been obscured by the economic silver lining. On issues ranging from Social Security and pension financing to corporate mergers, trade policy and government borrowing, Mr. Florio has hammered his opponent with the kind of class-based attacks Democrats usually aim at Republicans.
He has accused Wall Street titans of raking in billions in profits at the expense of poor and working-class Americans, and has blamed Goldman, Sachs for underwriting corporate mergers that cost more than 75,000 Americans their jobs under Mr. Corzine's leadership.
Mr. Florio has also cautioned voters not to let Wall Street's blazing performance in recent years lure them into accepting the Clinton administration's proposal to invest some Social Security money in the stock market, an initiative Mr. Corzine supports.
Such a plan would result in billions of dollars in investment fees for Wall Street firms, Mr. Florio argues, but leave low-income retirees at the mercy of volatile market fluctuations.
"Every week, you hear stories about economic disparities in this boom period, with more and more people in the top end doing better and people in the lower end doing worse in terms of purchasing power," Mr. Florio said.
At the heart of the exchanges are two starkly different visions of the economy and the Democratic Party.
Mr. Corzine (pronounced kore-ZYNE) is convinced that the economic expansion has brought benefits to enough people that his Wall Street resume will inspire confidence in working-class voters. Mr. Florio believes that the Democratic Party's traditional base in New Jersey -- factory workers, union stewards, minimum-wage employees and retirees -- is inherently wary of the rich.
James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said the race was a test case of how prosperity may have shifted the political landscape within the Democratic Party.
"It's really a question of new economy versus old economy," Dr. Hughes said. "What proportion of new economy workers, information economy workers, financial services employees, the people benefiting from the boom are going to vote in a Democratic primary?"
Leaders of the national Democratic and Republican Parties have debated whether Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton deserves credit for the soaring economy.
Candidates like Hillary Rodham Clinton have occasionally suggested that some pockets of the country, like upstate New York, have not shared equally in the boom. But no one has critiqued the economy's performance as directly, or as harshly, as Mr. Florio, said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia.
Robert H. Frank, a Cornell professor who has written extensively about the inequities and excesses of the 1990's, said Mr. Florio's argument may be a tough sell to voters.
"I can't think of any other candidate out there arguing against the boom," Dr. Frank said. "The Republicans aren't going to come out against an economy that has benefited their supporters, the rich. For Democrats, there is a case that Florio is making. But why make that case when you can just say we're responsible for greatest economic expansion of all time?"
It is somewhat surprising that such an appeal is being attempted in a place as prosperous as New Jersey. The state's per capita income -- $35,559 in 1998 -- is the second-highest in the nation.
Nearly 60 percent of New Jersey households have an interest in the stock market, either directly or through 401k plans or mutual funds. And the state's high-tech and pharmaceutical industries have expanded rapidly in recent years, helping drive the unemployment rate down to just 4.1 percent.
Nonetheless, some recent polls suggest that the boom has not completely erased New Jersey voters' suspicion of powerful establishments.
"Democrats are distrustful of big institutions, like big business, even if people are doing well financially," said Clifford Zukin, a Rutgers political science professor who heads the university's polling institute. "So in a Democratic primary, it makes some sense to rail against big money."
In many ways, the economic platform embraced by each candidate has been shaped by strategic necessity. Mr. Corzine, a political neophyte, has little choice but to maintain that his business triumphs are a harbinger of success in the Senate.
Mr. Florio left office in 1994, a year before most New Jerseyans began to fully feel the end of the recession, so it would be difficult for him to claim credit for the state's resurgence. Mr. Florio's campaign resources are also dwarfed by Mr. Corzine's $300 million fortune (and his pledge to spend as much as necessary to win).
So the former governor has blasted Mr. Corzine's costly advertising appeals in hopes that "free media," newspapers and television, will convey his message to voters.
What has emerged is a series of increasingly heated disagreements about economic disparity and the corrosive power of wealth that at times seem more at home in the Dust Bowl era than the Microsoft era.
On the day Mr. Corzine released his new television commercials this month, campaign officials for Mr. Florio held a news conference in which a prominent supporter ominously suggested that Mr. Corzine's fortune might actually be worth more than $1 billion.
"There are 450 billionaires in the U.S.," warned the supporter, Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., a Democrat from Paterson. "And if they fan out across the country, they can consume all of the congressional districts."
Mr. Corzine has tried to counter Mr. Florio's appeals to class resentment by pointing out his working-class roots. He also contends that the campaign is not about Wall Street, but about the ability to understand and shape a rapidly changing economy. "I think Jim Florio is just out of touch with where the economy of the U.S. is in this day and age," Mr. Corzine said.
In a recent advertising campaign, Mr. Corzine claimed some credit for job growth in recent years, stating that during his stewardship of Goldman, Sachs, the company's investments helped New Jersey companies create or retain 700,000 jobs.
Mr. Florio ridiculed that assertion, saying it was absurd for an investment banker to take credit for jobs created by his borrowers. Many political analysts also characterized Mr. Corzine's ads as exaggerations.
But Mr. Corzine maintains that the ads are technically accurate and that their message is that he learned to direct capital to areas where it can spur economic development. He said he would use that expertise in the Senate by pushing for an urban redevelopment bank to encourage business growth in inner cities and by proposing bountiful subsidies for health care, preschool, long-term care and college education.
Mr. Corzine also blames Mr. Florio for New Jersey's economic stagnation in the early 1990's, saying the governor's decision to push a $2.8 billion tax increase through the Legislature in 1990 scared off businesses, fueled unemployment and contributed to his being voted out of office.
"You can't argue that it was going to be a generator of business to New Jersey," Mr. Corzine said. "It had a deleterious impact."
Mr. Florio, whose tax increase was enacted to pay for court-ordered increases in school financing, dismisses those criticisms as the naive quibbling of someone who has never had to make a tough political decision.
Mr. Florio also contends that his long career in state politics has made him singularly attuned to the worries of New Jersey families. Mr. Florio cited several recent studies that show the gap between New Jersey's rich and poor widening.
As he makes campaign appearances at countless centers for the elderly, union halls and kaffeeklatsches, Mr. Florio says he is frequently surprised at the deep concern many New Jerseyans have about their long-term financial security.
Mr. Florio is scheduled to release an economic position paper early next month. Drafts of the document call for tax cuts aimed at certain segments of the population, money for worker retraining and trade sanctions against countries that do not uphold environmental and labor standards. But thus far, most of the economic debate in the campaign has been a critique of Mr. Corzine's ideas and Wall Street resume.
Jon Shure, whose liberal research organization, New Jersey Policy Perspective, has released several studies about economic disparity in the state, said it was heartening to hear any political candidate making Mr. Florio's call for economic justice. But Mr. Shure, who was Mr. Florio's communications director but is not involved in his Senate campaign, also warned that those people left behind by the boom also constitute the segment of the population least likely to bother voting.
Mr. Florio says he is undaunted.
"No one ever accused me of taking the easy way," he said. "But that's what leadership is about. Talking about important things that many people aren't yet ready to address."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about the campaign of former Gov. Jim Florio for the Democrats' Senate nomination in New Jersey misstated the pronunciation of the surname of his opponent, Jon S. Corzine. (An article on Sept. 24, 1999, also included the error.) The pronunciation is COR-zyne, not cor-ZYNE.

HEADLINE: SHOPPING;
An Internet Dummy Logs On for a Comparative Adventure

BYLINE: By BRIAN ALEXANDER; Brian Alexander contributes to Wired and other publications.

 BODY:
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN thinks that shopping online is so vital to America's prosperity that it should be tax free. Until now, I had shirked my patriotic duty. I had never shopped online. When I confessed this, people reacted the way women at Vogue magazine would react if someone mispronounced "Manolo Blahnik."
To avoid being labeled a misfit and to help keep our national economic engine humming, I jumped at the chance to shop on the Web for things I really needed and wanted. I then compared online and real-world shopping experiences by buying the same items the old-fashioned way. 
I kept score by price, time and frustration level (a 0 is no frustration; 3 is highest), and included driving time when judging real store shopping. To be fair, I should admit a few things. First, I am biased toward interacting with real people rather than sitting at home with my computer and credit card. So if the scores for the real stores and the online stores were close, I favored the real stores. Second, there is a learning curve to shopping online. My early purchases proved more frustrating than later ones. For example, it took hours for me to realize that typing a fairly common word into a search engine was hopeless. A search for "modems" generated a list of more than a million Web pages.
Third, regardless of where I shopped on the Internet, I was continually assaulted by DoubleClick advertisements; requests for "cookies"; warnings about my Netscape security certificate lapsing (whatever that means); windows upon windows alerting me to a "Java Script Error" (whatever that means); and my favorite: "This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down." I half- expected Eliot Ness to burst through my door. (I also learned to click "O.K." or "Continue" and keep my fingers crossed.)
Finally, my perception was also influenced by the fact that my computer is almost five years old. It has a 75-megahertz processor and 16 megabytes of memory. The modem is a 14.4K. I have made coffee while waiting for sites to download. In Silicon Valley's view, this means I should buy a new computer.
 
Modem
Instead of replacing my computer, however, I hijacked my wife's laptop and beefed it up with a new 56K modem. After two hours of ineffective searching, I found the 3Com Web site and selected a 56K V.90 Wintel modem card. The purchase took 20 minutes, only because I read the 14-paragraph legal document headed "Contract" and the privacy statement that said, essentially, there was no such thing as privacy. I paid $133.81, including tax and shipping.
The modem arrived three days early. Installing it was tricky, so I added 25 penalty minutes for consulting a technician by phone, plus 10 minutes for the moment he said, "Man, I give this a 2-to-1 shot of ever working."
It worked, finally, but did not increase the laptop's speed because of its limited memory. I returned to my own digital jalopy.
Shopping at a real store for the same type of modem was even more frustrating. I drove to Radio Shack, Circuit City and Staples. None stocked the modem. Circuit City had an Actiontec for $99.99; with tax, $107.75.
WINNER -- Online shopping.
TOTAL TIME -- Two and a half hours.
TOTAL COST -- $133.81, including tax and shipping.
FRUSTRATION -- 2.
THE RETURN -- 3Com accepted the return without a hitch and promised to credit my charge card, but I had to pay to ship the modem back.
 
Prosciutto
Two hours into my search for prosciutto, I knew more about Parma, Italy, home of arguably the best prosciutto in the world, but had failed to order any of the ham. I did find Muscovy duck prosciutto. At last I settled for Serrano ham, a Spanish prosciutto, from Dean & Deluca, in New York. That site was easy to use, and the ham arrived in two days, on time, packed in an ice chest. But I paid $47.21 (yikes!), including shipping, for one pound.
Prosciutto was simple to find at the Italian deli a couple of miles from my house. The guy behind the counter had suggested San Daniele, for only $19.95 a pound. No shipping.
WINNER -- The store.
TOTAL TIME -- 20 minutes.
TOTAL COST -- $19.95.
FRUSTRATION -- None.
THE RETURN -- Dean & Deluca would accept the return of the meat if it was unopened, but I would have to pay shipping. The deli would not accept the return of perishable food.
 
Termite Stakes
I have been fighting a chemical war with termites for two years. So I clicked onto an America Online shopping link for HomeTownStores.com, an online hardware store. The site required that I register and select a password, which I immediately forgot. When I searched for "termite" I found termite paper and termite shields. I had no idea what they did, and the site did not tell me. I scrolled down and found termite stakes, which are placed in the ground around the house to kill termite colonies. I ordered and paid $67.37, including shipping.
Unfortunately, the stakes arrived almost a week later than promised, but they weren't stakes. The box, in fact, contained four washing-machine hoses. Somewhere there is a guy in dirty clothes holding 20 termite stakes.
Home Depot stocked the Terminate brand stakes, charging only $49 for 20.
WINNER -- The store.
TOTAL TIME -- 35 minutes.
TOTAL COST -- $52.60, with tax.
FRUSTRATION -- 2 (I forgot where I had parked my car).
THE RETURN -- Easy at Home Depot, except for the long line at the return counter. I paid to ship the hoses back to HomeTownStores.com, and it promised to credit my account.
 
Toaster Oven
Several months after my wife and I moved into our house, we realized, thanks to the oven door's exploding open, that the gas ignition was not working properly. Last month, the handle on our toaster fell off. So we decided to buy a countertop toaster oven, solving two problems at once.
First we tried the Yahoo Kitchen and Home site. We chose a DeLonghi convection toaster oven for $179.95, which was at least $100 more than I had expected to pay, but it was Italian and sounded sexy, so we got it.
The next day I received an e-mail message saying that the company was out of the ovens. That same morning, however, I had seen an advertisement in a newspaper for a site called Tavolo.com. I typed in the Web address, the site popped up, I searched for DeLonghi ovens, and there they were. Unlike other sites, Tavolo offered the option of not registering an account with passwords and other information. I liked that. The oven was also $179.95, so I bought it. With tax, I paid $193.04. Tavolo did not charge for shipping. The oven showed up three days later, as promised. A week later, Tavolo .com sent me free jam and chocolate candy.
I drove to a local Williams-Sonoma store and quickly found the same oven. It was also $179.95. With tax, it would be $193.90.
WINNER -- A tie. Tavolo was easy and took less time, but I liked the saleswoman at Williams-Sonoma, who showed me how to use the oven.
TOTAL TIME -- One hour for Williams-Sonoma; 15 minutes for Tavolo.com.
TOTAL COST -- $193.90.
FRUSTRATION -- 1.
THE RETURN -- Both items were simple to return. Williams-Sonoma's policy is unconditional, as is Tavolo's. Tavolo will have the appliance picked up under most circumstances. No charge for shipping, though I was unable to make my computer print out the no-postage coupon Tavolo sent by e-mail. On second try, Tavolo faxed the coupon to me.
 
Coffee
My wife and I buy our coffee at a warehouse store. It is not great coffee, but it is about $8 for two pounds of whole beans, a deal. I figured that the Web might offer better coffee at a good price and that I might be able to subscribe to a service that would ship coffee to my door every month.
Many sites sell coffee, but few offer regular home delivery. Then I found E-Java.com. It offered a choice of three coffees, each in 12-ounce bags to be delivered monthly. I ordered Vienna Roast, Guatemala Antigua and French Roast. Including shipping, I paid $24.49 for the three bags, or 36 ounces. I also got a friendly e-mail message confirming the order, and when the coffee arrived on time two days later, the box included two samples as well as coffee candy.
Because the site did not sell the cut-rate beans I was after, I compared the E-Java.com deal with what was available at a local gourmet roaster. The shop sold beans by the pound. Vienna Roast, French Roast and Guatemala beans were $10 a pound each; 48 ounces cost $30, no tax.
WINNER -- A close call, but the store was cheaper.
TOTAL TIME -- 40 minutes.
TOTAL COST -- $30.
FRUSTRATION -- 2. (I got caught in traffic and realized I could not afford good coffee from either source.)
THE RETURN -- E-Java would accept the return and credit my account, but I would have to pay the shipping costs. The roaster did not accept returns.
 
Book
When I told people I had never bought anything online, they responded, "Not even a book?" So I clicked onto Amazon.com.
I considered buying "Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology," by Neil Postman, a techno-skeptic and cultural critic.
Ready to click the buy button, I recalled all the people who had considered me a rube. I also thought of John McCain and my nation's economy. So I raised a white flag and ordered "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Internet Shopping" for $18.43, including shipping. It arrived two days later, on time.
I then drove to a large bookstore, but the book was out of stock. The store could order it in four or five days for $18.26, including tax, but I would have to pick it up.
WINNER -- Amazon.com.
TOTAL TIME -- 10 minutes.
TOTAL COST -- $18.43.
FRUSTRATION -- 1. (I took a point off for the brief identity crisis I suffered upon re-entering the site: "Hello, Brian Alexander! If you are not Brian Alexander, click here.")
THE RETURN -- I paid the shipping costs to return the book to Amazon.com. The store would accept returns if the book was in its original condition.
 
Postscript
One week after my shopping excursion, I bowed to the inevitable and ordered a 700 MHz computer at the Hewlett-Packard Web site. I am also signing up for a digital subscriber line. Now let them smirk.

HEADLINE: SHOPPING;
Nobody Pays Retail, but the Real Bargains May Fade Away

BYLINE: By STACY KRAVETZ; Stacy Kravetz covers business issues from Los Angeles.

 BODY:
COME on, admit it. Who does not love getting a deal, no matter how much it costs?
Marketers depend on consumers' desires to go after deals, even for things we would never buy without a dollar-off coupon. Online retailers are equally savvy, offering all types of discounts for shopping on their sites. The fact is that online discounts are much like their real-store counterparts: they lure us in, get us to spend more than we planned and send us home reassured that we got a bargain. 
 Keep this in mind: Online retailers are not charities. Even Web sites will need to make money some day.
To be sure, there have been bona fide deals, especially around the recent holidays. In December, for instance, many sites offered free shipping and deep discounts that undercut prices at their very own brick-and-mortar stores.
But as post-holiday reality set in, discounts reverted to more typical forms: most were 9 percent to 16 percent off the regular price, but many retailers compensated with costly shipping and handling, or by charging fees for returns. Retailers make higher profits on shipping charges than on merchandise.
Some sites make comparison shopping arduous by forcing you to click through multiple screens to find out what a sweater really costs, all told, with tax, shipping and handling. Retailers hope you will invest so much time that you will go ahead and make the purchase, discounted or not.
In case that makes you want to head for the malls, here are some of the newest players in the online retail contest: sites that help you get a good deal at other sites.
* Reverse auctions. Sites like priceline .com, buyersedge.com and liquidprice.com have popularized the concept of searching for a retailer to match the price you are willing to pay. Often such sites automatically charge the item to your credit card if a retailer agrees to your price (so you had better want it). Others allow retailers to bid against each other until one prevails with the lowest price.
* Group purchasing. Buytogether.com, mercata.com and accompany.com gather buyers who are interested in the same product and offer a group discount. The price goes down as more buyers enter the group until a specified deadline.
* Online coupons. Hotcoupons.com and clickrewards.com, among other sites, give you incentives ranging from frequent-flier miles to online coupons for local stores.
Then there are sites that help you navigate through the discount jungle. Most people do not even know they exist. A study of 5,831 online shoppers revealed that only 34 percent were aware of sites that compare prices, according to Forrester Research, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.
Price-comparison sites will sift through discounters when you specify the item you want. Automated shopping robots, or bots, like mysimon.com and hotbot.com, scan the Web for the lowest price on the item. Pricing engines like dealtime.com, bottomdollar .com, deals.com and pricegrabber.com list online retailers who carry the item and offer merchant ratings and delivery information.
Other sites, like bizrate.com, offer rating systems that evaluate an online retailer's prices, promptness of delivery and shipping charges.
All this assistance, however, does not necessarily mean that there are great deals to be had. Experts say, for example, that the bargains carry costs of their own.
DAVID COOPERSTEIN, the director of online retail research at Forrester, says that by and large, Web discounters are worth looking at when you are buying an item that costs a few hundred dollars or more. If you can save 5 percent by shopping comparatively for 15 minutes, it is usually worthwhile.
But consider the trade-offs.
Time, for instance. How long does it take to find a good price, and how long until delivery? Do you really want a weeklong delay for a Zip disk drive to travel via ground transport just because the out-of-state purchase allows you to skirt sales tax?
Some online retailers offer a good deal if you are willing to give information about yourself and do not mind having your name circulating among marketers. You can get anything from rebates to a free mouse pad for filling out customer surveys and product registration information.
If you like your privacy, you should save your money another way.
"Retailers make consumers choose," Mr. Cooperstein said. "To get discounts you have to give some data or spend your time researching."
Web shopping is no place for suckers. The discounting sites shout at you with bold colors and spinning logos, prodding you to jump at the low, low prices. Some retailers pay to advertise on price comparison sites, fooling you into thinking that their price is the best. Sometimes deep discounts are real, albeit temporary -- meant to build loyalty and subliminally lure you to buy full-price items later.
"Sites in the health- and beauty-aids business may offer incredible discounts on over-the-counter items to hook you so you'll come back to buy more expensive items," said Alan Alper, an analyst with Gomez Advisors in Lincoln, Mass.
Brand-name items, like the Sony Walkman or the Apple iMac, are less likely to have wide swings in prices, whether online or in a retail store.
If you do not care about buying a brand name, your chances of finding a deep discount are greater. Your chances of being enormously confused are, unfortunately, also greater, because your searches will turn up hundreds of choices.
Online shopping, of course, is in its infancy. It has the potential to offer one-stop shopping through sites that can build profiles for shoppers to be used to troll the Web for sales, deals and new online retailers that will match shoppers' exact specifications.
That is still a leap into the future. But one thing is certain. For people who seek a deal, Internet shopping provides one more way to persuade themselves that they have found one.

HEADLINE: Is Anybody Not Out for E-Billions? Josie True, for One

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
JOSIE TRUE, a Chinese-American cartoon girl in an online game, hunts for her missing teacher by time-traveling. Along the way, she strikes up conversations with little-known historical heroines like Bessie Coleman, the first African-American to earn an international pilot's license.
Unlike most Web-based action games, which generally interest boys, "The Adventures of Josie True" is designed to appeal to girls' interests in characters and narratives. In sly fashion, Josie also introduces players to role models absent from most history books, while increasing their computer fluency. 
 "This is not a moneymaking scheme," said Mary Flanagan, an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Buffalo, who is developing the game with a grant of $199,920 from the National Science Foundation. Her concern is the lack of educational software aimed at girls, particularly minority girls.
Tapping this overlooked market, Ms. Flanagan thought, could help solve a stubborn gender gap. Girls still take fewer advanced computer-science classes than boys and are more likely to shy away from careers like engineering, said a 1998 report by the American Association of University Women. Part of the reason, the report said, was that boys play computer games more than girls and enter classrooms far more comfortable with computers.
"It's a software developer's dream to do something you're committed to," said Ms. Flanagan, who hired graduate students to finish the online game (www.buffalo.edu /scripts/newnews/index.cgi?article =theadventu) by the end of this year. For schools and girls without Web access, Ms. Flanagan intends to produce CD-ROM's.
With modest government assistance and a passion for closing the digital gender gap, Ms. Flanagan is demonstrating how the Internet can be an egalitarian tool for self-expression. The site, like other noncommercial sites being developed around the United States, is intended to be an example of high-minded goals that have not been eclipsed by the cacophony of e-commerce.
Without millions of dollars of investors' money to buy mass-market advertising, noncommercial sites, especially ones catering to untapped or underserved sectors, face an uphill battle as they try to gather like-minded audiences from the far corners of cyberspace. But such efforts are far from a lost cause.
"It's not different from any other medium," said Ekaterina Walsh, a consumer analyst for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. Compared with slickly packaged Web content for mass audiences, original and unadorned sites are a breath of fresh air that gain word-of-mouth (or e-mail) credibility "in the same way NPR and PBS stand out on radio and TV," Ms. Walsh said.
And developers of noncommercial sites can salve their dot-com envy with a patina of respect. Research shows that consumers are more likely to trust nonprofit sites than commercial ones, Ms. Walsh said.
Unable to penetrate popular culture through radio and television advertisements, some developers of noncommercial sites have resorted to grass-roots efforts to build an audience, particularly among those without Internet connections. This approach can be successful when the audience itself ends up being the supplier of low-cost content.
For example, in public libraries in Newark, Harlem and Melbourne, Australia, youngsters are dabbling at a test site, www.kahootz.com.au, where they can create and publish animated stories and inventions online, then "chat" about their work.
At a recent tryout of the site in Newark, schoolchildren on two continents showed off their child-centric creations: a homework helper and a dirt-to-food machine. "We're creating a channel for interactive design to stimulate girls and kids who don't have computers at home, to get them to start thinking of themselves as designers and inventors," said Dorothy T. Bennett, the project director of the Education Development Center for Children and Technology, which is developing the site with the Children's Television Foundation in Australia.
Another grass-roots project has already drawn participation from nearly 1,000 children in 139 countries. Their contributions filled an online bulletin board devoted to how young people believe technology can improve the world. The first Web site, www.jrsummit.net, spawned a second, www.nation1.org. The project began with professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab, who contacted education officials around the world to attract young people to participate.
"It's all about bringing underrepresented groups online," said Justine Cassell, a Media Lab professor who was one of the program's organizers and is a co-editor of the book "From Barbie to Mortal Kombat: Gender and Computer Games."
Another approach to reaching such an overlooked audience comes from Oakland, Calif., the eighth-largest city in the state. Pummeled by the 1989 earthquake and a catastrophic fire in 1994, the city is struggling to make an economic comeback, particularly in East and West Oakland, which are characterized by a mix of stately but aging Victorian houses, boarded-up storefronts and few commercial services, like supermarkets and bank branches.
"For the underserved communities to move to the served category," the community, not corporations, will have to create the content, said David Geilhufe, the director of the Eastmont Computing Center in Oakland, where 350 people receive computer training financed by the National Science Foundation.
This version of urban renewal is aimed at compressing the digital divide in poorer neighborhoods without typically putting computers in every classroom. Instead, the city and its philanthropic partners are counting on the virtual world to provide banking services that are unavailable to many residents in the community. The cost of developing an e-banking service in this market, about $300,000, with investment payback expected to be slow, is being shared by four lenders led by Union Bank of California.
"We'll mobilize and test and pull people into it," said Donald Vial, the chairman of the California Foundation on the Environment and Economy, a nonprofit group in San Francisco. Starting in May, about 200 people will use the service, which will be offered at five community technology centers, among them Eastmont.
Participants will receive training in computers and household financial management and learn how to navigate an e-banking site that will be customized for language and culture, said Norman Jayo, the foundation's senior strategist.
E-banking has the potential to show people that technology can make a difference in their lives, whether by helping a small business grow or helping someone on welfare to find a job, he said.
A goal of Oakland's e-banking site is to show lenders and other Web businesses that demand exists in neighborhoods being bypassed by e-commerce. "When the application is significant to them, it takes off," Mr. Jayo said. "It's using technology as a base for empowerment."

HEADLINE: NEXT NEW ERA;
For the Small Retailer, Life on the Internet Is One Big Bazaar

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER 

 BODY:
WHEN GeniusBabies.com, a fledgling business owned by Michelle Donahue-Arpas, joined the giant online mall Yahoo Stores last April, its sales doubled a month later and reached $20,000 a month by November.
But if Yahoo has served Ms. Donahue-Arpas well -- with a 95 percent customer approval rating she is a featured merchant -- she knows she should expand her horizons. 
 "Yahoo giveth and Yahoo can taketh away," she said, referring to the "featured merchant" designation, which raises the profile of her business, a seller of educational and developmental toys for babies and toddlers.
As a small fish swimming in a very big pond, Ms. Donahue-Arpas, like other small retailers, must make careful decisions about how to expand her company. In such a world, it would be easy to be overwhelmed, overshadowed or swallowed up if she is not careful.
With a growing number of shopping platforms from which small businesses can choose, a free-for-all is developing in online retailing. Portal shopping centers are offering an increasing number of services like gift registries, price-comparison tools and reviews to lure consumers while bolstering their base of merchants by making it easy to set up and run an online store. Amazon.com has opened an Internet bazaar it calls zShops, and a growing number of companies known as e-business service providers are offering retailers free tools to establish and maintain online stores with them.
Each alternative has advantages and disadvantages for merchants, and no clear answers have emerged about the best way to go.
"Most retailers are still unclear on how to do it and, more importantly, who to do it with," said Kneko Burney, director of markets and computing at Cahners In-Stat Group, a research group in Scottsdale, Ariz. "The big hurdle for them is building a Web presence that makes sense and making it known."
In-Stat estimates that 60 percent of the small companies in the United States have Web sites and about 80 percent use the Internet, but few do an effective job of selling products or services online.
"There are a lot of platforms that offer a quick fix for big bucks," said Sue Schwartz, who developed YarnXpress.com, which sells specialty yarns, with the help of an e-business service provider called Freemerchant.com. "It's really 'Let the buyers beware,' " she said, referring to the merchants.
Yet if caution is in order, analysts think there is also opportunity. Seema Williams of Forrester Research, which analyzes e-commerce, observed, "A bit of a free-for-all is actually a good thing," opening up options for small retailers. It is important to remember where interests lie.
For example, she noted, Amazon.com is foremost a store, and its interests will come first. Shopping portals like Yahoo, which is not a retailer, will always have more allegiance to their big-name merchants, who pay more money to be on the site.
The bottom line is that small merchants must look out for themselves, getting their names out in any way possible and using resources as long as they are cost-effective.
Ms. Schwartz, of YarnXpress, could not agree more. She said she was pleased with the set-up features offered by Freemerchant.com, but played down the links it provided to search engines as a way of generating business. More valuable, she said, was the link to eBay, which led to the sales on which she built her business. Rather than pay to put her business on established sites, she has used other strategies, including starting an online group for knitters and advertising in a knitting magazine.
Freemerchant sees itself as giving small businesses "a techno grub stake," offering free site construction, free hosting and back-office support like inventory control and sales-tax calculation. But it stops short of being a shopping destination.
By contrast, online malls and portal shopping centers have the benefit of traffic and built-in name recognition that can give an instant lift to a merchant. While the cost of aligning with some of these sites remains prohibitively high, other sites are lowering monthly fees and offering business-related services.
AltaVista, for example, is adding a variety of direct-marketing capabilities to its Shopping.com service while plugging more stores -- large and small -- into the search and product listings areas.
But such a relationship costs a few thousand dollars a month, more than what many small retailers can afford. In addition, analysts said, the big shopping sites' focus on comparison shopping, particularly regarding price, is not often advantageous for small retailers, who will be undercut by larger merchandisers.
At Yahoo, whose goal is to be the leading shopping site on the Web, Jennifer Dulski, a brand manager for Yahoo Shopping, which includes Yahoo Stores, said services were geared to buyers as well as sellers. Yahoo Shopping, which includes 9,500 stores and an auction, offers tools to merchants to help them establish and manage Web sites. The cost is about $100 a month to post 50 items, but rises from there.
In late September, Amazon.com introduced zShops, which offers merchants the chance to list their stores for $9.99 a month. Amazon can process credit-card orders for an additional 2.25 percent of the total sale. Merchants can also take advantage of Amazon's one-click shopping feature, which allows consumers to store their shipping and credit-card information in a database.
Ms. Williams, a senior analyst with Forrester Research, said that while Amazon would provide a retailer with traffic for a while, "the worry is, you're going to lose your category if Amazon decides to offer your product."
Still, linking with a site that has a customer base of 17 million people is enticing. "I believe the people who have the financial resources to advertise their Web site or latch on to those who can advertise for them are the ones that are going to be successful," said John Arnold, a customer service manager with the Pacific Cookie Company in Santa Cruz, Calif.
PACIFIC COOKIE has established a Web presence mainly through partnerships in which it provides goods to sites wholesale but pays nothing up front. It began with sites like Greatfood.com, and then established relationships with entities like Givechocolate.com, a gift site.
When approached by Amazon about joining zShops, Pacific Cookie readily agreed. "We haven't seen a lot of orders from them," Mr. Arnold said, "but just to be on a site like Amazon we thought was worth the cost we were putting forward."
Pacific Cookie will not stop there. By this summer, Mr. Arnold said, the company will be listed on about 10 shopping platforms, most of which cost the company nothing.
By contrast, Bryan Matthews, who sells antique books in Los Angeles, has stuck mostly to putting his books on databases. Although he said he was approached daily by online virtual malls to join their sites, he has gone with zShops because of his longstanding relationship with Amazon.com.
Instead, Mr. Matthews is investing his time and energy in developing the first online cooperative of booksellers, which he thinks will protect his business interests in the long run.
"It will let people know there are all these independent booksellers and turn them away from the brands and the big platforms," he said. "We want to let buyers know they are better off dealing with personalities. We're the ones that have the books."

HEADLINE: Behind 'Name Your Own Price' Lies a Mesh of Partners

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn.

 BODY:
PRICELINE.COM does not even look like your normal dot-com company. Its headquarters are not in Silicon Valley, but in a suburban office park. Instead of 20-somethings in jeans and T-shirts with long hair and short resumes, many of its inhabitants are gray-haired recruits from companies like Citigroup and AT&T. Some wear neat, casual clothes, while others wear suits.
Looks are not deceiving. For all its e-commerce, new-economy credentials, Priceline wants to be a member of the Old World corporate club. Instead of battling older, more traditional companies, Jay S. Walker, its 46-year-old founder and largest shareholder, and his lieutenants have turned them into partners and allies. If he does well, he says, so will Delta Airlines, American Airlines, AT&T, A&P, D'Agostino's, Pathmark, the National and Budget car rental companies and the Ford Motor Company. 
 "We don't compete against these companies," Mr. Walker said at his office. "We don't seek to own an airline. We don't seek to be a car dealer. We don't seek to be a grocery store. We don't seek to be a phone company. We seek to improve the profitability of our partners rather than cannibalize it."
Instead of conducting auctions with rising bids, Priceline allows a buyer to propose a price that the seller, whether of airline tickets or orange juice, can choose to accept or reject. Translated into Pricelinese, this approach comes out as the slogan "Name Your Own Price."
For all Priceline's establishment stripes, what Mr. Walker has in mind is more radical than eBay, pushing a strategy that is becoming more important throughout e-commerce: partnerships.
More and more, when customers call up a Web site, they see a single entrance to a structure made up of many businesses in a tangle of alliances and subsidies. Entrepreneurs like Mr. Walker concentrate on what they do best, finding partners for everything else.
"We distribute prices, not products," Mr. Walker said, his bushy eyebrows rising and falling for emphasis.
Priceline, he said, is demonstrating how the Web can introduce a new series of relationships between seller and buyer. "You can't wheel a grocery cart down the aisle and have AT&T say, 'You know what? I'll pay for all the meat in your grocery cart if you'll try our long-distance service for 7 cents a minute.' The Net allows for far richer, far more customized, instantaneously creative partnering."
In general, Priceline's target is not the customer who wants favorite grocery brands delivered to the door, who wants to fly direct flights at reasonable hours and stay in favorite hotels. All those desires are served well by other companies and Web sites. Priceline targets the bargain hunter.
Stores like Wal-Mart manage to offer low prices partly by using their size to win special breaks from their suppliers. Mr. Walker does not. He wants sellers to have the flexibility to lower their prices, then raise them. "We do not use our size to try to extract concessionary prices," he said. "Sellers like us because they can use us to balance supply and demand in a constantly changing business."
But isn't Mr. Walker dishing out some unrealistic bargains? Yes, he said, at least for now. "The model in every business is subsidize first to build traffic," he said. "Every business spends money to acquire customers. It's every grand-opening sale that has ever existed."
Analysts like Henry Blodget, at Merrill Lynch, remain optimistic about Priceline's prospects, but they also wonder what will happen when the grand-opening sale ends. "The question is what happens when the discounts narrow and the consumers won't be getting such a great deal," Mr. Blodget said.
Mr. Walker said that Priceline will be able to sustain attractive discounts. Bidding and buying through Priceline, he said, can involve a deal with up to five parties: Priceline, the customer, a retailer like a grocery store, a manufacturer or a service provider, and the provider of an unrelated service like long-distance calling or credit cards or magazine subscriptions. The issuer of Discover cards, for instance, will add $30 to Priceline customers' bids for airline tickets if they apply for the cards. Another $5 from Discover goes to Priceline.
The corporate partners are so important to Mr. Walker that he often identifies them, not his online buyers, as his true market, as when he said, "We're not here to compete with our customers."
His office seems like a shrine to those partners-cum-customers. Against an incongruous background of bookshelves filled with leather-bound classics, he displays dozens of packages -- Cheerios, Dove soap, Joy dishwashing detergent -- and model jets.
So strong is Mr. Walker's belief in his strategy's distinctiveness that he has taken out several patents, recorded on plaques that line a Priceline.com hallway, to protect his business processes. He has sued Microsoft, maintaining that it has infringed on Priceline, a contention Microsoft strongly disputes.
Whether this strategy will benefit consumers or investors once consumers exhaust their specials and Wall Street starts demanding profits is unclear.
So far, Wall Street's passion remains strong. Though Lauren Cooks Levitan, an analyst at Robertson Stephens, raises questions about how many industries will be receptive to Mr. Walker's approach, she praises the concept. "I think Jay stands apart as a real visionary," she said. "He isn't just trying to shift market share online, but develop a whole new business model."
THE Priceline strategy has been applied to hotel rooms, rental cars, mortgages, groceries, new cars, castoff household appliances and, as announced just last month, gasoline, but it will not work everywhere. Given the opportunity to offer name-your-own-terms credit cards, many major issuers have balked, as have some large manufacturers.
Kraft Foods, a unit of Philip Morris and the nation's largest maker of packaged foods, has also balked. So for the time being, shoppers who want Kool-Aid, Jell-O, Post cereals, Maxwell House coffee, Kraft cheeses or Oscar Mayer hot dogs cannot order through Priceline. "We are not participating," said Moyra Knight, a spokeswoman for Kraft. "We just need a better understanding of their performance."
Airline tickets, the closest thing to a certifiable success for Priceline, have features that suit the company's strategy, a point Mr. Walker readily confirmed. Airlines have to unload a highly perishable inventory, seats that would otherwise be empty, at low prices, without sacrificing revenue from business travelers and others willing to pay high prices. Priceline allows the airlines to find travelers willing to accept inconvenient connections and departure times in return for a bargain.
Just as clothing stores do not usually post signs telling shoppers about their outlets, airlines do not play up their Priceline partnerships. American Airlines, for example, refused to comment.
But other partners see so many benefits, and so few risks, that they are happy to voice their praise. "The stores like it and the customers seem to be happy," said Nick D'Agostino III, a vice president at D'Agostino Supermarkets Inc. of New York. Priceline allows his stores to sell groceries over the Web at no extra cost to them, he said, because the manufacturers provide the discounts and the customers pick up the groceries themselves.
Mr. Walker came to his big idea in stages. As a student at Cornell University, he was sued by Parker Brothers to prevent him from publishing a guide to winning at Monopoly, and watched the weekly newspaper he started in Ithaca, N.Y., collapse under competition from a local daily owned by the Gannett Company chain. "As you become more experienced in business, you learn that picking a fight is usually the last thing you want to do," he said. "War is the ultimate failure of diplomacy."
When Priceline began operating in April 1998, inviting customers to propose prices for airline tickets, its diplomacy led to the signing of only two, relatively meek carriers: T.W.A. and America West. Securing major airlines as partners took money, in the form of Priceline shares. That summer, Delta Airlines agreed to sell its tickets on Priceline's Web site in return for, among other goodies, rights to buy millions of shares for nearly nothing. Other major airlines followed, with American and United also receiving Priceline stakes, although smaller. The total cost to Priceline -- if not in cash, in the ability to raise it -- is about $1 billion.
Analysts were understanding. "There is no way they could have primed the pump without doing that," Mr. Blodget said. Mr. Walker, saying that such concessions are not habit forming, said that he has not had to give equity stakes to any other partners.
And if Priceline initially subsidized the tickets, paying the airlines more than it was receiving from customers, the company is paying less now. Marketing expenses, including those television advertisements with the actor William Shatner, still leave Priceline with heavy but narrowing losses.
Will the strategy work? The results, so far, are unclear. But it is a strategy distinct from the backward-looking approaches to selling over the Web. "We're not just catalogs online," Mr. Walker said. "That's not the future of e-commerce."
 
Grocery-Service Novice Finds Bargains, but No Bananas
 MY first experience with Priceline.com's new Webhouse Club name-your-price grocery service could have been accompanied by its pitchman, William Shatner, singing, "Yes, We Have No Bananas."
I wanted to bid on bananas, but when I tried, I was insistently asked to apply electronic discount tokens to the purchase. I received six such tokens just for trying out the grocery site. But by the time I bought the bananas, I had applied the tokens to salmon and boneless, skinless chicken breasts -- more expensive items for which tokens meant greater savings.
My future savings would come mostly from the producers. I could obtain discount tokens by answering surveys, accepting free introductory subscriptions to magazines and the like.
For my visit, I had to sign up online for a Webhouse card, which I received in about two days via priority mail, but learned later that I could have picked up at a participating store. On the site, I was quoted the odds of successful bids. For a half-gallon of orange juice, the site gave a range of $2.19 to $2.79 (high, I thought), and said that at $1.95, I had an 85 percent chance of filling my order; at $1.82 a 66 percent chance, and so forth. I bid $1.82 for two half-gallons and got Tropicana, any variety.
Among my other successes were two pounds of salmon, a bargain $2.82 a pound, using the discount tokens (regularly about $4.99); skim milk at $1.50 a gallon, saving about $1, and six cups of Colombo yogurt, at 51 cents a cup (though I prefer Dannon).
At 7:30 on a Sunday night at the A&P in Montclair, N.J., one of several local stores that participate in Webhouse Club, I found that the fresh seafood had been removed from the counter 90 minutes earlier. Yes, we have no salmon. And the yogurt, normally 95 cents, was on sale at 4 for $2.
Having prepaid on the Web site, I presented my printed receipt at the checkout counter and swiped my Priceline Webhouse card. The receipt said I had three months to pick up my groceries, meaning I could return for the salmon. After that, the charges for any groceries I had not picked up would be credited to my card.
The bottom line was an hour on the Web site and a savings of $3.78, offset by not being able to buy all the groceries I had wanted. With practice, however, I could probably do my electronic shopping in 10 or 15 minutes.
And that Colombo yogurt was not bad. ALLEN R. MYERSON

HEADLINE: NEXT NEW ERA;
The New Economy's Currency Is Stock, Stock and Stock

BYLINE: By MARTHA BAER; Martha Baer is a senior contributing editor of Wired magazine.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
A BAY Area urologist treating a patient who works at an Internet start-up recently had an idea. For their next appointment, the urologist joked, he wanted to be paid in shares.
"Think of what the guy does all day, for a doctor's salary," the Internet executive said sympathetically. "Of course he wants to get into the game." 
 Like the bankers, lawyers and venture capitalists he reads about in the papers daily, the urologist wanted in on the action, and these days it seems that everyone but the doctor is welcome.
Today, hordes of business-to-business contractors who make deals with high-technology companies are trading their services for equity. While law firms have long taken slices of their clients' companies on top of regular fees, consultants are now doing the same, along with public relations agencies, executive search firms and commercial landlords. Even independent engineers and building contractors are participating in the equity swap meet.
"We're five for five," said Ed Niehaus, a cofounder of Niehaus Ryan Wong, a San Francisco public relations firm that serves technology-company clients. "We've taken cash plus shares as payment from five companies and have seen all five go public." A sixth company, spun off from one of the five, went bankrupt, but Yahoo and OnSale.com were among the group, according to an executive close to the deals.
For public relations agencies that work with high-technology ventures, the opportunities for such deals are rife. Because of a shortage of agencies that are expert in technology, firms like Niehaus Ryan Wong are picking and choosing whom they will work with and how they will be paid. And venture capitalists, or V.C.'s, warn start-ups that their business plans must incorporate publicity efforts, which sends 30 to 50 companies knocking on Niehaus's door every week, many offering stock.
All of which makes signing contracts with new clients resemble aggressive stock picking. "You're acting like a venture capitalist when you do this," Mr. Niehaus said.
Sunny Bates has placed about 20 such bets since she founded Sunny Bates Associates, an executive search firm, in New York 11 years ago. The firm serves high-techology companies and the news media. She said, "We've hit twice, once with Priceline and now with a company still in its quiet period.
"These sorts of deals not only help us develop the value of our company and get our recruiters involved," Ms. Bates continued, "but they also guarantee a different kind of relationship -- not a hit-and-run, but a mind-share involvement. If you're a stakeholder, you give freely of your introductions and your time, your contacts. You're not hoarding."
For recruiters, equity reimbursements often follow the same formula as cash fees. Search agencies have traditionally taken a third of the newly placed executive's first year's salary, but now that fee is combined with a third of the executive's first year's stock options. Stock deals can be complicated, however, and vary widely. Some require no vesting or "lock-up" period, so recipients can cash in the minute a company hits the public market. Some deals involve options and some warrants. Both represent the right to buy stock at a given price in the future. Warrants, however, tend to be subject to fewer tax and accounting rules and can be issued on a more ad hoc basis than options.
In real estate, where the equity-as-currency phenomenon is stirring up this fairly traditional industry, landlords are agreeing to take warrants in lieu of security deposits. A wildly competitive real estate market can give the landlords more discretion over tenants and how they can structure deals.
"Rents are going up on a biweekly basis in my area," said Ted Caulkins, an associate director of leasing services in San Francisco for Cushman & Wakefield, the international real estate brokerage firm. "A landlord usually has three to six offers, and it becomes a beauty contest. That's where the stock element gets very attractive."
Within the high-technology sector and other companies that are likely to go public, roughly half the deals Mr. Caulkins negotiates involve warrants or options.
Even in New York, where large, institutional landlords reign supreme, stock-for-space swaps are occurring in smaller niches. Rudin Management, which owns highly visible commercial properties like 55 Broad Street and 110 Wall Street in the financial district of Manhattan, has done four such deals. When Rudin Management negotiated with xBind, a networking-technology company, "we liked their business model," said William Rudin, the president. With Homedelivery.com, which accepts orders for local merchants through its Web site, Rudin Management saw other possible collaborations. "We own a lot of residential apartments in Manhattan, and Homedelivery.com's services can add value for our customers."
WHEN New York landlords and dot-coms start talking synergy, times have changed. Or have they?
"My grandfather's philosophy was to buy stock in a company that moved into his building," Mr. Rudin said. "It's a slight variation of the theme."
But buying stock in companies beyond your balance sheet is not the same as taking stock for pay. At Cushman & Wakefield, Thomas Falus, the president of the New York operations, does not favor the equity high-wire act.
"We're investing vast amounts of money in earnings to grow our business in China and South America," Mr. Falus said. "We can't afford not to be profitable in mature markets like New York." For him, playing the equity game with square footage is no better than playing the horses without knowing a thing about thoroughbreds.
Mr. Caulkins agreed that companies needed to do their homework. "These deals put the landlord in the position of a V.C.," he said.
Scott Jamar sang the same refrain: "I use the same criteria in negotiating with clients that a V.C. would use." A marketing consultant with 20 years' experience in high-tech businesses, Mr. Jamar has taken noncash payment to the next level by incorporating it into his business model. "It's become a core component of my strategy, to build a portfolio of equity in companies. Right now I have stock, or agreements to take stock, in four companies. I imagine over the next 12 to 18 months, I'll probably hold equity in 10 to 15 companies."
Because he works with early-stage start-up companies, Mr. Jamar asks for a minimum of their scarce cash and most of his compensation in options. But this risky ride suits him well, he said. "The new Jaguar convertible is going to have to wait for a while, but I don't feel like I'm selling myself short."
At this end of the spectrum -- where e-commerce companies are even cutting in one-man-show consultants who would otherwise be billing at $150 an hour -- the territory is relatively untested. "This is a brave new world for most independent contractors and their clients," said Michael Dortch, who has been following the high-technology industry as an independent research analyst for most of the last 25 years. "Think about it just on a logistical basis: companies tend to work with a lot of contractors; for each equity arrangement you've got to go before your board and write up a specific contract; no one has the time to manage that much overhead."
Still, that momentum is building. "Somewhere down the road," Mr. Dortch predicted, "forward thinking start-ups might build into their business plans classes of equity specifically for independent contractors."
So, does all this swapping portend a world in which every office temp and smoothie delivery person builds a portfolio of investments in the start-ups they serve?
Not exactly. While the equity flows between businesses and their contractors in ever larger quantities, plenty of young companies are clutching to their ownership, declaring their equity too valuable to hand off to outsiders.
Michael Hudes, the president of Organic Online, a Web company that builds sites and provides marketing services and that went public in February, held firm when potential landlords proposed that Mr. Hudes pay in equity. "If we gave equity to any number of partners who approached us, we'd have missed out on giving ownership to the people who matter most, our employees."
Todd Sotkeiwicz, the chief operating officer of Bigwords.com, an e-commerce retailer targeting the college market, is also careful. "A short-term relationship I would never pay for with equity," he said. "It's got to be really long term and really strategic."
In addition, after an initial offering, most companies become stingy. "When you get capitalized," said Isabel Maxwell, the president of CommTouch Software, a provider of e-mail services, "you're looking at mergers and acquisitions. You buy what you need. I doubt you'll find well-capped companies who would give away stock to small contractors."
But as long as word keeps spreading that dot-com options are today's top dollar, contractors will clamor for them. Take the building contractor who badgered a San Francisco executive for warrants. "It was a total knucklehead request," the executive said. "Ten thousand shares, he kept on insisting, 10,000 shares. But he had no idea of the exercise price or how many shares we had outstanding!"

HEADLINE: NEXT NEW ERA;
Now That They've Come, What Can We Sell Them?

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI 

 BODY:
BEFORE people realized they could make a million dollars on the Web by putting an "e" in front of any word in the dictionary, registering the new name and shaking down a venture capitalist for seed money, the Internet was a much more communal place.
Perhaps because it was populated largely by academics and technology geeks who either cared little about getting rich or considered the idea so outlandish as to be irrelevant, the Internet assumed a quaint identity as a place where people offered information freely. 
 Personal home pages, chat rooms, bulletin boards and Usenet groups, which are open-discussion forums on various topics, drew millions seeking advice, news or companionship. Those running the sites frequently relied on surplus computer space from universities or whatever network power they could scrape together with spare money.
Then, of course, came e-commerce, a phenomenon that prompted the tripartite categorization of the Internet: now, alongside commerce sites are content sites, in which a publisher provides news and information, and community sites, in which the users create the content.
But the tremendous interest in making money from the large number of people who frequent a site, or "monetizing eyeballs" (in industry parlance), also foretold profound changes for community sites.
Community sites began selling advertising to stay in business. The sites incorporated and wrote business plans. Some, like TheGlobe.com, went public. Others, like the Internet Movie Database (IMDb.com), were bought by bigger sites (Amazon.com in this case). Still others, like Deja News.com, a buying guide in which consumers rate products and give advice, assumed a new identity (Deja.com) and charged headlong into the e-commerce fray.
In some cases, the community sites angered their constituencies, who accused them of selling out to commercial interests. In others, the transitions were smooth. But whatever the story, analysts and executives of community sites say the e-commerce revolution changed the face of the Internet.
"Community sites have been wandering the desert in search of a revenue stream," said Lisa Allen, an e-commerce analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "Now they've latched on to e-commerce, which is the fair-haired child of the Internet. The only problem is, commerce isn't making any of them rich, either."
Sometimes, commerce has alienated the users who helped create the sites' content. Tom Phillips, the chief executive of Deja .com, said that site angered "a lot of people when we made the change."
The change Mr. Phillips referred to took place last year. DejaNews.com, one of the few sites to provide easy access to and retrieval of Usenet topics and information, became Deja.com, a site devoted to users who wanted information about a range of products. DejaNews.com had generated a loyal following and had made money by selling advertising. But when Deja.com rolled out, it began posting boxes on the site's pages, requesting opinions and ratings on products.
Those opinions were aggregated into a vast (and anonymous) database, the linchpin of the new Deja.com site. But as Mr. Phillips said, "we sort of force-fed people the ratings and reviews, and it slowed the site down," leaving it less navigable.
David Wilson, Deja's senior vice president, said, "The complaints mostly talked about how Deja was, and is, the standard-bearer of Usenet, and they were concerned we'd take our eye off the Usenet ball and everyone would suffer for it."
As a result, Mr. Phillips said, "we lost a chunk of people, but we also gained some, so our traffic has been pretty flat."
He added that Deja would drop the ratings boxes and that "given the viral nature of Usenet," he expected those who left the site to return.
But Deja is not dropping its e-commerce ambitions.
Rather, the company's newest incarnation, released this month, expands its offerings of purchase information and includes direct links to merchants selling goods featured on the Deja site.
The transition from community to commerce was much less bumpy for the Internet Movie Database, a compendium of movie trivia built largely by contributions from movie buffs around the world who gathered on the IMDb.com site.
According to Col Needham, who founded the database in 1990 in Britain, the site received four complaints when it decided to start selling advertisements in 1996, and no complaints when it was bought by Amazon in 1998.
Not all the people who used the database were thrilled. Some felt that a friendly and comfortable online community had been swallowed by a giant.
Still, Mr. Needham said that not only did the alliance with Amazon lead to an increase in the number of contributors to the database; as it has grown, the database has hired some of the people who contributed voluntarily.
"I think that in the end, most people understand that when you have e-commerce in a content site, you can fund the future growth of the site, so users win both ways," he said. "They can buy things they're interested in, and they have better content."
Yahoo encountered trouble last year when it bought GeoCities, a site that allows users to create free home pages. Soon after the acquisition, Yahoo posted a notice on its GeoCities site (http://geocities.yahoo .com), suggesting that Yahoo could take the content from a person's GeoCities site and use it in a book, for example, without compensating the home-page publisher.
The event caused a stir among the GeoCities faithful, spawning a boycott and inquiries from at least one consumer group.
"I can understand where the users were coming from," said Doug Hirsch, a senior production director for Yahoo Communities.
"But at the end of the story, we did change our terms of service," he said, to assure home-page publishers that their content was, in fact, their property.
"Consumers are very wary of what commerce sites are doing with content they provide -- and they should be," Mr. Hirsch said. He argued, however, that GeoCities had become less commercial since Yahoo bought it, notably containing less intrusive advertising. "I'm actually proud that it hasn't lost its grass-roots vibe," he said.
OTHER community sites are heading into e-commerce, hoping to make a similar claim in the future. Gamers .com, a site devoted to video game enthusiasts, is one such venture. Among other things, it lets users rate video games and post notes on message boards about anything related to games.
According to the site's chief executive, Dennis Fong -- known in professional computer game circles as Thresh, the undefeated world champion -- the company will soon introduce a service that allows users to buy games on the site from retailers or buy from other users in an auction format. In addition, he said, they will be able to trade games.
Mr. Fong said he expected no resistance from users because the site was committed to the open exchange of information about every game on it. "We're the Switzerland of the games industry," he said.
Nonetheless, he added, the transition should be done carefully, lest it wave the e-commerce flag too proudly in the process. "The last thing we want to be known as is a store," he said. "It's very hard for a store to be cool."

HEADLINE: Transforming Art Into Enterprise

BYLINE: By BILL WELLMAN 

 BODY:
While many chief executives have nailed down the art of the deal, not many know the deal on art.
Enter Wendell Castle, artist-in-residence at the Rochester Institute of Technology and one of America's foremost furniture makers. His one-of-a-kind art pieces have graced corporate collections all over the country and hang in such cultural emporiums as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian and the Art Institute of Chicago. 
 And if you have to ask the price, well, you can't afford it. His pieces start around $20,000 and then begin to become expensive.
So why has Mr. Castle decided to disrupt a successful art career at the age of 67 and become an entrepreneur? Last year, he started a business called Icon Design that will market a "budget" line of his works -- the Wendell Castle Collection, as it is called -- for prices ranging from $1,000 to around $15,000. Icon will also look into producing pieces designed by other furniture makers.
Part of his motivation for going downscale was to make more money, Mr. Castle said. "There are only two ways I can think of if you want to have a better income out of it: you can either make more or charge more," he said. "I sort of tried the making more back in the early 80's and really didn't like it. There was always somebody saying, 'What am I going to do next?' It distracted me so much that I couldn't really concentrate."
"Charging more is a great option," he added. "But you can't just do that instantly. You kind of have to tweak the prices up."
"But I wanted to do more than that. I had all these ideas for things that I probably was never going to do because they really weren't far out enough to justify making one."
So he decided to make a lot of copies of these new designs, none of which duplicate his art pieces.
Every year, hundreds of thousands of Americans start their own businesses, from gift-basket ventures to Web retailers. And no matter how high- or low-technology their products are, most of these entrepreneurs share two distinct traits, the experts say: A desire to run their own show and a knack for seizing opportunities nobody else sees. Mr. Castle filled the bill on both counts.
His brainstorm came when he starting running numbers through his head. The effort of making more than just one would pay off financially if he made 20 copies, or 50, he figured. But then, he said, "I thought, if you have something really nice why do you want to stop at 20 or 50, especially if somebody else is making them."
Now, he was talking mass production -- albeit on a limited scale -- and that takes more than a studio, even if the studio is as large and rambling as Mr. Castle's in Scottsville, near Rochester. The Wendell Castle Collection is already being made on a small scale in the studio, but is about to be transferred to Icon's new 37,000-square-foot plant in nearby Le Roy.
Mr. Castle designs the pieces -- sold at Holly Hunt in New York and other locations -- for the new line and builds prototypes, but after that the work is turned over to his crew. He expects to add designs every year and to retire pieces that don't sell. After all, as he put it in Rule No. 10 of a 1996 poster, "My 10 adopted rules of thumb," that graces his Web site (www.wendellcastle .com): "If you hit the bull's-eye every time, the target is too near."
The new plant was bought last fall and is expected to be in full operation this spring. It will eventually have about 50 workers and will be laid out with production efficiency in mind -- unlike the Scottsville studio with its Escher-like stairs that seem to lead down to higher levels when they are not taking you up to lower ones.
Going to all of this trouble to open a plant also points out another reason to produce in quantity, although Mr. Castle said it was not the most important one: "An artist really never has a business that you can sell. Other businesses have value. You build a business up and you can sell it to somebody."
But back to the president and chief executive formerly known as the artist.
Icon is about a $2 million project, Mr. Castle said. He said he had sold 30 percent of the company to raise $1 million and then had received low-interest loans and grants to cover the rest. He estimates revenues of $1.2 million for this year, and expects the company to become profitable in 2001. Most of that business, he says, will be with people who use architects or interior designers. And to his delight, people who already own his art pieces are also buying his new line.
"Another way of doing this is to not sell any of it and start much slower," he added. "I didn't have a million dollars lying around, but I could come up with a couple hundred thousand and start much smaller and grow."
But when you're in your 60's, he added, "the idea of slow isn't so appealing."
All of this has created new challenges. Mr. Castle has always been skillful at marketing his artwork, but the intricacies of marketing an entire company are of a different magnitude. He is now involved with bringing in a public relations team and a marketing team -- another associate, Hunter Kariher, the operations officer, will run the plant day to day. "Everything I've ever done in my whole life, I think I probably jumped in naively," he said. "I didn't realize how much we have to do."
In the midst of this he is still carrying on at R.I.T., where he has no teaching schedule but does give seminars, "where we talk about current issues, design problems, problems of starting a business -- some of the practical things that go along with furniture making in addition to aesthetics."
Is something lost when an artist takes on the role of full-fledged entrepreneur?
"I like to think that it's possible to wear two hats," Mr. Castle said, "though it is pretty hard to wear them at the same time. You have to take one off to put the other one on. And the transition is not instant. It takes a little adjustment period. Right now I'm in the production mode, and after this spring we're introducing about 12 new things so some pressure will be off. And at that point I really can get back to some art work.
"If economics didn't enter the picture," he added, "the art work would be the clear choice."

HEADLINE: WINE TALK;
Fine Values From Italy's Sun-Baked South

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
SOUTHERN Italy is torrid in more ways than one these days. In the course of a few years it has become one of the most sought-after wine-producing regions in the world.
Not by wine drinkers, at least not yet, except for a handful of smart shoppers who know enough to shrug off labels and grapes, and concentrate on value. No, the wine people who are most interested in southern Italy at the moment are big producers from the north like Antinori, Santa Margherita and Zonin, which, lured by bargain prices, are buying hundreds of acres of actual or potential vineyard land, and importers from Britain and the United States looking for good affordable wines. 
 Ten years ago, the talk in the wine trade was of Tuscany, Piedmont and the Veneto, with Lombardy, the Alto Adige and Friuli following along. Now, Abruzzi, Campania, Apulia, Sicily and Sardinia are hot topics, with Calabria, Basilicata and even obscure Molise beginning to be known for their wine and wine potential.
It's not as if southern Italy hasn't been involved in wine in the past. The Greeks, who colonized the region before Roman times, called it Oenotria, which comes from the word oinos, Greek for wine. Greco del Tufo from Campania, greco di bianco and greco nero from Calabria and grechetto from north of Rome all trace their origins to early Greek settlers.
These sun-baked provinces have always produced wine, most of it heavy alcoholic stuff shipped off in bulk for blending with thin northern wines. There have been good wines made here, too. The Mastroberardinos have been making fine wines near Naples for generations, while families in Sicily have produced well-known wines like Corvo and Regaleali for hundreds of years.
But hundreds of other wines have been made and enjoyed in the south, ignored by the Northerners and totally unknown to the rest of the world. Suddenly, people are talking about grapes with names like negroamaro, cannonau, primitivo, aglianico (which derives from Hellenic) and the nero d'Avola, the best grape of Sicily and perhaps one of the best in Italy.
Southern Italy is usually defined as everything south of Rome, plus the Abruzzi to the east and the islands of Sicily and Sardinia. On the mainland, almost all of this region is cut off from the north by the Apennine mountains, meaning it suffers few of the weather problems that plague Tuscany and the Piedmont. It is an area as yet untouched by large international demand; it's out of reach for wine enthusiasts who drive down from Germany and Switzerland to bid the prices of Italian wines up to Bordeaux and Burgundy levels.
Southern Italy is an impoverished region. Unemployment in the Veneto, the booming industrial and wine-producing region around Verona in the north, is about 4 percent. In the far south, it is 15 to 20 percent, and more.
Southern Italy, at least until now, has enjoyed a special kind of stability, unknown in more modern cultures. As Leonardo Locascio, an American importer, said: "These regions have lived under so many conquerors -- Greeks, Muslims, Normans, Spanish -- that there has always been a visceral attachment to family and land, particularly land. Property, at least until recently, never changed hands."
"Consequently," he explained, "the price of a bottle of wine rarely reflects rising land prices the way it does in northern Italy, where prime vineyard land currently sells for $200,000 an acre."
Thus, low demand, a willing work force, good land prices and unfamiliar wine names have all contributed to what is still an attractive relationship between price and quality. Many of these wines are between $8 and $12 a bottle.
Not all the names are unfamiliar. Sicilian wines, for example, have long been widely available in this country. Now, there are some new ones. Try La Segreta wines from Planeta, particularly the merlot-based red. Or Regaleali's delightful Nozze d'Oro (Golden Wedding) sauvignon blanc, created for the fifth wedding anniversary of the owners, Giuseppe and Franca Tasca. Morgante's nero d'Avola, which resembles a young syrah, is also worth seeking out.
Sardinia, a truly remote wine source a decade ago, now exports several intriguing wines from Argiolas, including Turriga, a red blend of cannonau and malvasia nera, and a Cannonau di Sardegna Riserva from Sella & Mosca, the island's largest wine producer. Cannonau is the local name for grenache, the principal grape in Spain, which once owned Sardinia. For a unique but engaging cabernet sauvignon, try the barrel-aged Marchese di Villamarina, also from Sella & Mosca.
Mastroberardino is still the most respected wine name in Campania, and for me its most respected red is its Taurasi, made from the aglianico grape. The riserva is aged up to four years and can be laid down for many more. Falerno del Massico Rosso, from the Villa Matilde, is another Campania red worth sampling.
Of course, Mastroberardino is also the best-known source of greco del Tufo, a fine dry wine with a hint of almonds. For an inexpensive red that still manages to display some complexity, the Copertino Riserva, made from the negroamaro grape at a cooperative in Apulia, is a good bet, although, like others on this list, not yet widely distributed. The Vigna Spano from Calo, another Apulia producer, is a bigger wine, with depth and a long finish.
Another Apulian wine rather well known in America is Salice Salentino, also made from the negroamaro grape. It, too, is a big wine, made to last. A prominent producer is Taurino. It also comes in a rose version. (One day, southern Italy's rose wines will be much sought after. They are lighter than the reds but have body and lots of flavor. Some people apparently age them successfully.)
The aglianico grape turns up in another relatively well-known red wine, Aglianico del Vultura, from vineyards near Potenza, in Basilicata. This is another keeper, with great power and concentrated flavors. I'm told the 1985's are just now at their best.
These are just a few of the hundreds of wines produced in the southernmost reaches of the Italian boot. If they are not yet in your local shops, try the ones that are. A whole new world of wine awaits.

WE know it will end. It's only a question of when. Even the longest economic expansion in history cannot continue forever.
And when it ends, what will happen to the smaller revolutions it has created? To the transformation of the office into a place where workers are acknowledged to have families? To the growing insistence of employees that their lives matter? Is all this talk of work-life balance really a change to the social core, or is it just cocktail conversation that will fade when the party's over? 
 I recently spent a day in Boston at a company called Circles, the ultimate icing on the work-life cake. If your employer contracts with Circles, you are entitled to call a "convenience coordinator" who will run your errands. Coordinators won't do anything "that isn't legal, moral or nice," says Janet Kraus, co-founder and chief executive of Circles, but they will wait for the cable repairman, plan your child's birthday party or take your car in for servicing.
On the morning I arrived, Kelly Medico, a coordinator, sat at her computer searching for the perfect birthday gift for a Vietnam veteran who collects war memorabilia. For nearly two hours, Ms. Medico trawled the Web, choosing between a World War II wrist compass, an unopened pack of Lucky Strike Greens and a Saddam Hussein pincushion doll. And all the while the giver of the gift, an Ernst & Young employee, was doing her own work, which is why Ernst & Young was paying for this in the first place.
"We view it as a way to increase productivity," says Denise Hoffman, the manager of work-life balance at Ernst & Young. "It's valuable in retention of employees, and we use it as a recruiting tool."
Recruitment, retention and the bottom line. Those -- not generosity or love -- have always been the underpinnings of human-resource policies, says Ann Vincola, a longtime work-life consultant in Boston. She said that chief executives are not sold on job sharing, or flex time or lactation rooms "just because you present this as the right thing to do; there has to be some perceived advantage to the company."
There is no doubt that companies are eagerly seizing that advantage. The Society for Human Resource Management conducts an annual survey, asking its members what benefits they offer. Three years ago, there were 92 choices on the menu. Last year, there were 110. Not only does the survey show an increase in what are now considered traditional benefits (53 percent offer flex time, an increase of 7 percent from 1997), but the new perks are growing, too. Massage therapy is hot now (8 percent of respondents say their companies offer this), as are concierge services (now at 4 percent and double the percentage a year ago).
But if we accept that all this attention to our lives is spurred less by enlightenment than by economics, what can we expect when the economic realities change? "There will," Ms. Vincola says, "be a tightening of the belt." Those programs that make financial sense will remain, she predicts. Telecommuting, for instance, which frees office space. Or compressed workweeks, which don't cost the company more if they're done right. But things that simply make lives easier will probably be cut.
The people who make their living from work-life programs understand this, and they are quietly preparing for the inevitable. Two weeks ago, I attended a work-life conference, and the talk at one lunch table was about a human-resource executive's push to get on-site child care "right now when times are flush because once it's built they're less likely to take it away."
Ms. Kraus of Circles is also storing nuts. "We're diversifying our risk," she says, describing a recent deal with a major credit card company: sign up for their platinum card and get a free Circles membership.
If the economy stalls, she reasons, "there is a future for us in the customer loyalty market."
In the meantime, her coordinators keep fielding requests from harried but pampered employees. Find a psychologist in Florida who will perform an I.Q. test on a preschooler. Find a gym within five miles of Harvard Square with a basketball court that is open past 10 p.m. A housekeeper with good references in New York. Child-friendly hotels in Maui. Willie Nelson tickets any place he'll be playing.
We are standing on a sliver of a moment in a most unusual time. It may be cold comfort, but you might never be more valued by your boss than you are right this minute. Savor that while it lasts.

BLOWBACK
The Costs and Consequences of American Empire
By Chalmers Johnson
268 pages. Metropolitan Books, Henry Holt. $26.
Chalmers Johnson starts his new book with an account of how he came to change his view of the American role in the world. A onetime supporter of the Vietnam War who now wishes he had "stood with the antiwar protest movement," Mr. Johnson, professor emeritus at the University of California, San Diego, spent a decade studying Japanese industrial policy. His research, which inevitably covered the American relationship with Japan, led him, he writes, "to see clearly for the first time the shape of the empire that I had so long uncritically supported."
The empire in question is the American empire, the term itself indicating the extent to which Mr. Johnson has now come to see things very critically indeed. His new book, "Blowback: The Costs and Consequences of American Empire," is a take-no-prisoners tirade against what he portrays as classic imperial overextension worthy of Rome or the Ottoman Empire. His main contention is that the United States, by resorting to "bluster, military force and financial manipulation," all harnessed to its goal of global hegemony, is subjecting itself to acts of retribution around the world -- that retribution being the "blowback" of his title. In other words, the World Trade Center bombings and other anti-American terrorist acts may be just the beginning. 
 In this sense Mr. Johnson's book is a useful and timely alert by a man with robustly contrarian views. But Mr. Johnson's turn from uncritical to critical about the American empire is a vastly more radical project than just a warning. Underlying his book is a strong but unsubstantiated conviction that the United States has all along been little better than any other imperial power, including the Soviet Union, seeking amoral advantage wherever and however it could -- and reaping blowback as a consequence. Extending blowback to just about every area of American action in the world gives the book a boldly provocative edge; unfortunately, it also makes Mr. Johnson sound like some of the more rigidly ideological protesters he used to disdain.
This is not to say that Mr. Johnson fails to raise important questions or to make persuasive arguments about the deleterious consequences of the global American presence. Among the questions is whether it is really necessary for the United States to maintain some 65 major military installations outside its borders. Mr. Johnson describes the most important of those installations, in Okinawa, as a place where the impact of so many soldiers on such a small island has been ruinous for the permanent inhabitants. One of his major villains is the International Monetary Fund, whose narrow America-centered view of developement is, in Mr. Johnson's jaundiced view, responsible for economic hardship around the world, and this view, though sketchily presented, merits a hearing.
Mr. Johnson also mounts a thought-provoking critique of American behavior during the Korean crisis of 1994 and 1995, when North Korea seemed about to embark on a nuclear weapons program. He demonstrates that the threat was grossly exaggerated to begin with and then deceitfully managed, with the result that the Korean peninsula is more potentially dangerous than it was before. His two chapters on China, which he portrays as a likely superpower of the 21st century, are incisive, informed and common-sensical.
But these sections of Mr. Johnson's book are marred by an overriding, sweeping and cranky one-sidedness. The basic problem is that Mr. Johnson is a good deal readier to see hidden similarities -- between, say, the nature of the former Soviet satellite East Germany and the American "satellite" Japan -- than to admit obvious distinctions. His account of the American relationship with South Korea is a case in point.
He begins with the highly debatable assertion that for much of their history North and South Korea were "nearly indistinguishable in terms of human rights abuses and Stalinist-style development policies." Mr. Johnson then focuses largely on the suppression of a democratic uprising in 1980 in the city of Kwangju against South Korea's military dictator of the moment, Gen. Chun Doo Hwan. To Mr. Johnson, General Chun's crackdown, more violent than China's Tiananmen Square crackdown a decade later, was of a piece with Soviet repression in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 and illustrates the basic similarity between Soviet and American imperialisms.
It is a deceptive, even cynical argument. Nobody that I know of has much love for General Chun or approves of his handling of the Kwangju crisis, but Mr. Johnson's eagerness to draw Soviet-American parallels leads him to pass lightly over crucial facts and arguments. Most generally, he does not consider that the invasions of Czechoslovakia and Hungary were Soviet totalitarianism expressing its nature, whereas the slaughter in Kwangju represented neither American values nor American goals. He dismisses as almost irrelevant the signal fact that no American troops were in Kwangju but Soviet forces were in Eastern Europe.
Equally troubling, Mr. Johnson relies on a few snippets of very inconclusive evidence to accuse American officials in Korea and Washington of authorizing General Chun's Kwangju actions in advance, but he ignores a substantial evidence and published testimony that point to a contrary conclusion. Mr. Johnson even muses that when General Chun later was tried for the Kwangju massacre, these American officials "might well have belonged in the dock alongside their Korean colleagues."
Most important perhaps, Mr. Johnson fails to offer alternatives to American policy in Korea or the likely consequences of those alternatives. In Hungary and Czechoslovakia the alternative to the Soviet invasion was the survival of less repressive new governments. In Korea the alternative to continued backing for General Chun would probably have been a collapse of order in South Korea, which might have induced North Korea to attact.
Mr. Johnson is even unwilling to give the United States any moral credit for the overall outcome of its engagement in Asia: namely, conditions of relative peace and stability in which a core of fairly prosperous democracies has emerged. Mr. Johnson may label these democracies -- among them Japan, South Korea and now possibly even Indonesia -- as mere "satellites" of the American empire, but that characterization probably says more about Mr. Johnson than it does about the realities of world politics.

HEADLINE: An Iowa Heirloom: Pork With Real Flavor

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: STATE CENTER, Iowa

 BODY:
AGRICULTURE, they tell you the moment you get to Des Moines, no longer rules the local economy. Corn and pigs are no longer kings.
Well, maybe not, but farm traditions die hard. Although almost half of Iowa's pork producers went out of business between 1992 and 1997, the surviving family farmers cling to their debt-ridden, often economically marginal farms the way grand old English families hang on to their country houses, even when the roof leaks and the servants are long gone. 
 Hogs still outnumber people here five to one. Lots of people eat pork sandwiches, made from breaded, deep-fried tenderloins, instead of hamburgers. At the Iowa State Fair, an 11-day extravaganza each August, hungry Hawkeyes in bib overalls and print dresses flock to a huge dining hall called the Pork Tent.
And Iowa still chooses a lissome young thing every year to wear a crown and a pigskin sash that identifies her as the Iowa Pork Queen.
Pork queen? Anywhere else, call a young woman a pork queen and she breaks down in sobs, heads for the guidance counselor and asks her mother where she went wrong. In Iowa, the title is a badge of honor.
Big corporate operators have taken over the bulk of Iowa's pork production, with dire results not only for the small farmer but also for those of us who were raised on succulent pork chops and pork roasts. Fat gives pork some of its flavor, but modern hogs are bred to minimize fat; producers noticed that Americans were choosing chicken over beef. Raised in close quarters inside enormous metal buildings, the hogs foul the air for miles around, and their meat is bland, dry and tough when cooked.
"Pork, the other white meat," the ads say. Right they are; much of it, as Edward Behr wrote last summer in his erudite newsletter, The Art of Eating, "is as lean and characterless as factory chicken breast."
Happily, Iowa's rich, dark soil holds onto people like Kelly Biensen, a fifth-generation hog farmer, and his wife, Nina, a pair of stubborn, well-educated souls who want to do things differently. They are retro-pioneers who produce pork the old-fashioned way, giving their pigs lots of room to move about and eschewing the drugs and hormones many use.
They have also organized a marketing group called Eden Farms, which sells pork from their farm and 85 other family farms that raise pigs known as Berkshires, which originated in England 300 years ago. The breed is well known for its flavorful meat, well marbled with fat.
Try the gingered pork tenderloin at Bistro 43 in Des Moines, and you will taste the difference. Jeremy Morrow, 32, the chef, told me that he always has Eden Farms pork on his menu, prepared in a number of ways. The meat is moist, tender and almost buttery, with a bright, fresh taste. You know that you have hold of a piece of pig.
THE Biensens know that their pork tastes better, but for them, what is more important is that it commands a premium price. It has enabled them to escape the trap of commodity pricing.
Overproduction has driven the price of everyday pork below the amount that it costs a small farmer to produce. Mr. Biensen said that as a rule of thumb, it takes about $100 to raise a hog for market, and the price has fallen below that level more often in the last few years than it has risen above it. Most small farmers struggle to break even.
Things are bad for little guys everywhere. Glenn Grimes, an economist who does studies for the National Pork Producers Council, estimated recently that 8,000 hog farmers across the country quit the business in 1998 and 8,000 more quit last year.
"Life has not been very easy," said Mr. Biensen, 47, who lives in a battered farmhouse, surrounded by pens and barns, at the center of his 248 acres. "We haven't lived as well as we should. My wife has a Ph.D. in animal husbandry from Iowa State University. We could have done other things if our goal was money. But we wanted this, our own farm."
Mr. Biensen pronounces his family name, which is Alsatian in origin, BUY-en-son. He wears steel-rimmed glasses that make him look rather professorial, and as he talked, seated at a computer in a corner of the worn family kitchen, a small, rueful smile flickered across his face.
"The big change is the cost of farming," he told me one snowy morning in January. "In only about 40 years, we went from $300 to $500 for an acre of land, to $3,500 an acre. It has settled back to $2,500, but that's still almost 10 times as much. Forty years ago, the biggest tractor was 70 horsepower. Now, they look like a house coming across the field.
"As a result, labor is being replaced by capital as the essential element," Mr. Biensen continued. "The big producer, with more to invest, gets bigger, and he can make a deal with the packing houses. The more hogs you can give a packer, the higher a price you get."
At the moment, it costs about 40 cents to produce a pound of pork, which then sells for 38 to 39 cents. Eden Farms pork, however, fetches roughly 50 cents a pound from its customers, mostly clubs and restaurants in central Iowa. The Biensens grossed only $2,300 in January 1999, not long after they began. But business is growing steadily in their niche market: in December, they grossed $13,800.
SEVERAL things, Mr. Biensen suggested, account for the bland flavor of most supermarket pork.
One is the modern method of raising hogs in confinement -- "always indoors," he said, "in the same exact spot for their whole lives," eating there, sleeping there, defecating there, through the slatted floor into vast, smelly manure lagoons. Moving in and out of shelters, roaming in open lots, the way the Biensens' pigs do, even in cold weather, seems to yield firmer, juicier, tastier pork.
Hogs that are too lean cannot stand the cold outdoors.
A second factor is P.S.S., for porcine stress syndrome, which is caused by a gene often carried by breeds used for factory farming. It makes the animals more efficient -- that is, they produce more pounds of lean meat per pound. But they often produce meat that Mr. Biensen describes as P.S.E. The letters stand for pale, soft and exudative. Exudative meat loses much of its moisture as it cooks, which is why a fried pork chop can taste like leather.
Beef is classified by the federal government, with "utility" at the bottom of the scale, "prime" at the top. The more marbling, the higher the grade, but no such classification exists for pork.
Ken Prusa, a professor of food science at Iowa State University in Ames, argued that moisture, not fat, is the key to flavor. Low-fat, high-moisture pork, if not overcooked, can be delicious, he asserted, although most top chefs pay top dollar to get pork with a higher fat content.
One problem is that most home cooks and some chefs overcook pork in their determination to kill any lurking trichinae, the parasites that cause trichinosis. But with the disappearance of pork produced from pigs fed on garbage, and improvements in hog-rearing methods, Professor Prusa said, the chances of contracting trichinosis are nearly nil.
In any event, he added, no one need fear pork cooked to medium -- 160 degrees, with a bit of pink at the center. Other food technologists assert that medium-rare pork, cooked to 145 degrees, is perfectly safe. Some professional cooks here and abroad cook pork less than that. Heston Blumenthal, the chef at the Fat Duck near London, which has two stars in the Michelin guide, cooks his chops, cut from the loins of Tamworth or Middlewhite hogs, less than that, serving them at 135 degrees, still rosy-pink.
"The chances of someone getting sick from eating pork are a thousand times smaller than those of picking up bacteria from chicken," Mr. Blumenthal said. "I think that pork is probably the safest thing we serve."
Breed also counts. Berkshires produce somewhat smaller loins, which means fewer pounds of salable meat, but the meat has very fine fibers, which give it greater water retention capacity, and more tiny veins of intramuscular fat, which give it a more full-bodied flavor.
The Biensens raise both purebred Berkshires and Berkshire hybrids, for which Berkshires are crossed with other breeds like Durocs, one of the major commercial breeds. The hybrids, 75 percent Berkshire, grow faster, and the sows give birth to larger litters, while retaining, Mr. Biensen said, the desirable characteristics of purebreds.
His charges are fed soybean meal, ground corn and vitamins and minerals, but no animal byproducts and no antibiotics, which are standard for many factory pigs. They are energetic, curious beasts, mostly black with an occasional splotch of brown. Almost all of them have a white flash on the face, a white tip on the tail and white markings on all four feet.
As I watched them, I thought about Wilbur, E. B. White's lovable pig, who learns the hard facts about life and death in "Charlotte's Web."
EVENTUALLY, Mr. Biensen wants to sell his pork nationwide. Already, he noted, Berkshire pork has attracted a wide following; Japanese customers, who are notoriously picky about meat, like Berkshire pork so much that they buy most of the production of farmers affiliated with another marketing group, American Berkshire Gold.
Chefs across this country, dissatisfied with the pork available through normal channels, have found alternatives. Alice Waters of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., turned to Niman Ranch in nearby Marin County, whose beef had long been featured on her menus, and Niman Ranch eventually hooked up with Paul Willis, an Iowa farmer.
His and 36 other farms, in Iowa and nearby states, now supply Niman, which sells to restaurants (including Gramercy Tavern and Lutece in New York), a few retail outlets (including Fairway and Eli's in New York and Fresh Fields in Washington and Baltimore) and also direct to consumers. Telephone orders can be placed at (510) 808-0330, and Niman promises Internet ordering soon.
At Fairway, Niman Ranch's seven-rib rack Frenched is $8.99 a pound. At Eli's Manhattan, Niman center-cut pork chops with bone are $8.99 a pound, and shoulder roast is $5.99 a pound.
I discovered another top-flight producer, Four Story Hill Farm in Honesdale, Pa., 30 miles northeast of Scranton, by asking about the source of the dish "Black Pig Variation" (a pig's trotter stuffed with morels and a feather-light pork cutlet) that I tasted at Seeger's, a superb restaurant in Atlanta.
When I called the farm, Sylvia Pryzant, who runs it with her husband, Stephen, told me that they custom raise poultry and pigs for chefs like Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Wayne Nish in New York, Charlie Trotter in Chicago and Thomas Keller in the Napa Valley. The Pryzants also concentrate on Berkshire hogs, fed in part on chopped fresh apples, mostly McIntoshes, and slaughter them when they are younger (12 weeks old) and smaller (55 pounds dressed weight) than is usual with the pig farmers in the Midwest.
Mr. Pryzant, 48, and Ms. Pryzant, 44 and Tunisian-born, moved in 1992 to Pennsylvania from the New York suburbs, where she had been working for a nonprofit organization and he had worked in food service in a nursing home. He learned farming on a kibbutz in Israel. Now, she said, they watch their pampered porkers "running around in happy circles every morning."
 
SOY-MARINATED PORK TENDERLOIN WITH SHIITAKE CREAM

To the Editor:
Your March 24 Weiskirchen Journal from Germany suggests that Europeans sacrifice mobility to save energy. Although Europeans make only half as many car trips per day, they make four to eight times as many public transit trips as Americans, and four to five times as many walking and bicycling trips. In most European countries, at least half of all trips are by either public transit, walking or bicycling (compared with less than 10 percent here). 
 Our nation's auto dependence puts us at the mercy of oil-producing cartels and jeopardizes our long-run economic and political independence. It also pollutes our environment, accelerates global warming and robs us of valuable cardiovascular exercise.

HEADLINE: Pataki Offers Plan for a Women's Museum in Lower Manhattan

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 28

 BODY:
More than 150 years after the first convention on women's rights in upstate New York, Gov. George E. Pataki has proposed building one of the first museums in the country to be devoted to women's history.
The $125 million museum would be in Battery Park City near the southern tip of Manhattan, joining several recent museum projects like the Jewish Heritage Museum and the planned Skyscraper Museum. Mr. Pataki, a Republican, has provided $1 million in state money for the project and promises to carve out more from this year's budget. Advocates for the museum, which include a group of prominent civic and business leaders, are planning to raise the rest from private donations. 
 "We certainly have outstanding elements of history here in New York," Mr. Pataki said in a telephone interview. "The next logical step is to pull it all together in one site that is visible and reachable by most people. I think we're going to see a great deal of support for it."
Mr. Pataki said the idea originated with a one-year commission that he appointed in 1998 to honor the achievements of women. Libby Pataki, the governor's wife, headed the commission, and its 52 other members included Beverly Sills, Billie Jean King and Roz Abrams, the television anchor.
Although the museum is still in the planning stage, it has been laid out on paper by Ralph Appelbaum Associates, a design company that has left its imprint on the newly renovated Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. A drawing shows a 10-story building whose floors,linked by ramps, overlook a multilevel visual display at the museum's center.
The new museum, known formally as the Museum of Women: The Leadership Center, would differ from existing collections around the state in that it would not focus on individuals, but would offer a comprehensive view of women's contributions to American history, said Lynn Rollins, former deputy director of the state's Division for Women, who is leading the efforts for the new museum.
Ms. Rollins said the exhibits would include photographs, artifacts and interactive displays that help tell the story of women in American history, from the pioneers and suffragists to recent immigrants. "We want every woman to walk through the museum and feel like they're part of their history," she said.
The exhibits will not be limited to things of interest only to New Yorkers, Ms. Rollins said, but would be planned in consultation with a national advisory board of historians. The building would also include conference rooms and an auditorium to provide training classes in leadership and business skills.
"So much of the seminal history of women took place in New York, and this is a tourist mecca," she said. "This is an opportunity to let people know what women in America have achieved."
Mr. Pataki's aides said they had approached Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the Battery Park City Authority, a three-member state board appointed by the governor, about the project. It would require the approval of city and state officials and the authority.
"It sounds like a good idea, and we look forward to reviewing the plan," said Matthew Higgins, a spokesman for Mr. Giuliani.
Timothy S. Carey, president of the Battery Park City Authority, said the arrangement would be similar to one that helped bring the Museum of Jewish Heritage there in 1997. If approved, the women's history museum would not have to pay rent or other fees on the property for 20 years, Mr. Carey said.
In recent years, a diverse coalition of advocacy groups, scholars and politicians around the country has sought to promote women's history. A 1997 campaign persuaded Congress to restore a marble statue depicting three suffragists -- Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton -- to the Capitol Rotunda. The statue, which was commissioned by the National Woman's Party in 1921, had been kept in a downstairs corridor.
A former opera house in Dallas is being transformed with $25 million in public and private money into the Women's Museum: An Institute for the Future, which is expected to open in September. It will borrow artifacts from the Smithsonian and other museums to chronicle women's history from the 1500's to the present.
Plans are also under way for the National Museum of Women's History in Washington. And a host of educational programs and Internet sites have sprung up to inform women about their role in history.
"There's a need for women's history museums," said Galen Sherwin, president of the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women, who supports the creation of another one in Manhattan. "The problem with the study of history is that its focus is on politics and economics, areas that, up until recently, mostly excluded women."
In New York, some of the earliest exhibits about women's history can be found in Seneca Falls, a village halfway between Syracuse and Rochester that was the hometown of Mrs. Stanton, the suffragist. She helped organize the first women's rights conference there in 1848, drawing nearly 300 people and setting off the American women's movement.
Today, these historic events are commemorated there by the Women's Rights National Historical Park, which is managed by the federal government, and the National Women's Hall of Fame, a private center that opened in 1969 to honor the achievements of individuals from Mrs. Stanton to Madeleine K. Albright.
The Hall of Fame, which has inducted 157 women so far, has rebounded in recent years after nearly closing in 1989 because of financial troubles. Mary Ann Oppenheimer, the executive director, said the center now takes in enough from ticket sales and donations to cover its $350,000 annual operating budget. Attendance has climbed steadily to 10,000 visitors last year.
"There's so much out there that could be told," said Ms. Oppenheimer, who praised the idea of a new women's history museum in Manhattan. "It's a very interesting idea, and I think there are lots of opportunities for organizations like ours to find ways to work together and achieve our mission."
Nancy Cott, a professor of history and women's studies at Yale University, said the new museum would give historians an opportunity to reach a broader audience. Other scholars and advocates said they would like to see exhibits on everything from the changing image of femininity in the 1990's to the role that women played in the Civil War.

Poughkeepskie Students Try to Shape City Policy

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA ROWE 

DATELINE: POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y., March 28

 BODY:
Within a few miles of this tough Hudson River city are two elite colleges, a renowned cooking school, a college with a nationally watched political polling center and two state undergraduate institutions. Yet the thousands of students at these campuses seldom venture past the gates to mingle with their city neighbors, who often struggle with poverty, homelessness and the city's faltering attempts at urban renewal.
But 27 students from the six schools -- Vassar, Bard, Marist, Dutchess County Community College, the State University of New York at New Paltz and the Culinary Institute of America -- are involved in an unusual cross-campus class that uses the city as a laboratory and whose findings the city, by legislative fiat, must examine. 
 Several evenings a week, Catherine Schloegel, a senior at Vassar who describes herself as a typical, "innocent-looking college kid," waits at the bus stop where homeless men pick up a shuttle to the county shelter. There, she and Terri-Ann Sweet, a student at Dutchess County Community, speak to as many men as will allow them an interview. The results of their work will be included in a report to the city on the realities and causes of Poughkeepsie's homelessness.
"The first night people were like, 'You're never going to understand what it's like to be homeless,' " Ms. Schloegel said.
Ms. Schloegel, of Boulder, Colo., hung on long enough to watch one of her subjects, a man who had been homeless for 17 years, find a job and a place to live. The experience has changed her so much that she plans to remain in Poughkeepsie after graduation and work in education.
Each year, the program, known as the Poughkeepsie Institute, tackles an issue important to Poughkeepsie, offering research and an academic perspective with the hopes of affecting government policy. Last year, the subjects were race and ethnicity. Previous classes have focused on mass transportation and welfare. Students from the Culinary Institute, whose schedule does not mesh with those of the other colleges, serve meals to the hungry.
While the Poughkeepsie Institute's impact has thus far been small, last year's class on race and ethnicity increased awareness of issues surrounding the surging Mexican population and was a factor in prodding the city's Common Council to hold an annual Cinco de Mayo festival for Hispanic immigrants.
Certainly, the issues could be explored through conventional lectures and books, but the real-life fieldwork, students and college officials say, has been invaluable. "The question for undergraduates is how do you connect theory and practice," said Leon Botstein, president of Bard College. When looking at these issues by working in the field, he said, students "leave the realm of cliched generalizations immediately."
While unusual in that it involves a group of colleges, the Poughkeepsie initiative is not unique. Colleges around the country have abandoned a fortress-like, town-gown isolation and are finding a variety of ways, from anthropological and sociological study to outright redevelopment, of building bridges to their host communities.
One reason is that the real-world problem-solving is valued by career-minded students; another is that campuses want to make their host cities as attractive as possible to prospective recruits. Harvard is building low-cost housing in Cambridge, the University of Pennsylvania has helped rebuild parts of West Philadelphia and the president of Connecticut College is chairwoman of New London's development authority.
Peter Leonard, chairman of the institute and a Vassar College faculty member, believes Poughkeepsie's comparatively small size (population: 29,000) makes it an ideal place for such an effort.
"It's small enough that you can become a player on any issue and big enough to have all the problems and all the promise of a major American city," he said.
In Poughkeepsie, the governing powers welcome the help. Both Mayor Colette Lafuente and the chairman of the city's Common Council, Thomas O'Neill, are institute board members. Mr. O'Neill said in his annual address that he hoped to use the students' information "as a cornerstone of any meaningful reform."
Natasha Thomas, 22, a biology major at Dutchess County Community College, spends much of her time videotaping interviews with homeless men and women and has learned just how simplistic her previous notions about homelessness were.
At the Living Room, a daytime center for the homeless run by the Mental Health Association of Dutchess County, Ms. Thomas leaned forward, her hand on her chin, as she asked Trudy Dillard, 35, about her trips in and out of prison, questioned Nancy Reyes, 32, about the children who were taken away from her, and asked 25-year-old Carmen McClaurin about a life of physical abuse and the time she spent in jail for stabbing her boyfriend in self-defense.
"How did you become homeless?" she asked, filming every minute. "Were you abused as a child? What would turn things around for you?"
The video will be presented to the city's Common Council at the end of the year.
"Your story touched me," she told Ms. McClaurin. "For so many women, this is the real issue, domestic abuse, and homelessness is just the end of a long cycle."
Ms. McClaurin, a tough-looking woman who can shut down communication instantly, nodded and then hugged her interviewer.
"They're learning about us as people, who are out there on the street," she said.
In many ways, the class, which is held in a community center in downtown Poughkeepsie, is structured in traditional fashion, with three hours of classes and required reading. Students work under a team of teachers representing each college and a variety of disciplines.
"It's just a different way of learning," Ms. Schloegel said. "I think a traditional classroom experience is valuable, but so is knowing where you live. In fact, I think it's more important to understand the lives of people around us."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
The I.M.F.as 'a Crucial Cornerstone'

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, March 28

 BODY:
Laying out his vision of the future of the International Monetary Fund, Horst Kohler, the new managing director, said today that rather than shrinking as some critics have suggested, the fund should expand its role as "a crucial cornerstone" of globalization.
His remarks, in one of the first interviews he has given since his appointment this month, came amid a welter of conflicting proposals for overhauling the I.M.F., one of the world's important financial institutions, both in the United States Congress and the Clinton administration. 
 The thrust of some of those arguments, notably in a report from a Congressional commission led by Allan H. Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University, was that both the I.M.F. and its sister institution, the World Bank, should be radically pared back because they often do more harm than good in developing countries.
Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers has opposed some of the commission's findings, and Mr. Kohler, a 57-year-old former high official in the German finance ministry, sought in the interview to avoid an impression that he and Mr. Summers were on a collision course.
"I do see a lot of commonality in the ideas expressed by Larry Summers," he said.
But in the 45-minute interview at his office at the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, where he will leave as president to join the I.M.F., Mr. Kohler made clear that his concept of reform would not limit the broad reach of I.M.F. influence that some critics want trimmed.
"My own vision is, in rather broad terms, that the I.M.F. should be even more than in the past a crucial cornerstone to secure growth and stability in the world, or in the global economy," he said.
"Whatever we do with crisis management, aid to the developing countries, the most important thing to achieve is sustained growth in the world economy, and that's not only in developed countries but really in the global economy including the developing countries and the emerging markets. That's my most important thing."
He acknowledged, however, that the huge capital flows that have come to be associated with globalization had implications both for the I.M.F.'s role as a lender and the relationship between its loans and those available on the international capital markets.
"I do think that after the experience with the crises in Russia and Asia," Mr. Kohler said, "the I.M.F. should be the center of excellence for the international financial markets for the international financial and monetary system."
To that end, he continued, the I.M.F. should "set up standards and codes for sound banking systems, sound behavior and, based on that, do more to prevent crisis."
But he made clear that this did not preclude a shift in the way the fund allocates its multibillion-dollar resources. "The I.M.F. also, of course, has to adapt to changes in the world economy," he said. And, reflecting the views of the Clinton administration, he said that in seeking to promote growth, "the biggest part should be done by the private capital markets."
"I do think that there's need to review the focus of the I.M.F.," Mr. Kohler said. "And reviewing the focus also means that we have to understand I.M.F. lending in principle as a temporary lending, and not as a permanent lending, which would substitute the possibilities of the private capital markets."
The German official is joining the I.M.F. after 18 months as head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, an institution established in the early 1990's to promote private investment and market economic values in the countries of the old Soviet bloc.
He took up that job within weeks of the Russian default in August 1998, and was obliged to write off a series of bad Russian debts. The experience has bred a degree of caution.
Mr. Kohler was one of the first Western officials to meet with Russia's president-elect, Vladimir V. Putin, as he gained prominence during the presidential election campaign that just ended.
While Mr. Kohler said today that the I.M.F. should "remain engaged in Russia," and while he praised Russia's "progress in terms of adjusting to a market economy," he also urged Mr. Putin to avoid his country's past mistakes.
"The lesson from some experience in the past," he said, "is that the I.M.F., like others, should judge Mr. Putin and the Russian government not just by their words but by their deeds. And I hope that President Putin will build up new confidence in demonstrating that he's able to take prior action before international support is coming in."
Many of the issues he addressed coincided with American emphases, such as the idea that the I.M.F. should be prepared for greater transparency in its dealings with "civil society."
Asked about demands from some developing countries for the cancellation of their debts, he said that any debt cancellation should only be part of a broader strategy for third world economic recovery.
He repeatedly emphasized that the I.M.F.'s lending should continue as a means of influencing the economic development of these countries, rather than concentrating simply on emergencies. Without lending to developing nations, he said, the I.M.F. would have little influence on economic policy.
Mr. Kohler was chosen for the top job at the I.M.F. after tortuous trans-Atlantic wrangling that soured relations between the Clinton administration and Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroder. Mr. Schroder lobbied first for one German candidate, Caio Koch-Weser, who was vetoed by President Clinton, then swung his weight behind Mr. Kohler.
President Clinton's endorsement of Mr. Kohler was depicted in Washington as a reluctant move principally intended to avoid further strains with Germany. Some European officials supporting different candidates raised questions about Mr. Kohler's stature, despite his prominent role in designing the financial framework of German reunification and in setting up the European single currency.
But Mr. Kohler insisted that those circumstances would not undermine his authority as head of the I.M.F. "I think that the dust will settle after this rather heated debate," he said. "I'm quite confident that we'll do a good job."

HEADLINE: Confidence Of Consumers Weakened For 2d Month

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Consumers' confidence in the economy fell for the second consecutive month in March, and their expectations for later this year sank to a five-month low, a private survey showed yesterday.
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell to 136.7 this month from 140.8 in February and the record of 144.7 in January. The index that measures consumer expectations for the next six months dropped to 106.2, the lowest level since October, amid higher oil and gasoline prices and volatile stocks. 
 That could signal the economy will slow in the coming months, something Federal Reserve policy makers are eager to see. The Fed has raised the federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks five times since last June, to 6 percent, the highest in five years, to keep inflation in check.
"Clearly consumers are aware of how strong economic growth is but are also aware that the Fed is working to change that," said Christopher Low, chief economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets in New York.
Consumers are "waiting to see if a further erosion in confidence triggers a slowdown in consumer spending," said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's consumer research center. "As for now, a moderate cutback in consumer spending is unlikely to stifle still-strong economic growth."
As the economy enters a record 10th year of expansion this week, confident consumers, an unemployment rate near a 30-year low and rising incomes have translated into increased spending on goods and services. That is a concern for Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues, who have signaled interest rates will have to keep rising if demand exceeds the economy's ability to supply goods and services.
The Conference Board's latest survey showed the share of respondents who see jobs as plentiful rose to 52.7 percent, from 51.2 percent in February. The share seeing jobs as hard to get fell to 10.4 percent from 11.4 percent.

HEADLINE: Will Lissner, 91, Times Reporter Who Specialized in Economics

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Will Lissner, a reporter for The New York Times from 1926 until he retired in 1976, died on Saturday in a nursing home in Dunedin, Fla. He was 91 and lived in Clearwater, Fla.
For many years, Mr. Lissner specialized in writing about economics, but his varied assignments as a reporter and rewrite man included Prohibition raids, tong wars in Chinatown and coverage of The Times itself. In 1935, he contributed to The Times's coverage of the death of Adolph S. Ochs, who was then its publisher -- unbylined, as was the practice at that time. 
 In 1969, Mr. Lissner prepared a confidential 138-page report for Turner Catledge, who was then a vice president of The Times, entitled "Arthur Hays Sulzberger and the Eastland Investigation." James O. Eastland was a senator from Mississippi whose subcommittee in the 1950's was investigating, among other things, the extent of Communist infiltration and influence that he believed existed at The Times. Mr. Lissner's report, intended for the paper's archives and its senior executives, largely recapitulated the ways in which the paper and Mr. Sulzberger -- then the publisher, and grandfather of the present one -- had responded to Mr. Eastland. It was also an account of Communist Party activity in the newspaper business in New York from the 1930's to 1950's.
In 1980, Harrison E. Salisbury, a Pulitzer-Prize winning reporter and later an editor at The Times, cited Mr. Lissner's report in his book "Without Fear or Favor: The New York Times and Its Times." Mr. Salisbury wrote: "When I was sent as correspondent to Moscow in January 1949, as the McCarthy tensions were building up," The Times's management "took pains to make certain that the dispatches of the new man from Moscow were carefully scrutinized by a veteran Times reporter, Will Lissner, a dedicated anti-Communist and Soviet economics specialist. Lissner was able to report no signs of Communist bias in the new man's report; quite the reverse."
Mr. Lissner, a native New Yorker, graduated from Stuyvesant High School and studied and taught at the New School for Social Research. He founded the American Journal of Economics and Sociology in 1941 and continued his ties to it after leaving The Times.
His 1929 marriage to Ellen Batters ended in divorce in 1971.
He is survived by his wife, the former Dorothy Burnham; two daughters, Claire Shepherd of Milwaukee and Ellen Benjamin of Dover, Mass.; 9 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Gain as Investors Shift Makeup of Portfolios

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices were mostly higher amid a drop in the main stock market gauges, which caused some investors to seek shelter in fixed-income securities.
The shift out of stocks came after Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, recommended that her firm's clients reduce their allocation of stocks to 65 percent from 70 percent, with the 5 percent going into cash. She also recommended switching from a 5 percent allocation in long bonds to 5 percent in short-term Treasuries. 
 As a result, shorter-maturity paper led the market higher. The price of the two-year note rose 2/32 , to 9927/32 , while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, dropped to 6.58 percent from 6.62 percent on Monday. The 30-year bond lagged, gaining only 1/32 , to 10325/32 . Its yield was unchanged at 5.98 percent.
The 30-year bond also was held back by the fact that OPEC is having trouble agreeing on increases in oil production.
Treasuries took some strength from yesterday's consumer confidence data from the Conference Board; that index fell for the second consecutive month after reaching a record in January. The index that measures consumer expectations for the next six months also dropped, to its lowest level since October, after the most recent increase by the Federal Reserve in short-term interest rates, the fifth since June.
Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisers in Columbus, Ohio, said, "Going into this confidence report, credit market investors painfully realized that the Fed is facing an economy that just doesn't seem to want to slow down despite the cumulative increase of 125 basis points in the federal funds rate."
"Therefore, in this environment, there is no doubt that many investors have begun questioning whether the Fed is falling behind in its fight against potential inflationary forces."
Although he disagrees with that assessment, Mr. Chan said, it cannot be fully erased from investors' minds. "As a result," he said, "the dip in the confidence, especially in the more important expectations component, had to offer great relief to those that have spent countless hours worrying about the growth pace last quarter and what they can expect to learn in the first quarter."
Mr. Chan said that Ms. Cohen's announcement was a breath of fresh air for the credit market, where most investors took the news as an indication that the bond market might face less competition from the equity market.
Investors in the longer maturities did not celebrate at first glance because they viewed her comments as being more beneficial to the shorter maturities. They did, however, embrace her statements as the day wore on.
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at the J. W. Genesis Financial Corporation in Boca Raton, Fla., said all the markets were skittish, making hedging ineffective and forcing many investors to sit on positions longer because of the lack of liquidity.
Elsewhere, Treasury supply is back in force this week, and the market is not expected to have much trouble digesting everything. The government sold $35 billion in 21-day cash-management bills yesterday and will offer $30 billion in 19-day bills today along with $12 billion of two-year notes.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a 21-day cash-management bill:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
Price: 99.651
Investment rate: 6.09%
High rate: 5.99%

HEADLINE: Opening the Oil Spigot

 BODY:
The decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase its oil production by 1.45 million barrels a day is welcome and may, over time, lead to lower American gasoline prices. The action, which Iran, an OPEC member, unexpectedly refused to take part in, restores just over a third of production cut by the cartel over the past two years. But it should not be seen as a definitive answer to the recent sharp rise in oil prices.
Those prices reached a peak of $34 a barrel in early March, more than three times what they had been a year earlier. But those 1999 prices were artificially depressed -- lower, once inflation is accounted for, than at any time since the 1970's. A rebound to more realistic levels was inevitable. 
 OPEC's power is not what it once was. Its 11 member countries now account for less than 40 percent of world oil production, down from more than 50 percent in 1974. Internal discipline is weak, with many countries cheating on their production quotas to earn extra revenue. Even before the OPEC meeting, prices had dropped by almost 20 percent, to about $28 a barrel. Raising production should bring further price declines.
Yesterday's OPEC decision came in response to strong American pressure. Aside from Iran, most other OPEC countries preferred not to risk being cast as villains in American political debate if oil prices remain high. Many of these countries also recognize that their own self-interest calls for moderation to protect the economies of major oil-consuming nations.
Washington had sought a larger production boost, of at least two million barrels a day. But the Vienna decision is constructive and will take significant pressure off world oil prices, which may now stabilize around $25 a barrel. Gasoline prices, which reflect low inventories as well as expensive oil, will probably stay high for a few more months. But their inflationary impact on the American economy is likely to be relatively small.
After the oil shocks of the 1970's and early 1980's, the United States and other industrial countries undertook significant energy conservation measures, like raising automobile fuel economy standards. They also intensified efforts to discover and exploit new energy sources, including non-OPEC oil. With oil prices as low as they have been in recent years, conservation measures have lagged and the search for new supplies has slowed. By reviving these efforts, America can gain some protection against future oil price increases.

HEADLINE: Waiting for Oil Costs' Other Shoe

BYLINE: ByRICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: DALLAS, March 28

 BODY:
Donald Patman, a Texas farmer, is paying 40 cents a gallon more this year to fuel his diesel combines and tractors, adding as much as $240 a day to his costs during cotton-picking season. Soon he expects increases in the costs of pesticides and fertilizers to dent his budget even more. Pass the increases on to his customers? Forget it.
Officials at the H. B. Fuller Company, the St. Paul-based adhesives maker that sells mainly to other businesses, however, see some relief where Mr. Patman does not: they are raising prices 5 percent or more on many of their products to offset raw materials costs that have grown mainly because of higher petroleum prices. 
 And while the Centex Corporation, the Dallas builder, has watched suppliers raise prices as much as 5 percent for some petroleum-derived products, including carpets, Centex is not feeling the pain. It has purchase contracts that locked in lower prices for 6 to 12 months. After that, however, if oil prices remain high, the contract prices will probably rise also.
Though surging fuel prices and rising costs for chemicals, plastics, resins and other products have driven up expenses for many businesses, not all industries or companies have been affected equally.
And those that have suffered have not, by and large, passed along the higher costs; in part because global competition and a relatively strong dollar have made it unwise to raise prices.
Even inflation hawks, including Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, have noted that consumers have generally been spared, outside of direct expenses for gasoline and home heating oil. On Monday, Mr. Greenspan told a Senate panel that, so far, there was no significant evidence that higher energy costs were "in the process of embedding themselves in other areas of the economy and inflating the general price structure." And that is unlikely to occur, he added, if oil stays around the mid-$20-a-barrel level.
Yesterday, a majority of the members of OPEC agreed to reverse production cuts they made last year. Oil prices fell sharply earlier in the day, to about $27 a barrel, as traders anticipated the cartel would raise output. Still, oil is nearly twice as expensive as a year ago.
Many businesses have been able to cut other costs or increase productivity to offset the higher materials prices. But many others are swallowing the difference, at least for now: higher prices have already contributed to earnings disappointments at several companies, including Fuller and Procter & Gamble.
Within industries, too, oil prices have hit companies in sharply different ways. It is no surprise, for example, that the rise in fuel prices has stung the airlines, so, many have raised their ticket prices by about $20.
Five of the larger United States air carriers are expected to report either losses or very small profits for the first quarter, in large part because of the rise in jet fuel prices.
But some airlines are hurting more than others: US Airways Group, which had no hedges in place at year-end to protect against high fuel costs, experienced a 52 percent spike in its average price for a gallon of fuel from a year earlier. That contributed to a fourth-quarter loss.
In contrast, Delta Air Lines stunned analysts in January by reporting earnings per share that were 12 cents higher than expected, largely because of fuel hedging. For the quarter that ended in December, Delta's average cost rose just 6 percent and the airline reported a gain of $99 million on fuel-hedging contracts. Delta has three-quarters of its fuel requirements hedged for the rest of this fiscal year, which ends June 30, and 55 percent for next fiscal year.
Another industry hard hit by rising oil costs is freight transportation. Federal Express and others have responded by tacking on fuel surcharges to their rates.
But even that tactic does not guarantee earnings' protection. At J. B. Hunt Transport Services, a big trucking firm based in Lowell, Ark., fourth-quarter earnings per share fell 14 cents below what they otherwise would have been, the company said, despite fuel surcharges it added to customers' bills.
According to the Fed's most recent "beige book" report on the economy, some truckers indicate they are hurt more than might be expected because competition from rail carriers hampers their ability to pass on higher costs. Various groups of truckers have protested in Washington.
The beige book also noted that in the Southwest, some refiners have been pinched because prices for oil, their raw material, have risen faster than prices they charge for the fuels they produce. And oil services concerns continue to be frustrated by the surprisingly tepid pace of new exploration and development, as producers use cash flow to pay down debt instead of increasing their efforts to find more oil.
The big issue, if petroleum prices stay high, is whether manufacturers can continue to hold back prices, said David M. Jones, chief economist of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, the New York bond dealer.
"Businesses are having extreme difficulty in this world of intense global competition making price increases stick, and it's pretty much across the board, so they have to suffer with higher costs," Mr. Jones said. Oil plays a far smaller role today in the overall economy than it did the last time prices soared, in the late 1970's. But if high prices persist, many businesses will face a profit squeeze or "will try once again to make prices stick" -- spurring a reaction from the Fed if they succeed and inflation looms.
Indeed, Mr. Greenspan cautioned on Monday that crude oil "is still quite formidable." He added, "And there is no doubt in my mind that energy, which tends to cut across all aspects of this economy, if it gets sufficiently costly, could have materially negative effects."
Though that has not happened, many manufacturers are feeling squeezed. The National Association of Purchasing Management's price index rose again last month, to its highest reading in five years. That indicated that cost increases were still accelerating. Industries paying higher prices include clothing, electronic components and equipment, and rubber and plastic.
But manufacturers are mostly not charging more, because they feel they cannot.
Save for some notable exceptions, cost pressures have not torpedoed earnings yet. Edward M. Kerschner, PaineWebber's chief investment strategist, predicted on Monday that first-quarter earnings for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index would rise 15 percent from the period a year earlier.
Still, several recent surveys have found that manufacturing executives expect higher energy and related raw materials costs to crimp profits later this year.
Even though oil prices began rising a year ago, the increases are only now beginning to work their way down to some companies.
Some costs may not be felt soon for yet other reasons. For example, while the Labor Department reported that prices for electric power rose only slightly in the last year, the prices that electric utilities pay for natural gas rose by almost one-third. Natural gas-fired plants are the largest source of generation at many utilities, but increases in their rates often take months to get through commission rate hearings.
Ernie Goss, an economics professor at Creighton University in Omaha, said his monthly survey of 1,100 companies in nine Midwestern states found that only in the last month have many manufacturers begun to feel rising petroleum prices. "There were an unusually high number of manufacturers reporting that oil prices were really squeezing them," he said. "It was odd. We didn't see these comments till February."
A Dun & Bradstreet survey found that manufacturing executives believe that over the next three months rising materials costs will force either slimmer profits or higher prices for finished goods. David Kresge, Dun & Bradstreet's chief economist, said manufacturers reported only recently that they hoped to raise prices to offset higher costs. "Whether they are able to do that in the face of competition remains an open issue," Mr. Kresge said.
Temporary price increases can be swallowed by manufacturers, said Richard Edwards, director of investor relations at H. B. Fuller, whose stock dropped almost 20 percent earlier this month when it disclosed that first-quarter profits were likely to fall short of expectations. But, he added, "there's only so much that suppliers and manufacturers can absorb."
Mr. Patman, who farms about 6,000 acres near Waxahachie, Tex., about 30 miles south of Dallas, says the higher fuel prices have helped change his view of the business.
"For years, as you made less net profit per acre, you leased more land to maintain a certain income," he said. "But now, bigger is not better -- you have too much at stake out there," because one bad year can wipe out a farmer's equity in his equipment.
It would be a lot better if farmers could pass on some of the higher costs, he said, but they do not have the power to do so. Between the higher prices and the drought across the South and in the Midwest, Mr. Patman said, "I'm sure a lot of producers won't be able to stay in business" after this year.
Higher petroleum costs will cut $3 billion, or about 6 percent, from farmers' net cash income this year, if oil prices average $28 a barrel, estimates Terry Francl, a senior economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation in Chicago. But that is only the half of it: once stockpiles of fertilizers and pesticides are depleted, replacements could cost $800 million more later this year, and $2 billion to $3 billion more next year, he said.
According to a model prepared by the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve, it can take about nine months for the economy to feel a significant effect from higher oil prices, said Mine K. Yucel, head of the regional group of economists there.
But so far, competition has meant that businesses that cannot increase productivity or cut costs to offset higher prices "are suffering in terms of profits; they're eating it," Ms. Yucel said.

HEADLINE: No Relief at the Pumps Is Seen Until Fall

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: DALLAS, March 28

 BODY:
Regardless of how quickly oil-exporting nations can increase production, motorists in the United States may not get relief from high gasoline prices until this autumn at the earliest.
While the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries negotiated a new production agreement today, petroleum industry analysts said pump prices could remain at current levels for most of the summer, or even rise, because domestic supplies of gasoline and crude oil were severely depleted. 
 "What we're seeing now is inventories that look closer to what we'd expect after the summer driving season, rather than heading into it," said Jonathan Cogan, a spokesman for the United States Energy Information Administration, part of the Department of Energy.
As of mid-March, motor gasoline stocks were at 199.3 million barrels, compared with 221.6 million barrels at the same time last year, according to the agency. Similarly, crude-oil inventories had 292.6 million barrels at mid-March, compared with 330.9 million barrels last year.
It takes two months or so for Middle East oil to travel to the United States, be refined into gasoline, and make it to the gasoline pumps. But some analysts say an OPEC production increase might not have a noticeable effect on gasoline prices even after that time. Not only are domestic supplies already very low, but American consumers, feeling prosperous from the strong economy, are expected to take a lot of driving vacations this summer, regardless of the price. That will keep demand for fuel high.
"Almost any action taken now is an action that will have its greatest effect next fall or next winter," said Philip K. Verleger, a senior adviser to the Brattle Group, an economic consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.
Government forecasters have predicted that average retail gasoline prices could peak at $1.75 to $1.80 this summer. Prices could rise even more in some parts of the country, particularly California, which has requirements for cleaner-burning fuel.
Even with the run-up in gasoline prices, refiners have not been refining as much fuel as they can. The reason is that the price they have paid for crude oil, until recently, had risen faster than the prices for the refined products they sell, giving them less reason to produce more gasoline. In a report earlier this month, the International Energy Agency, which monitors petroleum consumption in developed countries, said this was an important reason why gasoline supplies in the United States were low.
On top of that, Mr. Verleger said, some lenders have grown more cautious with the credit lines that refiners use to buy crude oil because of the uncertainty over prices -- another reason why refiners have not been increasing production.
Mr. Verleger said any major refinery disruptions this summer -- including fires, maintenance and damage from Gulf Coast hurricanes -- could help drive up prices more.
"The direction of gas prices this summer will be determined primarily by the success of the refining industry," he said.
Political pressure has been building to release oil from the United States' Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Were that to happen, it could have a quicker impact on gasoline prices, he added, because it would take only a few weeks for that oil, which is in Louisiana and Texas, to flow to the market.

HEADLINE: Foundation Giving Is at $23 Billion High

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
Flush with ballooning endowments and new money from wealthy individuals and corporations, the nation's foundations set a record by giving away an estimated $22.8 billion in grants in 1999, according to a study to be released today.
Forced by law to give away larger and larger sums, many foundations are increasing the size of their donations, sometimes giving away tens of millions of dollars to a single charity. With greater resources, many are financing sweeping, ambitious programs in areas like education and health care rather than making what were often scattered and short-term grants in those fields. 
 Giving by every type of foundation has increased, according to the Foundation Center, the New York group that tracks foundation giving and conducted the study. The $22.8 billion in grants to nonprofit groups in 1999 compares with $19.5 billion in 1998. A decade ago, foundation giving was $8.7 billion.
"The increase in assets provides an incredible opportunity for the whole field," said Sara Engelhardt, president of the Foundation Center. The largest foundations may be able to accomplish goals on a scale not seen since the Carnegies and Rockefellers created their foundations earlier in the last century, she said.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for example, is tackling disease in developing countries by providing $750 million over five years to vaccinate children. "Scale is helpful when you can cause a bigger system change," said Patty Stonesifer, the co-chairwoman and president of the Gates Foundation, which is expected to give away about $1 billion in grants this year.
The foundation is also able to take a long view, supporting projects for as long as 20 years, in the case of its $1 billion scholarship program. By making a long-term commitment, the foundation can relieve the burden of many nonprofit groups, which "are always scrambling for resources," said Ms. Stonesifer.
Over all, the number of grants of $5 million or more is climbing sharply, according to a sample taken by the Foundation Center. While the number of such grants was under 50 for much of the early 1990's, it reached 147 in 1998.
The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, among the largest in the nation, spent $50 million over the last two years toward the purchase of 271,000 acres in California -- the rough equivalent of all of Los Angeles -- as part of its conservation efforts. The foundation hopes to preserve another 500,000 acres in the next few years.
Even much smaller community foundations are benefiting from a significant increase in resources, the result of the surging stock market and the largess of individual donors. "Every foundation that has invested in the equity market has had 10 years of galloping growth, especially in recent years," said Jack Shakely, president of the California Community Foundation, which has $525 million in assets.
The foundation, based in Los Angeles, now finances projects over several years instead of committing a single year at a time. Excited about the prospect of a new project to give books to children as a way to encourage reading, for example, the foundation was able to pledge $1.5 million over three years.
In Ohio, foundations including the Cleveland Foundation, whose assets have climbed by more than 50 percent over the last five years, have committed $10 million toward a $40 million initiative by Cuyahoga County to provide health care and child care for very young children.
Much of the rise in giving nationwide is a result of the soaring value of foundation endowments, which reached $385 billion at the end of 1998, the latest figure available, according to the center. By law, most foundations are required to give away at least 5 percent of their assets each year or run afoul of the Internal Revenue Service.
But large donations to foundations and the formation of new foundations are also fueling the increase, according to the center. The number of foundations has more than doubled since 1980 to nearly 47,000, and newly active foundations were responsible for one-fifth of the rise in foundation giving from 1997 to 1998.
Corporate foundations increased the amount they made in grants by a record 22 percent to an estimated $3 billion last year, according to the center. Many of them are also making larger gifts. The Bank of America Foundation, for example, is giving $50 million over five years to United Way of America to help children learn to read and get vaccinations.
"We don't want the margarine approach," said Caroline Boitano, executive director for the Bank of America Foundation, referring to giving that is spread out thinly among numerous causes.
The surge in the amount of money available for giving causes some concerns for foundations. The Packard foundation, for example, gave away about $400 million in grants in 1999, more than double the amount it gave away just two years ago. "It is a challenge for any organization to go through the kind of growth we have," acknowledged Richard Schlosberg III, president of the foundation, which increased its staff last year by about 25 percent to 150 people and expects a similar increase this year.
The Lilly Endowment also saw its giving climb steeply, by about two- thirds from the previous year to $425 million in 1998. The foundation now routinely gives away amounts like $50 million to the Hispanic Scholarship Fund and $30 million to the American Indian College Fund, compared with five years ago when its largest grant was about $6 million. Lilly has also significantly increased its giving to community foundations in Indiana, where it is based.
The tendency to give larger grants, often to large charities with national agendas, gives some cause for concern. "It can be counter to what people see as strategic grant making," said Ms. Engelhardt of the Foundation Center. Foundations may "look for more of the sure bets," established charities, rather than fostering experiments or creativity by financing small nonprofit organizations.
The rise in assets has also caused some individuals to call on foundations to give away more than the minimum required by law. The California Community Foundation, for example, gives away what it calls a "community dividend" with some of the money its investments have generated in recent years.
"I think foundations have a responsibility to get that money out and get it percolated," Mr. Shakely said.

Slouching Toward '92

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In a droll speech to a ballroom full of journalists and pols at the Gridiron dinner last Saturday night, Al Gore confided his "secret" plan for winning the White House.
He would associate himself with the good stuff that has happened during the last eight years and disassociate himself from the bad stuff. 
 "A low unemployment rate and a sound economy? Clinton-Gore," he said. "Grand jury testimony? Clinton . . . Impeachment? Not me."
The vice president was mocking his own image as an opportunist. He was also ribbing his Republican rival, whose campaign is based on the assumption that everyone is fed up with "the Clinton-Gore era."
But America is bursting with contentment. Our only worry is a new malady that The L.A. Times calls "sudden wealth syndrome," the ennui that comes from making too many millions too fast.
People scorned Bill Clinton's morals. But they love his economy, and the way he tackles hard things, like the Middle East, Ireland and guns.
If W. keeps banking on disgust with Clinton-Gore to propel him to the White House, he'll lose.
"It won't work to connect Gore to Clinton," a Gore adviser says. "It didn't even work to connect Clinton to Clinton."
The Republicans tried to run against Bill Clinton's character in '92, '96 and '98. It didn't work.
So it is truly remarkable that W. is repeating the willful mistakes of '92, given that the loss was so searing.
The father thought: I can't lose to a low-class hick from Arkansas. Now the son thinks: I can't lose to a cutthroat phony who did stinky things with a low class-hick from Arkansas.
The contempt of the Bushes blinds them to the need to fight harder, fight sooner and fight smarter.
After he soared to 90 percent with his victory in the Persian Gulf, the father coasted, failing to capitalize with any grand domestic plans.
W. coasts also, on his first national run (compared with four for Mr. Gore). He does not go on the offensive or offer much substance. He does not communicate in any interesting way, or outline core principles. He merely waits for the public to realize he is the better man. His campaign is like the Cheshire cat, fading to a smirk.
He parrots sound bites about reform, but he doesn't have the foggiest notion of why John McCain evoked such excitement. The governor finally deigned to call the senator yesterday, after prodding by Bob Dole.
Asked by The Times about the McCain phenomenon, Mr. Bush replied curtly: "Well, then how come he didn't win?"
As Lars-Erik Nelson wrote, it was an eerie echo of the comeback favored by Bush senior when he rejected advice in '92: "If you're so smart, why aren't you president?"
W. appealed to Republicans because he was a baby boomer, but he keeps Reagan hours. You picture Al up all night plotting. (You know Karenna has already chosen the convention theme song.) You picture W. hugging his pillow and belittling his rivals for being too hungry. But voters like to see a little gumption.
W. thinks the vice president will come off as duplicitous for pouncing on campaign finance reform. He thinks the words "Buddhist temple" will end any argument. But the Republican can't play the purist. Voters know he shot the moon on campaign money, too. And Americans believe in redemption. A real crack at a campaign finance plan from Gore the reformed sinner is still better than W.'s empty-shell proposal.
His insular Austin team keeps trying to graft a campaign onto a brand name. Realizing how hard it is to get Bush the Younger intellectually engaged, his advisers have reshaped his campaign to be about the one subject -- besides baseball -- in which he seems fluent: education. But his big speech yesterday, reviving his mother's pet issue, literacy, does not a vision-thing make.
Like his father's, W.'s basic message is: Trust me -- I've been bred for this job. Like Bill Bradley, W. is counting on Mr. Gore's smarmy, Eddie Haskell personality to rub people the wrong way.
But W. is expecting Americans to get riled up about what they already know. He might take a page from Bill Clinton: Elections are always about the future, not the past.

HEADLINE: Restaurant and Bar Workers Who Get Tips May Also Get Lesser Increase in Minimum Wage

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 28

 BODY:
On Friday, the minimum wage will rise for New York's lowest-paid workers, but lawmakers plan to prevent the absolute lowest wage earners, restaurant and bar employees who earn tips, from collecting the entire increase.
Under a combination of federal and state laws, restaurants and bars in New York can pay their workers as little as $2.90 an hour if they also earn tips, a wage that has not changed in nine years. On Friday, the minimum for some groups of workers will rise to $5.15 an hour from $4.25, and the minimum for those who make tips is slated to increase to $3.52 from $2.90. 
 But the Democrats who control the Assembly, including Speaker Sheldon Silver, want to set a new minimum for restaurant and bar workers who earn tips at $3.30, not $3.52. Until last week, they proposed freezing the wage at $2.90.
The Assembly is expected to pass the bill Wednesday or Thursday, said Patricia Lynch, spokeswoman for Mr. Silver. The speaker's office declined to discuss the rationale for the bill. The Republican-controlled State Senate has approved a bill freezing the minimum for tipped workers at $2.90. Michael McKeon, spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki, said that the governor supports the idea of setting the wage below $3.52, but that he objects to some technical provisions of the Assembly bill.
The debate pits some of the Democrats' traditional constituencies, low-wage workers and unions, against powerful small-business lobbying groups. It also strikes a dissonant note at a time when the economic talk is of stock options, dot-coms and full employment -- a reminder that in the service economy, low wages persist even in rosy times.
"I make $200, $250 a week, with tips," said Fernando, a Colombian immigrant who buses tables in a downtown Manhattan restaurant, and asked that his surname not be used for fear he would lose his job. "I have a wife and two children. It's not enough."
Ed Donnelly, legislative director of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O., said, "To take the lowest-paid worker, a waitress in a greasy spoon, and convene the best minds in the Capitol to rob her of a quarter, to me is immoral."
But restaurant owners insist that workers have done well in the booming economy. "We don't think those people need a statutorily authorized 62-cent-an-hour increase in pay," said Scott Wexler, executive director of the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association, which represents 5,000 small businesses. "For our average member, that would cost $15,000 a year."
He said that among his group's members, employees who are paid $2.90 an hour actually earn, on average, $10 an hour with tips. But a 1997 survey by the State Department of Labor found that the average income for waiters and waitresses was $6.34 an hour, with tips.
The "tipped wage" varies enormously from state to state, and New York's ranks 17th. The highest minimum is $6.50 in Washington State, which does not differentiate between tip earners and others. The low is $2.13, in several states, including New Jersey. Connecticut's is $4.73.
Federal law sets the minimum wage for most workers at $5.15, but it allows states to set lower minimums for a few categories of workers. (A handful of states actually have higher minimums than the federal standard.) New York's minimum wage has stood at $4.25 an hour since 1991.
In December, state lawmakers raised the minimum to $5.15 from $4.25, effective March 31. Under a 1991 ruling by the State Department of Labor, that would automatically raise the wage for workers who make tips, by the same percentage, to $3.52 from $2.90. The current bills would overturn that rule.

Pursuing Happiness

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
The big winner at the Oscars was "American Beauty," a film based on the daring and original premise that material possessions don't bring happiness. Oh, well. Anyway, not all trite ideas are wrong. In fact, there is quite a lot of evidence indicating that, sure enough, money doesn't buy happiness -- or at least not so you'd notice.
At this point I could cite the accumulated wisdom of the ages -- but hey, it's the modern world, so let's talk about the polls. Since World War II, random samples of people in the United States and elsewhere have repeatedly been asked how happy they are. When the economic historian Richard Easterlin surveyed these surveys in a classic 1974 paper, he formulated what has come to be known as the "Easterlin paradox": Basically, above a very low level economic growth does not seem to improve human welfare. Later evidence confirms his observation. Americans were no more likely to describe themselves as happy in the 1990's than they had been in the 1940's. Even the Japanese, who went from near-third-world conditions to widespread affluence between the 1950's and the 1980's, did not become happier. 
 Mr. Easterlin argued that the reason economic growth doesn't make us happier is that people judge themselves largely by their position relative to other people. Someone with an income of $32,000 in a society where the median is $40,000 feels as socially disadvantaged as someone with an income of $8,000 in a society where the median is $10,000; so even quadrupling people's real income may not make much difference in how they feel. Other evidence suggests that even relative income makes less difference than most of us imagine: the rich are happier than you and I, but not very much so.
In a recent paper David Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald estimated "happiness equations" from American and British survey data. They found that when you carefully control for other things, more money actually does make people a bit happier -- but its influence is swamped by non-pecuniary factors. Being married is far more important than being rich; having a job is much more important than how much the job pays.
So what are the implications? Anti-growth types tend to like the Easterlin paradox; they see it as yet another reason to favor the simple, ecologically sound life. Milder sorts like Robert Frank, author of the book "Luxury Fever," argue that if people care about their relative position -- as they clearly do -- then conspicuous consumption is not just in bad taste but a sort of psychological pollution, as real in its adverse impact as acid rain. The answer? A highly progressive tax system, which Mr. Frank supports for the same reason The Wall Street Journal opposes it -- that it reduces the incentive to make more money.
But before you denounce (or applaud) happiness research as leftist propaganda, be aware that it also cuts the other way. For example, how do you feel about the "living wage" movement, which in effect wants a large increase in the minimum wage? That would certainly increase the incomes of the lowest-paid workers; but it would also surely have at least some adverse effect on the number of jobs available. You may think that a price worth paying -- but the equations say that the extra unemployment would be a very bad thing for those who lose their jobs, while a higher wage would make only a small difference to the happiness of those who remain employed.
Or think of it this way. If you don't want a society in which everyone is desperately trying to get ahead in a zero-sum status game, you might advocate government policies that slow down the rat race: high tax rates, generous health and unemployment benefits, long mandatory paid vacations, maybe even a limit on individual working hours. In other words, you might want to turn America into France. But France has an unemployment rate more than twice as high as America's, largely because of those same government policies. And unemployment -- even comfortable European-style unemployment -- makes people very unhappy, because it is demoralizing.
Is there any way out of the dilemma? Well, East Germany had full employment without a rat race -- but it fell a bit short in the life and liberty departments. I'd say that given the alternatives, the American system, though not beautiful, still takes the prize.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
Citing a Crisis, Bush Proposes Literacy Effort

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: MANVILLE, N.J., March 28

 BODY:
Once again mooring a traditionally Democratic issue to the agenda of his Republican presidential campaign, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas today proposed a five-year, $5 billion program to address what he termed a national literacy crisis among children.
Mr. Bush said the program would provide grants to states to test reading in kindergarten and first grade, to make tutoring available to poor readers and to train teachers. He soberly contrasted the nation's economic success with its educational failings, and declared that he would bring the same improvements in reading on the national level that he said he had achieved in Texas. 
 He said every child should know how to read by third grade, and vowed that states that failed to improve student performance would lose federal aid.
"There is nothing more fundamental than teaching our children how to read," Mr. Bush said in a speech this afternoon in Reston, Va., the first in a series of events this week intended to spotlight his commitment to improving education.
"America must confront a national emergency," he said. "Too many of our children cannot read. In the highest-poverty schools -- I want you to hear this statistic -- in the highest-poverty schools in America, 68 percent of fourth graders could not read at a basic level in 1998."
Aides to Mr. Bush said his plan would help roughly 900,000 children with poor reading skills, at a cost of $1,000 per child per year for tutoring and other assistance. Besides that $900 million, an additional $100 million a year would go to testing and teacher training.
The Bush plan was quickly dismissed by aides to the apparent Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Al Gore. They sought to shift attention to Mr. Bush's tax-cut proposal, saying it would leave no money for new education initiatives.
Since the fall, Mr. Bush has introduced a variety of education proposals, but none of the others would entail spending anywhere close to the $5 billion he spoke of today. That sum in turn is dwarfed by the $115 billion that Mr. Gore would spend for new education initiatives over 10 years, and the disparity in the size of the two candidates' approaches highlights the challenge facing Mr. Bush: convincing voters that he can lead the nation to new educational excellence without spending huge new sums, which would clash with his broader fiscal policies.
Mr. Bush introduced his plan as his party continued to close ranks around him. Tonight Steve Forbes, who had attacked the governor as insufficiently conservative before withdrawing from his own race for the Republican nomination, endorsed the governor here at a meeting of the Somerset County Republican Party.
"As the American people are learning, and will learn," Mr. Forbes said at the meeting, in his home state, "he is a good man. He has been tested -- I tried to test him -- and he emerged the stronger for it."
Mr. Bush's chief rival during the primary season, Senator John McCain of Arizona, has resisted endorsing him, but Mr. Bush called Mr. McCain today in an apparent effort to salve some of the lingering wounds. Mr. Bush said he hoped that the two would meet soon, and described the conversation as amiable.
"John and I both understand that the past is the past and it's time to move forward," Mr. Bush told reporters aboard his campaign plane.
Mr. Bush's speech in Virginia offered striking evidence of a return to his original campaign strategy -- positioning himself as a soft-edged, centrist Republican -- after he veered to the right in the primaries to fend off Mr. McCain.
In that talk today, to a coalition of Asian-American groups at the headquarters of the Student Loan Marketing Association, the federally sponsored provider of student loans, he proclaimed that the federal government had to redouble its efforts to confront the educational plight of poor people.
"We will not tolerate illiteracy amongst the disadvantaged students in the great country called America," he said. "I know this is something a little new. Others have proposed throwing money at the problem. But they have proposed resources without reform. That approach has no history of results, and really no prospect of success. Under my plan, new resources will be an instrument of reform, not another investment in failure."
In echo of language once used by the Kerner Commission to describe the country's racial chasm, Mr. Bush said: "More and more we are divided into two nations: one that reads and one that can't, and therefore one that dreams and one that doesn't. Reading is the basis for all learning, and it must be the foundation for all other education reforms."
Still, Mr. Bush is not abandoning his belief that the federal government should not meddle in what, he says, is rightly a state and local issue. This evening, at a fund-raiser in Parsippany, N.J., with Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, he declared, as he often did during the primaries, that he did not want to be the "federal superintendent of schools."
"You are looking at the wrong man if you want me to be the national principal," he said. "I believe in local control of schools. The best education policy is that which bubbles up from the bottom."
Indeed, Mr. Bush has shaped his education proposals as a whole around the notion that the states should have more leeway in spending federal dollars, as well as the idea that schools must be held more accountable for their performance. He would encourage the creation of charter schools and has also proposed a voucher program for students of poorly performing public schools. He has urged too that Head Start, the early-childhood development program, be primarily a literacy program.
In his speech in Virginia, Mr. Bush's tone was largely conciliatory; he barely mentioned Mr. Gore.
But the Gore campaign showed no such reticence. Douglas Hattaway, a campaign spokesman, said that the governor's plan would be ineffective and that given his tax cut, "he won't have the money to pay for a new initiative like this without dipping into the Social Security surplus or going back to deficit spending."

SIDE BY SIDE
Comparing Two Plans for Education
 
Since the fall, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore have made several proposals on education.
 
Mr. Bush would:
nProvide students in low-performing schools that fail to improve after three years $1,500 a year for use at a parochial or other private school or for tutoring. Money would be drawn from the Title I program, for schools in poor districts.
nRequire students in Grades 3 through 8 to be tested in reading and math, with states and districts drawing up tests. States would have to publish report cards with annual test results.
nSpend nearly $1 billion a year for five years to diagnose reading problems in kindergartners and first graders and enable districts to create programs to elevate literacy.
nMake the Head Start early-childhood development program primarily a literacy program.
nMake available $3 billion of loan guarantees to help establish or improve 2,000 charter schools.
nRaise the annual contributions parents can make to education savings accounts to $5,000 from $500 per student.
 
Mr. Gore would:
nOppose school vouchers.
nSpend $115 billion over 10 years, $50 billion of it to make pre-school available to all 4-year-olds and many 3-year-olds by 2004.
nHelp families pay for college by making up to $10,000 of tuition and fees tax deductible, providing up to $2,800 a year in tax relief for each family.
nUse $25 billion in bonds to pay for new school construction and modernization.
nSupport a national teacher corps that would provide college aid or "signing bonuses" to 75,000 people who agree to teach in schools in inner cities or rural areas.
nProvide aid to schools that come up with their own plans to reduce class size or to reduce the size of schools.
nIncrease salaries for teachers in districts that adopt aggressive plans to increase the quality of teachers and that also get rid of low-performing teachers.(pg. A20)

HEADLINE: Agency Votes To Accept Bid For 2 A-Plants

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Capping an unlikely bidding war, the New York Power Authority voted yesterday to sell its two nuclear plants to a Mississippi company for $967 million in what would be by far the largest sale of nuclear reactors in United States history.
The winning bid by Entergy Nuclear, of Jackson, Miss., for the Indian Point 3 plant in Buchanan, in Westchester County, and the James A. FitzPatrick plant in Oswego County, broke ground in myriad ways. It was the largest sale of a public asset in New York State history. It was the first transaction involving the privatization of a publicly run nuclear plant in the country. And the $967 million price tag was at least four times as much as any previous sale of a nuclear plant, based on dollars per generating capacity. 
 It may have been the ultimate sign of the resuscitation of an industry once thought to be too moribund, costly and unsafe to continue operating that the sale yesterday occurred on the 21st anniversary of the industry's darkest moment in the United States: the Three Mile Island partial core meltdown in Pennsylvania.
Entergy's offer topped an unsolicited, last-minute offer from Dominion Resources of Richmond, Va., valued at $946 million. Both offers are at levels far below what was invested to build the plants. In that sense, the offers reflected the depths to which nuclear power had fallen as well as its improved safety record since Three Mile Island and the improved prospects for keeping aging nuclear plants in operation.
But the fact that there were two major companies dueling for two plants with spotty records illuminated how utility deregulation and rock-bottom prices helped provide a market for plants that in the past might not have found a buyer.
"There was no market a year and a half ago," said Clarence D. Rappleyea, the chairman and chief executive of the power authority, at a signing ceremony after the trustees' meeting in Manhattan.
But like any enormous transaction involving real estate -- much less one with thousands of employees -- this one is fraught with potential pitfalls. So how the transfer of ownership, expected to take six months, plays out may affect the structuring of deals for plants like the two Millstone reactors for sale in Waterford, Conn., and Consolidated Edison's Indian Point 2 plant in Buchanan, next to Indian Point 3.
"This is unique," Mr. Rappleyea said. "This is not anything that there's a road map to. I guess we're cutting new trail here."
For the power authority, the proposed sale, which is still subject to approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, would free resources to pay the remaining debt of $316 million on Indian Point 3, and to focus more on economic development and energy efficiency, Mr. Rappleyea said.
Eventually, Mr. Rappleyea predicted, there will be a "distinct possibility" that the sale will result in lower electric bills.
For Entergy, a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation in New Orleans, the sale would put it in a commanding position to dominate the nuclear power industry in New York State. The company is already bidding to operate two other upstate plants, the Nine Mile Point reactors, which are adjacent to the Fitzpatrick plant in Scriba, on Lake Ontario.
And yesterday, Entergy offered its bluntest statement about its interest in the troubled Indian Point 2 plant, which had a radiation leak last month at its Hudson River site, about 35 miles north of New York City.
"We would very much like to buy that plant and put these two plants with some synergies, pull them back together, and operate them the way they were originally designed to operate, as a single entity," said Jerry W. Yelverton, the chief executive of Entergy Nuclear, referring to Indian Point 2 and 3. (Indian Point 1 closed in 1974.)
Some watchdogs of nuclear power, though, were ambivalent about the sale. For months, many legislators, environmentalists and professors criticized the bidding process as being less than competitive and open, since Entergy was the preferred choice all along. And yesterday, some said that while the $967 million figure sounded impressive, it was almost $200 million more than Entergy's original bid -- and stoked speculation as to what a thoroughly open process might have produced.
"We would've been better off putting this on eBay in the beginning, and letting the market drive the price," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation.
Mr. Brodsky also questioned why the five trustees, all Republicans, did not delay their decision another month or so to consider the deal's financial ramifications. But Mr. Rappleyea said that the longer the board waited, the less likely it would be able to close the deal before a scheduled refueling at the FitzPatrick plant this fall -- a possible $30 million expense.
Under the deal, Entergy would pay $636 million for the plants, $171 for nuclear fuel stockpiles, $92 million for eventual decommissioning expenses and $68 million in return for the power authority's commitment to buy more electricity in the future.
Entergy would also guarantee employment, and no contractual changes, for the 1,700 workers -- almost half of whom are unionized -- at the two plants and the power authority's office in White Plains.
The power authority is expected to pay most of the costs of the eventual decommissioning, and has been building a fund, now valued at $630 million, in anticipation of those obligations. By 2015, when the licenses of both plants are to expire, that fund is expected to be worth $1.9 billion -- more than enough to cover the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's projection of $1.18 billion to decommission the plants.
But if that fund were subject to taxes because the public power authority sold its plants to a private entity, or if that fund were counted as taxable income for the new owner, then taxes would sap that $1.9 billion. And while that possibility is highly unlikely, the possible exposure to as much as $250 million in tax liability proved to be a crucial turning point in favor of Entergy, because Entergy had said it would assume that liability, while Dominion had not.
Yesterday, the board was careful to praise both bids as tremendous. But Dominion, clearly, felt that it had not gotten a fair shot.
"We are disappointed that N.Y.P.A. presented us with a complex tax issue at the 11th hour of its meeting on March 20 and gave us only eight days to resolve it," Thomas E. Capps, Dominion's president and chief executive, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: WITH IRAN BALKING, OPEC NATIONS PLAN TO SELL MORE OIL

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: VIENNA, Wednesday, March 29

 BODY:
After two days of disputes, OPEC decided today to increase oil production without the participation of its second-largest producer, Iran. But the increase was not what the United States had pressed for, and was not expected to bring down gasoline prices any time soon.
In a rare break in the solidarity of its ranks, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced that nine of its members would raise production by a total of 1.45 million barrels a day, despite bitter opposition from Iran to any increase. The higher production would begin next month. 
 With Iran, the total would have been about 1.7 million barrels, but analysts said the actual increase would end up significantly higher because other OPEC members were likely to seize the opportunity to cheat on their quotas to fill the gap left by Iran.
The United States had pressed for increases of up to 2.5 million barrels a day to reduce gasoline prices, which have soared to more than $1.60 a gallon in most cities. Iran's irritation at the American pressures was apparently one reason behind its opposition to any increase.
Experts estimated that it would take at least six to eight weeks before any additional oil production found its way to the gasoline pumps, and with inventories already unusually low in the United States as the summer driving season approaches, gasoline prices are not expected to decline soon. In fact, some analysts predicted, they would rise still more before easing by fall. Page A10.
"Anybody who expects to get back to gasoline at $1 or $1.20 a gallon will be seriously disappointed," said Raad Alkadiri, an analyst at Petroleum Finance Company, an industry research firm based in Washington. "Whatever happens, you're going to have a tight gasoline market this summer."
The agreement to increase daily production quotas by 1.45 million barrels is somewhat misleading. OPEC countries are already exceeding their production limits by about one million barrels a day and much of that output will simply be absorbed within the higher limits.
The Clinton administration, however, was optimistic about the effects of the increase and said that several other oil-producing nations that do not belong to OPEC would also increase output. "I think our quiet diplomacy worked," said Bill Richardson, the energy secretary, at a White House briefing on Tuesday evening.
Mr. Richardson said that when all sources of production were taken into account, "we will be well above our objective." He and other officials pointed out that prices were already down, to about $27 a barrel from a high of $34 a barrel, in anticipation of more production.
In New York trading on Tuesday, crude oil for May delivery fell 70 cents, to $27.09 a barrel.
The unusual break in OPEC ranks came after two days of wrangling between Iran and Saudi Arabia, the largest producer, which pushed for an increase in production. In the end, OPEC announced that 9 of its 11 members would go ahead and increase their quotas. The production of Iraq, which says it now produces 2.4 million barrels a day, has been separately governed by United Nations resolutions since the 1991 Persian Gulf war. Iraq said tonight that it planned to significantly increase its production by the end of the year, but experts were skeptical.
The fissure with Iran has major implications for the United States. Indeed, the battle within OPEC was as much political as economic, and much of the debate was over whether the group would be capitulating to pressure from the United States for lower oil prices.
It was OPEC's decision to cut production last year, joined by several non-OPEC nations like Mexico and Norway, that sent oil and gasoline prices soaring.
Today's split could damage OPEC's discipline and credibility, just as the organization seemed to have regained some of the power it had in the 1970's and early 1980's.
Iran's oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zangeneh, accused the other OPEC countries of trying to ram through decisions that were not justified by economic conditions. "OPEC is not an organization to rubber-stamp the decisions already made," Mr. Zangeneh said in a short but biting statement about 1 a.m. today.
"We tried to show our flexibility," he continued. "OPEC needs a spirit of compromise, which unfortunately we didn't trace at this time."
If OPEC's discipline does come unhinged, the United States could be a major beneficiary and see its bill for imported oil drop. In the past, when OPEC failed to agree on production limits, prices have plummeted as production soared.
"OPEC had a commendable record in the past year, and now one of its founding members is not taking part in their agreement," said Gary N. Ross, chief executive of PIRA Energy Group, an oil industry research firm based in Manhattan.
Today's split comes after a bitter test of wills between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which was determined to reverse the production cuts of last year and allow the price of oil to settle at about $25 a barrel, compared with about $27.50 today and its recent high of $34 in early March.
Saudi officials wanted to raise production, partly because the United States is its biggest market and partly because of concern about political wrath from Congress, where some lawmakers have pushed for legislation to block aid and sales of military equipment to OPEC nations.
Iranian leaders, on the other hand, had angrily denounced American and Saudi demands and insisted that OPEC should not make decisions in response to political pressure.
Oil experts and Saudi leaders argued here that Iran was already producing virtually all the oil it could pump, about 3 million barrels a day, and any increase in production would come from other countries -- Saudi Arabia in particular -- leading to lower prices that could only hurt Iran.
Saudi Arabia, with a daily output of 7.6 million barrels, has enough spare capacity to flood world markets in a matter of weeks.
The Clinton administration has been lobbying OPEC leaders intensively for the last several weeks, arguing that the world markets needed more oil to meet demand and to restore depleted inventories.
It has been clear that OPEC would not go as far as the United States desired, but Saudi Arabia had managed to persuade all other members except Iran to reverse the cuts they had imposed on themselves last year.
The Saudis have made it clear that they want the price of oil to settle near $25 a barrel, a price they say could be sustained and would allow the United States and other major oil-consuming countries to rebuild badly depleted inventories.
Even with the agreement this morning, many OPEC leaders were still fuming about what they viewed as heavy-handed pressure from Washington that only made their own political situation more awkward.
Venezuelan leaders, taking a cue from their outspoken president, Hugo Chavez, have been particularly sensitive about being portrayed as puppets of the American government, and went out of their way last week to criticize lobbying efforts by Mr. Richardson, the energy secretary. Venezuela is one of the top suppliers of crude oil to the United States.
On Monday, Iranian officials almost gleefully pounced on the issue of American pressure when Mr. Richardson reportedly called the oil minister of Qatar, another OPEC member, just as he was meeting with his counterparts.
Though modest, the proposed increases are still important. Indeed, oil prices have already drifted down about 18 percent since March 8, to about $28 a barrel from $34, and most of that decline reflected the anticipation that OPEC would agree on an increase of roughly that magnitude.
But the increase would also fall well short of what the Saudis envisioned. Experts said it would provide only a modest relief in gasoline prices.
Rilwanu Lukman, secretary general of OPEC, tried to put the best possible face on today's split, noting that countries have on occasion dissented from the organization's decisions before.
"We will remain as a group despite all of these tensions," he said after Iran announced that it would not join in the agreement. "Many people wrote off OPEC many years ago, and we're still here."

HEADLINE: Seeing the Future in an Old Triumph: Trolleys

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: BAYONNE, N.J., March 28

 BODY:
A half-century after the region's last streetcar tracks were torn up to make way for more cars and buses, New Jersey officials are set to open the first leg of a $1.1 billion trolley system along the Hudson River. It will carry 25,000 riders a day, and the entire project, when completed in 2010, is expected to move more than 100,000 people through the most densely populated region in the state.
The Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, which will carry its first fare-paying passenger on April 15, is the metropolitan region's most ambitious public transportation project since the 1960's, the largest public works program in New Jersey history and an intriguing look at the prospects for a transit system long deemed a part of the past, not the future. Officials say they hope the system will one day extend across New Jersey, linking light rail systems that are on the drawing board in other parts of the state. 
 "This is one of those infrastructure investments you make at the beginning of a century that serves you throughout the century," said the state's transportation commissioner, James Weinstein.
Whether enough commuters can be coaxed out of their cars to make the system a success remains to be seen. But officials say they believe that when completed, the 20.5-mile system will not only persuade commuters to leave their cars at home, relieving clogged roads and easing polluted air, but will also spur redevelopment in places that have missed out on the region's economic boom.
Ten years in the making, the line will initially feed into the ferries and PATH trains that carry tens of thousands of commuters to jobs in Manhattan as well as those who work along New Jersey's booming Hudson River waterfront. Once a wasteland of abandoned rail yards and rotting piers, the so-called Gold Coast in Hudson County has been transformed over the last two decades into a new city of office towers and luxury apartment buildings.
But until now, there has been no easy way to move north and south, something that frustrates many of the 31,000 people who travel to jobs on the waterfront. "Without this rail line, we'll drown in our success," said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, the ranking Democrat on the Senate's Transportation Appropriation subcommittee who helped secure more than half the project's financing from the federal government.
More than just making the commute easier for white-collar workers, transportation planners see the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail as a lifeline to places that have long been cut off from most of the region's jobs. Until now, for example, residents of Bayonne who worked in Manhattan had to endure an hour bus ride. Starting April 15, the light rail will cut that commute in half.
For mass transit advocates, the Hudson-Bergen line's birth is somewhat bittersweet. Before the car became king in the years after World War II, this heavily urbanized wedge of New Jersey was crisscrossed by trolley car lines, nearly all of them ending at the waterfront, where riders could hop a train or ferry to Manhattan. "We've clearly come full circle," said Martin Robins, director of the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University.
The concept of light rail was born in the 1970's, when engineers began marrying new technology with the traditional streetcar. The cars, which run on low-voltage electric lines, can quickly accelerate to 55 miles per hour, effortlessly climb hills and brake faster than a bus. And unlike commuter rail or subway lines, which often take decades to plan and build, light rail lines can be laid out on existing streets with minimal disruption. In the case of the Hudson-Bergen line, more than 17 of its 20 miles of track were set on rail beds that had been abandoned decades ago.
Most important, light rail advocates say, the lines are far less expensive to build than subways, "which makes them very attractive to both taxpayers and politicians," said David Phelps, a light rail specialist at the American Public Transportation Association in Washington.
Spurred by increasing traffic congestion and decreasing air quality, two dozen American cities now have light rail systems, among them such car-dependent stalwarts as Dallas, Los Angeles and Denver. Another dozen systems, Mr. Phelps said, are being planned or built. "The verdict so far has been almost unanimously favorable," he said.
Not everyone is so optimistic.
Alan E. Pisarski, a transportation specialist and the author of the book "Commuting in America," said cities like Buffalo and Baltimore have found that their initial ridership estimates were wildly overstated. As in many parts of the country, more and more New Jersey residents are commuting from suburb to suburb, not from suburb to city. Such commuters, he said, cannot be served by light rail. "I don't think light rail is a slam-dunk solution to the problem of congestion," he said.
Still, some developers are already betting on the project. On Jersey City's Martin Luther King Boulevard, one of the area's most neglected neighborhoods, a new shopping center recently opened next to a light rail station. A dozen blocks away, not far from a vast expanse of metal scrap yards and vacant warehouses, the sleek black-and-white cars glide past wooden skeletons for dozens of luxury town houses.
"The light rail will open up sites for development that until now have been virtually inaccessible," said Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who took a ride on the line this afternoon.
Transit officials plan to run the trains every seven and a half minutes at rush hour and every 15 minutes at other times. Jeffrey A. Warsh, the executive director of New Jersey Transit, said the $1.50 one-way fare comes down to 60 cents if passengers use a monthly pass, which costs $53 and allows for free transfers to local buses.
In addition to the 12 stations opening next month, four more stops along the Jersey City and Hoboken waterfronts will open by 2002, linking the system to New Jersey Transit's commuter rail terminus and the half-dozen Manhattan-bound ferries operated by New York Waterway. In 2010, when the line is scheduled to reach the Vince Lombardi Park and Ride station in suburban Ridgefield, transit officials said, it will carry more passengers than all of New Jersey Transit's rail lines combined.

Births Rose in 1998; First Increase Since 1990

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
Propelled by a strong economy and an increase in the number of women of childbearing age, births in the United States rose 2 percent in 1998, the first increase since 1990, the government reported today.
Births to unwed mothers reached an all-time high, but researchers said it was single women in their 20's and 30's, not teenagers, who were responsible for the boomlet. 
 There were 3.94 million births in 1998, or about 14.6 for every 1,000 people, the report by the National Center for Health Statistics showed. In 1997, 3.88 million children were born, and the rate of births was slightly lower at 14.5 per 1,000.
The increase was the first since 1990, when 4.1 million children were born.

HEADLINE: ARTS IN AMERICA;
A Detroit Museum on the Rebound With van Gogh

BYLINE: By Keith Bradsher 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 28

 BODY:
Great museums acquire their reputations not just through the size and quality of their collections but through the special exhibitions they organize, borrowing works from around the world. Even fairly small museums have won fame by wheedling prized artworks from scattered institutions and bringing them together briefly for the world to see.
By contrast, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the fifth-largest art museum in the nation in terms of floor space and the largest west of the Appalachians, has drifted into obscurity because financial troubles prevented it from initiating any major exhibitions for the last 14 years. But a new management structure and a big infusion of cash from private donors have brought the museum back from the brink of closing, allowing it to organize a major exhibition of paintings and drawings by van Gogh that opened on March 12. 
"Van Gogh: Face to Face" has been an instant hit. More than a third of the tickets have been sold for the show, which runs through June 4 before moving to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and then the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
The institute has temporarily stopped closing on Mondays and Tuesdays, as visitors from southeastern Michigan and a sprinkling of people from elsewhere cause traffic jams and parking shortages in the once-desolate cultural quarter of the city.
In keeping with its status as a privately managed but city-owned institution in the largest American city with a black majority, the museum has tried to attract a racially diverse audience. It has advertised heavily in publications catering to African-Americans and has advertised mostly on billboards in the city rather than the suburbs.
William Daniels, a retired teacher and Detroit resident, was surprised and pleased by the heavy turnout on a recent day. "I haven't seen it this crowded, the lines were terrific," he said, sitting on a bench after seeing the exhibition.
"Face to Face" is being praised by scholars too. Though there have been many van Gogh exhibitions in the last 20 years, the Detroit show is the first to focus on the painter's development as a portrait artist.
Van Gogh's portraits have been analyzed in books, but the current exhibition brings them together for ready comparison, a first, according to Bogomila Welsh-Ovcharov, a professor of fine art at the University of Toronto who has written six books on van Gogh and was not involved in organizing the exhibition. "What is more contributory and interesting for scholars and connoisseurs is to see them in a new context," she said.
With 31 drawings and 36 paintings, the exhibition traces van Gogh's rapid development in capturing faces on canvas. The earliest drawings demonstrate how van Gogh, a disillusioned theology student literally studying how-to books on becoming an artist, produced works of a style and vision that went far beyond the instructions in the manuals. The later paintings show his evolution from realistic representations of the faces of the poor to interpretations of his face and those of friends in his final years, in France.
So strict were the curators of the Detroit, Boston and Philadelphia museums about keeping the emphasis on portraiture that they did not ask to borrow one of van Gogh's "The Potato Eaters," because it depicts five peasants instead of just one and because it presents an entire scene.
George S. Keyes, the Elizabeth and Allan Shelden Curator of European Painting at the museum, said that the inspiration for the exhibition had come after Josephine Ford, a granddaughter of Henry Ford, donated a famous van Gogh portrait of a postman, Joseph Roulin, to the museum in late 1996.
In early 1997 the museum began organizing an exhibition of van Gogh's paintings of the Roulin family, then broadened its scope to the gamut of the artist's portraiture after discussions with the Philadelphia and Boston museums, Mr. Keyes said.
The institute only recently emerged from near financial disaster. The museum has long had an excellent collection and a sprawling building because of big donations by the Ford family and other auto barons, but it never had much of an endowment or received many donations for operations and maintenance.
It struggled through the hard times of Detroit and American automakers in the 1970's and 80's. Its last major exhibition, in 1986, featured the work of Diego Rivera, a Mexican muralist who painted one of his finest works in the huge marble central court of the museum in 1932.
The institution's management spent the late 80's planning an ambitious renovation and expansion of the buildings, only to be devastated in 1991 when Gov. John Engler, a Republican trying to balance Michigan's budget, cut almost all state aid to the museum. A third of the museum's $25 million annual budget disappeared, forcing a reduction in museum hours to 12 1/2 a week from 48, and the elimination of many educational programs.
"There were exhibitions planned that had to go right into the trash can because staying alive became the first order of business," said Samuel Sachs II, the museum's director from 1985 to 1997 and now the director of the Frick Collection in Manhattan.
The museum had trouble attracting donations for its operating budget partly because it was city-owned and staffed mainly by civil servants. After a nasty two-year political battle that ended in early 1998, daily management of the museum was transferred to its private donors, who live mostly in the suburbs.
The donors have given lavishly since then: a fund-raising campaign that began 11 months ago has brought in $93 million. The state government, flush again from the strong economy, has offered another $40 million if further matching contributions can be raised. An ambitious five-year renovation of the museum's main building and its two annexes will begin after the van Gogh exhibition closes, although the museum will remain open during construction.
The rejuvenation of the auto industry has also helped the museum raise money. DaimlerChrysler, for instance, is sponsoring the van Gogh exhibition. Eager to allay local worries about foreign control and to please the many German managers assigned to what some of them perceive as a Midwestern cultural backwater, DaimlerChrysler says it has increased by 20 percent the already substantial donations that Chrysler had been making to the arts in southeastern Michigan before it was purchased by Daimler-Benz in 1997.
Ms. Welsh-Ovcharov, the van Gogh expert, said that the Detroit museum's choice of van Gogh for its return to presenting world-class exhibitions showed the strength of its financial revival. Impressionist paintings and Post Impressionist works like those by van Gogh have become so valuable that the insurance and other costs of exhibiting them exceed the resources of most institutions, she said.
"It's a major coup from their point of view," she said. "Van Goghs are very difficult because of the financial budget required."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the rejuvenation of the Detroit Institute of Arts misstated the year that a benefactor, DaimlerChrysler, was formed through a merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler. It was 1998, not 1997.

Customer Service: Solving Problems Or Preventing Them?

BYLINE: By PAUL GRIMES; Paul Grimes writes the syndicated column "The Online Traveler."

 BODY:
EXPEDIA, the giant online travel agency that is owned primarily by Microsoft, prides itself on customer service. In a gesture to uneasy visitors to its Web site (www.expedia.msn.com), it recently stopped insisting that they register and provide personal information before browsing for flights, car rentals and hotel rooms. The site now requires registration only when a browser turns into a purchaser.
The site promises replies to e-mail messages within 24 hours, offers immediate assistance by telephone at any time and meticulously follows up sales with offers of further service. For example, after Expedia sold me two airline tickets to San Juan, P.R., it followed up a week before departure with an e-mail message suggesting that the itinerary be reviewed, and offered to book a hotel room, arrange a car rental and even buy luggage. 
 Unfortunately, when I tried to look at the itinerary, I was stymied. I had forgotten my ID and password, which were issued when I bought the tickets. No wonder: I am registered with at least 50 Web sites and have many ID's and passwords.
As the Web site advised, I dialed (800) Expedia (397-3342) for help. After five minutes on hold, I was told that six calls were ahead of mine. Four minutes later, "Chuck" responded, but the connection was soon cut off. Six minutes later, I got through to "Lawanda," who quickly e-mailed my user name and password.
As online customer service goes, this experience was good. Web businesses may be proliferating, but customer service varies remarkably from site to site. As e-commerce is maturing, however, there is a new emphasis on customer service, and virtually every online trade conference addresses the issue. On the customer end, a recent report by Forrester Research, the market research firm, found that 90 percent of online shoppers consider good customer service to be critical when choosing a Web merchant.
Forrester calculated that 4.8 million people, or 37 percent of those who have made purchases on the Web, had used customer services while shopping on the Internet. The report cited unhappiness with service as a main reason shoppers stopped using Internet merchants.
The growing importance of online shopping is most apparent in travel. According to a November report issued by PhoCusWright Inc., a travel research company, 45 percent of online buyers said they had bought travel on the Internet.
The report said the number of Americans who had booked trips online had soared more than 80 percent in 1999, to 11 million. It estimated the value of the online travel market at $7 billion in 1999 and projected a rise to $20 billion in 2001. Improvements in customer service and security were cited as reasons for the increase. The report also noted that many people who browse online are reluctant to buy because they object to the lack of human contact and are uneasy about privacy and credit card security.
The more one reads about e-commerce customer service, the more apparent it is that this can mean many things. It can mean the way a business promotes its product (whether it gives a full, clear description, answering the predictable questions without being asked); the billing and checkout procedure (how simple is it, and how secure?); the way a company responds to consumer problems and questions. Is the purchase delivered as promised, with the customer able to track it electronically before delivery? How easily can it be returned for a replacement or credit?
Some e-commerce sites go beyond satisfying a customer by striving to build loyalty for future sales. Incentives include frequent-flier miles and bonus miles to those who book an airline on its own site. Some sites that sell beauty products send samples to customers; others may send chocolates or flowers.
Indeed, some sites go to great lengths to promote loyalty. Two years ago, I had Amazon.com send a book about Middle Eastern history to Shlomo Sokol, my brother-in-law in Israel. The book was charged to my Visa card. When I recently returned to Amazon to order a book for myself, Amazon asked, "Would you also like to send this book to Shlomo Sokol?" (My answer was no.)
Customer service is handled in several ways: referring queries to a telephone number (preferably toll-free); accepting or soliciting e-mail messages and replying by e-mail; accepting e-mail but replying by telephone; posting answers to predictable questions on the Web site; and live online communication, or chats, between the dealer and the customer.
LIVE chats, or in Internet terms the exchange of written messages, are among the most intriguing. The technique is used by several large companies, like Lands' End, which sells clothing and household goods through catalogs and online. Live chats work like most chat rooms on the Web: one person types a question and clicks "send," and the other replies. The aim is to have experts ready to answer customers' questions.
I recently tested this chat service on the Lands' End site (www.landsend.com). Typing in my question, I received a message on my computer screen that seemed remarkably like what I often hear on the telephone: "Your call is very important to us. Please continue to hold and an agent will be with you momentarily. Thank you." Actually, the wait was not long, but the ensuing exchange took longer than a discussion would have by phone.
Asking questions by e-mail presents other problems. Some sites promise quick replies and actually deliver them. Other sites take much time, and some never respond. Among some sites that do respond, it is clear from their generic or irrelevant replies that little attention is paid to the questions.
A relatively recent development is the subcontracting of customer-service business. Companies like I.B.M. (www .ibm.com/solutions), LivePerson (www.liveper son.com), PeopleSupport (www.peoplesupport .com) and Kana Communications (www.kana .com) provide services for companies that prefer not to manage their own. This means that when you have a live chat with Lands' End, you will probably speak with a representative provided by LivePerson.
Sometimes a real person actually intrudes. A shopper may be clicking on a retail site when suddenly word is received from a sales clerk offering help. The clerk has been watching without the shopper's knowledge.
The latest in customer-service communication online is by voice, and that is important, because it is as close as you can get to face-to-face communication. In an example, an online jewelry store, Miadora (www .miadora.com), offers voice chats, instant messaging, e-mail queries or toll-free telephone calls.
At almost every e-commerce site, customer service means, at least partly, posting responses to "frequently asked questions," or FAQ's. Sometimes that is sufficient, but there are almost always questions that cannot be answered this way. Forrester Research found that only 19 percent of online shoppers with questions searched for answers on the site, and only 11 percent went to the FAQ's.
Why? Because a FAQ is not personal contact, researchers say. They recognize that to answer all questions by e-mail or by telephone would be costly. But they say that if e-retailers would provide full product description, prompt shipment, delivery tracking services and, for repeat customers, perks like free express shipping, there would probably be fewer questions.

HEADLINE: A Legendary Harlem Club Preens for Its Second Act

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
I HOPE that's not the renovation," said a young woman wearing a black crochet cap and light purple lipstick, a leopard-print satchel on her shoulder, as she peered through the glass of the Lenox Lounge into the dark glitter of the unlighted bar. A nicked and scuffed cafe chair with a zebra-stripe seat stood by the window, the photographer Art Kane's "Jazz Portrait, Harlem 1958" above it.
"It looks the way it was," the young woman said, rolling her eyes and walking off down Lenox Avenue toward 124th Street. What she couldn't see were the 22 cans of oven cleaner that took three millimeters of gummed nicotine off the gold mirrors and chrome trim. What looks antique now had been an authentic dirt-brown. The fake fur is fresh. 
 After eight months of renovations and $600,000, the Lenox Lounge, the legendary Harlem night spot built in 1939 -- the year Billie Holiday first sang "Strange Fruit" -- is reopening tonight: the sole surviving Art Deco club interior in New York City. Holiday, a regular, sat in with musicians there in the 1940's; her table in the Zebra Room beyond the bar, beneath the mock-zebra wallpaper that gave the room its name, was the first on the left through the swinging doors. She is said to have loved Art Deco, as genuine as glamour ever got. Malcolm X was also a customer.
More recently, the lounge has been a featured location in fashion magazines, music videos and movies, from Madonna's 1995 "Secret" to the remake of "Shaft," starring Samuel L. Jackson, opening this summer.
"New Yorkers will appreciate the fact that Shaft hangs out at the Lenox Lounge," said John Singleton, the film's director. "It's a Harlem landmark; he's a very uptown kind of cat. You think about Holiday, or Billy Eckstine, walking through those doors, way back in the day. I couldn't resist having a glass of Hennessy between shots."
If the new Lenox Lounge looks faded, it's a fade-in, not a fade-out.
Alvin M. Reed, a retired policeman and postal worker who has owned the lounge since 1988, decided last year to bring the club, which he said was struggling to stay profitable, back to life. His strategy was to restore its glass-finned, turbine-shaped lighting towers, black and white hide walls, Bakelite-plated leather ceiling and other original details.
"I'm a person of the past; I love the past," he said. "When I first took over, I had some people who didn't really appreciate the decor of the place. They were like, 'Oh we're glad it's a new owner. Now you can modernize this place.' "
Mr. Reed, 60, wearing a black satin baseball jacket with "Lenox Lounge: A Cocktail Lounge for the Elite" stitched across the back with its picture, was standing by the bar on Saturday with Fred Ruffin, a friend, who was at the lounge's grand opening party in 1942. Mr. Reed said that a trademark dispute with El Morocco over the use of a zebra motif, for which that storied supper club was famous, had kept the lounge from opening officially in 1939. Mr. Ruffin, who was one of the few blacks in the crowd that night at the club, which like many was conceived for white patrons coming uptown, recalled that it was "a grand night."
"Beer was 30 cents a bottle," he said. "We were kicking on that because it was 10 cents cheaper in other places."
Because of an economic boom uptown that many are calling a second Harlem Renaissance, Mr. Reed said he believed there was also a renaissance in the wings for Harlem night life and its jazz scene.
With a $450,000 loan from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone -- a development corporation created by the federal government in 1994 that is also assisting Minton's Playhouse and other Harlem institutions -- Mr. Reed closed the lounge in September to begin work. Yui & Bloch, an architectural team that specializes in restaurant interiors, drew plans to renovate as well as to restore the lounge as a bar and dining room with a program of live jazz.
"I was raised around here, about 10 blocks down," Mr. Reed said. "You could go into any club and there was a set going on."
Community preservationists' concerns about the Disneyfication of Harlem (in particular, the not-unlikely threat of theme-restaurant-style renovations at period clubs like the Lenox Lounge) reached Mr. Reed through newspaper articles, he said. Neither he nor his architects retained historical restoration experts, confident that existing details, which matched 1939 postcards, could guide replacements.
"It would have been an easier thing to rip it out and put fresh sheetrock in," said Jimi Yui, the architect, whose office is also at work on Le Bernardin's new private dining rooms. "It's a restoration in spirit only. Historical restorations are incredibly expensive to do. But it's so rich in history. There's nothing that you could have created that would have been better than the history of what it was."
Beyond its physical fact -- in continuous operation since 1939, the lounge was never stripped for sale or vacant -- documentation of the design is scant. The designer may have been Judson E. Schnall, a Brooklyn-based architect whose name appears on a city construction permit for the address, 288 Lenox Avenue, in 1938. Mr. Reed bought the club from Dominick Greco, a nephew of the family that built it, after seeing it listed for sale in The Amsterdam News.
Memory of what was there from the start was hazy, too, as thick and stubborn to clear as the smoke on the walls. An Egyptian-inspired mural in the Zebra Room, left behind by the television crew from "New York Undercover" that created it in two hours in 1992, endeared itself inconveniently to patrons.
"I had more flack over that," Mr. Reed said. "Everybody said, 'Please don't tell me that's not original; I don't want to hear it.' " It was replaced by zebra wallpaper, based on a scrap discovered in the room.
Budget kept the historical picture from excessive retouching.
"The program from Day 1 was to upgrade the building's systems, but keep the feel of the original bar," said Zachary Kaplan, the president of the ZMK Group, the general contractor. A new restaurant kitchen was created at the back, with prep areas in the basement; the lounge's scarred wooden bar was left intact, not refinished.
"The larger part of that was driven by aesthetics, but some of it was driven by money, too," said Mr. Kaplan, who grew up on Riverside Drive at 116th Street and visited the lounge as a student in the 1980's.
Serendipity played its part in the renovation, too. Frosted-glass fins to replace those missing in light fixtures were found under five inches of mud in the basement. A box of glass ashtrays used as decorative studs in the diamond-square upholstered ceiling panels in the Zebra Room also appeared in the debris as new vinyl was being put up to replace the tarred leather.
When applicable, neighborhood subcontractors were hired.
"I felt it was important to work with as many locally based people as possible," Mr. Kaplan said.
Mr. Reed's clientele will be another issue.
"A lot of them really didn't want me to do this," he said. Prices will go up, and the staff will change. Mr. Reed's loan was dependent upon his creating 15 new jobs. Tourists and downtowners are likely to be the immediate mainstay of the Zebra Room. Mr. Reed has a 15-year lease, but he is three months behind on his rent, and "stretched out," as he said.
"People came in and said, 'Make sure you keep this and that,' and I'm like, 'Come in here and spend some money, you know?' " Mr. Reed recalled of the renovation. "Preservationists don't do that."
A man on the street in a gray suit, a smart black hat and a gold neck chain put his face to the window. Mr. Reed told Mr. Ruffin not to let him in, explaining that he had been asked to leave and not to come back seven years ago.
"Maybe he thinks it's a new owner," Mr. Reed said, in the whiskey glow of the unlighted Art Deco interior, suddenly right in the present.

HEADLINE: DESIGN NOTEBOOK;
A Force in Film Meets a Force of Nature

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 29

 BODY:
The bugles are silent now. But in secluded vales of eucalyptus and along once-dusty parade grounds lined with red-brick Victorians, history still stands watch over the Presidio, the windswept 1,480-acre former Army base wrapped by the headlands of the Golden Gate Bridge.
Since 1994, when this National Historic Landmark -- about twice the size of Central Park -- became a national park, a novel and much-debated experiment in preservation and park planning has been under way at the 200-year-old military garrison. Once the northernmost point of the Spanish empire, it is a place that, though part of the city, still feels like the edge of the world. 
 Home to some 470 historic structures and now about 2,000 people, the Presidio is, as one resident puts it, an "oddball" national park -- the only one that is required by Congress to pay for itself.
Today, most of this vast, wild urban terrain of wildflower-covered sea cliffs and extraordinary architecture -- officers' homes, cavalry stables, airline hangars, a psychiatric ward -- is presided over by the Presidio Trust, a corporation created by Congress that assumed control over 80 percent of the park two years ago (the park service controls the rest).
The Presidio is a delicate work in progress, and the trust a controversial landlord. Born in a cost-cutting Republican Congress that had seriously considered selling off this verdant jewel, the trust has a dual and, some critics say, impossible mission: to preserve and protect the Presidio while making the park economically self-sufficient by 2013.
The Force may be with them. To create an "economic engine" generating around $5 million a year toward the $36 million the trust estimates it will cost annually to maintain the park, the filmmaker George Lucas, after a heated competition, recently won preliminary approval to build a 23-acre Digital Arts Center on the site of a dilapidated 1960's hospital. He envisions a "Lincoln Center West," he has said, a corporate campus, stylistically drawing on Presidio military architecture, that would house five Lucas enterprises, including Industrial Light and Magic, his special effects and animation company.
Development has long been planned for the site. But the Lucas proposal, along with the rental of some houses for upward of $5,000 a month, signifies the intrusion of a business culture into a national park. Some charge that the need to generate income may irrevocably change the nature of the place, recasting the Presidio as an elite city-within-a-city for wealthy individuals and corporations. "In the Presidio, Congress looked at one thing and one thing only -- how much would it cost?" said Brian Huse, Pacific regional director of the National Parks Conservation Association, a private watchdog group. "The question has become, Is it possible to preserve the Presidio's natural and historic treasures unimpaired with a mandate to raise money off the very resources we're trying to protect?"
Where enlisted men once exchanged war stories in mess halls, there is now talk about "synergy" and wireless Internet access. So far, about 80 historic structures have been rehabilitated. Among the new tenants, a quirky array of businesses and not-for-profits, are Fiber Futures (dedicated to tree-free paper), the Pachamama Alliance (protects indigenous Amazon cultures), Trash Talk (a waste prevention radio show) and the San Francisco Film Center, a group of 14 film-related businesses and organizations that spent $6 million to restore a sprawling barracks built in the mission style by the W.P.A. The Sundance Institute is eyeing the post's mission revival theater as a potential cinema for independent films.
"You can't help but be inspired here," said Mark Lindner, who is the unofficial "mayor" of his neighborhood, called Simon's Loop, and president of Food, Land and People, an environmental organization. "Being in the Presidio helps us to think bigger than we normally think."
The juxtaposition of dot-coms like WebMD with the still-operating Army PX, the Sustainability Art Show with Burger King -- not to mention a nudist beach beside a string of bunkers with retractable cannons -- gives the latter-day Presidio a sort of loopy charm. It has always been a place of secret corners awaiting discovery, like the tombstone in the pet cemetery that reads "SKIPPER: Best Damm Dog We Ever Had."
The country's longest continuously operating military base until 1994, the Presidio parallels the growth of the country as a world power. Established in 1776 as El Presidio de San Francisco, an isolated garrison (a fragment of the original adobe foundation can be seen inside the Officers Club), the Presidio was briefly controlled by Mexico prior to 1847. It was not then a place of beauty. "The view of the bay is fine from the high hills," noted a visiting Army officer. "But everything looks dirty and sandy; you cannot void the impression that it is a mean country."
By the Civil War, it had become one of the nation's most important military complexes, adding a central parade ground surrounded by rows of enlisted men's barracks and Officers' Row, a Civil War streetscape that survives essentially unchanged. The Presidio was the central deployment point for the Indian campaigns, the Spanish-American War and Pacific operations.
Its winding, thickly forested landscape -- highly unusual for a military base, where roads and terrain are usually flat and straight -- was strongly influenced by the late-19th-century City Beautiful movement. A foresighted Army engineer, Maj. William A. Jones, planted the forests of eucalyptus, cypress and pine in orderly rows, like soldiers in formation.
A role model for the rest of the new Presidio is the Thoreau Center for Sustainability, where some 50 organizations, most of them nonprofit, have taken over a dilapidated hospital complex and restored it according to green principles. At its heart is a three-story white clapboard hospital (1899), where pressed tin ceilings and Victorian banisters now commune with a glass canopied entryway with photovoltaic panels.
The biggest success story so far may be at Crissy Field, a 1921 airfield from which Army aviators and De Havilland biplanes once patroled the skies. After decades of environmental abuse, this mile-and-a-half stretch of waterfront beside the Golden Gate Bridge has been reborn as one of the country's most ambitious public spaces, under the aegis of the National Park Service, which still oversees the base's perimeter, and the Golden Gate National Parks Association, which raised $32 million in private funds to reclaim the site. It opens this year, replacing 70 acres of asphalt with a recreated tidal marsh and native grasses.
But this is not Yellowstone or Yosemite. The Presidio sits on prime real estate in one of the world's most desirable cities. The Lucas proposal, and the decision to rent historic buildings at fair-market prices, have tenants like Dorie Heeren, 49, who is married to a park service ranger, frankly worried. "This is no longer going to be a national park," Ms. Heeren said. "My feeling is that this will be a gated community."
The trust, overseen by a seven-member presidentially appointed board, is obliged to follow federal environmental and historic preservation guidelines. It was created based on Congress's view that the scope and complexity of the Presidio required real estate expertise that was beyond the National Park Service. Board members include Donald Fisher, founder and chairman of the Gap, and William K. Reilly, a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
But tensions have come to roost recently around the question of who gets to live in the Presidio's 1,100 housing units. Right now, the full-time Presidio community is a hodgepodge of park service employees, office workers, students, park police and firefighters, about 150 remaining military families (who will be phased out over five years), and members of the public who can afford the rents, which range from $450 or so for a student single to $6,000 a month for an officer's mansion.
The goal, said Jim Meadows, the trust's executive director, is a community of people who live and work in the Presidio, from low earners to C.E.O.'s -- people like Leanne Hoadley, 32, who lives in a complex mostly for students. "I live in an ugly apartment," she said. "But I'm looking over the Pacific Ocean 10 minutes from Robin Williams's house."
Some say the trust has not established a strong connection with the community or the National Park Service. "There's an insularity that's unfortunate," said Ed Blakely, a former board member who is now dean of the School of Management and Urban Policy at the New School in New York. "The trust is hunkering down rather than opening up."
The grand test case may be the Letterman Digital Center, as the Lucas complex would be known, where local environmentalists and others have raised concerns about traffic, water quality and the appropriate scale and density for a national park. Speaking at the University of California at Berkeley last month, Mr. Lucas said, "I think the park should stay a park." But he also observed: "One of the prominent issues is, What is the park? There's no Old Faithful, there's no Half Dome, there's no Grand Canyon there."
Gordon Radley, president of Lucasfilm Ltd., described a corporate campus with underground parking for 1,500 cars, various public spaces from cafes and coffee bars to a tuition-free digital training institute, and a special-effects visual archive open by appointment. "No one wants to create Universal Studios at the Presidio," he said. But in a private filmmaking campus some foresee a waning of the soul and spirit of America's great national parks.
"It is a significant departure for a national park," said Drummond Pike, president of the Tides Foundation, in the Thoreau Center, which funds environmental and social justice projects. "I don't believe the public interest is served by having Lucas as a tenant, though it will be nicer to have Lucas than a bunch of venture capitalists," he said.
Amy Meyer, a board member and Bay Area environmentalist, argues that the Lucas plan, which must still pass various environmental and design reviews, creates a financial entity that will keep the rest of the Presidio intact as a park. She agrees with Mr. Meadows of the trust, who says that preservation and self-sufficiency aren't mutually exclusive. "If we do our job right," he said, "the Presidio will look a great deal like it does today, with 20 percent more open space and historic buildings all renovated to code."
Roger Kennedy, a former director of the National Park Service, noted that other parks aren't expected to pay for themselves and that the trust concept, born of political compromise, must be watched zealously. "The question," he said, "is how many transactions do you consummate during the course of this process toward self-sufficiency that you will regret later?"
The park service, which will still be largely responsible for interpreting the park to visitors, has recently brought in a team from the Smithsonian Institution to help dream up new museums and exhibits for the site.
For all the future-thinking, wireless or otherwise, it is still the past that will anchor this place, where soldiers' tombs peek through eucalyptus trees. Sensitive reshaping is not for the meek, but it seems well worth the fight to Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, who is optimistic.
"It's not trouble free," he said, "and there are and will be inevitable tensions in the formula." The good news, he said, "is that nobody is talking about tearing down historic buildings, but rather, preserving them in innovative ways."
At its best, the Presidio contains the architecture of possibility.
"There are so many empty buildings here," said Marcia Smith-White, head of the neighborhood association, "you find yourself thinking, 'Why not?' "
 
Presidio Sites
THE 1,480-acre Presidio of San Francisco, on the Golden Gate, was a military post from 1776 to 1994. Today it is a national park featuring historic forests, rare plants and an outdoor museum of American architecture. By 2013, its 470 historic buildings will house a community of organizations and businesses that should make the park self-supporting.
THE MONTGOMERY STREET BARRACKS VISITOR CENTER in the 1890's brick barracks facing the parade ground is the best place to start exploring the park. The mile-long self-guided walk circling the heart of the post spans 200 years of military history and American architecture.
The 1917 PRESIDIO FIRE STATION was sensitively updated in 1997. The NATIONAL MILITARY CEMETERY dates from 1884. The 1932 Spanish colonial-style POST CHAPEL , nearby, has a W.P.A. mural visible from the outside. The 1.5-mile GOLDEN GATE PROMENADE offers spectacular views of the bay and the city. It leads to the CRISSY FIELD MARSH RESTORATION , a stretch of restored beach, tidal marsh and native-plant-covered dunes that replaced 70 acres of asphalt from a 1921 airfield. This $32 million restoration has been a decade in the making.

To the Editor:
Lisa Belkin (Life's Work column, March 29) predicts that employer commitment to workplace amenities will evaporate when the current economic boom stalls. We health care professionals, already adapted to the priority of volume and productivity, experience 10-hour-plus days, gulp coffee or grab lunch while working, and "donate" private weekend time in the futile effort to catch up on swamping paperwork demands. 
 While the notion of concierge service to help us balance career and family obligations is enviable, we would first welcome an actual coffee break.

HEADLINE: Africa Can't Afford Trade Growth Bill

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Africa: Aid or Harm?" (column, March 28), by Thomas L. Friedman: While offering meager trade benefits, the African growth and opportunity bill imposes harmful policy requirements on African countries. Countries must cut public spending on desperately needed health and education programs; let foreign companies buy and control local natural resources; cut corporate taxes; and eliminate food subsidies and price controls essential to fighting hunger. Many Africans see the ugly social effects of such policies in countries where the International Monetary Fund dictates economic strategy. 
 Mr. Friedman doesn't mention my alternative: the HOPE bill, which would provide duty-free, quota-free access to the United States for many African goods, protect workers' rights and not impose a multinational economic vision on Africa's poor. The support of many unions for the HOPE bill belies Mr. Friedman's claim that labor is opposed to any market-access expansion.

HEADLINE: Slight Drop In Sales of New Houses

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
Sales of new single-family homes fell less than expected in February, government figures showed today, suggesting that rising interest rates were doing little to discourage buying.
Sales declined 0.5 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 919,000 units, after rising 0.3 percent a month earlier, the Commerce Department said. Analysts had been expecting sales to drop to a pace of 874,000 units. 
 Applications for mortgages surged last week, lenders reported separately, a further sign that record levels of employment, consumer optimism about the economy and the availability of cheaper adjustable mortgages have offset the effect of a rise in conventional fixed-rate loans to above 8 percent.
"As long as job growth continues and consumer confidence stays high, and rates stay south of double digits, I believe there's going to be continued growth in the housing industry," said Samuel Fuller, chief financial officer of D. R. Horton, a big home builder in Arlington, Tex.
New-home sales the last three months were the highest since they peaked in mid-1999, a year that finished with a record 907,000 new homes sold, government figures showed. This took place even as 30-year fixed mortgage rates climbed, reaching 8.38 percent in mid-February, the highest in three and a half years.
Federal Reserve policy makers have raised the overnight bank lending rate five times since June to try to slow the economy. Still, "the jump in fixed-rate mortgage costs is largely behind us, and rates are apparently not high enough to slow the market down appreciably," said Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.
The one-year adjustable-rate mortgage increased to a five-year high of 6.78 percent last week, according to Freddie Mac, the big buyer of mortgages. The rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 8.23 percent last week.
Housing sales rose in the Midwest and Northeast and declined in the West and the South. The median home price rose to $162,000 from $158,000 in January.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the President's News Conference in Washington

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference in Washington yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:
 
Opening Statement
I would like to begin by saying that yesterday's announcement that OPEC members will increase oil production is good news for our economy and for the American consumer. These increases should bring lower prices, which will help to sustain economic growth here in America and also, and very importantly, throughout the world. It will also, I hope, bring relief to hard-pressed truckers in this country who've been especially hard hit and others who have high fuel costs by providing a greater balance between oil production and consumption. While home heating costs and the price at the pump are both expected to fall in the next few weeks, I urge the oil companies to do everything they can to bring the savings to consumers as quickly as possible. Meanwhile we will continue to monitor developments in world markets closely. 
 Since January our administration has taken significant action to address high oil prices, from helping more low-income and elderly citizens to pay their heating bills, to calling for the creation of a regional market reserve in the Northeast, to asking Congress to immediately reauthorize the strategic petroleum reserve. It is also very, very important for Congress now to act on my proposal to strengthen our long-term energy security, including new tax incentives and investments to support domestic oil producers and to promote the development and use of alternative fuels and more efficient energy technologies. We can become much more energy efficient and support economic development if we do.
Congress also has an opportunity and a responsibility to make progress on a number of other important issues for the American people this year. First we must work together to reduce the staggering toll of gun violence in America by passing my proposal for more prosecutors and stronger gun enforcement and by finally passing a strong juvenile justice bill that closes the gun-show loophole, requires child-safety locks for all handguns and bans the importation of large-capacity ammunition clips.
For nine months now, key Congressional Republicans egged on the N.R.A. have stood on a bill and stopped it from being considered by keeping it from coming out of conference onto the floor of both houses for a vote. Fourteen days ago, a House resolution passed with bipartisan support, sponsored by Representative Zoe Lofgren of California. It simply said that House and Senate conferees should meet to settle their differences on the bill that has been languishing in Congress for too long. But after 14 days, the response to Representative Lofgren's resolution has been deafening silence and still no action. It appears the opponents of reform have run out of arguments, so now they're just trying to run out the clock.
This makes no sense. With crime at a 25-year low and the Brady Law keeping guns out of the hands of half million felons, fugitives and stalkers, the argument is over. Gun-safety measures do work and do not interfere with the interests of ordinary hunters and sports people. So it's time to build on our proven success and pass this common-sense legislation. Three weeks ago I asked Congress to finish the gun bill and send it to me by the anniversary of the Columbine tragedy April 20. That deadline can still be met, so again for the sake of our children, I ask Congress to stop the delay. This should not be a partisan issue and it should lead to action, not argument.
There are some other issues I'd like to mention briefly. First, to make sure the benefits of Medicare keep pace with the benefits of modern medicine, we must reform Medicare and add a voluntary prescription drug benefit. Three out of five older Americans like dependable, affordable drug coverage. Since I first raised the issue last year, virtually every member of Congress has voiced support for some kind of new prescription drug benefit. I call on Congress to pass a bill that ensures all Medicare beneficiaries the option to choose an affordable, accessible drug benefit. If they do, of course, I will sign it.
Second, to protect the interests of 190 million Americans in health plans we should pass a strong, enforceable bipartisan patients' bill of rights. This isn't a partisan issue in America. The House has already passed a strong bill, but the insurance lobby continues to oppose it. All we need is for the conference of Senators and Representatives to let every member in both houses vote his or her conscience on a real patients' bill of rights. If it passes, and it will, I will certainly sign it.
Third, we should raise the minimum wage by a dollar over two years. A bipartisan majority in the House voted to do so earlier this month, but Republican leaders held the pay raise hostage for tax increases for the wealthiest Americans -- tax decreases, excuse me -- tax breaks that can make it impossible to pay down the debt or strengthen Social Security and Medicare. I ask again to the Congress, do the right thing. Everyone knows we need to raise the minimum wage. Send me a clean bill that raises the minimum wage by a dollar over two years, and I will sign it.
Fourth, we must keep the economy growing, first by opening new markets here at home in our hardest pressed communities, rural and urban, and second by opening new markets for American products and services around the world. Especially we need to give our businesses, farmers and workers access to the world's largest consumer market, in China. There is no more important long-term international economic or national security issue facing us today. Congress should pass permanent normal trade relations with China this spring. I will say again, this requires us to take no further action on our part, to lower tariffs or open markets. All the concessions are being made by China in return for entering an open trading system. If we do not do this, then the full benefits of all we negotiated will flow to all the other countries in the W.T.O., but not to the United States. The economic consequences will be bad. The national security consequences will be worse.
Fifth, we must invest more in our public schools and demand more from them. I ask, again, Congress to endorse the principles in the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which called for ending social promotion and funding only those things which work, to raise student achievement. And we know that our students can't learn in schools that are falling apart. Yesterday a bipartisan school construction bill was introduced in the House that would provide $24.8 billion in tax credit bonds to modernize up to 6,000 of our schools. If the Republican leadership doesn't prevent it, Congress could vote on this proposal tomorrow. I ask the Congress to pass this bipartisan legislation and I will sign it.
Sixth, to save the lives of thousands of young people who every year get hooked on cigarettes, we must now pass legislation allowing the Food and Drug Administration to require tobacco, like the dangerous substance it is, to be regulated by the F.D.A. There is strong bipartisan support for this idea, and I hope the Congress will pass it. If they do I will certainly sign it.
Finally, I would like to say a few words about the importance of passing the supplemental budget request without delay. This is urgent funding for pressing needs at home and abroad. To help the families that were victims of Hurricane Floyd, to provide needed energy assistance for families struggling to cope with rising oil prices, to help keep illegal drugs out of our nation by supporting the Colombian government's courageous fight against drug traffickers. to keep the peace, provide for our troops, and build stability in Kosovo, and to provide needed debt relief to the world's poorest nations.
When Congress adjourns this summer we ought to be able to look back and say we took real steps to make America better. The issues have been decided. They are clearly there. They have also been debated. The American people want action and they deserve it. The only thing left is for the Congressional leadership to reach across party lines and to work with us, to break the grip of special interests and do the people's business.
Thank you very much.
 
Questions and Answers
Q. You said that the ball is in Assad's court. Is that because you think that his insistence on the return of all Syrian land under occupation in exchange for peace lacks logic or possibility?
A. It's because he now knows in great detail what the Israeli proposals were and I believe since they have made an effort to be specific and comprehensive, if we're going to make progress, they should now be able to know what his specific and comprehensive response is on all the issues. There's more than one issue here. And if we're going to have a negotiation, I don't think it's enough to say, I don't like your position, come back and see me when I like your position. And I understand how strongly he feels about it, but if he disagrees with their territorial proposal, which is quite significant, then there should be some other proposal, I think, coming from the Syrians about how their concerns could be handled. . . .
Q. Mr. President, three unarmed black men have been shot and killed by police in New York City in the past 13 months. Do you believe that the New York Police Department has a racial problem? And does that department require Justice Department oversight?
A. Well, I believe there is a Justice Department review of the practices in the department, which I think has been a matter of public record for some time. And in the Diallo case, there was a specific reference to review of the action there for possible civil rights violations. And I -- I think the important thing is there's a lot of evidence that in city after city where the crime rate has dropped -- and the crime rate's gone down a lot in New York, it's gone down a lot in every major city in America -- there is now ample evidence that the crime rate can go down and the tenor of community police relations can go up. And it's largely a matter of the right sort of training, the right sort of policies and consistent effort there.
On the specific cases, I think I should say no more, and particularly in view of the latest incident, which was tragic. There is a good U.S. attorney in New York and I have confidence that whatever decision is appropriate will be made as all the facts come out and that's what's being done here. . . .
Russian Elections
Q. Mr. President, when you spoke with Russia's president-elect Putin the other day, what did he tell you to indicate how he might run the country, particularly in the areas of the economy and foreign policy? And do you think it would be a good idea for you or your successor to try to build the same sort of personal relationship with Putin that you had with Boris Yeltsin, in view of criticisms that U.S. policy was too focused on one individual?
A. Well, first, he has expressed a genuine commitment to economic reform and the Russian economy is growing again. And the desire to put together a first-rate team. And that was encouraging. In foreign policy, he expressed an interest in working with us to pursue matters of mutual concern, particularly in the area of arms control and in some other areas. And I'm looking forward to working with him on that.
With regard to the personal relations, I think that President Yeltsin, keep in mind, was the first democratically elected president of Russia. And he had the sort of personality that it was difficult to remain neutral in dealing with him. And I did like him very much but I also thought he was committed to democracy. And I think the fact that he stepped down and that we had a genuine democratic transition in Russia is some evidence of that. So I think that regardless of personal chemistry, and I hope that mine with President Putin will be good and I hope that my successor's will be good with him, the United States and Russia have vast national interests that require them to work together on the things with which we agree and to manage the difficulties between us where we have honest disagreements. And so it is the relationship that is important. And the personal chemistry will come and go depending on the personalities. But the point is the fact that I liked Boris Yeltsin didn't stop me from differing with him when we were differing and it certainly never stopped him from differing with me in his classic style. And I don't expect that to change with President Putin. But I think that the relationship is very important to the United States and to Russia. And it must be worked on constantly. . . .
 
Elian Gonzalez Case
 
Q. A possible confrontation is looming between the relatives of Elian Gonzalez and federal authorities. As a last resort, would you permit federal authorities or some kind of federal agents to go in there to forcibly take the boy so that he could be sent back to Cuba?
A. Well I think that we're surely some distance from that because doubtless, if they do not prevail in court, they will clearly appeal. And I would just hope that the law would be followed by everyone, including them. I think that there is a legal process here. I have done my best to avoid politicizing it, and I think that the appropriate authorities, and in this case the judges, will make a decision and when that is, when that is done, I think that people on all sides should accept the rule of the court . . .
Q. The mayor of Miami said today that he would withhold any assistance from the city, including police, if federal authorities decide to return Elian Gonzalez to Cuba, and that if there were any violence in the streets he would hold you and Attorney General Reno personally responsible for that. That seems to sound like an invitation for the community to block federal authorities and an assurance to them that the Miami police will stand aside.
A. Well, I like the mayor very much, but I still believe in the rule of law here. We all have to, whatever the law is, whatever the decision is ultimately made, the rest of us ought to obey it.
 
Gun Control
 
Q. Mr. President, Charlton Heston is on the college speaking circuit and he said last night it amazes me that the president is so stubborn when it comes to guns. And he notes that there are already 22,000 gun laws on the books by his count, which he says that the administration does not enforce. Could you do more to enforce existing gun laws? And how do you feel about the attack that the N.R.A. has mounted on you and your administration?
A. Well, let me answer the question on the merits. Gun prosecutions are up under our administration and I have asked in this budget for a significant increase to enforce the laws, including more prosecutors, more A.T.F. agents. But, again, I would make the main point, the N.R.A.'s position is that if somebody does something wrong, throw the book at them, but do not have any preventive measures when it comes to guns. They believe that unlike every other area of our life, there should be no prevention. So they say, they didn't want us to have the Brady bill. They said it was too burdensome, but it hasn't been burdensome. They don't want us to close the gun-show loophole, they say it's too burdensome. They're not even for the research into smart-gun technology or for banning large-ammunition clips. There's a case where we have a law on the books, it can't be effectively enforced. These assault weapons are illegal, but the big ammunition clips can be imported because of a loophole in the law, so a law we have can't be effectively enforced. You know, I think that it's just wrong to say that because of the Second Amendment and because there are a lot of people that like to hunt and sport shoot, that prevention plays no role in this. How would you feel if I said, for example, the following: you know, all these people that go through airport metal detectors, 99.999 percent of them are law-abiding, good people, and it is really a pain to go through those metal detectors if you got a money clip in your pocket or a rodeo belt buckle on or something else, and you have to go through two or three times and take your belt off or whatever. It's just too burdensome and I'm just sick and tired of it and I'm going to take these metal detectors down in the airports. And the next time a plane blows up, we're going to throw the book at them.
Now, you're laughing, but what if I said, you know, most people who drive are good, honest, responsible people. And we should just, we ought to repeal the laws, the driver's license laws and repeal the speed limits, and the next time somebody does something wrong and has a 25-car pile-up, we'll just throw the book at them. I mean, a sensible society has a balance between prevention and punishment. . . . And in terms of their attacks on me, you know, that's what I get hired to do, that's part of the president's job description, being attacked by people who disagree with him. That doesn't matter. I still think Charlton Heston is a great actor and I love his movies and I still watch him every time I get a chance. And I loved having him here at the White House not very long ago when he got one of the Kennedy Center Awards. But that's irrelevant to me. The only question is, what is best for the safety of the American people? And guns are no different than any other area of our life. We need a balance between prevention and punishment.
Q. A federal judge with whom you have disagreed in the past today said it was his opinion that you had committed a criminal violation of the Privacy Act by releasing those Kathleen Willey letters during the independent counsel investigation. What do you think of that ruling and do you agree with the take of one of your legal advisers earlier today who called this judge "a loose cannon"?
A. Did one of my legal advisers do that? Well, he does seem to have somehow acquired a significant percentage of the cases involving the White House. That's an interesting story, but anyway. You know, obviously we don't agree with the ruling and I can say that when the decision was made to release those letters, I didn't even have any conversation with anybody about the Privacy Act. I never thought about it, never thought about whether it applied or not, and decided to do it reluctantly only because it was the only way I knew to refute allegations that were made against me that were untrue. And I think they plainly did that, and I would not have done it otherwise. But, I think in terms of the law, there are other reasons that I disagree with the law, with the idea that the Privacy Act, which was generally designed to protect people who had business with the federal government or were complaining about something that the government was doing or had reasons for confidentiality and having to give the government records. There are all kinds of reasons for the Privacy Act. And so I just don't believe that. I think that the opinion of our counsel's office and many other judges who've ruled on this is that act does not apply to this kind of correspondence in the White House. And so we disagree and we'll proceed accordingly.
Q. Mr. President, in light of the fact that OPEC has decided to increase production, do you see it as a mistake for the Senate to proceed with a bill that would suspend the gas tax? And if it reached your desk, would you veto it?
A. Well, I don't expect it to reach my desk because there seems to be bipartisan opposition to it in the House, including among the leadership. But the problem I have with it, apart from what it might do to the Highway Trust Fund and the spending obligations that have already been incurred by the acts of Congress, the budgets, is that I'm not sure that the savings would be passed along to the consumers in addition to that. So I think there are a lot of questions about it. But I don't expect it to pass. I do think, however, we shouldn't minimize the real bind that some Americans have already faced by these high fuel costs. For most people who don't have to drive a long way to work, it may seem an irritant but not a burden. But there are a lot of Americans who do have to drive a long way to work, who work for not very much money. And there are a lot of Americans who are in the trucking business who've been really really hurt by this. So I think we have to just keep our powder dry, keep our options open. But right now I think the prudent thing is to see how quickly these prices can come down with the increase in production and for the House to reauthorize the strategic petroleum reserve. We've got to have that reauthorization of the strategic petroleum reserve. My authority even to use that, even as a possible option, expires on Friday. And it's very very important for that to pass. . . .
Q. Mr. President, I wonder if you've got any thoughts or advice for your friend, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the dilemma that he faces on whether he should take parental leave, as his wife has suggested, when their next child is born? And if you don't want to share your advice with us, what would you do in that situation?
A. I would like to have been a fly on the wall when they first talked about that after it appeared in public. Well, you know, I feel very close to both Tony and Cherie. I don't want to get in the middle of that. But as I think Mrs. Blair said that there must be a third way to handle this challenge. That's what she said, although I thought it was a good line. First of all, I envy him very much. I think it's a great thing for them. It'll keep them young. And it's a wonderful thing. You know, for me, even though presidents have a very hard schedule, you know, and we keep very long hours, you have some more flexibility with your time because we live above the store, so to speak. So I wouldn't have the same burdens if we were having a baby. I could spend a lot of time with the baby and still work and work it out. But I think that that's something they ought to work with. I do think that the prime minister's government did a good thing to try to provide fathers as well as mothers family leave, though. I think it's a good policy.
Trade With China
Q. Mr. President, you are lobbying Congress to pass permanent trade relations for China. You're having a difficult time getting your own Democrats to vote for it. Vice President Gore has said even though he is for this agreement, if he was president, he wouldn't negotiate trade deals like this. He would only negotiate trade deals that included labor and environmental standards. How is that stand of his complicating your efforts to convince Democrats to vote for this?
A. If we were having a trade agreement with China, instead of an agreement on their accession to the W.T.O., we could do that. But keep in mind this -- oh, you know, I favor, I believe I was the first person in a national campaign to ever to advocate the inclusion of labor and environmental provisions in trade agreements. And we put some in NAFTA. And we've gotten some good environmental improvements as a result of it. Even though there are still environmental problems along the Rio Grande River there, a lot has been done. And there've been some labor standards improvements as a result of it in some places. So I know a lot of the people who wanted it aren't satisfied that we've done as much. But it was a really ground-breaking effort. I went to the International Labor Organization in Switzerland and to the W.T.O. and to Davos, Switzerland to argue for a different approach to trade. I don't think you can take economics in a global economy that is becoming increasingly globalized and act as if it's totally separate from child labor or other abusive labor practices or what the impact of economic activity on the environment is.
That is not what this this agreement is. I still believe if we can just get everybody to read what this agreement does, it will pass handily because this agreement will create jobs for America. It will create jobs for labor union members. It will grow the economy. I will say again, this is a agreement about the conditions under which China enters the W.T.O.
The United States doesn't lower any tariffs. We don't change any trade laws. We do nothing. They have to lower tariffs. They open up telecommunications for investment. They allow us to sell cars made in America and China at much lower tariffs. They allow us to put our own distributorships over there. They allow us to put our own parts over there. We don't have to transfer technology or do joint manufacturing in China anymore. This is a hundred-to-nothing deal for America when it comes to the economic consequences.
And most of what we have negotiated we will absolutely lose the benefit of. If they go into the W.T.O. and we don't approve normal trading -- permanent trade relations with them -- what will happen is all the work that Charlene Barshefsky and Gene Sperling did to get those concessions will go to Europe and Japan and all the people who didn't negotiate. They'll get all the benefits and we won't.
So the economic consequences are quite clear and unambiguous for the United States. And under the rules of the W.T.O. we couldn't impose different standards on their membership that weren't imposed on us or anyone else. . . .
 
Campaign Finance
 
Q. Could you comment on the vice president's plan for a $7 billion democracy endowment to pay for Congressional and perhaps presidential campaigns?
A. I thought it was a good idea. I kind of wish I'd thought of it myself. I'll tell you why I think it's a good idea, very briefly. I think you can't ever really solve the problem in campaign finance reform unless you have -- because what is the problem? The problem is that it costs so much money to communicate with people over the mass media.
So if you want to solve the problem, you either have to have a different source of funding or there have to be requirements for free or drastically reduced media time. Otherwise, you're just kind of rearranging where the money comes from or how you do it. I think McCain-Feingold is important and let me reiterate what the vice president said. His proposal should not be interpreted in any way as a reduction of the administration's support for McCain-Feingold.
The Shays-Meehan bill, which is the partner bill, has already passed the House. Again, if we could bring it up to a vote in the Senate, it would pass the Senate. A minority is blocking it in the Senate. We can pass it in the Senate. And we ought to pass it because it will do some real good.
But the thing I like about it is the American people have reservations about public financing of campaigns. We even have some trouble with the dollar check-off for the presidential campaigns. This proposes to give incentives to people to try to raise the money in a more voluntary fashion from private, nontax sources. So if it could be done and if the trust fund could be filled up, I think it's actually quite a good idea. . . .
Q. I'd like to return to campaign finance reform if I could. Vice President Gore, in announcing his proposal, called himself an imperfect messenger on that subject. Isn't that an acknowledgment, sir, of something you and he have long denied, that there was an attempt to bend, if not break, the spirit, if not the letter, of campaign finance laws during your re-election campaign?
A. No, I disagree with that. He never said that he knew that any of the money that he raised was not lawfully raised, and I don't believe he did, and I can certainly tell you look at the difference in the way we reacted in 1996, and the way the other party reacted, to allegations of illegal foreign money, for example. What did we do? We spent $4 million that we had to go out and raise, to put all these records on computer discs, to give it all to the Justice Department, to make sure that everything was there, there was no slow walking, no stonewalling, no nothing. I was outraged when I found out that the system for checking the backgrounds of contributors, and things like that, had been dismantled without my knowledge or approval. And I did not do all that work, and, and keep in mind that -- you mentioned '96. We raised the funds we needed for my presidential re-election in seven months, and I believe you can go check this but I have been told that ever since the campaign finance laws came in in the 70's, that we had the smallest number of violations and fines of any presidential campaign; the Clinton-Gore '96 campaign did. So I know those funds were raised for the party, but I was as appalled as the next person when I found out that we had taken funds that people had given us, money that wasn't legal. We didn't need it to win. It was wrong, and we did everything we could to try to correct it and set it right, and we spent a lot of money doing it. And, so, I think what he meant is that he had been involved in one incident which he felt was unfortunate, and we raised soft money, and we had done it aggressively because we don't believe in unilateral disarmament. But I would just point out that 100 percent of our caucus, the Democratic Caucus in the Senate and the House, 100 percent of us, in the White House, the whole Democratic Party in Washington, D.C., support the McCain-Feingold Bill. So if it had been up to us, it would have been law years ago. And I think that's worth something. So I think he's a good messenger. . . .
 
White House E-Mail
Q. It was reported today that the White House had a computer disk with Monica Lewinsky's e-mails. Sir, what do you think about the notion that it wasn't turned over sooner? And how would you assess your administration's overall handling of e-mail problems at the White House?
A. Well, I don't know, but I believe that was known years ago. I don't, I don't handle the e-mail things. I can tell you this, my counsel, Beth Nolan is going up to the Hill, I think, tomorrow, to talk about this. I believe that it is accurate to say that we had turned over everything that had been found and from what I understand, some things were not found because they were in a different system. And so now we're working out how to cooperate with the Congress. . . . I'm confident that whatever's the right thing to do, we'll do.

HEADLINE: Coping With Nassau's Fiscal Crisis

 BODY:
Nassau County's political leaders are finally responding to the fiscal crisis that has pushed one of the richest counties in New York State and the nation toward junk bond status. On Monday the County Legislature voted 14 to 4 to overhaul Nassau's antiquated and unfair property tax assessment system, a long-resisted move that is essential for the county's long-term financial health. Currently Nassau pays some $100 million a year in refunds to residential and commercial property owners who successfully appeal their assessments -- a tab it has covered by adding to its staggering debt load.
In another promising step, the county executive, Thomas Gulotta, a Republican, and the Republican and Democratic leaders of the County Legislature have signed a joint pledge to raise taxes if necessary to close this year's budget gap -- projected at $100 million to $200 million. 
 These long-overdue steps were extracted from tax-averse lawmakers only under duress. The agreement to reassess all residential and commercial property within three years was necessary to avoid trial of a civil rights lawsuit challenging the racial disparities caused by the current system of assessing homes based on 1938 building costs, not their fair market value. The pledge on taxes came only after Standard & Poor's warned it would reduce the county's credit rating to junk status unless officials committed to raising taxes this year if other measures fail to close the budget gap.
That pledge sufficed to buy some time -- but only about three months. Standard & Poor's says it will go ahead and lower the county's bonds below investment grade "unless the county reacts swiftly and decisively by June 30, 2000, to implement a credible achievable multi-year financial plan."
The burden of leadership now falls to Mr. Gulotta, the county executive, whose reckless budget practices over the years helped to make this reckoning inevitable. He must quickly lay down a long-term recovery plan that can form the basis for negotiations with the nine Republicans and nine Democrats who now make up the Legislature. The plan will presumably have to include a mix of fee increases, service cuts, departmental consolidations, government layoffs and, yes, some dreaded tax increases. There may be steps that Albany can take to help out. But these should be considered only as the final piece of a disciplined plan in which the county bails itself out of the mess it has created.

HEADLINE: THE SKI REPORT;
Winter Resorts Searching For the Next New Thing

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD 

 BODY:
Just when skiers have gotten used to a six-pack -- the six-seater chairlift that scoops six people up at once -- along comes plans for an eight-pack. And just when they learned to ski around big, noisy snow-making guns, along comes interest in making thousands of little guns that would spread out like a sprinkling system over the mountain.
It is all part of efforts by winter resorts to keep skiers and snowboarders coming to the slopes. Fickle weather and swings in the stock market make that job all the harder. Even with a brisk economy, skier and snowboarder visits -- a universal quantifier based on daily lift ticket usage -- have hovered at a glacial 50 million mark for nearly a decade. Who among the industry managers has an idea for breaking up the ice? 
 Some industry executives are focusing on the personal likes and dislikes of their guests, on and off the slopes. Others are banking on the next generation, the children of the postwar baby boomers -- the so-called echo boomers. Many of them are preteenagers and teenagers who thrive on skiing and snowboarding, skateboarding, inline skating and motocross racing, all in the extreme sports genre.
Here are a few views of coming trends in the skiing industry as expressed in recent telephone interviews with top management at four of the largest North American resort companies:
LES OTTEN, AMERICAN SKIING COMPANY, BETHEL, ME. Lack of snow during the December holidays last year cut into the busiest time of the season for the American Skiing Company. So too did the Y2K bug, which Otten, chairman of the company that owns nine ski resorts nationwide, believes kept would-be skiers at home. But in the future, he sees such short-term vagaries having less impact on the market.
"What comes through for the future is an extraordinarily strong trend in young people entering the sport of skiing and snowboarding," he said. "I think we'll see the trend continue on over the horizon, and that's going to have a very positive effect. It's the clearest bright spot that we can easily identify."
GEORGE GILLET, JR., BOOTH CREEK HOLDINGS, VAIL, COLO. Gillet is counting on the increasing importance of what he calls the boutique ski areas -- those small-town, mostly out-of-the-way places that develop a personality. Gillet's group owns eight ski resorts, including Grand Targhee, Wyo., which it bought last week partly because it is one of those destination resorts.
He said that capital expenditures at ski areas -- such as adding new chairlifts, gondolas, restaurants and lodges -- is less important now than improving personal amenities. "Capital expenditure was king, but now the guest is back in," he said. "It's a total integration of golfing, skiing, great food and hotels. I call it retro -- it may be a little harder to get to such places, but people will probably stay a little longer."
ED PITONIAK, INTRAWEST, VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA Pitoniak believes that the new generation will bring a change in style. The industry estimates that half of all 16-year-olds who go to mountain resorts now are on snowboards rather than skis; that compares to snowboarders of all ages making up about 23 percent of all skier visits.
"Most of the choices in the last 10 years, especially for girls, have been team sports," said Pitoniak, whose company owns 10 ski resorts. "Now it's action sports. The kids live these intense lives at school Monday through Friday, and on the weekends, they just want to tear the lid off and let it go."
ART TEBO, BOYNE USA, BOYNE FALLS, MICH. People want alternatives in their skiing holiday, said Tebo, whose company owns five ski resorts. Access to the Internet in particular makes it harder for resorts to draw skiers; with one or two clicks of a mouse, a person can instantly find another place if they do not like what they see.
"I think the trend is going to be that people will look at us on a daily basis to see what we're offering on any one day," he said. "We are a society who changes its minds constantly. We are in the entertainment business now, not fitness."

HEADLINE: Between Migrants and Spain: The Sea That Kills

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS 

DATELINE: ALGECIRAS, Spain

 BODY:
Soon after sunset, every evening, Spanish police boats set out to zigzag on the choppy Mediterranean, their night-vision scopes and infrared cameras at the ready to pierce the darkness.
Their mission is to intercept small motorboats crowded with clandestine African migrants, mostly young men who want to sneak ashore and hunt for work in Europe. 
 Across the water, in Morocco, a fake Spanish visa may cost as much as $3,000. But a network of smugglers offer secret night rides for a third of that in rickety fishing vessels painted deep blue for camouflage.
The coast of southern Spain, like the United States' border with Mexico, is a fault line where the worlds of rich and poor people meet, a magnet for migrants seeking a better life.
Ship captains call the strait that separates Europe from Africa here one of the world's most treacherous sea passages, a wind tunnel where the waters of the Atlantic and Mediterranean mix with fury, producing high swells and powerful crosscurrents. And yet, night after night, hundreds of people risk their lives on a 10-mile crossing that may last two hours, stretch from dusk to dawn, or, worse, end in death by drowning.
From just a trickle a few years ago, tens of thousands of undocumented migrants are now taking this route every year, drawn by the booming market in low-paying jobs that Europeans do not want.
"This is a regular night," said Lt. Juan Fernandez at the Spanish Civil Guard base in Algeciras one recent evening. At 11 p.m. the first patrol boat had reported back to base: it had caught a 50-foot boat with 20 men aboard and was bringing them ashore. At 2:30 a.m. a boat was intercepted with 25 people. Earlier, the police helicopter had signaled three other vessels, but they got away in the dark.
As on most nights, the majority of the men were from Morocco. Others may come from as far away as central Africa. Those who consider themselves lucky make it to farms in Spain, restaurant kitchens in France or construction sites in the Netherlands. But for a growing number the trip ends here. The Civil Guard regularly finds bloated bodies or flotsam from the flimsy boats, which are often equipped only with small outboard motors.
"Sometimes the boats are hit by big cargo ships that don't even see them," said Lieutenant Fernandez, who has spent many nights patrolling the water. "Usually, the boats are overloaded and they capsize easily. These are the poor who dream of riches in Europe, but many can't swim because they are mountain people. And they don't even have life jackets."
The price of lost European dreams is starkly visible in the windswept cemetery of Tarifa, a village on the southernmost tip of Spain. A mass grave that bears no names is covered with wildflowers. Juan Gallardo, the village gravedigger, said he buried 14 drowned bodies here in 1997. He believed they were Moroccans. Nearby, he had dug a grave for five young black men. They had also washed up on the rocks below Tarifa.
"They looked young, maybe 18 or 20," Mr. Gallardo said. "Poor things, no one ever came to ask for them. Their families must still be waiting for news."
At Algeciras, 10 miles to the east, the cemetery has close to 100 graves of people who drowned in the strait. Almost all are nameless. Only the date of burial and case number have been scratched into the rough cement. Jose Sampalo, an undertaker, said almost half of them were buried in the last three years. Seven drowned just in January.
"No one is really keeping track of all the dead," said Abdel Hamid Beyuki, head of the Moroccan Workers' Association in Spain. "Bodies also wash up on the Moroccan coast or they are just lost." His group estimates that some 3,000 people may have drowned in the last five years.
Statistics about the number of migrant workers who make it to the Spanish shores and then deeper into Europe are equally uncertain. "We reckon we catch about one in four people, at least on this part of the coast," said Lt. Ovidio Corredor at the Algeciras Civil Guard base.
Once detained, the undocumented migrants are are taken to detention centers and, often on the same day, returned by ferryboats to the Moroccan port of Tangiers. "Some carry drugs to pay for their passage," said Lieutenant Corredor. "But they stay here and go to jail."
According to the Interior Ministry in Madrid, Spain expelled 17,000 undocumented aliens last year. The ministry said it estimated that some 50,000 legal and illegal workers arrive every year, most of them North Africans.
Many travel on to France, Belgium and the Netherlands, where they can disappear and find support in the large established North African communities. Others stay in Spain, where Moroccans are the biggest contingent of foreign workers.
Spain's Interior Ministry concedes that it can only guess at the number of undocumented people in the country, perhaps some 150,000. But it recognizes that they often find work. They do the low-paid, backbreaking jobs in the great expanses of hothouses that grow winter vegetables. And they work in the olive and orange groves of Andalusia or the factories around Barcelona.
"Spanish employers can be fined for hiring illegal immigrants, but they are often tolerated because they are needed," a government official said. He was merely acknowledging the status quo: despite high unemployment of 14 percent, prospering Spain does want the cheap labor and the seasonal work provided by uncounted foreigners.
So does much of Western Europe. It is why the story repeats itself elsewhere along the Mediterranean. In recent years, boatloads of Tunisians have been crossing to Sicily or have used other Italian islands as steppingstones into the European Union. Albanians, Kurds and Iraqis by the thousands have been sneaking ashore in Italy and Greece.
Cheap labor is only part of the economic equation. As Europeans have fewer children and the population ages, they need immigrants to help make up the pool of workers that will pay for the Continent's costly social security and pension systems.
In Spain, demographers say that the need for foreign workers will become particularly acute. The country now has among the lowest birthrates in Europe -- just 1.1 children per woman. (It takes an average of 2.1 children per woman to keep the population from shrinking.)
Nevertheless, Spain accepted only 30,000 immigrants last year. Specialists say that it will soon have to import far more to maintain the labor pool needed to sustain its elderly.
But here, as elsewhere in Western Europe, there are signs of rising xenophobia and racism in communities that feel besieged by immigrants. In February, crowds attacked Moroccan laborers in southeastern Spain. Last year, there were several racist incidents near Barcelona. Human rights groups fear that extremists here could build constituencies by campaigning against foreigners, as they have in Austria, Belgium, France and Germany.
The European Union has tried to enlist Morocco to stem the flow of people coming illegally, and equipped the Moroccan coast guard with new radar and boats. The Union is also offering more favorable trade terms and is including Morocco among the countries -- along with Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia -- that will get special development aid in the hope of reducing the flight of their people to Europe.
But European diplomats in Morocco said the Rabat government was ignoring the problem. "Migration acts as a safety valve for this nation that has more than 40 percent unemployment and no welfare," one said, adding that Morocco received some $2 billion a year from its citizens living in Europe. "That's one of the country's main sources of hard currency," the diplomat said. "It's become almost indispensable."
Moroccan officials have argued that it is better to regulate the traffic across the Mediterranean by setting a quota for migrant workers rather than leave it to smugglers. Talks have been going on for several years.
With Morocco needing to export labor and Europe needing to import it, the flow seems destined to grow. That at least is the perception of the Spanish Civil Guard that patrols this coast.
At its base in Algeciras, Lieutenant Corredor showed half a dozen newly confiscated boats. "People used to cross only in the summer," he said. "January and February used to be totally quiet."
This January, the guards at Algeciras caught 615 people on the water. Some were drug smugglers, most were migrants.
Lieutenant Corredor pointed to one flimsy dark blue boat. "A floating coffin," he said. "This one was adrift with engine trouble and 25 people aboard. We had to revive some of them. They were half dead with cold."

HEADLINE: Web Start-Up to Buy IMS Health in Perplexing Deal

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
An Internet health care company that went public less than six months ago announced yesterday that it was using its highflying stock to buy a leading health care information provider that has long been one of America's top 500 companies.
TriZetto Group, a start-up that provides software to doctors and health care companies online, said it would acquire IMS Health Inc., a decades-old company that gathers prescription information for drug companies, for stock valued at more than $8 billion. 
 The complex transaction, which leaves IMS executives and shareholders in control of the new company, which nevertheless will be called TriZetto, left Wall Street analysts and investors of both companies perplexed. Shares of TriZetto plummeted $24.5625, to $33.50. IMS fell $5, to $16.625.
Satish K. Tyagi, a managing director at SG Cowen, who follows IMS stock, said that shareholders in each company were uncertain about the benefits of the deal -- and also about each other. Many IMS shareholders have held their stock for many years, Mr. Tyagi said, while many TriZetto stockholders may have invested just weeks or even a day ago, hoping for a repeat of the whirlwind appreciation of many Internet stocks. Indeed, before yesterday, TriZetto shares had gained more than 500 percent since the company went public on Oct. 7.
"If you're a shareholder of IMS, you're saying, 'Wait a minute. Who are these guys?' " Mr. Tyagi said. And as for TriZetto investors, Mr. Tyagi said, "Those guys don't really care for these old-economy stocks."
Mr. Tyagi said it was not yet clear why the experienced management at IMS, a successful company founded in 1954, had decided to team up with executives at TriZetto. TriZetto, based in Newport Beach, Calif., was founded in 1997 by Jeff Margolis, 36. Mr. Margolis, TriZetto's chairman and chief executive, will be vice chairman and president of the new company.
"TriZetto is unseasoned," Mr. Tyagi said. "They've only reported one or two quarters as a public company."
But both companies boasted about the deal yesterday, saying it would create a new company that was the dominant leader in the fast-growing business of providing information services to health care companies. The new company would have 9,500 employees and would have had revenue last year of about $1.4 billion. Only about $80 million of that amount was earned by TriZetto.
Robert E. Weissman, the chairman of IMS, which is based in Westport, Conn., said that Mr. Margolis and other executives had many years of experience in the business of providing information services to health care companies.
The deal helps IMS move its business onto the Internet, Mr. Weissman said. And TriZetto, which sells services to doctor groups, health maintenance organizations and other insurance companies, gets access to the thousands of drug companies that are IMS customers, he said.
But the companies are most excited about creating a new business, Mr. Weissman said, by combining the information that IMS has on drug prescriptions with the data that TriZetto has on a patient's health care history and the cost of that care. The information would be sold to drug companies and health care companies, he said.
"Talking about this got both companies really excited," Mr. Weissman said. "We don't know how anybody else will be able to do it."
Under the agreement, IMS stockholders will receive 0.4655 share of TriZetto for each IMS share. Based on TriZetto's closing price on Tuesday, IMS shareholders would receive TriZetto stock with a value of $27.03 for each IMS share. The deal, which is expected to be completed this summer, will give IMS shareholders control of about 85 percent of the combined company.
Mr. Weissman will be chairman of the new company; Victoria R. Fash, the chief executive at IMS, will hold that same title at the new company.

HEADLINE: Guyana: Caught in Brazil's Net?;
Small Nation, New to Free Markets, Fears Loss of Its Identity

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: LETHEM, Guyana

 BODY:
Shirley Melville, owner of the main watering hole in this dusty border outpost, seemed perplexed. Just why do her patrons prefer Antarctica beer, imported from Brazil, over domestically brewed Banks Beer, at half the price?
"It's all about status," said Ms. Melville, 40, standing in the doorway of Don & Shirley's Airport Cafe overlooking Lethem's small airstrip. "In Guyana, anything coming from Brazil is seen as superior, even if it isn't." 
 Brazil, the giant of South America with perhaps 170 million people, is busy flexing its economic muscle these days, pressing forward with policies aimed at strengthening ties with its neighbors.
And Guyana, nestled on Brazil's northern flank, with a population of 700,000 and port access to the Caribbean, is squarely on its radar screen. So it should be no surprise that the allure of Brazilian goods has penetrated even to this village of 2,000, a stone's throw from the Guyanese-Brazilian border.
There is no more vivid symbol of Brazil's increased presence in the region -- and the concern it arouses -- than the heavy equipment that is paving the 60-mile road between Boa Vista, a state capital in northern Brazil, and Lethem.
"There's this fear Guyana will be slurped up when that road is completed," said Nick Sellitto, an American who owns a business that exports organic produce from Guyana. "But I don't see that happening any time soon, given the prehistoric, isolationist thinking of the Guyanese government."
After nearly three decades of inward-looking, socialist-inspired development policies, Guyana is starting to open its economy to investment in areas like timber cutting and mining.
Many other people, however, are convinced that Guyana is about to be drawn into Brazil's orbit. Vehicles making the two-and-a-half-hour trip today tend to be sturdy trucks transporting Brazilian miners over the border into Lethem, where they board small propeller planes headed for gold mines in the interior of Guyana or Suriname, to the east.
"It is the draw of riches," said Valdemir Costa Machado, 36, a miner from the Brazilian state of Maranhao, as he waited for his flight here. "The only problem is that there are too many of us Brazilians coming in."
There are about 10,000 Brazilians living in Guyana who chose to stay after their stint in the mines has ended, the government says. In Dutch-speaking Suriname, the number of Brazilians is estimated at 40,000, nearly 10 percent of the population.
"We run the risk of becoming a kind of adjunct to Brazil," The Stabroek News, Guyana's leading paper, said in a recent editorial. "If we are not to be swallowed up and lose our distinctive identity, among other things, then we will have to devise policies and strategies which will allow us to maintain an authentic independent voice in the company of giants."
The road from Boa Vista is not likely to remain the domain of adventurous gold miners for long. In a year or two it should be completely paved, making way for all manner of vehicles including air-conditioned passenger buses and small cars.
A similar road project linking northern Brazil with Venezuela led traffic to increase almost tenfold between those countries in the last two years. In southern Brazil, improved transportation links helped make possible the creation of Mercosur, the trading bloc comprising Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.
In Guyana, though, roads remain precarious, effectively limiting stronger commercial ties with Brazil. For example, the road between Lethem and Georgetown, Guyana's capital and largest city, is unpaved.
For Mr. Sellitto and others who depend on that route for their livelihood, this means they must travel in vehicles like Land Rovers or old army-issue British-built Bedford trucks. The trip can take two or three days, depending on the weather.
Many of these vehicles date to the days before Guyana gained independence from Britain in 1966 -- an illustration of the effect more than two decades of isolationist policies can have on an economy.
"It's the 'Mad Max' effect," said Peter McLachlan, a resident of Lethem who drives a 38-year-old Land Rover, referring to the 1980 film in which rival factions in a post-apocalyptic world drive vehicles held together with any material available. "Guyana is a surreal country, and probably no part of it is as surreal as here."
Indeed, much of Lethem seems as if time had frozen for 20 or 30 years. Most of the village's residents -- mainly Indians from the Macushi and Wapishana tribes -- get around on foot or by bicycle. With the exception of limited commerce taking place over the border, the economy is largely based on hammock-weaving and the cultivation of cassava.
Charred, decaying buildings near the airstrip still show signs of the government's reaction to an uprising by local ranchers in 1969, when Lethem was little more than the administrative center for a large cattle-ranching operation. After exiling the ranchers to Brazil and Venezuela, the army burned every structure to the ground.
Looks can be deceiving, though, for while Lethem, and much of Guyana's economy, might show the effects of socialist experiments from the 1960's through the mid-80's, the country has introduced several market-driven initiatives since 1992, when a government was elected that favored opening Guyana to foreign investment.
The privatization of companies like Guyana Airways and Guyana Telephone and Telegraph, in addition to awarding concessions to foreign concerns to mine for gold or cut timber, have resulted in inflows of investment from abroad.
Another important foreign project, a satellite-launching facility to be operated by Beal Aerospace of Frisco, Tex., near Dallas, which would take advantage of Guyana's location near the Equator, is nearing government approval.
From 1993 through 1997, the economy grew for five consecutive years -- more than 40 percent over all -- before contracting slightly in 1998, largely because of falling gold prices. In 1999, the economy grew nearly 3 percent, and this year 5 percent growth is forecast.
"We're making up for lost time," Moses Nagamootoo, Guyana's information minister, said in an interview in Georgetown.
Indeed, the trappings of a modern economy are more evident in the capital, where cellular phones and sport utility vehicles imported from rich industrial countries are common.
In Lethem, by contrast, basic telephone service by satellite hookup was initiated just two years ago. People in the interior use short-wave radios as their main communication tool.
"I can't wait until mobile phone service arrives in Bom Fim," Mr. McLachlan said, referring to the Brazilian community across the river from Lethem. "If towers are installed allowing us to have cells here, I'll be among the first to sign up."
While Guyana has slowly opened itself to foreign investment, trade with Brazil remains minuscule.
Neither Brazil nor Venezuela, Guyana's other big neighbor, is among its leading trading partners -- outranked by such countries as the Netherlands Antilles, Canada, the United States and Japan, according to United States government figures. Not everyone sees sense in this.
"It is retrograde that we don't have more contact with Brazil," said Gerald Gouveia, owner of Roraima Airways, whose regular flight between Boa Vista and Georgetown, begun only recently, had to be discontinued for lack of demand.
For its part, Brazil, in addition to paving the road to the border, is making overtures toward forming a stronger commercial relationship with Guyana.
In Boa Vista, the state government of Roraima offered to help cover some of the costs for a Guyanese consulate. And business interests have approached Guyana's government with plans to improve the road to Georgetown, in addition to port installations there.
"We're listening to the offers because we're not satisfied with our current levels of foreign investment," said Mr. Nagamootoo, the information minister. "But we're cautious, because we still have that British ethos from being an English-speaking colony and having cultural and historical links to the Caribbean."
In Lethem, local authorities are also wary of stronger ties with Brazil. "I'm concerned of the effect a better road will have on our unique indigenous culture," said Muacir Baretto, a Macushi Indian who is the district chairman of the administrative region surrounding Lethem -- a position comparable in some ways to a governor in the United States.
For many of the village's people, though, this sort of thinking is beside the point, given the allure that migrating to Brazil already holds.
"In Brazil, I can work as a maid and make a little money to send to my children," said Joyce Clement, a 37-year-old member of the Wapishana tribe. "I love my country, but it can't offer me that opportunity."

Another Crash Raises More Questions About Colleges' Van Travel

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
A crash between a van and a tractor-trailer in Mississippi left the coach and two players from a college baseball team in critical condition yesterday and brought new attention to an inveterate problem in college sports: the widespread use of 15-passenger vans, driven by exhausted coaches or players, to transport teams to and from games.
"It's the economics of the situation," said Douglas Mosley, the sports information director for the National Association for Intercollegiate Athletics, whose members are mostly smaller schools with limited sports budgets. "Not everyone can fly. Not everyone can even charter buses. 
 "I can't remember a year that's gone by that we haven't had news of an accident involving a 15-passenger van."
The latest accident came just after midnight yesterday about 45 miles east of Memphis, where a tractor-trailer slammed into a van carrying the coach and nine members of the Tennessee-Martin baseball team. The team was returning from a game against Mississippi in Oxford.
The coach, Victor Cates, 40, was driving. The police said he pulled out in front of the oncoming truck at the intersection of two highways and stopped the van for an unknown reason. He was in critical condition at the Regional Medical Center in Memphis, along with two players, David Tillman, 20, and Jason Alford, 23, hospital officials said. Five other players remained hospitalized last night, none with life-threatening injuries.
That accident is the latest in a string of similar mishaps, prompting college athletic directors across the country to take a hard look at their transportation policies.
Four students from the Prairie View A&M track team died last month when the van they were traveling in swerved out of control in east Texas. A student was driving.
In January, a 21-year-old Kenyon College swimmer was killed when a van driven by a teammate flipped several times on an icy road just 30 miles from their campus in Gambier, Ohio. Since late December, there have been three other accidents involving vans transporting college teams, resulting in injuries to 22 athletes, some of them serious.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association sets no policy or guidelines regarding travel, leaving it up to state law and individual schools to decide when to use vans and who should be allowed to drive.
Not surprisingly, the policies vary widely. Some schools limit the distances team vans can travel, chartering buses for longer trips. Some require coaches and other staff members who drive the vans to obtain a chauffeur's license. Others allow students to drive when there are not enough coaches for all the vans needed. Students were driving in three of the six recent accidents.
But even insisting that coaches drive can be dangerous, several athletic directors said. Often the athletes are exhausted and fall asleep. The coach at the wheel is usually mulling over the game and has put in a long day's work. Add an icy road and disaster can ensue.
Since the Kenyon accident, said Jennie Bruening, the athletic director, the college has temporarily stopped using 15-passenger vans to transport its 22 sports teams and has banned students from driving. For now, the school is chartering buses for all events, but the college has also appointed a committee to come up with a long-term policy.
Still, chartering buses for every team, from golf to football, is "an economic impossibility," Bruening said.
"We have to try to figure out some kind of structure and formula" to decide when a chartered bus is prudent, she said.
Larry Raab, the vice president for university operations at Prairie View, said the university has tightened its policies somewhat since the fatal Feb. 10 accident. But with 350 athletes in 17 sports at more than 150 events away from campus, the school cannot afford to charter buses for every competition, he said.
"The use of vans at smaller colleges is inevitable," Raab said. "You know that accidents happen, and you just have to thank your lucky stars and pray that it doesn't happen to you."
Other small colleges, however, have decided the extra expense is worthwhile. St. Benedict, a Division III women's school in St. Joseph, Minn., with 1,940 students, has slowly phased out the use of vans since 1989, after two basketball players from Muskingum College in Ohio were killed in a van.
Carol Howe-Veenstra, the athletic director at St. Benedict, said the school now charters buses for the vast majority of road games. The vans cost about 65 cents a mile to operate, while charter buses cost more than $1.90 a mile, plus $9.50 for each hour the driver must wait, she said. The bottom line: the school now spends about $13,000 more to transport athletes in buses than it would if it still used vans.
But Howe-Veenstra, the college's former volleyball coach, said the peace of mind coaches enjoy is worth every penny. The college has also found other savings -- cutting meal allowances, for example -- to offset the extra costs.
Mosley, the N.A.I.A. spokesman, said the recent spate of accidents has prompted many small-college athletic directors to consider pushing sports governing bodies to establish guidelines for travel, even though such rules might be onerous for programs on tight budgets.
"I know it has created a buzz," Mosley said. "I don't doubt that in upcoming meetings this will be a topic of discussion."

Flight From Technology Bolsters Pillars of Old Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Technology stocks sent the Nasdaq stock market to the biggest of three consecutive losses yesterday as more investors abandoned recent market favorites for the perceived comfort of General Electric and other household names.
The Nasdaq composite index shed 189.22 points, or 3.9 percent, to 4,644.67. 
 The decline in terms of points was the biggest since March 14, and the percentage loss was the biggest since March 20.
Investors who as a group have been heavily overweighted in technology have become increasingly nervous about stretched valuations. In addition, yesterday there were reports that one of the biggest hedgefund operations, Tiger Management, has decided to close and "the news on Tiger Management clearly precipitated some rotation out of these higher-momentum areas," said Christine A. Callies, chief United States strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. This pall over the market was in spite of the fact that Tiger's holdings are mainly New York Stock Exchange issues.
Other analysts pointed also to a lingering effect from the recommendation on Tuesday by Abby Joseph Cohen, the influential Goldman, Sachs strategist, that investors trim their exposure to stocks and hold as much as 15 percent cash. Technology companies, she contended, were no longer undervalued.
As the Nasdaq sagged, the Dow Jones industrial average staged an afternoon rally of as much as 165 points before losing half of it toward the close. It ended the day with a gain of 82.61, or 0.76 percent, at 11,018.72.
G.E. accounted for nearly half the Dow's gain, jumping 8, to a record close of 164, after an analyst at Prudential Securities raised his price target to 210 from 185.
Wal-Mart and Exxon Mobil each surged more than 4. Exxon was among the many oil-related stocks that more than reversed Tuesday's ragged performance, as analysts and investors further digested O.P.E.C.'s announcement of plans to raise production.
"There's a realization now that crude prices are not going to collapse here," said M. J. Matts, a value-oriented portfolio manager at National City Investment Management in Cleveland. "The price can probably stay above $25 for a sustained period."
Chevron, Texaco and ARCO all gained more than 3, while oil-field companies Schlumberger and B. J. Services were up more than 4, and Halliburton was ahead more than 2.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, less dominated by high-technology than is Nasdaq, finished up 0.79 point, to 1,508.52. Of its components, 280 advanced and 203 declined, the biggest point-losers being technology companies like Motorola, Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments, Micron Technology and Yahoo, though some regained part of the lost ground after the normal 4 p.m. close. Micron's announcement of a 2-for-1 split may have contributed to the rebound.
Drug stocks joined energy in the winner's circle, with Warner-Lambert ahead more than 3, and Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb and American Home Products each ahead more than 2. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones 1,632 to 1,336, as 57 stocks hit new 52-week lows, and 54 hit new highs. Volume climbed to 1.06 billion shares.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasury Prices Steady
 (By Reuters) -- Treasury bond prices were little changed yesterday as worries that economic growth has yet to slow were counteracted by weak technology shares, fragile agency debt markets and softer oil prices.
Prices of two-year and five-year notes were lifted for much of the day by flows out of agency debt, which was rocked by further reports that senior Washington officials back changes for federally chartered lending agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Treasury Under Secretary Gary Gensler sent agency debt markets into a spin last week after he backed moves to repeal the Treasury credit line to agencies and stressed that agency debt was not government-guaranteed.
The price of the 30-year Treasury rose 4/32 , to 10329/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.97 percent from 5.98 percent on Tuesday.
Following are results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of 19-day cash management bills and 2-year notes:

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
A Onetime Highflying Hedge Fund Appears Likely to Shut Down

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Undone recently by bad bets on old-economy stocks, Julian H. Robertson Jr. is closing his Tiger Management investment company, according to someone close to the company.
Mr. Robertson, 67, who is revered for his long-term record as an investor, appears to be succumbing to rapid change in the world financial markets. At his peak two years ago, he had $23 billion under management at Tiger, which runs six investment pools known as hedge funds, putting him on a par with George Soros, the hedge fund manager known for his big currency bets. 
 But a combination of investment losses and heavy withdrawals have left Tiger a shadow of its former self. About $900 million will be distributed to investors who have requested redemptions as the first quarter ends tomorrow, leaving the company with just $5.2 billion in assets, according to the person close to the company.
In the last couple of years, Mr. Robertson has been on the wrong side of a series of big investment bets. The first was a $600 million loss in the fall of 1998 when Russia defaulted on its debt. It was followed by a $1 billion loss on the Japanese yen later that year.
Retreating then from global bets as many other hedge fund managers did, Mr. Robertson refocused on beaten-down stocks in the old economy, shares of US Airways Group, Bowater Inc. and the Sealed Air Corporation. Those stocks, too, have proved disappointing, continuing to lag far behind the white-hot technology sector.
In a letter to shareholders earlier this year, Mr. Robertson wrote, "We are in a market where reason does not prevail."
Rumors of Tiger's demise have raced through Wall Street before. But with Mr. Robertson's funds down about 13 percent so far this year after a 19 percent decline last year, the person said, the end seemed not just plausible but likely yesterday. A hedge fund manager, who insisted on not being identified, said: "It's hard to come back from being down that far."
Fraser Seitel, a Tiger spokesman, said yesterday: "Tiger is not commenting on the rumors. Tiger's investors have not been notified about anything." Neither Mr. Robertson nor Philip Duff, Tiger's chief operating officer, returned telephone calls.
A native of North Carolina, Mr. Robertson spent much of his career as a stockbroker and money manager at Kidder, Peabody. But in 1980, he left to found Tiger, taking a name suggested by one of his young sons.
With $2 million of his own money and $6 million in outside investments, Tiger surged from the start. Until 1998, it lost money in only two years: 1987, the year the stock market crashed, and 1994. In several years, returns exceeded 40 percent. Even after the tough years of 1998 and 1999, the Tiger Fund had a 27 percent average annual gain since its inception almost 20 years ago.
Over the years, Mr. Robertson started five additional funds, available only to wealthy individuals. The Jaguar and Puma funds were opened in 1986, the Lion Fund and two Ocelot funds in 1987.
Unlike the unwinding of Long-Term Capital Management, Tiger's unraveling did not rattle world financial markets. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 82.61 points on the day, while the Nasdaq lost 3.91 percent. Shares in some of the stocks that Mr. Robertson is known to own were weak.
US Airways, in which Tiger had a 25 percent stake at the end of the year, slipped 43.75 cents yesterday, to $25.44. According to end-of-year filings, Tiger's big positions included UAM, the fund management company in which it owned nearly 15 percent; Sealed Air at 7 percent; and the Bear Stearns Companies at almost 4 percent.
Because Mr. Robertson has lost so much money in recent years, the remaining assets could no longer generate enough fees to cover operating expenses, according to a person close to the firm. As is the case with other hedge funds, Mr. Robertson's clients pay incentive fees of 20 percent to the manager only if their gains exceed what is called a high-water mark. Because of that threshold, Mr. Robertson's recent losses meant that he would have to be up 85 percent this year to generate any incentive fees, according to the person close to the company.
Moreover, given that roughly $2 billion of the $5.2 billion remaining at Tiger is said to belong to Mr. Robertson and his colleagues, the $3 billion from outside investors would not generate enough in management fees -- 1 percent annually -- to pay for operations at the firm's elegant New York, London and Tokyo offices.
One thorny issue in the closing of Tiger is related to Mr. Robertson's incentive fees, which have been kept offshore where they compound tax-free until the funds are repatriated, according to a source. This person said that Mr. Robertson might have a $200 million tax liability on those fees.
While shutting Tiger Management seems to signal the end of an era for Mr. Robertson, his legacy runs up and down Wall Street. Indeed, 13 hedge funds, known as Tiger Cubs, are run by Tiger alumni. Last year, all but one of these funds had positive returns.
On Tuesday evening, even as word of Tiger's woes was once again seeping into the markets, Mr. Robertson was honored at a reception in New York held by a group of former Tiger managers. At the event, the managers announced that they had made a gift to the University of Virginia in Mr. Robertson's name. At the celebration and among old friends, Mr. Robertson was near tears, someone in attendance said.

HEADLINE: Guggenheim May Face Fight Over Site

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
Frank Gehry, the architect of the acclaimed Guggenheim Museum branch in Bilbao, Spain, has completed a design for what Guggenheim officials hope will be another branch of the museum, in lower Manhattan.
Museum officials hope to build it on city-owned waterfront piers along the East River near Wall Street. But the city is considering several other proposals for that site, including a floating hotel and marina, indoor tennis courts, a floating youth hostel, and an aquarium. 
 Bernadette O'Leary, a spokeswoman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, confirmed the general nature of those proposals, but would not elaborate.
One real estate executive active in downtown Manhattan who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said that all the proposals faced an uphill fight. He said officials of the Development Corporation had narrowed the field to the Guggenheim and the floating hotel, but that the city did not seem keen on either one.
With a decision not yet at hand, the museum is releasing the Gehry design in the hope that it will attract public support for the plan, which calls for a curvilinear building that would rise as high as 45 stories on a platform over the piers. Community groups are usually wary of large projects that they fear will add to congestion and disrupt views.
Yesterday, the museum mailed letters inviting about 100 board members, prospective financial supporters and prominent New Yorkers to a "small exhibition" of the museum's plans and a dinner in honor of Mr. Gehry on April 18.
The museum then plans to exhibit Mr. Gehry's model through the summer in its flagship building at Fifth Avenue and 89th Street.
"What we would like is for a greater audience to see it," said Stephen C. Swid, the Guggenheim's vice president and treasurer. "It's no different from when the Municipal Art Society wants to save a building," he explained. "This is what you have to do. Bring pressure to bear. The city needs that nudge."
The invitation, signed by Thomas Krens, the museum's president, also describes how the new building would allow the Guggenheim to rearrange its collection. Under the plan, he wrote, the 89th Street building would house the Guggenheim Foundation's collections from the late 19th century to approximately 1945, while the new facility would be devoted to works from 1945 to the present and to special exhibitions.
The invitation delicately skirts the issue of the building's location. "Certain important issues with respect to the project remain open -- such as the formal identification and designation of the actual site for the building," Mr. Krens wrote. But he added that the design was "a unique cultural event of some significance."
Mr. Krens declined requests for an interview. Scott Gutterman, a spokesman for the museum, said "We don't wish to comment on this until our first formal presentation of it on April 18,"
Mr. Swid estimated that construction would cost $400 million, but added that the museum wanted to raise an equal amount as an endowment. "We have the money -- most of the money," he said. "We already have $250 million from one person and other interested donors who want to be part of this."

Japanese Worry About Being Overshadowed

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 29

 BODY:
For 12-year-old Kenji Nakanishi, watching the Mets and the Chicago Cubs play their season-opening game at the Tokyo Dome tonight was better than opening presents at Kurisumasu, Japanese for Christmas.
"It's like a dream come true," the sixth grader said, trying to control his emotions. "I got to see my baseball heroes Sammy Sosa and Mike Piazza, and I feel so excited, so tingly inside." 
 Few Japanese in the sellout crowd of 55,000 spectators, who paid as much as $120 for a ticket, would seem to disagree with young Kenji's assessment of the first regular-season major league game to be played outside North America.
Motoharu Yanamoto, managing editor of Weekly Baseball Magazine, said that for Japanese fans, holding a major league season opener in Tokyo was "a monumental, unbelievable event." The game was a rare opportunity to witness two of America's top teams in real competition, he said. In the past, only major league exhibition games have been held in Japan.
American and Japanese organizers of the event have said they hope the games will create new markets for Major League Baseball overseas while increasing interest in Japan's professional leagues and improving their level of play.
But not everyone was euphoric over the opening of Japan's normally highly protected borders to a prominent foreign product like major league baseball. Long before the Mets and the Cubs arrived here last weekend to great fanfare, many Japanese teams were expressing concerns that allowing the immensely popular major leagues into Japan could be devastating to the country's own professional baseball leagues, siphoning off their top talent and fan base.
Yoshiaki Kanai, secretary general of the Japan Professional Baseball Commissioner's Office, said the commissioner's office agonized over whether to allow the major leagues to stage the games but eventually decided to grant approval because Japan could no longer resist the growing globalization of sports.
"If Japanese baseball is to survive, it has to also make its debut on the global stage, and we need to gain experience competing at that level," Kanai said. "So we decided to open the door to major league baseball so we could raise the technical level and interest in the game in Japan."
With attendance at many Japanese baseball games already on the decline because of the country's stubborn recession and waning interest, some team officials are afraid that given a choice, fans will spend less money on local games and save their precious yen for the major league games. The officials are also upset over the high price of the major league tickets, which cost $120 for the best seats, compared with $59 for comparable seats at a Yomiuri Giants game.
Few Japanese baseball officials were willing to express their complaints on the record, but they have been complaining to the baseball commission and local sports reporters.
"The money fans have is limited these days, and I wonder if fans who bought expensive tickets to the major league games will come to our games, too," an official of a Tokyo-based baseball team told The Asahi Shinbun newspaper.
Moreover, with money from ticket sales, merchandising and broadcast rights flat or falling at many of Japan's 12 baseball franchises, the teams can scarcely afford to match the high salaries that their top players can make in the major leagues.
Some local sports commentators and reporters said the concerns of local Japanese teams are not entirely unjustified, especially if the number of American major league games staged in Japan increases. "The real danger for Japanese baseball is if we start to see a repeat and expansion of major league games here and if we see a growing exodus of top Japanese players to America," Yanamoto, the magazine editor, said. "That could rob us of local talent and focus the attention of Japanese fans to the major league teams where our local boys will be playing."
Many of the complaints about Major League Baseball are coming from Japanese teams that are struggling economically and have limited national television exposure. Japanese baseball is divided into two leagues, each with six clubs.
Teams in the Central League are profitable because they have a huge fan base, mainly because they compete against the Yomiuri Giants, who are backed by a powerful news media organization that broadcasts all its games. Clubs in the Pacific League are generally not profitable and have trouble filling their stadiums. To be profitable, a team must generate about $50 million in annual revenues. Some baseball watchers are concerned that if the situation does not improve, the sport could be reduced to one league with as little as eight or even six teams.
Masaru Ikei, a political science professor at Keio University who is considered an expert on Japanese baseball, said it remains unclear whether Major League Baseball would help or hurt the sport in Japan. But Ikei said that he believes the way Japanese play baseball will be greatly influenced by the staging of major leagues games in Japan. He expects that Japanese baseball games, which are notoriously slow, will become faster and that umpires, who are not highly regarded in Japan, will gain new credibility as the country adopts practices of the major league.
Tim Brosnan, executive vice president in charge of international business for Major League Baseball, sought to dispel any notions that his franchise was trampling over Japanese baseball in its efforts to expand internationally.
"Japanese baseball has had some concerns about this project," Brosnan said, "but we've consulted with them and we've been very mindful to avoid the downside of those issues. Anyone who says these major league games will make the fans think that Japanese teams can't compete hasn't been at the same games I've seen this week." The Giants won exhibition games this week against the Cubs and the Mets.
Many baseball officials and commentators believe there is enough interest in baseball in Japan that fans will watch both local and international team play.
Satoshi Izumida, a 22-year-old part-time worker, certainly thinks so. At the end of tonight's season opener, Izumida, who attended two of the major league exhibition matches this week, prepared to spend the night outside the Tokyo Dome to ensure that he could obtain tickets to the Giants' season opener on Friday.
"I like both the local teams here in Japan and those in the major leagues, but the only problem is that there's not enough money or time to see them all," he said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Hails OPEC Decision to Sell More Oil

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
President Clinton today welcomed the OPEC decision to increase crude oil production and urged oil companies to pass the savings quickly along to consumers.
At a news conference that covered issues from China policy to gun control to taxes on the Internet, the president began by saying that the production increase announced on Tuesday by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was "good news for the economy and for the American consumer."
He proposed no new policies. Until it becomes clear whether gasoline and fuel oil prices fall and by how much, Mr. Clinton said, "we have to just keep our powder dry, keep our options open." 
 The Senate plans to take up legislation on Thursday to cut and potentially repeal the federal gasoline tax, but there is considerable opposition to the measure in Congress. Asked if he would veto the bill, the president said he did not anticipate having to make that decision because he did not expect Congress to approve the bill.
Republicans in Congress, hoping to get political mileage from the steep increase in gasoline prices this year, continued today to attack the administration on energy issues. "There is, unfortunately, a Clinton-Gore anti-energy policy, and the American people are paying the price -- at the gas pumps -- for eight years of neglect," said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader.
Mr. Armey and many of his colleagues want tax breaks for oil producers and more oil and gas exploration on federal land, including the waters off Florida and California and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.
Mr. Clinton opposes those measures. Today, he renewed the call he made in his State of the Union address in January for new steps to promote fuel conservation and alternative energy sources.
For years, the Republican Congress has rejected the administration's requests for more money for energy research and for tougher fuel economy standards for automobiles and trucks.
Republicans in Congress are divided over whether to try to lower the federal gasoline tax, now 24.4 cents a gallon. The measure before the Senate would immediately roll back the 4.3 cents enacted in 1993, which was part of a large budget measure approved by the Senate after Vice President Al Gore cast the tie-breaking vote. The remaining tax would be rescinded if average gasoline prices, now slightly above $1.50 a gallon, reached $2 a gallon.

HEADLINE: Reluctant Iran Falls in Line With OPEC Production Rise

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: VIENNA, March 29

 BODY:
Just hours after Iran angrily broke ranks with all other OPEC members here today, its leaders reversed themselves and announced that they would, after all, try to raise production in line with the rest of the oil-producing nations.
"We are going to keep and preserve our market share," said Iran's OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili. "Beyond that, we will see what will happen." 
 Iran's quick reversal added to the drama that has surrounded the meeting of oil ministers, which ended here early today when 9 of the 11 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to raise production quotas by 1.45 million barrels a day.
If Iran continues to pump in line with its share of the market, the cartel's production limit will rise by 1.7 million barrels a day, about 7 percent, beginning next month. Iraq is now the only OPEC member not a party to the accord.
Iran's reluctant acceptance reflected OPEC's continuing power to enforce a unified pricing strategy. Despite the messy process here, economic analysts said there was little danger that the group would dissolve into the bickering -- and erratic production -- that occurred years ago when prices plummeted.
Oil markets interpreted the agreement today as a sign that production would indeed rise, and prices fell moderately in commodity trading around the world.
In New York, oil prices fell 64 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $26.45 a barrel on the Mercantile Exchange, the lowest level since Jan. 12. Since a nine-year peak of $34.37 a barrel three weeks ago, prices have fallen 23 percent, mostly because traders had anticipated that oil cartel members would raise their production quotas here.
One OPEC official predicted that in the next few weeks, oil prices would continue to decline, and Iraq's oil minister, Amer Mohammed Rasheed, forecast that the decline would persist in coming months.
But lower prices at gasoline pumps in the United States are probably months away, experts said, especially with inventories low and demand for fuel likely to rise in the summer. Also, the increased production is not so sizable that it is expected to reduce prices substantially at the pump.
In practice, the total OPEC increase will be much smaller because several members are already overshooting quotas by 1.2 million barrels a day. Analysts estimate that after the quotas are raised, most of this cheating will simply be absorbed into the new limits.
As for crude oil prices, experts predict that they could start climbing again by this winter, because demand is likely to remain strong, the world's oil inventories are low and they will not be fully replenished.
What is more, several OPEC countries have little excess capacity and would not be able to exceed their production limits further, even if they wanted to.
Tuesday night when Iran refused to participate in the agreement, several analysts worried that the rift could set off a frenzy of cheating by a few OPEC members. But today, Iran's grudging compliance suggested that Saudi Arabia has enough power to enforce the pricing and production regime in the face of objections.
"The excess capacity is unevenly distributed," said Irene King, senior oil economist at J. P. Morgan & Company. "Seventy percent of the excess capacity is in three countries -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Abu Dhabi." Those countries, she added, are the ones most interested in preserving OPEC's grip on the market.
In a fierce feud with Saudi Arabia, Iranian officials had initially argued that any significant increase could send prices plunging and would be a capitulation to the United States.
But Iranian officials also knew that holding the line on oil production would be both futile and costly. On the one hand, their refusal to pump more crude would do little to keep oil prices high. On the other, Iran would lose sales as countries like Saudi Arabia simply filled the gap.
Indeed, the real point Iran wanted to make today was to attack the United States and its aggressive lobbying for higher production.
"This is a question about influence," said Mr. Ardebili today, asserting that Bill Richardson, the American energy secretary, had telephoned OPEC's president, Ali Rodriguez of Venezuela, just as the OPEC oil ministers were meeting on Tuesday.
"In the 40-year history of OPEC there has never been a case of the secretary of energy calling OPEC ministers in the middle of a meeting," Mr. Ardebili complained. "We are very upset and disappointed at the external pressure. We don't like it."
All in all, the increase in oil production quotas did not live up to the two million barrels a day that the United States had sought.
However, the OPEC agreement will probably be supplemented by several hundred thousand barrels from Mexico and Norway, non-OPEC countries that participated in last year's cuts.
Indeed in Mexico City today, the energy minister announced that the country would raise production by 150,000 barrels a day.
Exhausted oil ministers described marathon battles over ideology as much as money.
Saudi Arabia, the conservative kingdom whose enormous oil reserves overshadow those of any other OPEC member, was determined to increase production enough to bring oil prices down to about $25.
Why seek a lower price at all? Analysts say Saudi officials were worried that with oil at $30 a barrel or higher, demand in the United States would eventually decline.
"We want a stable market, we want a well-supplied market and we want a market that will be in equilibrium all the time," Ali al-Naimi, the Saudi minister, said.
But Mr. Ardebili of Iran wanted to keep prices high and worried that OPEC risked repeating the blunder made at a meeting in Jakarta in 1997, when Saudi Arabia pushed through a production increase only to see prices fall.
OPEC leaders have always wanted to present a unified front, and even the Saudis had preached about the need for consensus. But after hours of fruitless wrangling, Mr. Naimi idecided to ignore Iran and go ahead without its agreement.
"Oh but we do have consensus," Crown Prince Aziz said with a mischievous grin. "We have consensus among nine members, and we happen to have one that does not agree."

HEADLINE: China Bars Basketball Star From U.S. Event

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, March 29

 BODY:
China has barred a young basketball star from taking part this weekend in the Nike Hoop Summit in Indianapolis, an exhibition event meant to showcase the world's best young players and introduce them to the N.B.A.
The player, Yao Ming, 19, is a 7-foot-6 center for the Shanghai Sharks, a professional team, and has long been viewed as a possible future player in the N.B.A., which has had very few players his size. He had hoped to display his skills at the Nike games, which fall during the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Final Four playoffs and are closely watched by agents and coaches looking to recruit international talent. 
 But China's basketball bureaucrats have decided that Mr. Yao should stay home. "Yao Ming has been chosen for China's national Olympic team and must start intensive training in Beijing on April 1," said Xu Minfeng, director of the Chinese Basketball Association's general office.
Mr. Xu said the "second reason" that Mr. Yao was not allowed to leave is that he "has played a lot of games in the past year, feels very tired and needs time to recover."
Mr. Yao apparently does not have any choice. The basketball association, a government agency, said Mr. Yao "must abide by the decision." Questions were referred to the State Sports General Administration's propaganda department, which could not be reached. Mr. Yao left Shanghai for Beijing today and was unavailable for comment. His father, reached by telephone, declined to discuss the matter.
China's decision is a stark reminder that despite advances in the country's economy, its people are not necessarily free to travel abroad at will and remain subject to the whims of the central government bureaucracy. The ban is reminiscent of the cold war era, when many Soviet athletes were prevented from traveling abroad or, when they did, defected to freer societies in the West.
It also darkens Mr. Yao's N.B.A. dreams, which would bring him millions of dollars if realized, compared with the $8,000 a year his team managers say he earns now.
The Jinan Times, the newspaper in Shandong Province that reported the travel ban, said Mr. Yao had hoped that this weekend's games would have shown that he ranked among the top international players. Basketball executives say the games were to have been Mr. Yao's "coming-out party," and would have helped him decide whether to put himself into the N.B.A. draft this year. Players under 22 must declare their desire to participate in the draft to the N.B.A., in writing, by mid-May.
"What a shame!" the Shandong newspaper quoted Mr. Yao as saying. "What a big shame! This is my last chance." He will not be eligible for the games next year.
The Jinan Times report was picked up by several Chinese-language Web sites and word of the government's decision spread quickly through the sporting community.
China is counting on Mr. Yao and another player, Wang Zhizhi, for a chance at winning a gold medal at this summer's Olympics, a hugely prestigious prize for a country obsessed with its standing in international forums. Mr. Wang was prevented from going to the United States last year after he was drafted by the Dallas Mavericks, and many people believe his value as an Olympic player was a primary reason.
China remains sensitive to what it considers a history of foreign exploitation, and that extends to sports. The country's fledgling basketball league is also reluctant to let the United States begin poaching its best players, even though a Chinese player in the N.B.A. would undoubtedly increase interest in the sport at home. "We need Yao Ming here," the Shanghai Sharks' general manager, Li Yaomin, said in a recent interview.
Still, provided that Mr. Yao is not injured, he will remain an attractive N.B.A. candidate for years, giving him time to wait for China to change its attitude.

Company Laying Off 400

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The Fleming Companies will lay off 400 workers as it continues to close its warehouse and administrative operations in the Buffalo area.
Fleming, a food wholesaler and retailer in Oklahoma City, announced the plans in early February, followed by efforts of government and labor officials to change the company's mind. 
 Despite an offer of an incentive package worth at least $1.1 million to stay, the company is moving ahead with plans to shift the Buffalo work to an Ohio facility.
More than 80 warehouse workers reported to work for the last time on Friday. The remaining employees are expected to be released over the next few weeks.
At the time of the announcement of the closing, Fleming said economics prompted the decision. The company has closed eight other warehouse centers in the United States in the last two years.

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD;
Big Shoulders, Buffed for Action

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
When friends from abroad come to the United States, I always send them to Chicago, or try to. It is the quintessential American city: muscular, inventive, wonderfully diverse, worldly-wise (if a bit oafish at times) and as unpretentious as its prairie-flat vowels.
"Chicago is American in every chitling and sparerib," H. L. Mencken wrote wickedly during the era when the city's stockyards, since demolished, were the biggest anywhere. "It is alive from snout to tail." 
 Reviled in the days of Al Capone and John Dillinger as a haven for hoodlums, Chicago was maligned for years for its cheerful civic corruption and dismissed in the effete East as a hick town. Nelson Algren, one of the writers who knew it best, said that "loving Chicago is like loving a woman with a broken nose." But no more. Chicago enters the 21st century as a prosperous, well-governed model for the rest of the country.
Richard M. Daley does the governing. He won a third term as mayor last year, and he and his minions sometimes seem to be everywhere at once, effacing graffiti, reshaping the schools and creating new green spaces like the 16-acre, $230-million Millennium Park, with a Frank O. Gehry band shell and pedestrian bridge, just north of the Art Institute. Consummate pol that he is, the mayor works hard to maintain links to arts groups, business, labor, blacks and Hispanics.
He bullies enemies. He mangles syntax, though not as mercilessly as his father, Richard J. Daley, who spoke unconsciously for all politicians everywhere when he harrumphed, "Together we must rise to ever higher and higher platitudes." But Richard M. -- "Richie" to his constituents -- never loses sight of his grand goal: ensuring the city's future by persuading its middle class to stay. He has made a good deal of headway.
Daley the elder, who ruled Chicago like a pharaoh for 21 years, also did a lot to beautify the city. But he is best remembered for flying into a black rage at the 1968 Democratic convention, siccing his cops on Vietnam War protesters and the reporters covering them. The ensuing melee, a grim spectacle of swirling tear gas and flailing billy clubs, all but guaranteed the defeat of the party's hapless nominee, Hubert H. Humphrey.
The first president nominated in Chicago was a favorite son named Abraham Lincoln, and a dozen others have been nominated here since. One of them was Warren Gamaliel Harding, whose grandiose middle name promised so much more than he delivered; he was chosen in the original smoke-filled room, Suite 408-409-410 of the Blackstone Hotel.
They must put something into the water in Chicago. Politics here -- national politics, local politics -- never pales. This is the city, you may recall, that produced not only the Daleys but also Daniel Rostenkowski, the consummate congressional deal maker, a stout political oak felled by a petty-cash scandal; aldermen-scoundrels of yore like Bathhouse John Coughlin and Hinky Dink Kenna and Paddy Bauler, who told the world in 1955, "Chicago ain't ready for reform"; and Mayor William Hale Thompson, who threatened to punch King George V in the nose if he dared set foot in the city.
Obviously there is nothing Old World about Chicago. Europe seems further away here than it does in Boston, New York or even San Francisco. And yet the genius who did more than anyone else to give the city its charm -- the architect Daniel H. Burnham, who planned waterfront pleasure parks and scenic drives where other cities have factories and warehouses -- did so in the name of transforming Chicago into Paris on the Lake. On Lake Michigan, which lies like an ocean at the city's feet, "so huge that you can't see across," as my awed wife, Betsey, said when she first came here.
"Make no little plans, for they have no magic to stir men's blood," said Burnham, the master planner who laid out the new city that rose from the rubble of the flimsy boom town consumed in the Great Fire of 1871. He made none, nor have the generations of builders who succeeded him.
 
Hot Dogs and Fancy Stuff
The old song warns, "Don't ever ask what Chicago is, unless you've got an hour or two or three."
Chicago is a lot of things: the fabulous Frango chocolate mints that they sell at Marshall Field's department store; Oprah Winfrey, queen of television talk; Ann Landers, ageless purveyor of newspaper advice to the lovelorn; the Chicago River, once a key link between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi, which is dyed green every St. Patrick's Day, and O'Hare Airport, the sprawling kingdom of fallen arches and missed connections used by 70 million passengers a year.
All that and the Lincoln Park Zoo, which makes a specialty of breeding gorillas; the Field Museum of Natural History; the vast Museum of Science and Industry, the youngsters' favorite, housed in the only building left from the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893; and the John G. Shedd Aquarium, the world's largest, which my sister, Barbara, calls "the whale jail."
Chicago is good eats: the frogs' legs at Phil Smidt's in Hammond, Ind., just across the city line, amid the smokestacks of the old industrial economy, and Italian beef sandwiches and deep-dish pizza and garlicky Chicago hot dogs (hold the ketchup). Fancy stuff, too. I remember when Jovan Trboyevic, the fastidious wonder worker who ran the much-mourned Le Perroquet, was alone in offering proper haute cuisine; now it's all over town.
Chicago is also a city of neighborhoods, so far-flung that the visitor can sample but a few.
Off to the northwest, in the gritty areas along Milwaukee and Lincoln Avenues, far from Michigan Avenue's glittering Magnificent Mile, where the affluent shop, immigrants have lived since the mid-19th century: first Germans and Scandinavians, then Poles, Russian Jews, Italians, Ukrainians, Slovaks and most recently Puerto Ricans. Shop signs in countless languages and churches with exotically shaped domes serve as testaments to the succeeding waves of newcomers.
 
Saving a Church
One of the churches, St. Stanislaus Kotka, which had the world's biggest Roman Catholic congregation only a century ago, was saved from the wrecker's ball by Mr. Rostenkowski, who used his legendary clout to divert a new federally financed expressway around it.
The South Side has been America's largest black community for most of the last century. It is home today to Jesse Jackson and Louis Farrakhan, two very different black leaders, and two prominent black members of Congress, Jesse Jackson Jr. and Bobby Rush. Once Mr. Rush was a Black Panther leader; now he is a moderate who says, "Most African-Americans just want a comfortable middle-class lifestyle." They find it more easily on the South Side than on the West Side, which is almost as bedraggled today as it was when the Nobel Prize winner Jane Addams and her staff at Hull House labored there early in the century.
Also to the south is the top-drawer University of Chicago, founded in 1890 with Rockefeller money. No fewer than 69 Nobel Prizes have been awarded to its teachers, students and researchers. Among the laureates are Saul Bellow, the novelist, and Milton Friedman, the conservative economist, whose teachings influenced not only his colleagues but also influential scholars at the university's law school, like Edward H. Levi, who served as attorney general in the Ford administration.
Beneath the Stagg Field grandstands, Enrico Fermi and his co-workers achieved the first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear reaction on Dec. 2, 1942, the most important step in developing the atomic bomb. The site is marked with a massive bronze by Henry Moore, "Nuclear Energy."
 
In the Loop
Frank Lloyd Wright's prototypical Prairie Style building, the Robie House, stands nearby, echoing the horizontality of the plains in its strip windows, the deep overhang of its eaves and even in the proportions of his trademark Roman bricks, very long and very skinny. The house made him world famous, along with the houses he built for himself and others in the western suburbs of Oak Park and River Forest. Also in Oak Park is Unity Temple, "my little jewel," as Wright called it, a masterpiece in reinforced concrete, built in 1905 on an awkward site for only $45,000.
But the birthplace of modern architecture, and of the skyscraper, was the Loop, as the central business district is known (after the elevated train tracks that circle it).
Chicago's architects capitalized on the fire of 1871, which began in Patrick and Catherine O'Leary's barn on DeKoven Street, much as Christopher Wren capitalized on London's Great Fire of 1666. They were influenced by the great Henry Hobson Richardson's startlingly original Glessner House, a rugged study in rusticated stone (1887) that turned its back to the street, opening instead onto a south-facing courtyard.
Louis Sullivan, Richardson's disciple and Wright's teacher, sensed "an intoxicating rawness, a sense of big things to be done," and began with the Auditorium Building in 1889. Its acoustically perfect 4,000-seat theater, spanned by vast flattened arches, illuminated by thousands of clear, unshaded bulbs, is one of America's great interiors.
At the same time Burnham & Root were designing the Rookery a few blocks away, organized around a graceful cast-iron light court that Wright reworked to good effect in 1906. In 1891 Burnham & Root built the brooding 16-story Monadnock Building, a pioneering skyscraper, and in 1899 Sullivan, in the Carson Pirie Scott & Company store, frankly expressed the revolutionary steel grid in bands of windows that became a Chicago School trademark. Below he applied webs of his luxuriant foliate ornament in cast iron.
All these buildings remain, on or near State Street, "that great street," a living textbook of modern architectural development.
Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the German master who helped found the Bauhaus, came to Chicago to escape Nazi persecution and reinvigorated Chicago architecture. His deceptively simple stripped-down steel-and-concrete designs, like the apartment buildings on North Lake Shore Drive, the Federal Center in the Loop and the Illinois Tech campus on the South Side, achieve a rare elegance through the careful calibration of proportion.
From Mies's work grew such landmarks as the John Hancock Tower, the distinctively cross-braced high-rise by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill in the Magnificent Mile shopping area, and in reaction to it arose the postmodern movement, epitomized here by the sleek buildings of Helmut Jahn.
 
Icons of Isolation
In among the shining towers stands an unparalleled collection of modern street sculpture: not only Picasso's enigmatic Cor-Ten steel beast outside the Daley Center and a 100-foot-tall baseball bat by Claes Oldenburg on West Madison Street but also big works by Calder, Stella and Miro.
You can see many of the best surviving buildings on boat tours organized by the Chicago Architecture Foundation, and at the Art Institute you can see fragments of many that have been destroyed, including the entire, colorfully stenciled trading room of the old Chicago Stock Exchange by Louis Sullivan.
But it is for paintings that the Art Institute, a "universal" museum like the Metropolitan and the Louvre, is best known. There is a St. John the Baptist by Guido Reni, admired by Sister Wendy on a recent visit, but most of the lures are newer: Seurat's "Grande Jatte," the greatest of Pointillist canvases; "Paris Street: Rainy Day" by Gustave Caillebotte, a magnificent mood piece to which the institute gave pride of place long before the general revival of interest in his work; and two icons of American isolation, Edward Hopper's "Nighthawks" and Grant Wood's "American Gothic."
Farther up Michigan Avenue, the Terra Museum of American Art rotates its collection every few months; when we were last there, a George Luks called "Knitting for the Soldiers" (1918) struck us with its acid Kirchner-like colors. Nearby, the excellent Museum of Contemporary Art showcases its own holdings, which range from Bruce Nauman to Cindy Sherman and well beyond, in a series of barrel-vaulted galleries. The museum looks out across a cityscape typical of this part of Chicago, with wide, tree-lined sidewalks and an agreeable little park surrounded on three sides by tall buildings.
 
Da Bulls an' Da Bears
Chicago loves its sports. It loves the Cubs and their cozy little park, Wrigley Field, with ivy-covered outfield walls and seldom-used floodlights. (God made baseball to be played under his own light, the Cubs and their fans believe.) Forget the fact that the Cubs haven't played in a World Series since 1945 or won one since 1908. Chicago loved Da Bears in the heyday of Mike Ditka and Walter Payton. It swooned over Da Bulls and their balletic, clutch-loving, gravity-defying star of stars, Michael Jordan.
Air Jordan and the Bulls carried the city's name around the globe; so did Sir Georg Solti and the mighty Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which he made one of the finest on earth. But both are gone now, Air retired, Solti dead. The Bulls are rebuilding, and the orchestra has not quite managed to maintain its old luster, despite the manifold gifts of its current music director, Daniel Barenboim.
Mr. Barenboim's goals are different from those of Solti, a taskmaster if not a martinet, who drilled his players until they achieved a rare precision. At its peak the Chicago was best noted for the sonority of its brass choirs, especially in the late romantic repertory. Sometimes its Bruckner rang out with the awesome power of the horns of heaven.
Since taking over in 1991, Mr. Barenboim has encouraged subtlety. Today quiet passages are often as impressive as climaxes, though some critics, including James R. Oestreich of The New York Times, have detected occasional raggedness. Many listeners wonder how things will change when the virtuoso trumpeter Adolph Herseth, who is now 78, finally yields his chair.
Still, Mr. Barenboim is a musician of substance as well as a figure of glamour. At Orchestra Hall and on tour in the United States and abroad, he not only conducts but doubles as a piano soloist, and he has kept the orchestra ensconced among the nation's elite musical ensembles.
The big stir in Chicago music this past season came from the Lyric Opera's heralded premiere of a work it commissioned, William Bolcolm's "View From the Bridge," based on the Arthur Miller play. The critics were kind, and the company liked it so much that it has asked Mr. Bolcom, a genial University of Michigan professor who likes Gershwin and Youmans as much as Puccini, to produce two more new scores for production in the next decade.
It was a general director named Ardis Krainik, one of the rare women in her line of work, who propelled the Lyric into the first rank of American opera houses, along with the Metropolitan and San Francisco. (Some would add Houston to the list.) She died in 1997, to be succeeded by William Mason, and the company has gone from strength to strength. It sells more than 100 percent of its seats every year, an unparalleled accomplishment, because subscribers religiously turn in unwanted tickets for resale.
 
Dance and Drama
Chicago has also taken the Joffrey Ballet to its heart. Directed by Gerald Arpino, the company moved its base here in 1995 from New York after running into financial trouble. It seems to have restored its bank balance and renewed its classical style. Mr. Daley regularly attends performances.
Big-league drama abounds in the Windy City. Two of the most widely applauded Broadway productions of the past couple of years originated at the Goodman Theater here: Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman," starring Brian Dennehy, and Eugene O'Neill's "Moon for the Misbegotten," starring Cherry Jones and Gabriel Byrne. Another O'Neill play, "Desire Under the Elms," directed by Walter Dallas, scored a hit this winter at the Court. And the Steppenwolf helped propel David Mamet and John Malkovich to fame.
No better evidence could be found that Chicago has long since shed the "Second City" complex A. J. Liebling diagnosed 50 years ago.
The Chicago Tribune, still ensconced in its lacy neo-Gothic tower on Michigan Avenue, is in almost every respect a different animal from the wacky, pugnaciously conservative, isolationist sheet full of local puffery and idiosyncratic spelling that Col. Robert R. McCormick oversaw in the 1940's and 50's. It is in the process of buying The Los Angeles Times, The Baltimore Sun and Newsday, plus several television stations, which will make it one of the nation's handful of dominant media conglomerates.
 
Patrons of the Arts
Swift and Armour and the other barons of beef are no more; Chicago is no longer "hog butcher to the world." Only a gate adorned with a bas-relief of a Hereford steer remains of the Union Stockyards, where in 1892 alone 2.5 million cattle and 5 million hogs were slaughtered. Many of the big corporations hereabouts, like Walgreen's, United Air Lines, Motorola and Sears, which abandoned its eponymous skyscraper in the Loop, are out in the suburbs. Amoco and Ameritech and a couple of big banks succumbed to takeovers. But many biggies remain, including Bank One, Sara Lee and Quaker Oats, to which the city gave $9.75 million in tax breaks to stay.
Most of them support the arts with enthusiasm. C. Steven McMillan, who takes over as chief executive of Sara Lee on July 1, told me not long ago, "The arts, politics and the business community are more heavily comingled in Chicago than in any other American city I know of, to everyone's benefit."
Down at the foot of La Salle Street, in a fine Art Deco building with a statue of Ceres on top, is the headquarters of the Chicago Board of Trade, where the big commodity traders do their (to me) incomprehensible thing.
"Few economic institutions," the social historian Thomas Cronon tells us sternly in "Nature's Metropolis" (Norton, 1991), "more powerfully affect human communities and natural ecosystems in the modern capitalist world. Even those of us who will never trade wheat or pork bellies on the Chicago futures markets depend upon those markets for our very survival."
I'll have to take his word for it. Meanwhile, allow me to focus for a moment on Chicago's writers: the early reformers Frank Norris and Upton Sinclair; the overearnest but underrated Theodore Dreiser, whose "Sister Carrie" still moves me; James T. Farrell, whose "Studs Lonigan" is set in one part of the South Side, and Richard Wright, whose "Native Son" is set in another; Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, who gave us the greatest of all newspaper plays, "The Front Page," and Carl Sandburg, who for better or worse gave Chicago its overfamiliar nickname, "City of the Big Shoulders."
More recently, the city and its ways have been depicted by Mike Royko, the irascible newspaper columnist; Studs Turkel, the oral historian; and Ward Just, the novelist.
A moment, too, for the popular arts: the blues that Muddy Waters and others brought up the Illinois Central from Mississippi; the jazz that King Oliver and Louis Armstrong brought to the South Side, echoed by white kids from the suburbs like Benny Goodman and Eddie Condon; and the wacky, wonderful plaster cows (including Ferragamoo, sponsored by the Italian fashion house) that appeared all over the city in the summer of 1999.
It was Sinatra's kind of town, and it is mine, too.
 
You'll Have the Time, the Time of Your Life
 
Chicago is about 790 miles west of New York City. Here is a sampling of attractions, along with travel information:
 
Where to Stay
 
BURNHAM, 1 West Washington Street, (312) 782-1111. In a minor miracle of adaptive restoration, D. H. Burnham's Reliance Building (1891), one of the world's first skyscrapers, has been raised from near-dead and turned into a boutique hotel, managed by the Kimpton Group of San Francisco. In the heart of the Loop, it has 103 rooms and 19 suites, average in size, below average in price. A lot of fine original detail has been retained, including the terra cotta facade, terrazzo floors and Carrara wainscoting. Double room: $135 to $230.
 
FAIRMONT, 200 North Columbus Drive, (312) 565-8000. A businessman's favorite a few blocks north of the Loop, the Fairmont occupies a 42-story post-modern tower sheathed in pink granite. Its 692 exceptionally large rooms offer drop-dead views over the city or the lake, plus marble-topped desks and tables. Give the Primavera restaurant a pass; the waiters sing. Double room: $159 to $259.
 
FOUR SEASONS, 120 East Delaware Place, (312) 280-8800. In city after American city, the Four Seasons is the top-rated hotel. The Windy City is no exception. The English-country-house-fantasy lobby occupies the 7th floor of a 66-story skyscraper, above a mall full of chic shops (Bloomie's, Bendel's). Whatever you want, it's right at hand: barber and beauty shop, sauna, indoor pool and a stellar restaurant, Seasons, with Mark Baker as chef. Double room: $465 to $900.
 
RITZ-CARLTON, 160 East Pearson Street, (312) 266-1000. Operated by the Four Seasons chain, despite the misleading name, this luxurious lair forms part of the Water Tower Place complex, smack in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. Its bright, expansive lobby, complete with octagonal fountain, is on the 12th floor. Guest rooms are all that anyone could ask, as is Sarah Stegner's cuisine; her Sunday brunch, Chicago's most sumptuous, ranges from gravlax to mini-souffles. Double room: $400 to $3,000.
 
WHITEHALL, 105 East Delaware Place, (312) 944-6300. European in style and ambiance, this little hideaway is tucked into a side street, well away from Michigan Avenue's noise and bustle. In-room faxes, phones with data ports and wall safes were installed in a recent renovation. On weekends and during special promotions, prices are low by Magnificent Mile standards. Double room: $199 to $379.
 
Where to Eat
 
ARUN, 4156 North Kedzie Avenue, (773) 539-1909. This is America's best Thai restaurant, a kitsch-free zone where the food on the plates is just as delicate as the ceremonial headdresses adorning the room. Miang kum, the first of 12 stellar dishes at a recent meal, consisted of batons of lime peel, ginger and coconut, heaped with tiny red peppers and peanuts on betel-nut leaves with tamarind sauce. It would awaken the most jaded palate. Superb Austrian and American wines; tasting menu only, $75 and worth it.
 
BERGHOFF, 17 West Adams Street, (312) 427-3170. Old Chicago, alive and kicking. Owned by the same clan since 1898, the Berghoff holds the first liquor license issued by the city after Repeal. It brews its own beers and root beer and serves all the old favorites from Mittel Europa, like herring, bratwurst and knackwurst with sauerkraut and real wiener schnitzel.
 
CHARLIE TROTTER'S, 816 West Armitage Avenue, (773) 248-6228. One of the nation's two or three premier chefs, Mr. Trotter makes gastronomic Faberge eggs. He bathes foie gras, salmon and Japanese mushrooms in a warm broth to create a dish that is both rich and refreshing: a rarity. The service is fluent and the wine list (check the big bottles) mind-blowing.
 
EVEREST, 440 South LaSalle Street, (312) 663-8920. The next time someone tells you he never eats on top of skyscrapers, send him to Jean Joho's place, 40 floors up. Alsatian-born, Mr. J. blends the cuisine of kings with the cooking of commoners in dishes like creamy sauerkraut soup with caviar. The attention to detail is constant, the tapestry of lights below stirring, the service urbane and the Alsatian wines the best in the hemisphere.
 
FRONTERA GRILL AND TOPOLOBAMPO, 445 North Clark Street, (312) 661-1434. You could spend half a lifetime in Oaxaca and know less about Mexican food than you will learn at Rick and Deann Bayless's two restaurants, one casual, the other less so. Both, saturated with vibrant color, serve food prepared with immense care from the best ingredients. Every sip or bite is a revelation, from margaritas to marlin ceviche to tacos al pastor.
 
GIBSONS, 1028 North Rush Street, (312) 266-8999. Chicago is a steak town from way back. It has plenty of places to satisfy your carnivorous impulses, but this one, packed with politicians, visiting show-biz types, bulky guys in warm-up jackets and head-turning dolls, epitomizes the city's exuberance. Order a martini, chopped chicken livers (try them on the house raisin bread) and either a W. R. Cut (a bone-in rib-eye named for the Tribune's food columnist, William Rice), or tender London broil (made with top sirloin). Desserts, like strawberry shortcake, are the size of a steamboat.
 
M K, 868 North Franklin Street, (312) 482-9179. The letters stand for Michael Kornick, the chef, and he stands for modern American cooking with bright, true flavors. Sweetbreads with caramelized endive, for example, and definitive calves' liver with grilled Vidalia onions, Nueske bacon strips and a sauce of mustard and pan juices. The decor is terminally chic.
 
SPIAGGIA, 980 North Michigan Avenue, (312) 280-2750. The name means "beach," and you can glimpse the lake from this snazzy aerie perched above the Magnificent Mile. But bag the view. Paul Bartolotta's thoroughbred Italian cooking, the best between New York and Santa Monica, is the thing to focus on here: full-flavored, grown-up, fantasy-free dishes like asparagus with unctuous fonduta, gnocchi with duck ragu and wood-roasted rabbit.
 
TRU, 676 North St. Clair Street, (312) 202-0001. In from the suburbs, Rick Tramonto and Gale Gand are challenging Charlie Trotter and Jean Joho for local supremacy in an airy glacier-white room. Mr. Tramonto sends out a lobster risotto in a miniature copper saucepan and serves dazzling savory sorbets (beet, orange pepper, etc.) in parmesan cones. Ms. Gand, his wife, whips up whimsies like pineapple "carpaccio." Well-chosen wines.

HEADLINE: Grace Under Pressure

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Johanna Winant complains that while people would not ask an unemployed adult about his job search, they usually don't hesitate to ask high school seniors about college applications (Op-Ed, March 27). But once Ms. Winant's college years have passed, she will learn that people usually don't know better than to ask about a job search and will usually pat a pregnant woman's belly. These gestures are not insensitive, but simply natural, interested responses. 
 Yes, patting bellies is somewhat intrusive, but if you tell an acquaintance you are unemployed, do you really expect him or her to whistle and talk about the weather?
With the shift to adulthood come challenges that require not only strength but also the ability to handle seemingly imprudent inquiries about those challenges with grace.

Treasury PricesAdvance as Investors Seek a Safer Haven

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Largely ignoring news that the economy grew at a pace of 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, faster than previously reported, bonds reacted instead yesterday to a decline in stocks as investors sought the safety of Treasuries.
Bonds continue to be influenced by stocks, so when global stock markets dropped before the opening of the United States market, Treasury yields fell to their lowest level in more than a week. When the American stock market opened on a relatively firm note, Treasuries trimmed some of those earlier gains. But bonds advanced later as the Nasdaq slumped on a sell-off in technology shares. 
 The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 121/32 , to 1059/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 5.87 percent from 5.97 percent on Wednesday, its biggest one-day drop in almost two months. The yield is at its lowest level since Aug. 24, when the Federal Reserve raised its rate on overnight loans between banks by one-quarter point, the second of five increases since last June intended to slow the economy.
The Commerce Department's final estimate of gross domestic product for the last quarter of 1999 reported a growth rate of 7.3 percent, revised from the previous estimate of 6.9 percent and higher than economists' expectations of 7.1 percent. Even though it was a strong number, some market participants felt it was not necessarily new information.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said: "The U.S. economy is in uncharted waters, roaring ahead at a prodigious pace in the midst of the longest expansion on record. Indeed, G.D.P. growth has accelerated over the past nine months despite five pre-emptive tightening moves by the Federal Reserve. And while the nation's economic momentum during the first quarter of the year 2000 will not be quite as torrid as the blistering 7.3 percent pace registered during the fourth quarter of 1999, it will still be in excess of the Fed's perceived maximum noninflationary 3.5 percent trend rate of growth."
And for that reason, Mr. Fine says he thinks the Fed will continue to raise rates until it sees signs that the economy is moderating. Most market participants expect the Fed policy makers to raise rates by another quarter-point at their next meeting on May 16.
Another recurring theme in the bond market is the effect of the government budget surplus and buyback program, which have caused an inverted yield curve, in which investors who take on more risk by owning long-term debt are paid less than those holding short-term instruments. The yield on a two-year note is now at 6.48 percent, and yields on the longer maturities are lower.
"In addition," Mr. Fine said, "growing concerns about risks in other sectors have, at times, produced a flight-to-quality movement into Treasuries, and with asset allocations jumping around between cash, bonds, traditional stocks and particularly tech-sector equities, the markets appear to be searching for some kind of anchor in what has recently become a rather volatile financial world."
Elsewhere, corporate bonds got off to a bad start, with market participants concerned that the government would not be responsible for agencies like Fannie Mae if they default on their debt, which has caused some unwinding of those positions. A bill pending in the House of Representatives would repeal a conditional line of credit that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have with the Treasury, thus stripping them of some tax and regulatory advantages they now have over commercial and investment banks.

HEADLINE: Growth Rate For Economy Accelerates

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
The economy grew at a 7.3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1999, the fastest in almost 16 years, revised government figures showed today.
The growth rate -- stronger than the 6.9 percent previously reported by the Commerce Department -- was paced by higher consumer spending and a smaller trade deficit. It capped the third consecutive year in which the economy grew faster than 4 percent. 
 Consumer spending, buoyed by rising confidence and unemployment at close to a three-decade low, fueled the fourth-quarter gain in gross domestic product as the economy closed in on a record expansion that begins its 10th year this week.
The fourth-quarter pace was the fastest since the economy grew at a 9 percent pace in the first quarter of 1984. It followed a 5.7 percent rate of growth in the third quarter.
For all of 1999, the economy expanded 4.2 percent. The last time the economy expanded at 4 percent or more for three consecutive years was 1976 to 1978.
The new numbers suggest the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a sixth time in less than a year when its policy makers meet again on May 16, economists said.
The Fed's five interest rate increases since June were intended "to slow down the growth of aggregate demand because we think it's growing at a rate that's not sustainable," Michael Moskow, president of the Fed Bank of Chicago, said in a speech today.
Adding to that concern is a dwindling supply of workers as the unemployment rate hovers close to a 30-year low. The Labor Department reported today that initial claims for unemployment benefits rose by 3,000, to a seasonally adjusted 266,000, in the week ended March 25. Even with the increase, the level of claims is close to a 26-year low.
Still, faster fourth-quarter growth occurred without causing inflation to accelerate. The G.D.P. price deflator -- a measure of price increases that is watched by many investors -- rose at a 1.9 percent rate, previously reported as rising at a 2 percent pace.
The personal consumption expenditure price index, which the Fed uses to make inflation forecasts, rose at a 2.5 percent rate, unchanged from the previous estimate.
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity, rose at a 5.9 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, the same as previously reported and faster than the 4.9 percent pace of the third quarter.
A smaller deficit in services trade also had an effect on the final number. Exports grew faster and imports slower than first estimated.
Exports of goods and services rose at a revised 10.1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, previously reported as an 8.7 percent increase. In the third quarter, exports rose at an 11.5 percent rate. Imports of goods and services grew at a revised 8.7 percent annual rate, previously reported as a 10 percent pace. Third-quarter imports advanced at a 14.9 percent rate.

HEADLINE: In Charmed India, Clinton Wooed, and Maybe Won

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, March 30

 BODY:
Without winning or conceding anything of substance on his tour of South Asia last week, President Clinton may still have helped modestly reduce the risk of war between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan by talking sweet to India and tough to Pakistan.
He spent five days courting India, the region's democratic colossus and rising economic power, with the ardor of a smitten suitor -- and half a day treating Pakistan, America's cold war ally and a nation yet again ruled by generals, like an old girlfriend who is part of the past. 
 After decades of estrangement, Mr. Clinton gambled that the best way to build a closer relationship with India, a nation of one billion people that is hungry for respect, and to encourage it to act soberly with regard to its smaller, but detested, rival, Pakistan, was to give it a dose of unconditional affection.
He demanded no quid pro quo for his visit here -- for example, requiring India's signing of the nuclear test ban treaty. And he seconded India's demand that Pakistan reduce the violence by militants it supports in Kashmir, the Himalayan territory both countries claim.
American diplomats and experts on the region have become increasingly worried that India, angered by intensified attacks by Pakistani-backed guerrillas, will strike across the so-called Line of Control that divides the Indian- and Pakistan-held parts of Kashmir to hit at militant training camps.
But in an interview, Brajesh Mishra, the national security adviser to India's prime minister, said India had assured the Americans that as long as there were no new large-scale Pakistani incursions into Indian territory, "we will not take any provocative action on the other side of the Line of Control."
The American approach to Pakistan was motivated by a different assumption: that Pakistani generals were operating under the illusion that if they stirred up enough trouble in Kashmir, the United States, fearing a conflict that could turn nuclear, would step in and insist that India make concessions.
In recent months, Pakistan-backed militants have become increasingly bold. At the same time, the Indians have added to an already immense military presence that has been criticized for well-documented human rights violations against the civilian population. Pakistan, weaker than India, has long pleaded for international intervention.
"I think for many years they thought that might get us involved and it won't," Mr. Clinton told Peter Jennings of ABC News days before his trip. "I'm not going to be dragged into something that, first of all, that India doesn't want us to be part of and secondly, that I got dragged into from deliberate acts of violence."
Mr. Clinton's sternly worded warnings, issued privately to Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the army chief who has ruled Pakistan since an Oct. 12 coup, and in a televised address to the nation, were meant to leave the generals with no doubt that further violence in Kashmir would deepen Pakistan's international isolation and fail to bring America to the rescue.
But the significance of the trip was not limited to war and peace. In a traveling exhibition of political performance art, Mr. Clinton also began rebuilding America's long-estranged relationship with India, the world's most populous democracy.
In New Delhi, he wowed one of the world's most hard-boiled groups of politicians, the Indian Parliament. "As Clinton walked to the exit, suddenly, as if the dam of hostility had been breached, almost everyone wanted to shake his hand," the news weekly India Today reported.
In Rajasthan, the president danced spontaneously with village women. In Hyderabad, he sang the praises of India's fast-growing software industry.
Outlook, a national magazine, said Mr. Clinton would be remembered as "a warmhearted, fun-loving man."
Americans in the embassy here and those visiting from Washington were almost giddy with relief and amazement that India seemed to have fallen head over heels for Mr. Clinton. After all, the president was in the final year of a second term tainted by scandal, coming to a country that has had notoriously prickly relations with the United States.
But the good feelings of this moment could quickly fade. The administration had been warming up to India in 1997 and 1998 -- planning the first visit to India by an American president in more than two decades -- when India shocked the world with its nuclear tests in May 1998.
"They've been in the gulag for a couple of years and this was their chance to rehabilitate themselves," said an American diplomat.
A lot of the ground lost at the time of the tests was recovered last week as the Americans simply agreed to disagree with India on its development of a nuclear deterrent. But economic sanctions imposed by the United States after the tests are still in place. And the sensitivities of India to what it has often perceived as American highhandedness are still just below the surface.
It is also far from certain that Mr. Clinton's trip will produce the long-term results he seeks: that both nations accede to the test ban treaty, get back to the negotiating table, calm their hostilities and slow down spending on nuclear arsenals.
Though he did not fundamentally change the American position on Kashmir, the length and warmth of his visit to India and the brevity and coolness of his time in Pakistan left the impression in both that the United States has tilted toward India.
"When it became clear that Clinton would be tough with the Pakistanis when he went to Islamabad -- as indeed he was -- India smiled," said Dennis Kux, author of the definitive history of Indian-American relations, "Estranged Democracies" (Sage Publications, 1993).
A decade after the end of the cold war -- during which India drew close to the Soviets and Pakistan to the Americans -- there is a more solid foundation for cooperation between India and the United States.
Both are great, multicultural democracies.
The United States' thriving high technology industry has spawned a crop of successful Indian-born entrepreneurs who are becoming a force in American politics. India itself has a growing software industry with rapidly rising sales to American companies.
More broadly, India's more open, market-driven economy is producing opportunities for American investors, though the dollar amounts remain relatively small. While Mr. Clinton was in India, American companies signed deals worth about $4 billion with Indian firms and state governments in the high technology and power sectors, among others.
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has accepted an invitation to visit the White House before Mr. Clinton leaves office and both governments have committed themselves to high-level consultations on nuclear nonproliferation, trade, the environment and terrorism.
Nonetheless, Mr. Kux, the historian, cautioned that one good visit is no guarantee of better relations. "Only time will tell," he said, "if Clinton and his successor, whether Gore or Bush, and the Indians stay the course."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Stakes in China Suddenly Seem Less Appealing

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, March 30

 BODY:
Wall Street's top-drawer investment firms are falling all over each other to take China's state-owned companies public. After the furor unleashed by the latest deal, they may wonder whether it is worth the grief.
Goldman, Sachs & Company set the price today for its initial public offering of the PetroChina Company, China's dominant oil and gas producer. At 1.28 Hong Kong dollars a share, or about 16 cents, it is at the low end of the company's predicted range. That will hardly soothe the architects of the deal, who spent months putting it together, only to see it ripped apart by critics ranging from Republican lawmakers to Tibetan monks. 
 "The PetroChina offering has been a very complex and grueling process," said Paul Shapira, a managing director at Goldman, at a news conference here last Sunday.
When PetroChina's bosses traveled to the United States on March 20 to sell the offering, they were hit with charges of human-rights and labor abuses. Critics said the listing would lead to a million layoffs at PetroChina's parent, China National Petroleum. They also said the company was damaging the environment in Tibet and abetting an outlaw regime in Sudan through a joint venture there.
Not content just to criticize, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. organized a shadow road show in New York and other cities to persuade investors to steer clear of PetroChina. Fund managers in Hong Kong said today that the campaign had an impact -- scaring off some American funds.
"The political concerns have been a major overhang," said a fund manager, who, like most people interviewed for this article, spoke on condition of anonymity. "Not that many Asia-Pacific funds invest in oil and gas companies, so you need demand in the United States."
PetroChina's bumpy ride has far-reaching implications for China's campaign to overhaul its sclerotic corporate sector. As part of that effort, Beijing hopes to sell shares in dozens of huge state-owned companies, including Sinopec, the second-largest oil company; China National Overseas Oil, the No. 1 offshore oil company; and China Unicom, the No. 2 telecommunications company.
With PetroChina limping into the market, however, the prospects for these other deals are now cloudier. The A.F.L.-C.I.O., emboldened by its success, said it planned to protest future Chinese stock offerings that it feels are bad investments or represent companies that violate human rights and labor practices.
"Our understanding is that there is going to be 120 of these I.P.O.'s coming out of China," said Richard Trumka, the secretary general of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "On ethical issues and shareholder governance issues, most of these are going to be just as bad as PetroChina."
In the face of such criticism, PetroChina may feel vindicated that it was still able to raise about $3 billion from the offering, which values the company at roughly $30 billion. China National Petroleum will retain a 90 percent stake and will appoint the entire board, including the two independent directors.
Shares of PetroChina begin trading next Thursday in New York and next Friday in Hong Kong. In New York, they will trade as American depository receipts that represent 100 Hong Kong shares, or $16.44 at the price set here today.
China National Petroleum had initially hoped to raise $5 billion or even $7 billion. To meet even the more modest goal, Goldman was forced to round up strategic investors to soak up the shares. BP Amoco agreed to buy 20 percent of the offering, or as much as $1 billion, while three politically friendly property developers in Hong Kong agreed to chip in another $350 million.
Goldman's performance was also tainted by an unauthorized e-mail message that four of the firm's sales representatives sent to 83 clients. Because the note contained claims that the firm feared may have violated securities laws, Goldman tried hard to recall it. Later, on the advice of lawyers, it took the extraordinary step of reprinting the e-mail message -- and correcting portions of it -- in the prospectus.
"It clearly was a mistake," Mr. Shapira said tersely at the news conference.
The disputes surrounding PetroChina obscure the fact that it is, in many respects, a trail-blazing company for China. It has instituted an incentive plan for its top 300 managers, tying as much as 75 percent of their compensation to profit targets. That is unheard-of among state-owned companies in China, which only recently began paying attention to profits, let alone the role of managers in producing them.
"We are a world-scale oil and gas company, and the flagship of China's reform," said Ma Fucai, the chairman of PetroChina, in the news conference in Hong Kong.
Because China National Petroleum is a classic state-owned enterprise -- with a vast network of hospitals and schools in addition to oil and gas operations -- the company decided to carve out its most valuable assets and place them in a separate venture, PetroChina.
By doing that, the company also removed the burden of its bloated payroll from PetroChina. The new public company will retain 480,000 employees, while the remaining one million workers will stay at China National Petroleum, where most are likely to be laid off.
These layoffs were a main reason that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. decided to oppose the deal. But the labor federation also warned that the proceeds from the stock offering could be siphoned off by the parent, where they could contribute indirectly to its activities in Tibet or Sudan.
"The fire wall they created between PetroChina and C.N.P.C. is illusory at best," Mr. Trumka said, "so money will find its way back into the parent company."
According to the company's prospectus, 90 percent of the proceeds will be used by PetroChina to pay off debt and finance capital expenditures. The remaining 10 percent will go to China National Petroleum to reduce debt and pay for employee severance and retraining. Mr. Ma said the company had hired outside auditors to guarantee that the money would not be used for other purposes.
Mr. Ma also tried to distance PetroChina from its parent's activities in Sudan. China National Petroleum is an investor, along with Malaysian and Canadian companies, in a pipeline there. "PetroChina does not have any overseas assets and operations," he said. "We do not have any plans to expand overseas."
Even aside from questions about Sudan, PetroChina has been hurt because it is indisputably an old-fashioned company. At a time when investors are bewitched by technology stocks, PetroChina's discussion of benchmark crude prices does not send hearts fluttering -- even though the company has proven oil reserves of 10.3 billion barrels, making it the world's fourth-largest publicly listed oil company.
Given the low price of its shares, analysts said PetroChina might prove a shrewd investment. For its labors, Goldman, Sachs also gets a high fee. The firm can expect to split a payment of 3 percent to 4 percent of the offering, or about $90 million, with the other underwriters.

Oil Companies to Merge
By The New York Times
SHANGHAI, March 30 -- China's second- and fourth-largest oil companies will merge by order of the government, the companies said today. The move will make China New Star Petroleum, the country's fourth- largest producer, a subsidiary of China Petrochemical, or Sinopec, the country's second-largest oil company. The combination is expected to reinforce Sinopec's strength in oil and gas exploration as the company prepares for a global public offering of its shares. Sinopec plans to list on the Hong Kong, New York and London stock exchanges by the end of June. Despite the merger, the China National Petroleum Corporation remains the country's largest producer.

HEADLINE: One Tough Plant

BYLINE: By Peter Reuter; Peter Reuter, a visiting fellow at the Urban Institute, teaches in the School of Public Affairs, University of Maryland.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The $1.3 billion in aid approved by the House yesterday to help Colombia's faltering government combat narcotics trafficking may be good politics, but it is based on bad economics. And it is unlikely to stem the flow of South American cocaine into the United States.
The backers of the bill, as well as the Clinton administration, which requested a similar aid package, argue that rebuilding Colombia's weak military would help the government defeat the leftist guerrillas who protect the coca farmers, or at least force the guerrillas to the bargaining table. This, in turn, would allow the government to attack coca fields directly and help farmers make the shift to legal crops. 
 The problem is that for the guerrillas, the coca industry is essential (since the money that growers pay them for protection provides nearly half of their estimated $100 million annual revenue), but for the coca growers and refiners the rebels are a convenience, not a necessity. Without the guerrillas' protection, the farmers may have to move to smaller and more dispersed plots, which is inconvenient and costly. But this would have little effect on the price of cocaine on the street in the United States.
It costs cocaine refiners only 30 cents to purchase the coca leaf needed to produce a gram of cocaine, which sells for about $150 in the United States. Even if the price of the leaves needed for that gram of the finished product doubled, the change in retail price would be negligible. And if retail prices do not rise, then consumption in the United States will not decline.
Cocaine refiners will always pay what they need to pay to get the leaves to meet demand. This is, after all, an agricultural market and is subject to the same economic laws that govern markets for legal crops.
The aid money, which is part of a $12.7 billion spending package that faces a tough battle in the Senate, also provides money to help coca farmers develop alternative crops like pineapple. But helping farmers earn more money growing legal crops by giving them cheap seeds, subsidized processing plants and better roads assumes that the price of the coca leaf will not increase enough to tempt the farmers back to growing it. Cocaine refiners would offer a high enough price to get back the land and labor needed to meet the needs of the cocaine market.
Many who support the aid package point to the success of efforts in Bolivia and Peru, where land under coca cultivation is down to 145,000 acres in 1999 from 370,000 in 1992. But there is little evidence that intervention in Peru and Bolivia has lowered coca production in South America as a whole. As acreage devoted to coca farming in Bolivia and Peru decreased, cocaine acreage in Colombia increased to 300,000 acres in 1999 from 90,000 acres in 1992. Even if coca farming is pared back in Colombia, it will likely increase again in Bolivia and Peru.
Washington seems fixated on trying to solve America's drug problem through intervention in other countries. That only a tiny fraction of the federal drug-control budget goes for overseas programs is a source of frustration to hawks and liberals alike: hawks want more for crop eradication; liberals want more money to help farmers grow alternative crops. Neither side seems willing to accept that these actions can do little but shift the location of crop production. In the end, the only way to win the drug war will be to change the behavior of Americans, not of farmers in the third world.

HEADLINE: The End of the Game;
Tiger Management, Old-Economy Advocate, Is Closing

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
The financial markets humble ordinary investors all the time. In Julian H. Robertson Jr., head of Tiger Management, they have humbled an investing giant.
After 20 years of generating superlative investment returns by buying stocks that were undervalued and selling short those that carried excessive valuations, Mr. Robertson, 67, confirmed yesterday that he was shutting Tiger's operations. He has essentially decided to stop driving the wrong way down the one-way technology thoroughfare that Wall Street has become. 
 In the conference room of his sumptuous Manhattan offices yesterday just after he had written his farewell letter to the roughly 700 investors in his six funds, Mr. Robertson mused cheerfully about his career in the stock market, the joys and perils of managing other people's money and the end of the era in which his calls on investments regularly moved markets.
"I'm not capitulating," he said. "I'm not going to quit investing. But it will be nice to get out of the public eye. I don't mind people calling me an old-economy investor, but it doesn't go over well with the clients."
Neither does losing money, of course, which is what forced Mr. Robertson to fold Tiger's tent. The difficulties began in the early fall of 1998 when Russia defaulted on its debt. Tiger lost $1.6 billion on bad currency bets that year, producing a decline of almost 4 percent for 1998.
Things got worse the next year when technology stocks roared and value shares tumbled. Tiger's returns plunged 19 percent. So far this year, the funds are down 13.5 percent.
As a frustrated value investor, Mr. Robertson finds himself in good company, like Warren Buffett, whose returns last year, measured by Berkshire Hathaway's book value, rose a woeful half of 1 percent. Then there's Robert Sanborn, a once-hot mutual fund manager, who resigned last week from his stewardship of the Oakmark Fund after a dismal 1999 in which the fund lost 10.5 percent.
Still, Mr. Robertson's long-term record is a stand-out. For an initial investor in his fund, invested capital would have grown 85 times as of earlier this year. Mr. Robertson's 25 percent annualized return since his fund's inception in 1980 handily beats the 17.5 percent average annual gains in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, with dividends reinvested, for the period. Tiger's returns also exceed the 14.7 percent average annual gains in the Morgan Stanley total return world index, a proxy for international equities.
Nevertheless, as Tiger's woes became pronounced in recent years, investors grew nervous and quickened their withdrawals from his hedge funds, which cater to institutional investors and wealthy individuals. At its peak in 1998, Tiger managed more than $21 billion. Since August 1998, however, investors have withdrawn $7.65 billion, including $950 million in the first quarter of this year.
It is a testament to Mr. Robertson's management that even as word spread of Tiger's closing, the financial markets remained calm. That is because Mr. Robertson has been slowly liquidating his holdings over the last 18 months and reducing the fund's use of borrowed funds. As a result, Tiger's unwinding created none of the upheaval that surrounded the near failure of Long Term Capital Management in September 1998. Then, the prospect of the huge hedge fund's dumping its holdings into already damaged markets pushed the Federal Reserve of New York to broker a deal to unwind the fund gradually with the help of several big Wall Street firms.
"This has been a long process," Mr. Robertson said. "Since 1998, we've been trying to take the leverage out of the funds. Because of partner withdrawals, we've probably sold or bought between $60 and $70 billion of securities."
Mr. Robertson says he will have paid his clients 80 percent of what they are owed by the end of April. Because he has been unwinding his funds' positions over time, he said that 75 percent of the refund would be in cash and an additional 5 percent in 11 stocks that Tiger still owns. These are Bear Stearns, Bowater, Federal-Mogul, Navistar, Niagara Mohawk Power, Pittston Brinks Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Sealed Air, Starwood Hotels, Tosco, and UnumProvident. Because the holdings represent relatively small slivers of the total shares of these companies, the prospect of some Tiger investors selling should not hang too darkly over the shares.
Another five stocks in which Tiger has a large stake represent the remaining 20 percent owed to investors. These will be kept by Tiger to be disposed of later, in blocks perhaps, at better prices than the fund would get if it dumped them on the market at once. The five are GTech Holdings, Normandy Mining, United Asset Management, US Airways and Xtra. Mr. Robertson said he had fielded many calls over the last few days from investors or corporate executives looking to buy his positions.
It is not lost on Mr. Robertson that many of the same stocks he had been betting against in recent months -- Internet shares, technology stocks and other beloved new-economy stocks -- have been in free fall since Tiger's shutdown became public. In the last four trading sessions, the Nasdaq composite has lost 10.2 percent. "If we had been in business this week, it would have been one of our best weeks ever," he said.
Mr. Robertson's exit from the hedge fund business makes some market observers wonder if the bear market in value stocks may finally be ending. "I have great faith that this too will pass," he wrote in a letter to investors yesterday. "The difficulty is predicting when this change will occur and in this regard I have no advantage."
Mr. Robertson may have been bloodied by the mania for technology stocks and shares of unprofitable Internet companies. But he remains unbowed in his belief that value stocks will make a comeback. "The key to Tiger's success over the years has been a steady commitment to buying the best stocks and shorting the worst," Mr. Robertson wrote to his clients. "In a rational environment, this strategy functions well. But in an irrational market, where earnings and price considerations take a back seat to mouse clicks and momentum, such logic, as we have learned, does not count for much."
Mr. Robertson fears for investors in companies that have little in the way of history, earnings or even revenues. "Investors are rightly fascinated by the Internet." he said, "But wrongly they do not include price in these equations. It's going to end in a real blood bath."
Mr. Robertson was one of the last holdouts in value investing; many others have gone against their beliefs and jumped onto the technology bandwagon. "Life and investing are long ballgames," Mr. Robertson said. "The people who were cynical and jumped in and played this boom are going to win this game. But to take the cynical risk against your fundamental belief, I wonder if in the long run that will work."
Now that he will have more time on his hands, Mr. Robertson said he might try to write a novel. "I've got a great wife that I'm looking forward to spending more time with," he said.
He is also very active in charitable pursuits. In New York, he supports the Strang Clinic for cancer research and Lincoln Center, and in his hometown, Salisbury, N.C., population 25,000, he and his wife have created a charitable foundation named for his father, who had a textile operation, and his mother, known for her volunteer work in the community. In just two years, the Robertson Foundation has given more than $3.5 million to education, community development and health programs. About half the foundation's assets are in the Jaguar fund, run by Tiger.
But most of Mr. Robertson's time will probably be spent with a handful of Tiger employees hunting for undervalued stocks. "I'm looking forward to investing on my own," he said. "I've not believed in playing the markets. I've always believed fundamentals will win out."
Against all the odds, he still does.

HEADLINE: Outlook Better for Social Security and Medicare

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
A vibrant economy has significantly improved the financial condition of Medicare and Social Security, extending the life of Medicare's hospital trust fund by eight years, to 2023, the Clinton administration said today.
"This is a remarkable accomplishment," said Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services. "When this administration took office, the Medicare trust fund was projected to be depleted in 1999. We have extended the life of the trust fund a full 24 years." 
The report today said the Social Security trust fund would not be depleted until 2037, three years later than estimated last year.
Both estimates assume that there will be no new benefits, no reduction in benefits and no tax increases.
Democrats welcomed the report as a political boon. They said it validated President Clinton's economic policies and the way he had managed Medicare and Social Security. Republicans conceded that the short-term outlook had improved, but insisted that the programs still had long-term financial problems.
Vice President Al Gore can use the new numbers to his advantage, as evidence of the administration's efforts to help the elderly, an important group of swing voters. The elderly were once a reliable part of the Democratic coalition, but opinion polls suggest that Republicans won a majority of their votes in the last three House elections.
Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush, the likely Republican candidate for president, said Democrats would not necessarily get credit for preserving Medicare and Social Security.
"If voters had been giving Al Gore credit for the strength of the economy," Mr. Fleischer said, "he would already be winning this election by 20 points. The voters do not give him credit. They are more sophisticated than that."
Secretary Shalala said she feared that the good news would invite complacency, discouraging efforts to "modernize Medicare." Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, said, "We must not let this good news make us complacent in our efforts to improve Social Security and Medicare."
The new figures will probably make it easier to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, as President Clinton and lawmakers from both parties want to do. The new estimates will also reduce the political pressure for cutbacks or radical changes in the structure of Medicare or Social Security. In addition, the report will embolden hospitals and other health care providers to step up their demands for an increase in Medicare payments.
The White House boasted that "Medicare is now in the soundest shape it has been since 1975."
President Clinton, speaking at a senior center in Queens, said the improvement in Medicare's financial condition had produced tangible benefits for the elderly.
"Just a decade ago," Mr. Clinton said, "Medicare premiums were increasing at double-digit rates every single year. Today, with better management and with a strong economy, we've been able to slow the rate of growth dramatically, producing a saving of more than $200 a year in the premiums for a couple over 65." The premium is now $45.50 a month for each beneficiary.
Lawrence H. Summers, secretary of the treasury, said the improved condition of Social Security and Medicare resulted from "the robust expansion of the economy and the continued brightening of the long-term outlook as a consequence of technological progress."
The current economic expansion, which began nine years ago, is the longest in United States history. In the final three months of 1999, the economy grew at an annual rate of 7.3 percent, the fastest growth rate in nearly 16 years, the government reported today.
Thirty-nine million people are in Medicare, the federal health insurance for the elderly and disabled. More than 152 million workers are covered under Social Security, which pays cash benefits to 45 million people each month.
The Medicare fund has gained 22 years of life since 1996, when the administration predicted that it would run out of money in 2001.
Reasons for the change include the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which curbed all types of Medicare spending, and a federal crackdown on Medicare fraud, which has made doctors and hospitals more cautious in filing claims. Health care prices have grown at a relatively modest pace, compared with past trends, and the administration today noted a "a substantial decline" in the use of home health care services under Medicare.
Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said today's report "proves that Republicans were right to strengthen Medicare in 1997."
The Clinton administration said today that Social Security spending would begin to exceed the program's revenues in 2015. By 2037, it said, if the system is unchanged, the trust fund will be depleted, and revenues will cover only 72 percent of benefit costs.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, said, "Today's report should take the wind out of the sails" of people who seek to raise the eligibility age for Social Security or cut benefits to finance risky individual investment accounts.
Robert M. Ball, who worked at the Social Security Administration for three decades and was commissioner from 1962 to 1973, said, "Arguments for radical changes in our approach to Social Security are weakened by today's report."
Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan fiscal watchdog group, said: "People will use this report as an excuse to say we don't really need to move too quickly on these issues because there's less of an immediate crisis. But people shouldn't be lulled into thinking that the problem has gone away. Social Security will run cash deficits in the long run."
The first baby boomers will reach the age of 65 in 2011. The number of people 65 or older will double in the next 35 years, to a total of 71 million in 2035.
Medicare spending declined slightly last year, for the first time in the history of the program. But the Clinton administration said the growth would resume this year. The administration, like the Congressional Budget Office, predicts that Medicare spending will double in the coming decade, to more than $400 billion in 2009.
Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund pays hospital bills for beneficiaries admitted to hospitals. Its solvency is widely used as an indicator of Medicare's overall financial health, but experts agree that it is an imperfect measure.
A separate Medicare trust fund pays doctors' bills and other outpatient expenses. Spending from this account is growing much faster, but it never faces bankruptcy because it receives general revenues and premiums as needed to meet its expected costs each year.
Estimates in the report were prepared mainly by actuaries and civil servants. Clinton appointees supervise their work, but do not dictate their conclusions.
For several years, Republicans and some Democrats said Medicare was facing a financial crisis. Many Republicans want to overhaul Medicare by offering a fixed amount of money to each beneficiary to purchase a public or private health plan.
Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, said today's report rebuts the Republican argument that "the sky is falling, so we need to make radical changes in Medicare."
Administration officials said several economic factors contributed to the improvement in the condition of Medicare and Social Security. The unemployment rate is at the lowest level in three decades. With more people working, the government collects more payroll taxes, and those taxes help finance the programs for the elderly.
Low inflation also saves money for Social Security because it lowers the annual cost-of-living increase in benefits.

HEADLINE: Fed Isn't Aiming at Markets, Greenspan Says in a Letter

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told members of Congress in a letter made public today that the central bank's goal in raising interest rates was not to bring down the stock market, and he reiterated his opposition to growing calls for the Fed to make it more difficult for investors to buy stock with borrowed money.
In a letter to Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the House Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed "is not 'jawboning' the stock market or targeting stock prices." The letter was in response to written questions from the committee to Mr. Greenspan after his appearance on Capitol Hill last month. 
 Rather, Mr. Greenspan said, the central bank is concerned that the economy is reaching a point at which it cannot meet the sustained high level of demand for goods and services -- and that the long rise in the stock market, by making people feel wealthier, is supporting that demand.
"The sharp increase in equity valuation appears to have been an important factor behind an apparently developing imbalance," Mr. Greenspan said.
Mr. Greenspan has long struggled with how monetary policy should take account of sharp swings in asset prices. Ever since he used the phrase "irrational exuberance" in discussing the stock market in December 1996, investors have been suspicious that he is trying to talk down the markets.
In recent months, Mr. Greenspan has said that he does not know whether stocks are overvalued -- but that in either case the wealth being generated on Wall Street is contributing so much to the accelerated pace of economic growth that the Fed cannot ignore it.
To many economists and analysts, the distinction being drawn by Mr. Greenspan -- that monetary policy does not single out stock prices, but that the rise in stock prices will almost certainly have to be tempered or reversed for monetary policy to be successful -- is so fine as to be meaningless.
And as he has put the stock market at the center of the debate over monetary policy, Mr. Greenspan has come under pressure not to drag down the entire economy, especially with inflation so restrained, just to put a ceiling on the stock market's rise.
Asked by Mr. Leach whether it would be better to try to rein in the stock market not by raising interest rates but by tightening requirements on margin lending -- buying stock with borrowed money -- Mr. Greenspan said that "changes in such requirements have no appreciable and predictable effect" on stock prices.
But the Fed chairman issued a veiled warning about the rapid rise in margin lending at a time when the markets are gyrating wildly and technology stocks in particular are on a roller coaster ride.
The Fed, he said, "recognizes that considerable risks can be involved in the purchase of equity on margin, especially in volatile markets, and believes that lenders and borrowers need to assess carefully the risks they are assuming" in using margin debt.
Ultimately, Mr. Greenspan said in response to a question from Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas, the path of stock prices will be determined not by the short-term interest rates the Fed controls, but by corporate performance and overall interest rates in the economy.
The risks "of investing in equities come primarily from uncertainty about future earnings and about the longer-term interest rates at which those future earnings should be discounted, and not mainly from the possibility that the short-term cost of financing stock positions could increase," Mr. Greenspan said.
"Consequently, even if our operating procedures were associated with somewhat larger movements in short-term rates, I doubt that investors' perceptions of equity risks would be much affected and thus that equity prices would be significantly influenced."

Brazilian Regulators Approve the Merger of 2 Big Brewers

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, March 30

 BODY:
Brazilian antitrust regulators approved the $7 billion merger of the two biggest beverage companies in this country today, creating one of the world's largest brewers.
The combination of Companhia Cervejaria Brahma and Companhia Antarctica Paulista into a new concern, Companhia de Bebidas das Americas, or AmBev, had first been announced last year, and came after months of government scrutiny. 
 Approval of the deal sent a powerful message about the potential for other big Brazilian mergers and acquisitions. It represented a setback to smaller beverage producers, who fear that AmBev could crush competition in Brazil, Latin America's biggest economy.
AmBev will control nearly 70 percent of the country's beer market, where its Brahma, Skol and Antarctica brands are leading sellers among its 18 beer labels. AmBev will also control about one-quarter of the soft-drinks industry, with a product lineup that includes 37 soft drinks and 7 brands of water.
Brazil is the third-largest market worldwide for Coca-Cola after the United States and Mexico. Coke controls about half of Brazil's soft-drink market, in addition to owning a minority stake in Cervejarias Kaiser, the country's third-largest brewer.
While Kaiser and other critics had complained that the approval of AmBev could give it the ability to dictate beverage prices in Brazil, the majority of the regulators apparently viewed the merger as consistent with a goal of the government's broader economic policy -- encouraging the formation of large companies capable of competing in markets abroad.
One of AmBev's goals is to capture 1 percent of the global soft-drink market by exporting a beverage made with guarana, an Amazonian berry, in a venture with PepsiCo. The company also hopes to strengthen its presence in Latin American countries where Brahma is already sold.
Nonetheless, the federal antitrust agency's approval of the merger was greeted with surprise in Brazil's domestic beverage market, even though several conditions were attached, like the sale of some manufacturing installations and of one beer brand, Bavaria.
"From a strict antitrust standpoint, I thought that any merger resulting in 70 percent market share would have trouble getting approved," said John Ferencz McNaughton, a lawyer specializing in antitrust policy at Noronha Advogados, Brazil's largest law firm. "At the very least, the expectations were for stronger restrictions."
A possible beneficiary from the approval may be Cintra, a brewer that is reportedly considering the purchase of some of AmBev's factories.
Other beverage concerns were critical, and Kaiser said it was seeking a way to appeal.
"The ruling is full of holes," said Kaiser's president, Humberto Pandolpho. "It is an insult to the Brazilian consumer."

A Little Bit of a Change From Old-Time Religion

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

DATELINE: HEMINGWAY, S.C.

 BODY:
Williamsburg County, a rural slice of the Bible Belt an hour's drive from the Atlantic coast, is just the place one expects to find religious radio. Roadside signs testify that Jesus saves, and the steeples of Baptist and Pentecostal churches can seem as ubiquitous as the tall pines and the Spanish moss.
Yet it is just this setting that makes WLGI, a 50,000-watt FM station outside this small town, such a surprise. 
 On one recent morning it was broadcasting gospel music. But then came a station break, and a young woman said: "Across America, Bahais are tapping into the power of unity to build racial harmony in their communities. The Bahai faith attracts people like you from every race and nationality." The announcement included a toll-free number for more information.
To listeners, WLGI is known as Radio Bahai (pronounced buh-HI), a 15-year-old project of one of the world's newer religions, a monotheistic faith that emerged in 19th-century Persia, now Iran. Bahai has gone global, with five million adherents in nearly 200 nations.
Bahais follow the teachings of a Persian nobleman, a prominent member of a popular religious movement of his time, who in 1863 declared that he was the Promised One, anticipated by all major faiths. From then on, he was known as Baha'u'llah, Arabic for the Glory of God.
He taught that all humanity is a single race, that men and women are equal and that the world's major religions are all true expressions of God. Bahais accord him the status of divinely chosen Messenger, the latest in a line that in their belief includes Abraham, Krishna, Moses, Buddha, Jesus and Muhammad. Bahais believe that all were sent by God in successive eras to teach humankind, a process called "progressive revelation."
Amid the musical programming, Baha'u'llah's words (along with readings from the Bible and other sacred texts) can be heard on WLGI, whose signal spans eastern South Carolina, touching metropolitan Charleston and the resorts of Myrtle Beach, and reaches into North Carolina as well.
"We say prayers for folks," said Ernest Hilton, a broad-shouldered 42-year-old who works as the station's associate manager. "A lot of folks call us in the mornings for prayers for people who are ill or who have passed on," he said, displaying a leather-bound Bahai prayer book.
The Bahai faith counts about 130,000 members in the United States. World headquarters are in Haifa, Israel, and American administrative offices in suburban Chicago. The faith operates six radio stations. Only one is in North America -- in Hemingway. The obvious question is, Why here?
Well, this state is important to Bahais, and has been ever since thousands of South Carolinians converted to the religion in the 1970's.
"From my understanding," said Lanita Barnes, a lifelong Bahai who moved here from Southern California to administer many of the faith's local programs, "there was never a true civil rights movement in South Carolina," at least nothing approaching the history-making events of Montgomery or Selma.
But when Bahais began working in the area, promoting their ideal of racial unity with a religious rather than secular message, they won a hearing. Mr. Hilton, who is black, grew up nearby and attended a Bahai youth gathering in 1980.
"I sat, I listened, and I was really impressed with the racial makeup of the event," he said. "I thought back to Martin Luther King's dream, because there were black kids, Persian kids, white kids, Orientals. And these kids were talking about how they could change the planet."
The Bahais have had property here since 1972, when the faith established a school focused on social and economic development. Called the Louis G. Gregory Institute, it occupies a largely wooded tract where the air is alive with dragonflies and the chatter of birds.
Ms. Barnes, who serves as administrator, says relations with neighboring churches have been amicable, with ministers invited to events at the institute. (What surely helps is that Bahais abstain from aggressive proselytizing, teach a personal morality whose standards -- no gambling or alcohol, for instance -- fit well in a culturally conservative area and regard Christianity as a divinely revealed faith. The station also runs free announcements about local churches' events on its community calendar.)
Bahai emphasizes religious service, and the institute attracts volunteers, like Nancy Nawi, 19, of Norwood, N.J., who grew up in a Bahai family and will enter Smith College next fall. "I know people who had come down here, who had volunteered down here," she said. "People would talk about Radio Bahai down in South Carolina."
The institute (whose initials give WLGI its call letters) is named for an early convert, a South Carolinian born in 1874 to former slaves. He earned a law degree at Howard University in Washington and flirted with black nationalism before finding the faith in 1909. Thereafter, he traveled widely preaching racial unity, often in the segregated South. Twice, Booker T. Washington invited him to speak at Tuskegee Institute, the predominantly black school that Washington founded in Alabama.
One recent graduate of Tuskegee (now a university) works at the station. He is Jonathan Graham, who grew up in the nearby town of Kings- tree and embraced the faith at 15, after encountering a Bahai youth group. Like Mr. Hilton, he was impressed with the message of racial unity.
"Here in the faith, it's all about us getting the world together," said Mr. Graham, now 30. "That's what appealed to me."

HEADLINE: Nassau Democrats Suggest Broad Changes to Save Millions in Police Costs

 BODY:
Treading heavily on ground that Nassau County's elected officials have traditionally avoided, Democrats in the Legislature called yesterday for a shake-up in the county's police department that they said could save Nassau $15 million this year and $25 million in years ahead.
An unflattering report released by two legislative committees controlled by Democrats described the 3,100-member police force in the financially struggling county as much higher paid than other departments, top-heavy with supervisors, too generous with overtime, filled with officers doing desk work and short on lower-paid civilian employees whose presence would save money and free more officers to work on the streets. 
 The 13-page report was presented as a request to the county's new police commissioner, William J. Willett. It urged the department to hire more civilians, reassign some high-ranking officers to the streets and strictly limit overtime.
The report said those measures and others would be necessary if the county, which is facing a shortfall of $100 million to $200 million in its current budget, was to avoid hundreds of layoffs in the police department.
"Right now this is just a friendly nudge," said Lisanne G. Altmann of Great Neck, the chairwoman of the Budget Review Committee, which joined the Public Safety Committee in releasing the report. "But our expectation is that this has to be done, and if it isn't we will have to take action. We don't want to lay people off."
A spokesman for the commissioner, Detective Sgt. Kevin Smith, said, "We have to examine these proposals and see if they are feasible and appropriate."
The leader of the Legislature's Republican caucus, Peter J. Schmitt of Massapequa, said that while he was "pleased to see the Democrats joining our call for spending cuts," the Legislature should allow Mr. Willett time to take steps of his own.
The report noted that about 28 percent of the $2.2 billion county budget was spent on the police department. Nearly 90 percent of the police budget, it said, went for salaries, overtime and fringe benefits. Personnel costs, it said, had risen 16.8 percent since 1997, even though the number of officers had remained stable.
Legislator Joseph Scannell, the chairman of the Public Safety Committee, said that with more than one in four dollars going to the police, "any review of the county's finances has to begin with the county's police department."
The report said the average annual cost for a police department employee had reached $114,877, an amount similar to that in Suffolk County but far above the $88,000 average for 13 departments the report surveyed, including New York City's, which averaged $79,209.
The county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, said he welcomed the committees' suggestions. The county's largest police union, the 2,100-member Nassau County Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, has submitted its own cost-cutting plan to Mr. Gulotta.
Officer Edmund Farrell, a spokesman, said union officials had already discussed some of the reports' suggestions with Mr. Gulotta. Other items, he said, might have to be addressed in contracts. The P.B.A.'s five-year contract expires at the end of this year.
A spokesman for the 520-member Nassau County Police Superior Officers Association, Sgt. George Bruckbauer, said the union had not yet reviewed the report and could not comment. But, he said, "We are fully aware of the economic times we live in."

Icahn Seeks to Take Control Of Nabisco Group Holdings
Just 15 days after being rebuffed by the board of Nabisco Group Holdings, the investor Carl C. Icahn appealed to shareholders in a campaign to take over the troubled maker of Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers.
 In a letter to the board that was widely distributed, Mr. Icahn offered shareholders a premium of 40 percent for 100 million shares that would give him control of the company. Once in control, Mr. Icahn said, he would try to sell the company at what he expects would be a "very attractive price." Page C2.

Thousands of the six million people who took fen-phen have decided to opt out of the proposed settlement, under which American Home has agreed to pay $3.75 billion. Shares of American Home fell $1.8125, to $52.0625. C2.

Saving The Lost World

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: SANTA ELENA DE UAIREN, Venezuela

 BODY:
In a few weeks many of the Seattle protesters will reassemble in Washington D.C. to throw rocks at the I.M.F. and the World Bank, denouncing them as agents of global corporate greed that is spoiling the environment and leaving the poor behind. The protesters are no doubt sincere, but the truth is the I.M.F. and World Bank are neither the problem nor the solution. They are bit players, of declining importance, in a much larger drama.
The real drama is on the ground in the developing world, not on H Street; the real players are a diverse collection of companies, indigenous peoples, endangered species and local governments; and the real solution lies not with he who throws the biggest stone but he who builds the most effective coalition to get these players working together. 
 I came to this remote spot on the Venezuelan-Brazilian border to watch a team from Conservation International try to build such a coalition. Its goal: to save the Guyana Shield, the largest unbroken expanse of tropical rain forest in the world, running from southern Venezuela across Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. As you fly over it in a small plane, this rain forest looks like an endless expanse of broccoli, broken only by waterfalls -- including Angel Falls, the tallest in the world -- and by tapuis, the mesa-like rock formations that thrust 8,000 feet above the forest floor. Save for local indigenous tribes, the area is ruled entirely by the "locals"; harpy eagles and Amazon parrots control the skies, jaguars prowl the forest floor and ferocious peacock bass run the lakes. No wonder Arthur Conan Doyle based his novel "The Lost World" on this region.
Conservation International began by strategizing with the indigenous Ye'kwana tribe on how to protect its homeland -- which lies at the heart of this remarkable ecosystem -- from the Brazilian and local miners who covet its gold and ore, from the Japanese logging companies that covet its timber and from a debt-ridden Venezuelan government with legitimate development needs. Throwing stones at the I.M.F. won't do it. This is not a teach-in. This is the sort of real problem that needs to be solved, here and elsewhere, if we want to protect the environment and support growth in the third world.
Conservation International and the Ye'kwana are developing a "network solution." First they are proposing the creation of a 13-million-acre protected area and indigenous reserve on this Venezuelan portion of the Guyana Shield. They have found an unexpected ally in Venezuela's national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, which owns Citgo in America. Petroleos has lost business in the U.S. because of environmental critics. To improve its global brand name, it has pledged to maintain strong environmental standards in its own operations and, through its affiliate Bitor, to provide funding and technical support to protect the Guyana Shield's biodiversity and the Ye'kwana. As one company official put it: "As a global company, if you don't adapt to the growing trends in the world today you're going to be out of business."
At the same time, Conservation International and its Venezuelan allies are asking the government here to consider a debt-for-nature swap, in which money raised from the environmental group's supporters around the world would be used to help retire part of Venezuela's national debt -- in return for the creation of the 13-million-acre reserve. If it can pull this off, one of the planet's richest ecosystems gets saved, the Ye'kwana's home is protected, Petroleos protects its global image and Venezuela reduces its debt (if you want to help, go to www.conservation.org).
"In the old days everyone focused on how to get governments to solve these problems by fighting the companies, because industry had so much more power than you and me," remarked Glenn Prickett, senior vice president for Conservation International. "But thanks to globalization and the Internet, power is now much more diffused, global companies are now much more exposed, and organizations like ours much better positioned to offer solutions."
Without activist protesters, neither governments nor corporations will be pushed to value the environment. But activists today have the power to do more than say no. In a networked world they now have the power, and the responsibility, to create coalitions -- with business, government and affected communities -- that don't just make a point, but make a difference.

 BODY:

Sure, gasoline prices have been moving up, and they may go higher.

HEADLINE: Going Hungry To Make a Point;
A Fast for Poor Laborers Is a Sign Of New Interest in an Old Technique

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
On college campuses and farmers' fields, in churches and immigration detention centers, and across a range of religious and political beliefs, people are fasting. They do it to make a statement, to prove a point, to draw attention, to make a personal kind of peace.
Indeed, across New York State this week, more than a thousand people, from the Roman Catholic bishop of Albany to janitors in Buffalo, have joined one of the country's largest fasts, this one to protest low wages and abuses in the workplace. 
 Fasting, of course, has been a spiritual undertaking and sociopolitical tool for centuries, and the lineup of famous fasters is vast and varied: Gandhi, Cesar Chavez, Dick Gregory and, of course, Jesus of Nazareth. But fasting, it appears, is seeing a modest revival.
"There's been a definite increase in fasting," said Kim Bobo, executive director of the National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice. "Fasting has always been in the Christian, Jewish and Muslim tradition, and as people of faith seek increasingly to struggle for justice in this time of abundance, it's a natural outgrowth that fasting would be something they do."
To many, the power of fasting, personal and political, feels especially strong in New York, where many of the streets, beginning with Wall Street and extending deep into the suburbs, seem to be awash in money and an obsession with wealth and excess.
Bishop Howard Hubbard of Albany said New York's religious and labor leaders came up with the idea of a 40-hour fast because they were upset that the problems of poor workers were drawing so little attention, while high-tech billionaires were getting all the publicity. Fasting, he said, is a way to make an unmistakable moral statement when so much of the populace is preoccupied with stock options and sybaritic consumerism. And what better time to do it, he said, than during the Christian penitential season of Lent?
"Everybody is mesmerized these days by the soaring stock market and how people seem to be doing so well economically, yet the gap between the richest and the poorest is wider than it's been in decades," said Bishop Hubbard, co-chairman of the New York State Labor-Religion Coalition, which organized the fast. "Very often those not participating cannot speak for themselves, and we feel as religious leaders and members of the labor movement that we have to be a voice for the voiceless."
In Albany, Brockport, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and New York City, hundreds of clergy members, labor leaders, college students and others began fasting at 8 p.m. Wednesday. Subsisting on only water and juice, they have prayed together and joined street demonstrations to draw attention to a group they call "invisible workers."
These workers include janitors in Buffalo who earn $5.25 an hour, farm workers in Sullivan County who are required to work 70 hours a week and cafeteria workers at the State University of New York in Albany who cannot afford medical coverage. These workers, the fasters say, often do not earn enough to feed their families adequately.
Hallie Williams of Buffalo, who worked for 18 years as a unionized building cleaner before she was laid off and replaced by a nonunion janitor earning the minimum wage, applauded the fast. "We can't do anything if somebody don't help us because if somebody don't help us, we're just out there without a paddle," she said.
The New Yorkers are fasting during the same week that six students at Purdue University in Indiana are doing so to pressure the university's administration to do more to ensure that clothing bearing the Purdue name is not made in sweatshops.
Last spring, six students at the University of California at Berkeley fasted for eight days to demand more instructors for the ethnic studies department. In 1998, half a dozen tomato pickers in Immokalee, Fla., fasted for a month to protest low wages, while janitors and labor leaders at the University of Southern California shunned food to protest the university's failure to sign a union contract.
Fouad Jabar, a graduate student at Purdue who began fasting on Monday, said, "At other schools, there have been sit-ins and protest demonstrations, but instead of being confrontational, we chose to do a fast to show how serious we are about the sweatshop problem."
The Rev. Kevin Irwin, a professor of theology at the Catholic University of America who has written extensively on fasting, said the recent upsurge is a healthy development, healthier than a trendier type of fasting that he has little patience for.
"The recent trend in fasting in our society was rather narcissistic -- we fast to lose weight, we fast to look good," Father Irwin said. "The purpose of the fasting we're seeing now regarding social concerns is healthier. It is dependent on God and raises very important values in society."
Those who choose to fast have many role models. In the Bible, the prophet Isaiah fasted to loose the bonds of wickedness and to undo the yoke of the oppressed, and Jesus fasted for 40 days to proclaim good news to the poor and to give sight to the blind and health to the sick.
Gandhi fasted to draw attention to Britain's colonial domination and harsh treatment of the Indian people. Cesar Chavez, founder of the United Farm Workers, held repeated fasts of three weeks or more to make the public focus on the low wages and miserable conditions of thousands of farm workers.
"It's a commonly accepted practice: one afflicts one's own body as a sign of identifying with the pain of another," said Balfour Brickner, rabbi emeritus at the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue in Manhattan. "The fast in New York is appropriate because these people, these workers, are hungry. They're hungering for economic and social justice, and our fast is a manifestation of our identity with their cause."
Brian O'Shaughnessy, statewide coordinator of New York's labor-religion coalition, acknowledged that it was hard to count how many people were participating in the fast. But he said close to 1,500 people had told the coalition that they would participate.
The coalition chose to make the fast 40 hours because 40 is freighted with symbolism: the 40 days of Lent, the 40 days of rain in the Great Flood, the Jews' 40 years in the desert, and the 40-hour workweek.
This is the fifth year the coalition has held the fast. Last year, after the participants focused on the plight of farm workers, the State Legislature raised the minimum wage for farm workers. This year the fast began two days after the New York State Catholic Conference held its annual lobbying day in Albany, and it will end at noon today.
"Fasts like this highlight problems and highlight the need for us to continue to address the inequities in many provisions of the labor law," said Nicholas Spano, a Westchester County Republican who is chairman of the State Senate Labor Committee. "We are listening, we are responding, and we have to do more."
The participants say they want to press the Legislature to raise the state minimum wage above the federal minimum of $5.15.
Bishop Hubbard said he hoped the fast would grow in future years, and some labor and religious leaders say they will try to spread it to other states. The fasters, Bishop Hubbard said, were following in the footsteps of Jesus, who, the Bible said, fasted to prepare for his public ministry to help the needy.
"I think we have the same mission in today's society," he said. "The issues may be different, but the call to reach out to those who are neediest and most vulnerable among us is every bit as much a part of our religious mandate as it was when Christ walked the face of the earth."

HEADLINE: HOUSE PASSES BILL TO HELP COLOMBIA FIGHT DRUG TRADE

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
After two days of debate, the House today approved a $12.7 billion emergency spending bill whose centerpiece commits the United States to train and equip Colombia's security forces to combat drug traffickers in a country where the narcotics trade and guerrilla insurgency have blurred.
Not since the Central American civil wars of the 1980's has the United States tried to throw such political, diplomatic and military backing behind a crucial Latin American ally threatened by insurgency. 
 The bipartisan House vote today, 263 to 146, approved an emergency package that also includes money for the Pentagon to pay for the peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, and for flood disaster relief in North Carolina.
But most significantly, the House has cast judgment on a plan backed by the Clinton administration to spend $1.7 billion during two years to help Colombia and other Andean countries, despite critics' complaints that the anti-drug plan is ill-conceived and could drag the United States into an open-ended conflict that has already cost tens of thousands of lives during the past 40 years.
"This program will strengthen democratic government, the rule of law, economic stability and human rights in that beleaguered country," said Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director.
For those who warned of a Vietnam-like quagmire, the House approved by voice vote an amendment to limit American military personnel sent to Colombia to 300 at any one time, unless more are needed for a rescue mission. In promoting his amendment, Representative Gene Taylor, a conservative Mississippi Democrat, said, "I expect they want American kids to fight in the war they won't fight and American taxpayers to pay for a war they won't pay for."
Aid to Colombia, which is the source of 90 percent of the cocaine and 65 percent of the heroin seized in the United States, was the main lightning rod in the debate. But the overall spending measure that includes the anti-drug program is imperiled in the Senate because of opposition from the Senate's top two Republican leaders, Trent Lott of Mississippi and Don Nickles of Oklahoma.
The two senators do not oppose the Kosovo or Colombia aid. But Mr. Lott has vowed to block the bill, saying it has become "bloated" with pork and other non-urgent spending.
He wants to roll the most pressing aid proposals -- including those for Kosovo and Colombia, as well as millions of dollars in flood relief for North Carolina farmers -- into Congress's annual appropriations process.
But the bill's proponents say that approach would postpone badly needed aid for months, leaving disaster-stricken Americans in the lurch and jeopardizing Washington's commitment to the fragile democracy in Colombia, the hemispheric hub for narcotics.
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert made the anti-drug program one of his top legislative priorities, and on Wednesday took to the House floor to give a rare speech.
"We must act now," Mr. Hastert said. "We cannot wait. We have a responsibility to stop drugs in Colombia, to stop them in transit, to stop them at our border, and to stop them on our streets and in our schools."
The Pentagon, which has been borrowing from other accounts to pay for the Kosovo operation, says if it does not get $2 billion by late April, the Army, in particular, will have to cancel training and postpone maintenance, all steps that could hurt military readiness.
The lopsided vote today in the House and a brewing revolt by influential Senate Republicans who favor the immediate dispatch of the Kosovo and Colombia aid may force Mr. Lott to relent. Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican who heads the Appropriations Committee, said his panel would take up a $9 billion spending bill, which includes the Kosovo aid, in the next few days.
The administration originally proposed a $5.2 billion emergency spending bill, but the House Appropriations Committee added about $3.8 billion more earlier this month. Lawmakers on Wednesday night then loaded on $4 billion more in additional military spending to cover unanticipated costs of spare parts, military health care and safety maintenance.
Among the spending plans in the House bill that the White House did not request -- and Mr. Lott is grumbling about -- are $600 million to repair highways and bridges, $75 million to spruce up NASA's fleet of shuttles, and $20 million to build a new Food and Drug Administration building in Los Angeles.
All but $421 million of the bill would be paid for from this year's projected $26 billion non-Social Security surplus.
On the House floor today and Wednesday, lawmakers passionately debated the plan to send $1.7 billion during two years to help Colombia, as well as other Andean nations like Ecuador and Peru, step up its fight against drug traffickers by reducing cocaine and heroin production.
The final vote today reflected divisions across party lines, both over Colombia and the bill's ballooning cost: 143 Republicans and 119 Democrats voted in favor, while 61 Republicans and 84 Democrats voted against. Each side drew the vote of an independent.
Proponents of the aid package framed their debate not only in terms of supporting an embattled Latin American ally, but also as a bold move in the war on drugs in this country.
"How many more hundreds or thousands of our kids will get hooked on drugs or die from overdoses?" said Representative C. W. Bill Young, a Florida Republican who heads the House Appropriations Committee.
But critics warned that the United States was being drawn more deeply into a convoluted civil conflict in Colombia, a country with two leftist guerrilla armies fighting the government, right-wing paramilitary forces fighting the guerrillas, and civilians trapped in the middle.
The backbone of the aid package is 30 Blackhawk and 33 Huey helicopters for the Colombian Army and police forces, as well as $470 million for the Colombian Army and $115.5 million for the police, that would be used to train and equip three army battalions for anti-drug operations, two of which would be new.
The measures also offer farmers incentives to grow other crops, and finance programs to promote human rights and judicial reform, but that did not assuage critics.
"We're getting involved in a civil war for which we're going to pay a price," said Representative Jose E. Serrano, a New York Democrat.
Opponents also balked at giving the bulk of the aid to the Colombian military, which has ties to paramilitaries implicated in human rights abuses. Given these objections, many critics said the aid would be better served treating patients for drug abuse in this country.
"This doesn't really get to the heart of the matter: the drug problem in our country," said Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat. "Some 5.5 million Americans need substance-abuse treatment, and only 2 million are getting it."
The overall spending bill also includes $143 million in emergency economic aid to Balkan countries and other nations in southeast Europe. Lawmakers, by a vote of 219 to 200, defeated an attempt to force President Clinton to start withdrawing American troops from Kosovo unless he certified that European NATO allies shoulder their share of costs for international police, humanitarian aid and economic reconstruction.

HEADLINE: Carl S. Shoup, 97; Shaped Japan's Tax Code

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Carl S. Shoup, a Columbia University economist who oversaw the creation of a modern tax system for Japan after World War II, helped invent the value-added tax and made a major study of ways Americans could be taxed, died March 23 at a nursing home in Laconia, N.H. He was 97.
Many of the approaches to taxation that Professor Shoup emphasized in his work focused on making tax systems fair and simple for both individuals and corporations. 
 In 1934, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. invited Mr. Shoup to Washington where he and Roy Blough, another economist, directed a comprehensive six-volume study of American taxes and potential reforms. Their 1937 "Report on the Federal Revenue System" explored issues that to this day confront Congress. It was reproduced last year by Tax Analysts, a nonprofit publisher in Washington, at www.tax.org, as part of its tax history project.
In 1949, an aide to Gen. Douglas MacArthur invited Professor Shoup to Japan to help overhaul the tax system. In the late 1800's, the Japanese adopted both corporate and individual income taxes, but in a tour of the country by private rail car, Professor Shoup heard complaints that the system was arbitrary, with some people being heavily taxed while others paid little.
To remedy this, he and six other economists, a team that became known as the Shoup Mission, proposed a system under which companies that kept detailed records and filed an annual tax report would be freed from onerous audits and could take advantage of various tax breaks, including generous allowances for the depreciation of equipment and the ability to carry losses in bad years forward to offset taxes during highly profitable years.
He had the forms printed in blue, after being advised that the Japanese liked blue documents, as part of his effort to encourage voluntary compliance. The Japanese Diet enacted his proposals in 1950.
Beyond creating a friendlier tax agency, the Japanese system also eliminated the need for about 80 percent of Japanese to file an individual income tax return because taxes withheld from paychecks settle obligations to the national, prefecture and municipal governments.
Professor Shoup also played a crucial role in developing the value-added tax systems used in Europe, Japan and Canada. "He worked from the very first days on the VAT and made many trips to Europe when the VAT was being developed over there after World War II," said Lowell Harris, a retired Columbia economics professor.
Lorraine Eden, a Texas A &M management professor who was the last graduate student Professor Shoup advised at Columbia, said that while "he was often called the father of the value-added tax" he was not necessarily its advocate. "He always said he didn't go to bat for the VAT," she said.
In the 1950's he helped overhaul the tax systems in Cuba, Venezuela and Liberia, Professor Harris said.
Carl Sumner Shoup was born in San Jose, Calif., in 1902, and grew up in nearby Los Altos, where he rode to school on horseback. One of his grandfathers was an engineer who helped build the cable-car system in San Francisco; his father was president of the Southern Pacific Railroad in the late 1920's.
In 1924, Mr. Shoup graduated from Stanford University with a law degree and then moved to New York where he became a reporter for The New York World. He grew bored with the newspaper business and began studying economics at Columbia, becoming an instructor there in 1928, earning his doctoral degree in economics in 1930 and becoming a full professor in 1945. He retired in 1971 as McVickar professor of political economy and eventually moved to Center Sandwich, N.H., with his wife, Ruth. She died in 1997, 73 years after their wedding.
He is survived by a son, Paul, of Charlottesville, Va., and a daughter, Dale S. Meyer, of Center Sandwich. Another son, Donald, died in 1989.
Throughout the last 50 years the Japanese government honored Professor Shoup for creating a tax system that played a major role in its rise as an economic power. Emperor Hirohito twice decorated Professor Shoup with the Order of the Sacred Treasure. In 1991, the Toyota Motor Corporation gave $2 million to Columbia University to endow a chair in Professor Shoup's name.

MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAN: TALIBAN FOE FLEES -- Iran's official news agency said Ismail Khan, the former governor of Herat Province in Afghanistan and a major figure in the opposition to the ruling Taliban, had crossed into Iran and reached the city of Meshed after escaping from a Taliban prison. Mr. Khan, a hero to many Afghans for his fight against Soviet forces in the 1980's, was said to have reached Iran with another anti-Taliban leader who escaped from prison with him, Hafiz Qadir. Iran strongly opposes the Taliban. John F. Burns (NYT) 

IRAN: KHATAMI BROTHER IN COURT -- A hard-line court summoned Riza Khatami, left, a brother of President Mohammad Khatami, on unspecified charges linked to his outspoken pro-reform newspaper, Mosharekat, the official news agency reported. It said the summons was apparently linked to libel charges against the daily. Riza Khatami heads the main political faction backing the reformist president. (Reuters)
 
IRAQ: HUSSEIN SON'S DENIAL -- President Saddam Hussein's son Uday will not seek the post of speaker in the newly elected National Assembly, his newspaper, Babil, reported. An election victory by Uday Hussein reinforced speculation that he would seek the post. But Babil quoted him as saying he wanted to be an "ordinary" legislator. (AP)
 
ASIA
 
INDONESIA: SUHARTO PROTEST -- The police fired tear gas to disperse protesters near former President Suharto's Jakarta residence after he, citing medical grounds, failed to show up for questioning in connection with a corruption scandal. Scores of students were arrested after 200 demonstrators threw stones at officers blocking streets leading to his house. (AP)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
GUATEMALA, SPAIN: PLEA ON CASE -- Spanish state prosecutors asked a High Court judge to drop his investigation into genocide allegations against former Guatemalan dictators made by the Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchu. The prosecutors said Spain had no jurisdiction in the cases, including a military assault on Spain's embassy in Guatemala in 1980 in which 39 Spaniards died. (Reuters)
 
EUROPE
 
BRITAIN: QUEEN HONORS NATO COMMANDER -- Gen. Wesley Clark of the United States, NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, is to be given an honorary knighthood by Queen Elizabeth for his leadership in the bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said he would be entitled to put "K.B.E." -- for Knight of the British Empire -- after his name, but, because he is not a Briton, not put "Sir" before it. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
BALKANS: INTERNATIONAL AID -- International donors meeting in Brussels pledged $1.8 billion to pay for projects to help the economies of southeastern Europe and help stabilize the Balkans. The European Union pledged $530 million through its head office, the European Commission. The 15 European Union nations were believed to have pledged a similar amount. The United States pledged $77.65 million. (AP)
 
NORTHERN IRELAND: LIBEL AWARD -- Sean McPhilemy, a Northern Ireland filmmaker, won a $230,000 libel judgment against The Sunday Times when a High Court jury ruled that the newspaper failed to prove its claim that his 1993 program "The Committee" was a hoax. The program said there was collusion between Royal Ulster Constabulary officials and Protestant politicians in the killing of prominent Catholics. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
FRANCE: KOSOVO OFFICER REASSIGNED -- A paramilitary police officer freed from jail after being held for 48 hours on suspicion of leaking secret military papers on Kosovo to the news media will be reassigned. Lt. Col. Jean-Michel Mechain, 46, has denied giving journalists documents describing tensions between French commanders and the United Nations administrator in Kosovo. He remains under judicial investigation, however, and cannot leave France. Suzanne Daley (NYT)
 
SWITZERLAND: HOLOCAUST ACCOUNTING -- Banks have agreed to publish the names of owners of 26,000 dormant accounts to see if they belong to Holocaust survivors, a move recommended in December by the Volcker Commission. The delay has held up payment from the $1.25 billion settlement reached with Swiss banks by Jewish groups in 1998. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)
 
POLAND: NO TAX ON NAZI-ERA PAYMENTS -- Payments by German companies to 400,000 Poles for forced labor during World War II will be exempt from income tax, Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek announced. The poles will be eligible for payments of between $2,500 and $7,500 each from a $5 billion fund. Donald F. McNeil Jr. (NYT)
 
AFRICA
 
SOUTH AFRICA: NEO-NAZI BEGINS JAIL TERM -- Eugene Terre'Blanche, leader of South Africa's neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement, began a 12-month jail sentence on an assault charge. Mr. Terre'Blanche, whose followers set off bombs that killed 21 people on the eve of the first nonracial elections, in 1994, was imprisoned for setting his dogs on a gas station attendant in 1996. He is appealing another conviction, for the attempted murder of another black man. Rachel L. Swarns (NYT)
 
ALGERIA: RIGHTS INVITATIONS -- Rights groups welcomed a decision to invite them to Algeria in May and June. The invitations -- to Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders and the International Federation of Human Rights -- were made through Algeria's diplomatic mission in Geneva. Since fighting between guerrillas and the army began in Algeria in 1992, the country has been closed to rights groups. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)
Using lasers, the technology tries to identify chemical impurities that are characteristic of diamonds from a particular country. Before it can work, though, a huge database containing the fingerprints of the world's diamonds would have to be gathered and a method of industrial testing would have to be devised.
"Identifying them is going to take many years," said Andrew Bone, a De Beers spokesman in London. "Most international experts believe that the techniques are not yet sufficient to allow the tracing of individual stones. Nevertheless, we are committed to helping in any way we can."
 
Buying Love Tokens
It appears likely, then, that a trickle of diamonds from the war zones of Africa will continue to leak into jewelry stories, at least until technology, international law or a heretofore unseen vigilance in the diamond industry finds a way to stop it.
De Beers insists that the chances of buying such a diamond are infinitesimal.
"There is less than a one-in-a-hundred chance that any single stone will come from conflict areas," said Mr. Bone, the De Beers spokesman.
Despite such assurances, the window remains open for African rebels. Smugglers in Sierra Leone and Congo have ready access to the third of the world diamond market that De Beers does not control. And Unita, although its diamond dealing is down sharply from the mid-1990's, is still selling between $80 million and $150 million worth of stones a year, according to the most conservative estimates. To perk up sales, Unita held a sale last year, military experts said, marking down rough-diamond prices by a third.
The perceived need to own a diamond appears, if anything, to be increasing.
On a recent Sunday afternoon, Tracy Scholl, of Suffolk County, Long Island, stood with her fiance, Mike Sabatino, at an engagement ring counter on 47th Street in the diamond district of Manhattan.
"When you get engaged, you get a diamond," Ms. Scholl said as Mr. Sabatino, an electrician from Staten Island, warily eyed a one-carat ring that cost $5,500. "It is what you are supposed to do."
And Africa? "I want to say that I would not want a diamond because of that stuff in Africa, but I guess that's not really true," Ms. Scholl said. "Me not buying a diamond is not going to stop what is going on over there."

 CORRECTION:
A report in the World Briefing column on March 31 about invitations to human rights groups to visit Algeria in May and June misstated the Algerians' position on such visits. Several rights groups have been admitted since the guerrilla war began, with varying freedom of access; the country has not been closed to them since 1992.
A front-page article on April 6 about the role of diamonds in fueling wars in Africa misstated the life expectancy in Botswana, the world's largest diamond producer. The United Nations says that because of AIDS, the figure has fallen sharply and is 41, no longer close to 70.

Diamonds were known to exist only in India and Brazil, and were regarded as the rarest of gems, until they were accidentally discovered by a boy on the banks of the Orange River in South Africa in 1866. Since then, Africa has dominated the world market for large gem-quality diamonds. The finest stones come from Namibia, Angola and Sierra Leone.
