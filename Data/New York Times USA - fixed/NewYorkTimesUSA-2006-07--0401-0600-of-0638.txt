HEADLINE: Coming in January, A Fox Morning Show

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
With Katie Couric and Charles Gibson departing morning television, Roger Ailes has decided to dip a toe in. Beginning in January, the 35 stations owned and operated by Fox Television Stations group, overseen by Mr. Ailes since last year, will begin broadcasting a live, one-hour morning show, to be seen beginning at 9 in most cities, Fox announced yesterday.
 The show will generally forgo hard news for segments on entertainment and lifestyle, but it will undoubtedly have some of the feel of the Fox News Channel, which is producing the show with Twentieth Television. (Mr. Ailes created and continues to oversee the Fox News Channel.) The two main hosts of the new show, Mike Jerrick and Juliet Huddy, are hosts of Fox News's ''DaySide,'' which they are to leave in the fall. 
The announcement of the morning show represents the first major initiative by the Fox Television Stations group since Mr. Ailes became its chairman a year ago. But also noteworthy is the time slot in which Fox's new show will appear. 
 At least for now, Fox has chosen not to compete with the three main network morning shows ''Today,'' ''Good Morning America'' and the ''Early Show'' -- or with ''Fox & Friends'' on Fox News on cable -- between 7 and 9 a.m., when those programs draw the most viewers. (In New York City and elsewhere, NBC broadcasts a third hour of ''Today,'' from 9 to 10 a.m.)
 And, at least initially, Fox has chosen not to syndicate the show in the vein of ''Live With Regis and Kelly,'' the series that is perhaps its main competition at 9. ''Live With Regis and Kelly'' is produced by Buena Vista Television and is seen on many ABC stations.
 In an interview yesterday, Dennis Swanson, president of operations for Fox Television Stations, said Fox believed that the stations could best distinguish themselves by producing local news from 7 to 9 a.m., but saw an opportunity for a national program in the 9 to 10 a.m. hour slot.
 ''We think the economics for doing this show are right,'' Mr. Swanson said. ''We've got plenty of experience in that regard. We wouldn't enter into this project unless we thought there was a profit potential to it.''
 Asked if the new show risked cannibalizing Fox News's audience at 9 -- when ''Fox & Friends'' leaves the air, and the daytime lineup begins -- Bill Shine, senior vice president of programming for Fox News, said the programming was intended to be distinct enough to pose no such concerns.
 ''There are hundreds of millions of viewers out there,'' Mr. Shine said. ''We're going after all of them.''
 Mr. Shine added that another national show broadcast on Fox stations and distributed by Twentieth Television, ''Geraldo at Large,'' had not appeared to cut into Fox News's audience.
 In another morning news development, ABC News has decided to hire Jim Murphy, a former executive producer of the ''CBS Evening News,'' as a senior producer on ''Good Morning America,'' said an ABC News staff member who knew of the hire but was not authorized to disclose it. Though the program's executive producer, Ben Sherwood, is leaving this fall, Mr. Murphy's responsibilities and title have not been finalized, the staff member said. Mr. Murphy's potential move to ABC was first reported yesterday on the Broadcasting & Cable Web site.
 The Fox group includes stations in New York (WNYW, Channel 5), Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas and Washington, as well as in Cleveland, Houston, Minneapolis, Phoenix and Orlando. Because the Los Angeles station already has a morning show at 9, and the station in Cleveland is planning to produce one of its own, Mr. Swanson said those stations might delay carrying the new national show until 10 a.m.
 Mr. Ailes declined, through a spokeswoman, to be interviewed yesterday, deferring instead to Mr. Swanson and Bob Cook, president and chief operating officer of Twentieth Television.

9 P.M. (History) ATLANTIC INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY -- They call it the Ditch, a 2,500-mile, 12-foot-deep stretch from Boston to Miami, conceived in the late 18th century as the country's first superhighway, in which ships and vessels were protected from the swift currents of the Atlantic. This special takes the slow boat along its canals, islands and land cuts (like this scene in Stuart, Fla., above right), and looks at attempts to save it. 


5:30 P.M. (TLC) DINNER TAKES ALL -- Rick, up next in this week's competition to see who can give the best dinner party, hopes his setting -- his family's New Jersey mansion -- will push him over the top.

7 P.M. (Sundance) FACE -- (1997). Robert Carlyle was big news in 1997 as Gaz, one of several unemployed steel workers who take it all off for a buck, in ''The Full Monty.'' This is his other film from that year, a little-seen gem by Antonia Bird about an ex-socialist who turns to bank robbing and discovers that, even among thieves, honor is rare.

9 P.M. (Sundance) HOUSE OF BOATENG -- He's partial to colors like orange and chartreuse and a bodyskimming fit not likely to attract corpulent executives. Still, Ozwald Boateng (left), the British director of the French fashion house of Givenchy, hasn't given up on winning over converts in America, where celebrities like Will Smith, Laurence Fishburne and David Bowie are already on his side.

10 P.M. (Animal Planet) ANIMAL COPS HOUSTON -- Her condition ain't being what it used to be, an old gray mare needs a new home. Good Samaritans help.

10 P.M. (History) AMERICAN EATS -- Catch that fizz: the history of soda pop.

10 P.M. (NBC) WINDFALL -- Money makes some heads go round in this series about 20 friends who win an enormous lottery. What are Peter and Sunny doing halfway to Belgium? What's up with Cameron and Nina? Can a dead woman write checks?

10 P.M. (Spike) THE DUDESONS -- In this reality series, which makes ''Jackass'' look like a thoroughbred, the Fabulous Finns destroy a supermarket and break some bones. (Where did they get them?)

11 P.M. (SoapNet) I WANNA BE A SOAP STAR -- A ''killed off'' finalist comes back from the dead in this competition to win a role on ''All My Children.''

11:35 P.M. (NBC) THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO -- Colin Farrell extols his latest, ''Miami Vice,'' in which he reprises the Don Johnson role of Sonny Crockett (far right, with Jamie Foxx as Ricardo Tubbs), down to the last hair. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers perform. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

HEADLINE: Playing Matchmaker for Technology, With a Twist

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Universities and research centers often have hundreds of technologies waiting for a company to come along to license them for profit. Trouble is, ferreting out the right business for the science can make finding needles in haystacks look easy.
 Enter the Utek Corporation. Utek, founded by Clifford M. Gross in Tampa, Fla., is a technology transfer company with a twist: it will work only with publicly traded companies, and it will take its payment only in shares of stock. ''The truth is, we're really a specialty finance company,'' Mr. Gross said.
 Utek's business model smacks more of trading floors than petrie dishes. Most technology transfer companies make their money by acquiring technologies that they license out themselves, or by charging fees for brokering deals between inventors and users.
 In Utek's case, small publicly traded companies pay a $10,000 monthly retainer, and Utek agrees to comb universities and government agencies for whatever new technologies the company needs. When it finds a match, it has the technology scientifically vetted, then buys it for cash. Utek then forms a subsidiary whose only asset is that technology, and sells the subsidiary -- generally for five times what it paid for the technology -- to the small company for shares of stock. It agrees to hold onto that stock for at least a year. 
 In a nutshell, small companies are paying Utek a premium for access to technologies, while universities and laboratories are accepting a discounted price to minimize their own risks.
 ''A stock deal is speculative, who knows what the shares will eventually sell for,'' said Nila Bhakuni, director of technology transfer at Rice University, which recently sold Utek a technology for synthesizing flavors and fragrances; Utek then swapped that for shares of the Industrial Biotechnology Corporation. ''And people are more likely to sue a university with a large endowment than a small company, and our endowment cannot be compromised.''
 Indeed, Utek's own investors are shouldering a great deal of risk. If the small company fails, its stock could be worthless. And, in fact, Utek has written off about a dozen once-promising stakes. Universities rarely offer warranties that they have not infringed on someone else's patent, and Utek often takes on the responsibility of patent due diligence, efficacy checks and liability insurance. And Utek must compete not only with conventional technology transfer companies, but with the very universities and government laboratories with whom it negotiates. 
 The Rochester Institute of Technology, for example, started a formal licensing program in 2001, and Varda N. Main, director of the technology licensing office, has yet to call in outside help to commercialize a patent. ''Our researchers know people in industry, and I know how to put together mailings and make cold calls,'' said Ms. Main, who said her office has brought in $924,000 in licensing fees. ''And I do get more money if I sell it myself.''
 Moreover, universities are under growing pressure from state and municipal governments to narrow, not widen, the net they cast for commercial partners. For example, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which does roughly 50 technology licensing deals a year, has used its technologies to help local entrepreneurs start 32 companies within the last five years. It has never felt a need to use Utek. 
 ''We want to use our intellectual property to create local jobs and investments in our state, and we feel we have the capability in-house to do that,'' said Mark Crowell, associate vice chancellor for economic development and technology transfer. 
 Still, Utek has a sizable following. It has already transferred 67 technologies, has equity stakes in 53 companies, 40 small companies paying that monthly retainer and a database of almost 32,000 technologies. It earned $5.9 million on revenue of $22.7 million in 2005. In the first three months of this year, revenue hit $11.8 million and operating income was $3.6 million. It is sitting on $60.1 million in equity stakes and cash, and just declared its first dividend, of 2 cents a share. It went public at $6 in October 2000; its shares closed at $20.90, up 19 cents yesterday.
 But why the success?
 For one thing, strides in biotechnology have caused a boomlet in new drug and fuel technologies looking for homes, and companies looking for inventions. ''There are so many different molecules and proteins and processes to patent, and so many companies looking to use them,'' said Kenneth Schoppmann, executive director of the Licensing Executives Society. ''But big companies have big staffs for seeking out technologies, and small businesses just don't.'' 
 For the technology transfer officers, Utek is simply another tool in their arsenal, albeit not the main one. ''Our primary priority is to get our technologies into the marketplace,'' said Charles T. Rivenburgh, director of intellectual property and technology licensing at Mississippi State University, which recently sold Utek a technology for using kenaf fiber to make cabinets.
 Indeed, few universities or government laboratories sell Utek exclusive rights to their technologies, and most continue to search for new users after the sale. But the fledgling companies that are often the best prospects for commercializing innovations rarely show up on their radar screens.
 ''Large companies are less willing to take risks with new technologies, and Utek has access to clients that we don't know about,'' said Richard Bolin, commercialization manager for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, part of the Department of Energy. Mr. Bolin sold Utek one technology for converting biomass to fuel only after a deal he was negotiating himself fell through. And he continues to talk to other companies about a technology he sold to Utek for use in making biodiesel fuel. 
 For the small companies that buy the technologies, though, the Utek connection has been crucial, not adjunct. 
 When Christopher d'Arnaud-Taylor wanted to create a business around making ethanol from forestry and paper wastes, he asked Utek to find him technologies to do so. He turned down a few, but bought five -- for stock that has varied from a low of $1.50 a share to a high of $16. (Shares of his company, the Xethanol Corporation, were unchanged yesterday at $8.05). 
 ''I outsourced technology search, because I do not have the time or energy to find or evaluate technologies myself,'' said Mr. d'Arnaud-Taylor. Xethanol will begin production of cellulosic ethanol this month.
 Even if the technology is an obvious fit, the deals can be hard to strike. The Trio Industries Group, a small company that wants to coat and cut doors and other parts for kitchen cabinets, has bought seven technologies from Utek, including a way to make panels from cornboards developed by the University of Illinois-Urbana, the kenaf fiber from University of Mississippi, and several adhesive technologies developed at Canadian universities. ''They earned their retainer, without them we would never have gotten in the door,'' said Robert E. Gyemant, Trio's chief executive.
 Now, with its technologies in place, Trio is finally building a factory, and expects to be producing by fall. Mr. Gyemant is predicting that by the end of next year, his company will be turning a profit on revenue of more than $10 million. Utek has a lot at stake: It now owns enough Trio stock so that Mr. Gyemant named it as a major investor in Trio's registration statements. ''They're our third-largest stockholder,'' Mr. Gyemant said. 

Jim Flanigan, whose Entrepreneurial Edge column appears on the third Thursday of each month, is on vacation.

HEADLINE: Technology Rewrites the Book

BYLINE: By PETER WAYNER

 BODY:
When Steve Mandel, a management trainer from Santa Cruz, Calif., wants to show his friends why he stays up late to peer through a telescope, he pulls out a copy of his latest book, ''Light in the Sky,'' filled with pictures he has taken of distant nebulae, star clusters and galaxies.
 ''I consistently get a very big 'Wow!' The printing of my photos was spectacular -- I did not really expect them to come out so well.'' he said. ''This is as good as any book in a bookstore.''
Mr. Mandel, 56, put his book together himself with free software from Blurb.com. The 119-page edition is printed on coated paper, bound with a linen fabric hard cover, and then wrapped with a dust jacket. Anyone who wants one can buy it for $37.95, and Blurb will make a copy just for that buyer. 
 The print-on-demand business is gradually moving toward the center of the marketplace. What began as a way for publishers to reduce their inventory and stop wasting paper is becoming a tool for anyone who needs a bound document. Short-run presses can turn out books economically in small quantities or singly, and new software simplifies the process of designing a book.
 As the technology becomes simpler, the market is expanding beyond the earliest adopters, the aspiring authors. The first companies like AuthorHouse, Xlibris, iUniverse and others pushed themselves as new models of publishing, with an eye on shaking up the dusty book business. They aimed at authors looking for someone to edit a manuscript, lay out the book and bring it to market. 
 The newer ventures also produce bound books, but they do not offer the same hand-holding or the same drive for the best-seller list. Blurb's product will appeal to people searching for a publisher, but its business is aimed at anyone who needs a professional-looking book, from architects with plans to present to clients, to travelers looking to immortalize a trip. 
 Blurb.com's design software, which is still in beta testing, comes with a number of templates for different genres like cookbooks, photo collections and poetry books. Once one is chosen, it automatically lays out the page and lets the designer fill in the photographs and text by cutting and pasting. If the designer wants to tweak some details of the template -- say, the position of a page number or a background color -- the changes affect all the pages.
 The software is markedly easier to use -- although less capable -- than InDesign from Adobe or Quark XPress, professional publishing packages that cost around $700. It is also free because Blurb expects to make money from printing the book. Prices start at $29.95 for books of 1 to 40 pages and rise to $79.95 for books of 301 to 440 pages.
 Blurb, based in San Francisco, has many plans for expanding its software. Eileen Gittins, the chief executive, said the company would push new tools for ''bookifying'' data, beginning with a tool that ''slurps'' the entries from a blog and places them into the appropriate templates.
 The potential market for these books is attracting a number of start-ups and established companies, most of them focusing on producing bound photo albums. Online photo processing sites like Kodak Gallery (formerly Ofoto), Snapfish and Shutterfly and popular packages like the iPhoto software from Apple let their customers order bound volumes of their prints. 
 These companies offer a wide variety of binding fabrics, papers, templates and background images, although the styles are dominated by pink and blue pastels. Snapfish offers wire-bound ''flipbooks'' that begin at $4.99. Kodak Gallery offers a ''Legacy Photo Book'' made with heavier paper and bound in either linen or leather. It starts at $69.99. Apple makes a tiny 2.6-by-3.5-inch softbound book that costs $3.99 for 20 pages and 29 cents for each additional page.
 The nature and style of these options are changing as customers develop new applications. ''Most of the people who use our products are moms with kids,'' says Kevin McCurdy, a co-founder of Picaboo.com in Palo Alto, Calif. But he said there had been hundreds of applications the company never anticipated: teachers who make a yearbook for their class, people who want to commemorate a party and businesses that just want a high-end brochure or catalog.
 Picaboo, like Blurb, distributes a free copy of its book design software, which runs on the user's computer. Mr. McCurdy said that running the software on the user's machine saves users the time and trouble of uploading pictures. The companies that offer Web-based design packages, however, point out that their systems do not require installing any software and also offer a backup for the user's photos.
 As more companies enter the market, they are searching for niches. One small shop in Duvall, Wash., called SharedInk.com, emphasizes its traditional production techniques and the quality of its product. Chris Hickman, the founder, said that each of his books was printed and stitched together by ''two bookbinders who've been in the industry for 30 or 40 years.'' The result, he said, is a higher level of quality that appeals to professional photographers and others willing to pay a bit more. Books of 20 pages start at $39.95.
 Some companies continue to produce black-and-white books. Lulu.com is a combination printer and order-fulfillment house that prints both color and black-and-white books, takes orders for them and places them with bookstores like Amazon.com. 
 Lulu works from a PDF file, an approach that forces users to rely on basic word processors or professional design packages. If this is too complex, Lulu offers a marketplace where book designers offer their services. Lulu does offer a special cover design package that will create a book's cover from an image and handle the specialized calculations that compute the size of the spine from the number of pages and the weight of the paper.
 A 6-by-9-inch softcover book with 150 black-and-white pages from Lulu would cost $7.53 per single copy.
 These packages are adding features that stretch the concept of a book, in some cases undermining the permanent, fixed nature that has been part of a book's appeal. The software from SharedInk.com, for instance, lets a user leave out pages from some versions of the book. If Chris does not like Pat, for instance, then the copy going to Chris could be missing the pages with Pat's pictures.
 Blurb is expanding its software to let a community build a book. Soon, it plans to introduce a tool that would allow group projects, like a Junior League recipe book, to be created through Blurb's Web site. The project leader would send out an e-mail message inviting people to visit the site and add their contributions to customized templates, which would then be converted into book pages.
 ''Books are breaking wide open,'' Ms. Gittins said. ''Books are becoming vehicles that aren't static things.''

HEADLINE: Southwest and American Air Report Profits 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Two of the nation's largest airlines gave signs yesterday that the industry was turning the corner after five years of losses by increasing passengers and raising fares at the start of the summer travel season. 
 The Southwest Airlines Company and AMR, the parent of American Airlines, the biggest carrier in the nation, met or beat Wall Street's profit forecasts for the second quarter despite higher fuel prices.
Analysts said the results at Southwest and AMR indicated that the airline industry was making a comeback, albeit one threatened by uncertainty over the economy and fuel prices.
 ''They proved they can make money at these fuel prices, at least in the busy second quarter,'' said Ray Neidl, an analyst with Calyon Securities. ''We still have to get through the slower winter period and see where fuel prices go.''
 Southwest, the most consistently profitable carrier in the country, said its profit more than doubled, to $333 million, or 40 cents a share, from $144 million, or 18 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
 Excluding gains from hedging its fuel purchases, the company said, it earned $273 million, or 33 cents a share, in the recent quarter.
 Analysts polled by Thomson Financial had predicted the airline, based in Dallas, would earn 26 cents a share.
 Southwest, which has been profitable every quarter since the start of 1991, said revenue rose 26 percent, to $2.45 billion, from $1.94 billion, topping analysts' forecast of $2.3 billion.
 Southwest jets averaged 78 percent occupancy in the second quarter, up from 72.5 percent a year ago. Analysts said the company benefited from a reduction of flights by other carriers and from people who decided to fly instead of drive.
 AMR, which is based in Fort Worth, recorded only its second profitable quarter, excluding those helped by one-time items, in the last five years, and its best April-June period since 1998.
 AMR said it earned $291 million, or $1.14 a share, up from $58 million, or 30 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The latest results matched analysts' forecasts.
 Revenue rose 12.5 percent, to $5.98 billion, slightly higher than the $5.93 billion that analysts had expected.
 That increase was enough to offset high fuel prices. American and its regional affiliate, American Eagle, spent $1.71 billion on fuel in the second quarter, nearly 30 percent more than a year earlier. 
 ''Our performance indicates very clearly that we are on the right track, but also demonstrates just as clearly that we have more work to do to return our company to financial health,'' the chief executive, Gerard J. Arpey, said.
 Mr. Arpey said challenges included high fuel costs and tougher competition from low-cost airlines and those that used the bankruptcy process to cut costs.
 American's planes averaged 82.6 percent occupancy, up from 79.5 percent a year earlier.
 Shares of AMR rose 26 cents, to $24.62, Southwest jumped $1.30, to $17.24.

HEADLINE: Count Ethnic Divisions, Not Bombs, to Tell if a Nation Will Recover From War

BYLINE: By Austan Goolsbee. 
Austan Goolsbee is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and a research fellow at the American Bar Foundation. E-mail: goolsbee@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WITH repeated Shiite and Sunni killings in Iraq, the Hezbollah rocket attacks on Israel, Israeli attacks on Lebanon and Gaza, the assaults by the Taliban and counterassaults by American forces in Afghanistan, and a train bombing in India, it has been quite a fortnight for at least two of the horsemen of the apocalypse -- war and death. 
 With little prospect of a quick resolution to most of these conflicts, perhaps it is worth looking at the long-run prospects for these nations once the wars actually end (assuming that they do end, of course). 
The good news is that history suggests that the destruction of war has no lasting impact on economic prospects. The bad news is that most of these countries, especially Iraq, are filled with ethnic divisions and civil discord. The evidence shows that these problems, unlike bombs, cause lasting damage to the prospects for a nation's economy, even if they do not boil over into civil war.
 The negligible long-term impact of war itself is rather startling but has been noted in numerous studies. The recent work of two economists at the University of California, Berkeley -- Edward Miguel and Gerard Roland -- for example, ''The Long Run Impact of Bombing Vietnam,'' (globetrotter.berkeley.edu/macarthur/inequality/papers/MiguelVietnamBombs.pdf), starts from the fact that some 10 percent of the 584 districts in Vietnam received nearly three-quarters of the total bomb tonnage. No matter how they sliced the data, they did not find that heavier bombing during the war corresponded with any major differences in poverty rates, access to electricity, literacy, population density or consumption in the 1990's and 2000's. 
 Similar studies have documented that the long-run population of Japanese cities was not affected by whether they were destroyed in World War II (including Hiroshima and Nagasaki, whose destruction was radioactive, to boot) and likewise for cities in Europe. After suffering the enormous immediate costs of war, it seems that people rather quickly return to where they left off. In the long run, things return to normal. Nation-building is still possible, even if one starts with rubble.
 But for the optimists hoping that war in the Middle East will soon end so the rebuilding can commence, there is a serious problem. The political boundaries of these countries, especially Iraq, make the long-term prospects bleak. The existence of ethnic division in the countries will probably mar them permanently in a way that bombs never could. 
 Boundaries between many countries of the Middle East, like those in Africa, were haphazardly put together in negotiations by European colonizers who had little regard for ethnic realities. Indeed, they sometimes even lumped enemies together on purpose, hoping that ethnic hatreds might reduce anticolonial feelings. In a new study, three economists -- Alberto F. Alesina and Janina Matuszeski of Harvard University and William Easterly of New York University -- document how important internal cohesion is for the health of a society. 
 Their study, ''Artificial States,'' (www.nyu.edu/fas/institute/dri/Easterly/File/artificialstatesNBER.pdf), creates two measures of how ''artificial'' a nation's boundaries are. The first measures whether the country's political borders partition ethnic groups into separate countries. A country that combines a few Hutus and neighbors another country with lots of Hutus is in greater danger of ethnic fragmentation than a country made up of similar peoples. 
 The second measures how squiggly the borders of a country are. Straight lines are usually the sign of an arbitrary colonial mapmaker. Natural barriers like rivers and mountains seldom look tidy. Taking the measures of partitioning and neat borders, their study compares the performance of countries with natural borders to those with artificial ones and finds, overwhelmingly, that artificial nations suffer terribly -- lower income, horribly ineffective and corrupt governments, less respect for the law, low literacy, limited access to clean water, poor health care, you name it. 
 Professor Alesina explained in an interview why he believed the fragmentation was so damaging.
 ''First, the governments in these countries are often run to benefit one ethnic group at the expense of the others and are prone to corruption,'' he said. ''Second, if you have a lot of people who would prefer to be part of the neighboring country, they tend to spend their time fighting the government rather than improving schools and building roads,'' 
 The fact that these groups do not trust one another, he said, makes them less willing to invest in social capital or even to conduct basic market transactions with one another. 
 Viewed from this perspective, the long-term economic prospects for Afghanistan and Iraq do not look good. It is not the destruction of war. That will end and the countries can be rebuilt. It is the fragmentation and ethnic hatred. That, typically, never goes away. 
 Iraq, especially, is a straight-edged, ethnically partitioned nation wracked with internal strife. And having oil wealth is unlikely to save the day. Fragmented countries with natural resources often do worse because civil war rages over who gets to keep the money. Some of the poorest countries in Africa, for example, are actually quite well endowed with diamonds and other resources. 
 When the horsemen of war and death arrive in the form of internal division, the horsemen of famine and pestilence are seldom far behind. But come to think of it, the Book of Revelation says the horsemen of the apocalypse arrive on horses of different colors -- white, red, black and pale. I wonder how they kept from killing one another?

HEADLINE: Martha Peterson, 90, Barnard President in Vietnam War Era

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Martha E. Peterson, the president of Barnard College in the turbulent Vietnam War era who went on hold the same position at Beloit College, died last Friday at her home in Madison, Wis. She was 90. 
 The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said Ron Nief, a spokesman for Beloit, in Wisconsin.
Miss Peterson, as she preferred to be called, was known for fostering calm at Barnard's campus in the Morningside Heights section of Manhattan during the late 1960's and early 70's, when student demonstrations roiled at the neighboring campus of Columbia University. 
 Miss Peterson, who was president of Barnard from 1967 to 1975, said shortly after her appointment: ''I'm not alarmed by student demonstrations. We better try to build bridges of understanding.''
 At Beloit, where she was president from 1975 to 1981, Miss Peterson was credited with restoring fiscal stability when enrollment and the endowment were shrinking. 
 Martha Elizabeth Peterson was born on June 22, 1916, outside Jamestown, Kan., the only child of a wheat farmer and a news reporter. She graduated from the University of Kansas in 1937. 
 After teaching high school mathematics for several years, she returned to the University of Kansas and earned a master's degree in educational psychology in 1943. 
 Three years later, after teaching mathematics at the university, Miss Peterson was named assistant dean of women. In 1952, she was promoted to dean of women, and five years later was appointed to a similar post at the University of Wisconsin. In 1959, Miss Peterson completed her doctorate in educational psychology at Kansas.
 In May 1967, Miss Peterson was chosen the seventh president of Barnard. 
 Dorothy Urman Denburg, the current dean of Barnard, was a student government officer during the antiwar protests, during which more than 100 Barnard students were arrested. 
 ''The campus came to a grinding halt,'' Dean Denburg recalled. ''Martha convened the entire college community -- faculty and students -- in one of the largest rooms on campus to talk about what the college's response should be. The outcome was a series of compromises giving students options for completing their academic work.'' 
 In Miss Peterson's estimation, she once told a reporter, her most significant achievement was working out an arrangement between Barnard and Columbia that allowed students at both colleges to take an unlimited number of courses at the other school while retaining Barnard's autonomy.
 Desiring to return to her Midwest roots, she took the job of president of Beloit. She helped improve the school's economic situation by selling off parts of the campus and cutting the staff. 
 Beloit's current president, John E. Burris, said that Miss Peterson's ''down-to-earth style, mixed with congenial good humor, worked well for Beloit at a time when severe personnel and fiscal decisions were necessary.''
 Miss Peterson is survived by her companion, Dr. Maxine Bennett.

HEADLINE: Boom Times in Wyoming, and Worrying Times as Well

BYLINE: By VERLYN KLINKENBORG

 BODY:
Here are some interesting facts about Wyoming. It's likely to have a $1.8 billion budget surplus next year, even though state spending has jumped by more than 50 percent in the past two years. In the past quarter, Wyoming had the highest per-capita income growth rate in the nation and the third lowest unemployment. It usually ranks at the top of the ''best business climate'' charts, because it has no personal or corporate income taxes.
 It is a state full of new roadwork, a place where you hear story after story about the flash floods of cash washing through the schools. It is also the least populous state, with fewer people than Washington, D.C., where one of its best-known residents, Dick Cheney, happens to work. 
The other interesting fact, of course, is that the country wants a lot more of what Wyoming has in abundance -- coal and natural gas -- and is willing to pay for it. The price of natural gas at the wellhead has gone up by more than 150 percent in the past seven years, often spiking much higher. That, coupled with the Bush administration's freewheeling approach to energy development, has resulted in a petroleum boom that is transforming the state. 
 The coal and gas and oil industries have siphoned off workers from nearly every other field. The state's Department of Environmental Quality, for instance, is having trouble filling vacancies because it can't compete in salaries with the industry it's supposed to be regulating. Rents in Gillette -- in the heart of coal country -- have skyrocketed. There is now a rush hour on what used to be quiet country highways. Marching bands have sprung up in towns that have been without marching bands for a decade and more. 
 Wyoming knows a boom when it sees one because it has seen them before. And, to its credit, the state is trying to find a way to feed some of its revenue into programs that will help even out the shock when the boom busts -- or simply tapers off. It is putting large sums into its Permanent Mineral Trust Fund, which collects a portion of the severance tax paid for Wyoming minerals, and it is adding to what it calls its Legislative Stabilization Reserve, a temporary savings account. The state has at last created a wildlife trust fund first proposed in 1982 but regularly defeated in the State Legislature, and it has endowed scholarship programs and the building of new schools. 
 It's hard to argue with prosperity, but a lot of people in Wyoming are worrying about its ultimate costs. Over the past few years, for instance, the rush to develop coal-bed methane, a process that involves extracting methane from water pumped out of coal seams, has done enormous harm to the landscape of the Powder River Basin in north-central Wyoming and to the reputation of the petroleum industry. In the western part of the basin, near Sheridan, many of the companies that rushed in to dig coal-bed wells have gone belly up, leaving the state, or no one, to pay the costs of mitigating the damage. 
 But the problem is bigger than that. Since George Bush took office, the federal government has turned the American West into a gas and oil open house. In nearly every Western state, the Bureau of Land Management's main function seems to be auctioning off petroleum leases. 
 Wyoming has always been a pro-drilling, pro-digging state, but now it finds itself trying to manage a free-for-all that looks to many people as if it has gotten out of hand. The governor has sided with environmentalists, for example, in successfully protesting new leases near the Wyoming Range. Senator Craig Thomas, a Republican, has argued that national forests should be off limits to drilling after Washington tried to offer for leasing nearly 175,000 acres in the Bridger-Teton National Forest.
 The boom would be hard enough to handle if it were merely a reflection of good times. But this boom gets portrayed as a response to a national crisis -- the demand for energy security. The mining laws, which assume that mining is the highest, best use of the land, already make ordinary people feel disenfranchised. Recasting those laws in terms of a national emergency compounds the problem. What polarizes the debate even further is the subtle character of the Wyoming landscape. It's hard enough to protect the Bridger-Teton National Forest, vastly harder still to protect a place like the Green River Basin. To a driller it's a wasteland ready for the drilling rig. To an environmentalist, it's delicate habitat.
 The real question isn't whether Wyoming can stabilize its prosperity. It's whether it can protect values and resources that are not as easily monetized as coal, oil and natural gas, or translated into the terms of national security. But then this is the question the whole nation faces.

HEADLINE: Nigerian Official Denies Congressman Bribed Him

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19 

 BODY:
The vice president of Nigeria angrily denied Wednesday that he accepted bribes or had a business relationship with Representative William J. Jefferson, the Louisiana Democrat who is the target of a federal corruption investigation that is threatening to complicate American relations with that oil-rich West African nation. 
 In a statement made available by his Washington lawyers, Vice President Atiku Abubakar, a leading candidate in Nigeria's presidential election next year, insisted that Mr. Jefferson had never ''suggested -- in any way -- providing any personal economic benefits'' to him.
Mr. Abubakar said he had ''no relationship with Mr. Jefferson, personal or private, other than the usual diplomatic courtesies'' extended to an American official promoting development in Nigeria, a major exporter of oil to the United States. One of Mr. Abubakar's lawyers, Edward Weidenfeld, said that ''there is nothing linking the vice president with Congressman Jefferson except Mr. Jefferson's own false, self-serving statements.''
 Mr. Weidenfeld said his client was entitled to a statement from federal prosecutors that he was ''an innocent victim.'' 
 The statements Wednesday were the first detailed effort by Mr. Abubakar and his political advisers to distance him from the wide-ranging corruption investigation centered on Mr. Jefferson, an eight-term lawmaker who was influential on African issues in the House. 
 Federal prosecutors have said Mr. Jefferson is under investigation for conspiring to bribe officials in Nigeria and elsewhere in West Africa in exchange for their help in securing government contracts for a small Kentucky-based technology company partly controlled by Mr. Jefferson.
 Mr. Jefferson has denied wrongdoing and is seeking re-election in November. His spokeswoman, Judy Smith, said Mr. Jefferson agreed with Mr. Abubakar that ''the vice president never accepted or agreed to accept any money from the congressman.'' 
 ''The selective disclosures made by the Department of Justice continue to create false impressions,'' Ms. Smith said.
 The criminal investigation has accelerated in recent weeks. On Wednesday, a federal judge ruled that investigators could begin examining documents seized in a search of Mr. Jefferson's offices on Capitol Hill. Mr. Jefferson had sought to delay that examination while he appealed an earlier ruling by the same judge, Thomas F. Hogan, that the search was legal and did not infringe on the constitutional separation of powers.
 The investigation of Mr. Jefferson is being closely followed by news organizations in Nigeria, and Mr. Abubakar has been forced to address questions about it as he prepares to step up his campaign for the presidency.
 In his statement, Mr. Abubakar said that he ''does not wish to make any judgments about Congressman Jefferson since the matter is still ongoing,'' that he had ''full confidence in the system of administration of justice'' in the United States and that ''at the end of the day the truth of the matter will be known to all.''

HEADLINE: Senate Backs New Controls For Projects By Engineers

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19 

 BODY:
The Senate voted Wednesday to put new controls on water projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, with proponents of the legislation repeatedly citing the experience of New Orleans, where corps-designed levees and waterways failed to protect the city from Hurricane Katrina.
 The legislation, an amendment to a measure authorizing new corps projects, calls for the creation of independent panels of scientific and economic experts with authority to weigh in on projects under consideration by the corps. A decision to ignore the panel's advice could be used against the corps in legal proceedings. 
Flood control, navigation and environmental restoration projects costing $40 million or more, or particularly controversial projects, would be subject to such review under the amendment, which passed the Senate 54 to 46. 
 A companion amendment, intended to create an interagency panel to recommend priorities among competing projects, failed by a vote of 19 to 80.
 Despite the resounding defeat of the second measure, environmental groups hailed the new requirements for independent review as a first step in what they see as needed reform. The new controls were attached to a $11.6 billion measure that adds scores of new projects on the corps' to-do list. The basic authorization for the water projects, often attacked as pork-barrel projects with little national significance passed on a voice vote Wednesday evening.
 ''New Orleans was betrayed by the corps and its friends in Congress,'' Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said during the debate Wednesday afternoon, citing the collapse of levees that were constructed on a base of sinking soil that weakened them. ''The record of the Corps of Engineers cries out for independent review,'' added Mr. McCain, who sponsored the amendment with Senator Russ D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin.
 The amendment had been opposed by many farm-state senators, like Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who warned that the new process might slow projects crucial to the transportation of corn, soybeans and other crops to ports and to world markets. Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, warned that the new review panels would be taken over by special interests who, he said, ''would be determined to undo projects for other reasons, policy reasons.''
 He said the Senate should not ''be handing government functions over to some unelected commission.'' 
 This week, the White House budget office criticized the overall authorization measure for including projects outside the agency's basic mission, despite an existing backlog of work that, in total, would cost $58 billion. 
 The water projects bill, the first since 2000, gives the government the authority -- but not the money -- to underwrite projects including a $3.4 million improvement of the locks on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers and $1.5 billion for ongoing restoration of the Everglades.
 The House passed a similar bill a year ago, before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita laid waste to the Gulf Coast.
 Mr. Bond and Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, had sought to circumvent the creation of the independent review panels by offering a separate amendment, setting the threshold for review at $100 million instead of $40 million and giving the top official of the corps discretion to decide that a review might not be necessary. That amendment failed, 49 to 51. 
 Malia Hale, director of national restoration and water resources for the National Wildlife Federation, praised the Senate action on independent review as a response ''to many of the things that arose with Hurricane Katrina.'' She added that the underlying bill ''has a lot of unnecessary pork but a lot of good things, like Everglades restoration.''

HEADLINE: Reluctantly Adjusting To Oil Cost

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE; Alexei Barrionuevo contributed reporting from Chicago for this article.

 BODY:
Every Monday morning Dean England, chief executive of a family-owned trucking company, logs onto the Energy Department's Web site and checks the latest average cost of a gallon of diesel fuel. If it is up enough, he raises the charge to haul produce across the country in his tractor-trailers.
 A formula has evolved. For every 5-cent rise in the price of fuel, Mr. England's company, C. R. England Inc., based in Salt Lake City, adds 1 percent to its freight rates. Since 2003, those rates are up 37 percent, yet demand has not slackened. The company's 2,800 trucks are constantly on the road.
 ''The market has been good to us,'' Mr. England said. ''But ultimately the extra cost of hauling food has to fall on the consumer.'' 
 Demand is similarly strong at other energy-dependent operations, notably railroads, airlines and chemical companies. They, too, are raising prices to recapture as much as they can of the run-up in oil prices.
 That is gradually adding to the inflation rate and appears to be contributing to a slowdown in growth -- but it has not crippled the economy. 
 ''As oil prices rise, a noose does tighten around the expansion,'' said Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist for Global Insight. 
 Mr. Gault estimates that rising energy prices are currently shaving 1 to 1.5 percentage points from the economy's annual growth rate, which is one reason that he expects the rate to slow from the robust 5.6 percent of the first quarter to roughly 3 percent for the rest of the year.
 ''I'm guessing that if oil gets to $100 a barrel, that could provoke a recession,'' Mr. Gault said, ''but even then it depends on how quickly we get there. We do seem to be adjusting to gradual increases.''
 The $8 run-up last week, to $78 a barrel, as violence spread in the Middle East was hardly gradual. But prices did fall this week, to under $73, and the Energy Department forecasts that West Texas intermediate crude oil, a benchmark grade, will finish the year at $73.50 a barrel, up $8 from January.
 Whatever the energy costs, many companies have managed to absorb much of the price shock and preserve profits, which have risen to record levels recently as a share of national income. The companies have done this by raising prices and instituting efficiencies that reduce the use of petroleum and natural gas. 
 Consumers have not fared as well. Rising gasoline prices constitute what economists sometimes describe as a consumption tax. When such a tax is imposed on millions of workers whose incomes have not kept up with inflation in recent years, those consumers eventually cut back on spending. That is one reason that economists see a slowdown coming. 
 The consumption tax is likely to be $100 billion higher this year than last year, Mr. Gault estimates. 
 The increased caution in spending is evident in the weekly consumer surveys conducted by the University of Michigan. Those surveyed seem to be losing faith that oil prices can be checked, now that the average price of a gallon of gasoline reached $3.03 this week, up 75 cents since January.
 ''For a long time people anticipated that gas prices would fall back, so they ran up more debt to cover their higher expenses without cutting back on purchases,'' said Richard T. Curtin, director of the Michigan surveys. ''And now they have reluctantly concluded, in the past three or four months, that gasoline prices are not going to go down.''
 But cutbacks in spending have been concentrated among households with less than $50,000 in annual income, according to Mr. Curtin's surveys. That is roughly half of all households. Most of those with incomes above $50,000, which contribute to the bulk of consumer spending, are still managing to absorb the higher energy costs without cutting back much elsewhere. ''Rising gasoline prices are really driving a wedge between lower- and higher-income households,'' Mr. Curtin said.
 Companies often have more room to maneuver than average consumers. Railroads, for example, are operating at high levels of capacity, mostly in transporting ever greater amounts of coal to electric utilities. That has given them the leverage to raise rates enough to cover 75 percent of their increased cost of diesel fuel, says Philip Baggaley, a managing director and transportation analyst at Standard & Poor's.
 The airlines, through surcharges and fare increases, are also covering three-quarters of the increase in their fuel costs, Mr. Baggaley said. After years of having to keep fares low, the big airlines have achieved a turnaround by shrinking their fleets and flying planes ''jammed with people,'' as Mr. Baggaley put it.
 Even food companies are getting into the act as energy costs work through the food chain. Kellogg will raise cereal prices by about 2 percent in September, the first increase since July 2004, said Neal Goldner, director of investor relations.
 On the other hand, chemical companies are getting a break on natural gas. Petroleum and natural gas are often interchangeable feedstocks in the production of the chemical ingredients that go into foam for cushions, solvents for dry cleaning and plastic for bottles, as well as glues, synthetic rubber, electronic circuit boards and a host of other products. 
 While oil prices have remained high, natural gas has become cheaper. That is mainly because a milder-than-expected winter left the nation with huge unsold inventories of natural gas that cannot easily be shipped around the world, as oil is.
 Dow Chemical takes advantage of the natural gas price drop in its American operations. But the real gain is overseas, says John Dearborn, Dow's vice president for energy. While natural gas is about $6 per one million B.T.U.'s here, it is only $1 in various Middle East countries.
 ''At Dow, our production is about 50 percent in the United States and 50 percent elsewhere,'' Mr. Dearborn said, ''but our preferential investment is elsewhere.''
 Even so, Dow's feedstock costs were $22 billion last year, up from $8 billion in 2003. ''If we are going to survive, we have to get our prices up,'' he said. With the global economy booming, prices on all Dow products are up 44 percent on average since 2001, the company reports. 
 Thousands of companies have shaved fuel costs by using less but getting the same result. Dean England, for example, has installed heaters that run on their own fuel canisters in his company's 2,800 truck cabs. Engines no longer have to idle to generate heat while drivers rest, a more expensive option. He is testing a similar air-conditioning unit.
 ''Our drivers can be cool in the summer and warm in the winter,'' he said, ''and we won't have to have any engine idling.''

HEADLINE: Pension Deal Closer, but Hurdles Exist

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Congressional negotiators have reached a preliminary oral agreement on a long-awaited package of amendments to overhaul the nation's pension system, the chairman of the negotiating group said yesterday.
 The chairman, Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, left a session yesterday afternoon saying that he thought ''everything is resolved, pending getting the exact wording.''
Mr. Enzi declined to give details, but he said the negotiators would be working today on a written draft. The legislation is meant to keep more pension plans from failing and being taken over by the federal government. 
 Others involved in the House-Senate negotiating committee sounded less optimistic. One, Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio and the majority leader, said there were ''some moving parts still.''
 Aides to other negotiators also cited some unresolved issues, like the question of whether companies that provide investment advice on retirement plans and offer mutual funds should be shielded from conflict-of-interest provisions. 
 Whatever the case, lobbyists and interest groups, anticipating that a deal was near, said they would continue to press their individual needs. 
 "Probably this will be our last chance," said Jerry Fisher, a retired truck driver in Asheville, N.C., who is traveling to Washington to fight a provision of the bill that would reduce the benefits of people who take early retirement in certain types of plans. 
 Negotiators have been struggling with the complicated, contentious package for months, missing several self-imposed deadlines. They have sought to make compromises between those who say the pension system is too risky and needs strengthening, and those who warn that companies offer pension benefits voluntarily and are likely to stop offering them if Congress makes it too difficult and expensive. 
 Some compromises are unlikely to satisfy either side. The negotiators have reportedly agreed to let companies ''smooth'' their pension values over two years, for example. Companies are accustomed to spreading changes over more years than that, and they say the two-year approach will bring unwanted volatility into their pension numbers. 
 The Bush administration wanted to reduce smoothing to less than a year, and a growing number of economists say it should be eliminated.
 As pressure has mounted to finish the bill, other issues have suddenly flared, including the possibility that nonpension matters, like the estate tax, could be included. 
 Negotiators are under pressure from the major airlines, which have been urging them to come up with special pension relief measures for their troubled industry in time for a vote before Congress's August recess. Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines are in bankruptcy protection and have said that if they do not get permission to delay their contributions, they will terminate the plans and send them to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. 
 Failed airline plans have long been a problem for the pension guarantor and are the source of some of its biggest losses. Already this summer, Delta has begun the process of terminating its pilots' pension plan. 
 The idea of relief for the airlines has been popular in Congress, although outside Washington many financial analysts say that delaying pension contributions in any industry is a bad idea, because the plans are likely to be terminated later and will only be further behind. 
 People who have been following the Congressional negotiations say they expect some sort of airline relief to be included in the final bill. 
 But the prospect of pension relief for the airlines is causing concern in other industries. Companies that expect to have to contribute more to their pension plans under the coming amendments have been asking why they should pay more when the airlines will be paying less. The questions of fairness appear to be one issue keeping negotiators at the table. 
 Some of the greatest unhappiness appears to involve changes in how companies are allowed to get credit when they make pension contributions that are larger than needed. 
 Currently, companies may keep a running balance of their excess contributions, year after year, and in years when they do not put in the required amount, they can make up the difference by using some of their credit balance from previous years. 
 The credit balances can be deceptive when a pension fund is invested in assets, like stock, whose values can fall. After credit balances played a key role in the $10 billion pension failure at United Airlines, a record, Congress decided to change the way the balances were handled. 
 Their approach involves a complicated compromise and it could still change. Pension specialists who have been briefed on the bill's provisions say that companies will not be able to include their credit balances when they run a new test, envisioned under the new law, to see whether their pension plans are at risk.

HEADLINE: Higher Housing Costs Pushed Consumer Prices Up in June

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
A closely watched barometer of inflation grew at a strong pace in June but shed little light on whether the Federal Reserve would increase interest rates again next month.
 While the Labor Department reported yesterday that core consumer prices had the largest sustained rise since 1995, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, sounded a less-than-hawkish tone on inflation in testimony on Capitol Hill. Without a more declarative position from Mr. Bernanke, economists were left to speculate whether the Fed may pause when it meets next month or approve its 18th consecutive increase in interest rates.
The Labor Department reported that the core Consumer Price Index, which does not include food and energy prices, rose by 0.3 percent in June, its fourth consecutive increase. That was a larger increase than economists expected, and represented the longest period of high inflation in the core rate since the first four months of 1995. 
 The consensus estimate, according to a survey by Bloomberg News, was for a 0.2 percent rise in June. 
 The core index was 2.6 percent higher last month than in June 2005, which was the biggest year-to-year jump since early 2002. 
 Over all, consumer prices rose 0.2 last month, a more moderate pace than the 0.4 percent rise reported in May. A retreat in energy prices in June helped hold down the number. Energy prices declined 0.9 percent last month, the first time since February they dropped. 
 But with crude oil prices once again near record highs, the June decline may be short-lived. 
 ''The reality is that inflation continues to accelerate,'' Joel L. Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors, wrote in a report yesterday. ''Excluding energy, retail costs rose at a pace that cannot make anyone on the F.O.M.C. comfortable,'' he said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, the group at the Fed that sets interest rates. 
 A major contributor to the increase in consumer prices last month was the cost of housing. The indexes for rent and its equivalents in the consumer price calculation climbed 0.4 percent. Prices for medical care, education and tobacco also went up. 
 With prices over the next several months expected to be higher because of record oil prices and rising rents, many economists say they believe the current inflationary trends are likely to become the norm. 
 ''What this suggests is a broad-based rise in core inflation, and this has been happening over the past several months,'' said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital. ''This is the trend.''
 Simon Hayley, senior international economist with Capital Economics in London, said, ''This is not a temporary blip.''
 Still, investors appeared to shrug off the concerns raised by the numbers and to focus instead on remarks by Mr. Bernanke in Senate testimony. Mr. Bernanke said that while inflation was still on the rise, he believed that the impact of the Fed's past interest rate tightening had yet to be fully felt. 
 Those remarks, combined with strong earnings reports from International Business Machines and J. P. Morgan Chase, lifted investor sentiment and helped send stocks surging. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 212 points yesterday, while the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite both rose nearly 2 percent.
 Investors also largely ignored another government report yesterday with more signs the housing market was slowing. Building permits fell to a three-year low and new residential construction fell by 5.3 in June, the slowest pace in a year and a half.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Set to Alter Pension Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Prodded by a governor and a state treasurer who spent years on Wall Street, New Jersey is poised to adopt a plan that would shift about a quarter of the state's $72 billion pension fund from the control of state employees to private money managers within the next year.
 While Gov. Jon S. Corzine acknowledges that the new strategy will cost at least $200 million a year in fees and carry some risk, he says he is confident that the change will improve the state's fiscal outlook.
 In magnitude and in speed, it may be the most drastic change in any state's pension investment policy, pension experts say. With a new emphasis on diversified investments like hedge funds, emerging markets and commodities rather than the traditional mix of stocks and bonds, the proposal will transform New Jersey from being one of the most conservative states to one of the most aggressive, along with New York, California and Oregon. 
 The proposal has been before members of the State Investment Council -- a group of finance executives, union representatives and others -- for several days, and the council's final vote on whether to go ahead is scheduled for today. 
 Some financial experts who support the concept of investment diversification question whether the change is too abrupt, and the leader of one of the state's labor unions described the proposal as a foolish high-stakes gamble.
 The union leader, Rae Roeder, president of Local 1033 of the Communications Workers of America, in Trenton, said in an interview last night that her workers had been told that outside managers would eventually control as much as half the portfolio.
 ''They're playing fast and loose right now with our money,'' Ms. Roeder said. ''Just like you're sitting at the craps table, you can lose it all. And it's not his money -- it's our members' -- and it's people who are breaking their necks all these years, and all the retirees.''
 The proposal also carries significant political implications for Mr. Corzine. While he earned high marks from state workers during the recent budget standoff for insisting that the state pump more than $1.1 billion into the pension fund, he runs the risk of alienating them with this proposal and souring the relationship when contract negotiations begin in a few months.
 Still, it is a risk that Mr. Corzine, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, readily accepts. ''I'm a big believer in diversification,'' he said in an interview yesterday with reporters and editors of The New York Times.
 When asked about the angry reaction from the unions, he said: ''They know how I feel about this. I find that sometimes it's hard to get deep into dialogue when you look at several of the unions that are raising the most Cain about this. You look at their national retirement plans -- they're some of the most well-managed, diversified portfolios.''
 In support of the new investment strategy, the state treasurer, Bradley I. Abelow, who was a partner at Goldman Sachs, is to make his first appearance before the investment council today. 
 In many ways, the disagreement over the investments is part of a larger policy debate over both the fiscal well-being of the state's pension system and the philosophy behind it. 
 After the collapse of technology stocks in 2000, the value of the state's fund shrank by about a third. Other state pension funds also lost money at that time, but many finance experts criticized New Jersey's for being one of the few public retirement funds being managed by civil servants.
 Even union officials outside New Jersey puzzled over why the state had been almost alone among major funds in avoiding such alternative investments as hedge funds, real estate and nontraded stocks known as private equities.
 ''Every other fund in the country was doing it this way, and New Jersey was doing it its own way,'' said John Adler, director of private equity for the Service Employees International Union national headquarters, in New York City.
 In the last five years, New Jersey's pension fund has generated annual returns of 3.7 percent, which is about one-third lower than the returns generated by public funds with more than $100 million in assets, according to Pete Keliuotis, vice president of Strategic Investment Solutions, a San Francisco investment consulting firm that is a general consultant to New Jersey's pension fund. In terms of risk, New Jersey's fund has also been more volatile than most comparable funds, he said.
 But Ms. Roeder and Joseph A. Golowski, a retired state auditor who is now a consultant for the Communications Workers of America, cited a trade magazine, Pensions and Investments, which has ranked New Jersey 12th best in the nation of all public and private pensions. 
 In addition, they noted that in the last decade, administrations under both political parties have not deposited much money into the pension.
 Pension investments began to change under Gov. James E. McGreevey, who began to question whether the state was earning as much as it could. As a result, the State Investment Council turned to several money management firms to experiment with some of the pension funds. So far, it has approved more than $2 billion in new investments; that was supposed to grow to about $9 billion within five years, or 13 percent of the total pension fund. 
 But Ms. Roeder's union, which represents the 60 state workers who now handle the state's pension investments, and the New Jersey Education Association filed lawsuits to block the state's investment plans, saying that the Legislature needed to be involved. That suit is still pending. 
 Even though the state began to dabble in alternative investments, Orin S. Kramer, the chairman of the State Investment Council and a prominent hedge fund manager in Manhattan, wrote in a memo to council members that overall, the current plan was a ''uniquely quaint historic investment structure.'' To reform the system, the memo calls for $6 billion in alternative investments; $3.9 billion in equity markets in developed countries; $1.3 billion in emerging markets; $2.9 billion in commodities; $2.2 billion to Treasury inflation-protected securities; and $2.2 billion in high-yield fixed-income, among other suggestions.
 According to the memo, if the state had diversified its portfolio five years ago, the fund would have earned at least $5 billion more.
 Ms. Roeder likened the proposed shift in investments to going from ''a little drop to a huge waterfall.''
 Governor Corzine disagreed, insisting that the plan proposed by Mr. Kramer sounded responsible and that it would be irresponsible to fail to try to improve the rate of return, given the state's financial situation.

HEADLINE: Europeans Agree on Plan To Send Money To Palestinians

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: GAZA, July 19 

 BODY:
The European Union foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, pledged Wednesday to start international donor funds flowing to cash-starved Palestinian hospitals as early as Aug. 1, part of a broader relief package that will provide the Palestinian Authority with about $130 million over three months.
 Agreement on the financial package, details of which are still being worked out, came as long-promised donations from Arab League members began arriving in accounts controlled by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. His political party, Fatah, lost elections in January to the Islamist group Hamas. 
''As we have said previously, the problem is not with us, it is with Hamas and the world,'' said Nabil Abu Rudeineh, an aide to Mr. Abbas.
 Both streams of cash are intended to ease the Palestinian government's dire financial crisis without dealing directly with the Hamas leadership. A Western financial embargo on the Hamas-led government has cut off the Palestinian Authority from the international aid that is its lifeblood.
 The so-called quartet of the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia has been working to find a way to funnel money to Authority employees through Mr. Abbas while maintaining pressure on Hamas, which all members of the quartet except Russia consider a terrorist organization.
 ''The international community has worked hard to put together a mechanism to support President Abbas and pay for basic needs in critical sectors,'' said Christina Gallach, Mr. Solana's spokeswoman. Mr. Solana was visiting Gaza as part of a Middle East tour to find a way out of the current crisis.
 Many Palestinians regard the effort to reconcentrate power in the hands of the president as a cynical effort to undermine their democratic choice. ''This contradicts the American and European vision of democracy,'' said the Authority's acting finance minister, Yousef Rezqa, a member of Hamas. ''The concept of democracy that the U.S. and the E.U. were pushing changed once the elections brought a government they didn't like.''
 The effect has been to shift the balance of power in Mr. Abbas's favor, making the Hamas government dependent on him for its financial survival. 
 The international embargo has prevented even sympathetic Arab governments from transferring money to the Hamas government, because banks are unwilling to risk the sanctions that would result from dealing with Hamas.
 Government workers have not been paid since March, except for some who received one-time payments of $300 each from cash carried in personally by Hamas ministers.
 Under the European and Arab plans, money will begin dribbling into Palestinian pockets, but still nowhere near the amount necessary to meet the Palestinian Authority's $160 million-plus monthly budget.
 Arab League countries pledged earlier this year to provide $55 million a month in support. So far, Qatar and Libya have each deposited $50 million in an Arab League Palestinian relief fund, while Yemen and Oman have together sent another $11 million. 
 Of the Arab League donations, $50 million has already been transferred to bank accounts controlled by Mr. Abbas. Another $45 million has been transferred directly from Kuwait.
 Palestinian Authority officials said the money would be used to pay a half-month's salary to all of the government's 167,000 employees -- except Hamas ministers and Parliament members. The rest will be used for government operating expenses. 
 Mr. Abbas's office asked the Arab League on Wednesday to release the rest of the money from its fund. 
 Under the European plan, meanwhile, the first payment of the international donor funds will be paid through the World Bank directly to hospitals and schools beginning in August. An additional payment for Authority's utility bills is expected to be worked out within the next few days. Palestinian and European negotiators are still discussing how to deliver a third portion, for health care workers.
 The most contentious payments are those that would be made to the neediest Palestinians. While Mr. Abbas has lobbied hard for such payments to be included, there is a debate about how to determine who the recipients should be. Initial lists presented by the Palestinians included the families of men killed while fighting Israel, and there is concern that the money could end up supporting members of Hamas or other militant groups.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Optimistic On Inflation

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19 

 BODY:
Despite the recent acceleration in consumer prices, pushed higher largely by oil prices, the chairman of the Federal Reserve expressed optimism on Wednesday that the central bank's heavy lifting to fend off inflation may be almost finished.
 ''The economy appears to be in a period of transition,'' Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said at a hearing of the Senate Banking Committee. The outlook, he said, is for somewhat slower economic growth, a slight increase in unemployment and a broad-based cooling of the nation's housing market.
The comments by Mr. Bernanke, who got off to a somewhat rocky start with Wall Street earlier this year, helped fuel a rally in financial markets, which had already started the day up on strong earnings reports from I.B.M., banks and airlines. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 1.9 percent and pushed its way back into positive territory for the year after falling 2.3 percent last week when hostilities flared in the Middle East. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 212.19 points and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.8 percent. 
 And even though the Labor Department reported Wednesday morning that consumer price increases in June slightly exceeded expectations, Treasury bonds recovered from their earlier losses and shot higher.
 Mr. Bernanke left ample room for another rate increase when Fed policy makers meet on Aug. 8, but he suggested that the most recent jumps in consumer prices were largely old news and would gradually subside as the Fed's previous rate increases rippled through the economy. 
 ''The lags between policy actions and their effects imply that we must be forward-looking, basing our policy choices on the longer-term outlook,'' Mr. Bernanke told lawmakers. ''We must take account of the possible future effects of previous policy actions -- that is, of policy effects still 'in the pipeline.' ''
 Mr. Bernanke offered no specific hints about whether the Fed would raise rates again at its next meeting, and many analysts predicted that at least one more increase was still likely.
 Speaking carefully, and staying as close as possible to his prepared remarks, Mr. Bernanke displayed a new nimbleness in communicating -- in contrast with earlier performances that seemed to confuse investors and rattle the markets.
 In plainer language than that typically used by his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, Mr. Bernanke conveyed a clear message on Wednesday about the Fed's thinking. But he avoided any explicit hints about the Fed's next policy move and emphasized the need for toughness if inflation signs unexpectedly persist.
 Boiled down, Mr. Bernanke conveyed a twofold message: The economy appears to be reacting to Fed policy as expected, which means that interest rates probably do not need to climb much higher -- but if there are any surprises, all bets are off.
 ''We think this is a pretty clear signal that Mr. Bernanke does not think the recent inflation numbers ought to have much impact on the debate,'' wrote Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, in a note to clients. ''The key question is whether the tightening already in place is enough to slow the economy to a pace that will, over time, reduce inflation pressure. Mr. Bernanke thinks it is.''
 In his testimony, the Fed chairman admitted that inflation was higher than the central bank had expected back in February. But he suggested that inflation would gradually subside in 2007 to just above the central bank's informal comfort zone.
 The Fed's newest forecast anticipates that the nation's economic growth will slow to an annual rate of about 3 percent this year and next -- down from the red-hot pace of 5.6 percent in the first three months of this year -- and that the underlying ''core'' pace of inflation will edge down to about 2.2 to 2.3 percent next year from an average around 2.5 percent this year.
 Core inflation, excluding the volatile prices of food and energy, would still be higher than Mr. Bernanke's preferred target of 1 to 2 percent and higher than the Fed had previously expected. But the trend would be in the right direction, and Mr. Bernanke has often cautioned against knee-jerk reactions to temporary shocks. 
 On Wednesday, Mr. Bernanke suggested that the Fed was inclined to sit back and let the long series of previous rate increases -- to 5.25 percent from 1 percent in June 2004 -- work their way through the economy. 
 In response to a question from Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, Mr. Bernanke said the economy was ''in a more normal range of interest rates at this point.'' 
 ''I do think it's beginning to have some effect,'' he said. ''We are trying to judge the effect on both real output and inflation and trying to make our best judgment.''
 Mr. Bernanke, though emphasizing the need for vigilance, showed little alarm. ''We can't do anything about this month's inflation number, because our policy works with a lag,'' he told lawmakers. 
 He then pointed to a range of indicators that showed the economy was slowing, a trend that Fed officials hope will ease inflation pressures. He called particular attention to evidence of a slowdown in the housing market, where home sales have fallen and new construction has dropped. The slowdown ''appears to be more broad-based'' than could be explained by seasonal factors or the vicissitudes of weather, Mr. Bernanke said.
 Consumer spending is likely to be ''restrained'' by the decline in home equity withdrawals and a slowdown in real estate prices. And while wages are likely to climb and the labor market in many industries appears ''tight,'' Mr. Bernanke was optimistic that higher wage costs would be largely offset by continued strong growth in productivity.
 In general, the Fed chairman appeared cautiously confident that economic growth would remain strong enough to prevent a big jump in unemployment without aggravating inflationary pressures.
 He pointed to strong increases in business investment, rising backlogs in orders for big equipment, strong corporate profits and signs of solid growth in the global economy.
 ''Over all, the U.S. economy seems poised to grow in coming quarters at a pace roughly in line with the expansion of underlying productive capacity,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
 But lawmakers, Republicans and Democrats alike, made it clear that they were already worried about the pain of higher interest rates. ''You don't want the medicine to destroy the patient, right?'' asked Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama.
 Some Democrats, meanwhile, warned that the economy was already in trouble.
 ''The economy is slowing down, and the run-up in oil prices is contributing to that slowdown,'' Mr. Sarbanes of Maryland said. ''Not only are jobs growing slowly, but all the measures of wages and compensation show gains below inflation over the last year.''
 Mr. Bernanke acknowledged that wage gains had been modest and that corporate profits remained unusually high as a share of the total economy. But he expressed hope that corporations would use some of those profit margins to meet demands for higher wages from workers without raising prices to customers.
 ''I do think the wages will rise,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''I'm a little surprised they haven't risen more already.''

HEADLINE: Motorola Income Rises 48% on Cellphone and Cable Box Sales

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Motorola, the world's second-largest mobile phone maker, said yesterday that its profit jumped 48 percent in the second quarter on the strength of record shipments of cellphones and digital set-top boxes. 
 Since shedding several unprofitable divisions over the last two years, Motorola's sales have grown at all its remaining divisions. Notably, the company has been able to gain market share in handsets because of strong demand for its Razr and Q phones in the United States and surging sales in China and other developing economies.
The strong performance was at odds with some analysts' predictions of slower industry growth in technology products, including cellphones, as well as the declining share prices of many technology stocks in recent months.
 Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., earned $1.38 billion, or 55 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with $933 million, or 37 cents a share, in the corresponding period last year. It benefited from one-time gains worth 21 cents a share.
 Financial analysts had expected a profit around 30 cents a share before the one-time gains.
 Revenue reached $10.9 billion in the quarter, nearly 30 percent more than the $8.4 billion last year. The company expects strong sales of its cellphones to help third-quarter sales rise to a range of $10.9 billion to $11.1 billion. That would represent an increase of 20 percent to 23 percent compared with the 2005 period.
 ''The numbers are stunning despite all the gloom and doom around technology,'' said Edward J. Zander, Motorola's chief executive, who said his company had been gaining market share from Samsung, LG and other rivals.
 Motorola has been selling more cellphones, including the Q, that are designed for sending e-mail as well as talking. Over all, the company shipped 52 million handsets in the quarter, a 53 percent increase. It said it now controlled about 22 percent of the global handset market, 4.3 percentage points above its share in the quarter a year earlier.
 Motorola said it shipped a record 2.4 million digital set-top boxes to meet demand from cable companies.
 Mr. Zander said business had not been affected by the recent merger of Cisco Systems and Scientific-Atlanta, the second-largest maker of set-top boxes in the United States.
 Despite the company's performance, Motorola's shares have slipped more than 16 percent this year. Yesterday, the stock rose 37 cents, to $19.25.
 The bond-rating agency Fitch raised its rating yesterday on Motorola's debt to A- from BBB+, citing the company's stronger cash flow and debt reduction. Fitch also ''remains comfortable with Motorola's operating profile.''
 The company's larger competitor, Nokia, releases its earnings today.
 Yahoo said yesterday that it had signed a deal with Motorola to have its Yahoo Go for Mobile service automatically installed on new Motorola handsets starting in the first half of next year. The service lets users read their Yahoo mail, and get access to their address books and other features.

HEADLINE: Talk of Automaker Alliance Makes Michigan Uneasy

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARDand NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 19 

 BODY:
General Motors, Renault and Nissan have only begun talking about a possible alliance, but the prospect of such a deal has touched a raw political nerve in the Motor City.
 Members of Congress from both parties, Michigan's governor and the head of the United Automobile Workers union have all questioned whether the deal would be good for a state troubled by high unemployment, plant closings and the erosion of its mainstay auto companies.
Representative John D. Dingell, the longtime Democratic congressman whose district includes parts of Detroit, Dearborn (where Ford is based) and other automaking cities in southeastern Michigan, recalled: ''My daddy used to say if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. As of this time, I'm applying this useful lesson of caution.'' 
 Mr. Dingell, whose wife, Deborah, is a senior official in G.M.'s Washington office, said shareholders and employees of the company had told him they were fearful of an alliance. ''Most of them think it's a bad deal -- a bad deal for the company, a bad deal for the state and a bad deal for them,'' he said.
 Across the aisle, Representative Joe Knollenberg, a Republican who represents Bloomfield Hills, Mich., the home of G.M.'s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, and other industry leaders, voiced similar concerns. 
 G.M. ''should go very slow'' in its discussions with Nissan and Renault, Mr. Knollenberg said, especially because the potential remains for a strike at Delphi, G.M.'s big parts supplier, which sought bankruptcy protection last fall.
 He questioned whether a proposed deal, an idea floated by G.M.'s biggest shareholder, Kirk Kerkorian, was in the automaker's best interests. ''The role of Kerkorian is one that bothers me, and I think it bothers a lot of people,'' he said. ''He is not necessarily supporting keeping G.M. alive and well.''
 President Bush, though he has not commented directly on the proposed alliance, left little doubt at a news conference on July 7 about where he stood on the idea of Renault and Nissan investing in G.M. Asked about foreign companies investing in technology producers, Mr. Bush replied, according to a White House transcript:
 ''On the broader scale, I have no problem with foreign capital buying U.S. companies; nor do I have a problem with U.S. companies buying foreign companies. That's what free trade is all about. 
 ''A lot of the jobs in America exist because of foreign companies investing in our country.''
 Many of the doubts about the potential of such a cross-continental alliance, political leaders in Michigan say, are fueled by lingering bitterness over the 1998 merger of Chrysler and Daimler-Benz. 
 Initially promoted as a ''merger of equals,'' the deal was essentially a German takeover of Chrysler, then the No. 3 American auto company. This spring, Chrysler slipped to fourth place, behind Toyota, which has been planning to expand its presence in North America by adding factories.
 ''The Chrysler thing has left everybody here with a very bad taste in their mouth,'' Mr. Dingell said.
 Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm has joined those who have raised questions about an automotive alliance. Soon after Mr. Kerkorian sent letters on June 30 to the three companies suggesting that they explore an alliance, the governor told The Detroit News, ''Our history has been what is good for G.M. is good for Michigan,'' and then added: 
 ''This is serious business. This is our major employer. Show me this is good for Michigan. Show me this won't send jobs to France or Japan. Show me how this helps us and I'll be on board.''
 The governor's spokeswoman, Elizabeth Boyd, said this week that she planned to closely monitor negotiations to ensure that a deal would not be detrimental to Michigan. 
 Ms. Boyd said Governor Granholm's concerns did not conflict with her determined lobbying of Toyota and other Japanese companies, whom she visited in Japan this spring, her second visit there in less than a year. ''We welcome foreign investment,'' Ms. Boyd said.
 Richard M. DeVos, the probable Republican challenger to Governor Granholm, also wants to ensure that the talks do not lead to more job losses, his campaign spokesman, John Truscott, said. Mr. DeVos, whose father founded Amway, is concerned that G.M. might effectively be run far from Detroit if Renault and Nissan were to eventually control the company. ''When you lose control of the headquarters, you lose the heart and soul of the company,'' Mr. Truscott said this week.
 Rarely mentioned in discussions of the alliance is that Nissan has a technical center and design studio in affluent Oakland County, Mich., an area northwest of Detroit that has a large population of Japanese-born residents. Nissan says its technical center employs 474 people and represents an $80 million investment.
 The county, where G.M. has car and truck factories as well as a truck development center, is staking much of its future on high-technology installations like Nissan's, said Doug Smith, the Oakland County director of economic development. 
 ''If anything, I would think that you're going to see the investment here even greater because this is where both Nissan and G.M. are,'' Mr. Smith said. ''I think we'd see growth, not retraction, if the two companies join together.''
 A partnership, though, would increase the uncertainty felt by members of the United Automobile Workers, who face the loss of 60,000 jobs at G.M. and Ford over the next few years, said Gary Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. 
 This week, the U.A.W. president, Ron Gettelfinger, said the proposed alliance ''raises very serious concerns'' for his union, which he said was a major stakeholder in G.M.'s future. 
 A sore point for the U.A.W. has been the active role of Carlos Ghosn, the Nissan chief, in defeating an organizing drive in 2001 at Nissan's plant in Smyrna, Tenn., one of several union drives there that have failed over the years. In a campaign denounced by union leaders as one of ''fear and intimidation,'' Mr. Ghosn sent workers a videotape urging them to continue the relationship they had with the company.
 ''Ghosn's view of the U.A.W. is essentially as a drag on the company,'' Mr. Chaison said.
 For his part, Mr. Gettelfinger said this week he was ''not confident'' that the alliance would come about.

HEADLINE: Judge Rules a Tax Shelter In KPMG Case Is Legitimate

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
A federal judge in Texas ruled yesterday that a questionable tax shelter was essentially legitimate, dealing a setback to the government's crackdown on aggressive shelters.
 The civil ruling, by Judge T. John Ward of United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, is notable because the shelter, called Blips, is at the center of a large criminal tax case in a Manhattan federal court that prosecutors have brought against former employees of the accounting firm KPMG.
His ruling could potentially weaken that case, which is the government's largest criminal tax case ever. It could also complicate the continuing criminal investigation of the role that Deutsche Bank played in a variety of aggressive tax shelters, including Blips. 
 Judge Ward's decision does not spell the end of the civil case in Texas, which was brought against the government by two prominent Texas lawyers, Harold W. Nix and C. Cary Patterson. The two men sued the Internal Revenue Service in late 2004 for refunds after the tax agency denied each of their claims for nearly $67 million in deductions stemming from their use of the tax shelter in 2000. Mr. Nix and Mr. Patterson were part of a team of lawyers that won the $17 billion tobacco settlement for Texas in 1998. 
 A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment yesterday on the ruling. Donald L. Korb, the I.R.S.'s chief counsel, said in a statement that the agency ''was still studying the opinion.'' 
 The I.R.S. considers tax shelters with no economic substance or business purpose to be invalid. The judge did not rule yesterday on whether Blips meets those terms; that will be decided when the case involving Mr. Nix and Mr. Patterson goes to trial in October. Rather, he ruled that Blips was valid because the I.R.S. overstepped its authority.
 Blips stands for bond-linked investment premium structure. It involves investors taking out bank loans, which the government contends are not legitimate, and then shifting them to partnerships to claim tax losses. 
 Blips were among the most widely sold aggressive shelters of the mid to late 1990's. It was created by KPMG with Deutsche Bank and an investment firm called Presidio Advisory Services, according to internal Deutsche Bank documents that have been previously disclosed. Other banks, including the HVB Group and, in the case of the two Texas lawyers, National Westminster, also worked on and sold such shelters, according to court papers.
 The heart of Judge Ward's ruling was that the I.R.S.'s retroactive use of tougher Treasury Department rules in 2003 on liabilities like those in Blips was ''ineffective'' and ''not enforceable'' because it was retroactive. The Internal Revenue Code generally prohibits retroactive regulations. The I.R.S. said in 2000 that it would formally challenge Blips deductions claimed by taxpayers. 
 Jerrold Cohen, a lawyer in Atlanta for Mr. Nix and Mr. Patterson, said yesterday that Judge Ward's ruling showed that ''the government isn't allowed to change the rules just because it doesn't like the result.''
 Prosecutors in the KPMG case have indicated that they will argue that the shelter itself was technically valid, but that the way the defendants carried it out was not. Lawyers for the defendants argue that no court of law has ever ruled that Blips, or the other shelters in question, was illegal. 
 Judge Ward's ruling also potentially raises questions about an I.R.S. settlement in 2004 that raised $3.7 billion in unpaid taxes from 1,200 investors in Blips and similar shelters. It may raise questions over KPMG's admission last August of criminal wrongdoing with Blips and three other shelters as part of its $456 million deferred-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 26, 2006

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Friday about a court decision on a tax shelter case in Texas misstated the ruling at one point in some copies. The judge effectively found the shelter valid -- not invalid.

HEADLINE: As Oil Rises, Will Economy Finally Fall? 

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
WHEN oil almost hit $40 a barrel in 2003, there was talk that the rising cost of gasoline would slow the American economy. The talk returned when oil topped $50 in 2004 and $60 last year. But the economy kept on growing at a good clip.
 Now, with oil above $70, some seem to think the logic was simply wrong, and that the new American economy is impervious to oil. 
 A differing interpretation, with the same conclusion, was that oil shocks matter only if they come from supply cutbacks, not from added demand. Just why the reason for higher prices should matter to consumers was not clear, but it provided comfort, as did assertions that oil prices are far higher than they ''should'' be, driven up by speculators and sure to fall some day.
 If you believe all that, you can forget about the bad old days when troubles in the Middle East led to soaring oil prices that produced recessions and led Jimmy Carter to don a cardigan while calling for conservation. Calls for saving oil now are halfhearted at best, particularly since the already reeling American automakers would be even worse off if consumers abandoned sport utility vehicles. Highway speed limits, cut to 55 miles an hour then to save oil, are now being raised in some states. 
 Certainly the economy is less dependent on oil than it was 30 years ago. It is more of a service economy, and the strides in fuel efficiency made in the 1980's have endured to some degree. Even now, energy spending does not take nearly as large a share of consumers' budgets as it did after the first oil shock.
 Oil is, however, a product that may have more than one market equilibrium price, simply because price changes do not affect demand or supply very much in the short term. In 1973, an oil embargo brought on by the Arab defeat in the Yom Kippur War suddenly showed that oil producers could charge a lot more than they had been receiving. The ratcheting up of prices since 2003 -- without recession -- has shown the same thing.
 That means oil prices are not likely to plunge, at least until something is done to restrain demand significantly. That something could be an economic slowdown, in the West or in Asia, or it could be new technologies that cut energy use.
 The markets have largely accepted that. On the day in 2004 that oil first hit $50, the futures market expected prices to be down more than 20 percent within two years. Now, it thinks prices will rise a little over the next two years.
 One factor that kept the American economy rolling despite rising oil prices was the willingness of consumers to stop saving and to use money from rising home values to support consumption. 
 Now it appears that housing is sinking. New-home starts are down, but still much higher than you would expect from looking at either home builder stock prices -- down 40 percent in a year -- or the index of sentiment maintained by the National Association of Home Builders.
 That index is down 45 percent in a year, and is at its lowest level since 1991. In the Northeast, where markets were among the most overheated, the drop has been even sharper. That the economy is slowing is getting clearer. Paul Kasriel of Northern Trust notes that retail sales in the second quarter, adjusted for inflation, fell more than in any quarter since 1991. 
 Even the Federal Reserve may be growing worried. Its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told the Senate on Wednesday that he thought a slowing economy might enable inflation to cool without more tightening. That sent the stock market soaring, although a slowing economy is hardly what investors want.
 But want it or not, we may get it. The impact of the housing slowdown is likely to be greater than in the past because of the strange mortgages -- some without principal payments and some with negative amortization, meaning the amount owed grows every month -- that financed the boom. If interest rates rise and prices fall, some borrowers could find they owe more than the house is worth at a time when the required mortgage payment is set to increase. In this cycle, the economy became far more dependent on a strong housing market than ever before. If people can't take more money out of their homes, and must pay more for gas, they may have no choice but to buy less of everything else.
 And those who said high oil prices would hurt the economy would turn out to have been right, even if their timing was wrong.

HEADLINE: Experts on Demand: A Match Made on Wall Street 

BYLINE: By Jenny Anderson

 BODY:
HERE'S a riddle: How does Wall Street help its clients secure fresh, proprietary information from primary sources without facilitating the exchange of material nonpublic information? 
 It's an age-old question with new-age problems -- or opportunities -- depending on whose seat you are sitting in.
Consider Primary Insight, a service that Bear Stearns introduced in December, a sort of match.com for investors and information sources for their investment ideas. Its goal was simple: get money managers (Bear Stearns clients) information from the trenches by creating a network of experts to provide it. 
 Need to know how people are responding to a recently introduced drug? Bear Stearns might find a doctor who has prescribed it. Want to find out how satellite technology works? The firm could find you an engineer or consultant familiar with it. 
 Primary Insight is not the first of its kind. The Gerson Lehrman Group, an independent firm based in New York, is the leader in developing expert networks, using its extensive web of contacts for everything from telephone consultations to industry surveys. 
 Gerson's idea was an immediate success. In 2002, banks cut back sharply on research budgets after the economy stumbled and regulators outlawed subsidies for research from investment banking. At the same time, the explosion of hedge funds resulted in more research analysts inside hedge funds looking for more experts to help evaluate ideas. 
 But Primary Insight raises some red flags. Who are the experts, and how does Bear Stearns guarantee that it isn't creating a drive-through window for insider trading? The bank is connecting information-hungry clients -- with whom it hopes to do multiple forms of business -- with experts, who if truly expert, could be in possession of material nonpublic information. 
 The product comes at a time when regulators are particularly concerned about information flows and information ''leakage'' in banks. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at whether information about client trading is used by a bank's proprietary traders. The S.E.C. is also looking at whether banks are using valuable information about customer order flow and ideas -- expert or otherwise -- to win coveted hedge fund business. 
 Bear Stearns is not the first bank to wade into the expert network waters. Goldman Sachs considered buying Gerson Lehrman more than three years ago. Those negotiations ended over pricing and other issues. 
 Starting with health care, Primary Insight has expanded into more than half a dozen other areas, including technology, telecommunications, energy and industrial. The bank has a contract with its clients and a set of terms and conditions with its experts. Among those conditions are a requirement that the expert has to attest to the fact that he or she has permission to be paid for offering advice. 
 According to a Bear Stearns official, there are two checks to make sure everything is above board. First, there are the contracts and terms and conditions. Second, before the group sets up a call between client and expert, it makes sure both parties are comfortable with the topic. Clients receive a Primary Insight bill that is separate from any other transactions with the bank.
 The group has a separate management structure, and it is not situated near the trading desk or the investment banking division, where potential conflicts would be most apparent. 
 It is unclear if there are enough controls to comfort clients. Gerson has used its place in the market to build certain protections against the risk of insider trading: companies that prohibit their employees from participating as experts are blocked from the system through technology the company has developed. Compliance officers have been part of the technology development program on the idea that money managers will buy it if they are convinced that it will not create more problems than it solves. 
 In its health care group, Gerson has its doctors register conflicts down to every drug or device. Perhaps most important, Gerson can write the following statement on its Web site: ''G.L.G. does not write reports or take published positions, make product recommendations or offer investment advice.'' 
 Bear Stearns, however, is a prime broker to scores of hedge funds, managing their accounts and financing their trades; a broker to them, executing their trades; a provider of research, giving ideas to money managers. Add to that matchmaker. 
 Gerson Lehrman's success shows how much research has changed: investors are doing more for themselves and Wall Street is looking for ways to capitalize on that. Many research analysts in the big banks complain today that they are little more than a glorified concierge service, arranging meetings between management and clients. 
 Wall Street executives are always quick to say that their business is one of managing conflicts. The success or failure of Primary Insight will offer some insight into whether it is managing this one well.

HEADLINE: Bearing Fine English Silver For Rich Russian Nobles 

BYLINE: By Wendy Moonan

 BODY:
The age of exploration produced several theories about the fastest way to reach China. Just 59 years after Columbus discovered America by sailing west on his quest to find China and India, the British Society of Merchant-Adventurers joined together to finance an expedition to find a faster passage via a northeastern sea route. Two years later three British ships sailed north of Norway and into the Barents Sea, where they were scattered in a storm. One ended up in the White Sea, just northwest of Russia. It docked at the mouth of the Dvina River.
 There natives led an officer, Richard Chancellor, and his crew all the way to Moscow, where Czar Ivan IV (''the Terrible'') received them in the Kremlin. Thus began a century of tempestuous Anglo-Russian diplomatic and commercial relations, often marked by sumptuous silver gifts from the English crown to the Russian court. 
About 80 of these treasures, on loan from the Armory Museum of the Kremlin, can be seen in ''Britannia & Muscovy: English Silver at the Court of the Tsars,'' an exhibition at the Yale Center for British Art through Sept. 10.
 Most extravagant are 36 splendid pieces made by English craftsmen from the 1550's to the 1660's, including gilded Renaissance-style cups, a leopard-shaped flagon, heavily embellished basins, intricately wrought salt cellars and silver-inlaid hunting rifles.
 ''We wanted people to understand how ceremonial objects helped to craft diplomatic and trade relations in the early modern period,'' said Amy Meyers, the director of the Yale museum in New Haven. ''The political and economic ramifications of those human relations are still relevant.''
 The Armory Museum has 500 pieces of antique English silver; 100 are from the late-Tudor and early-Stuart eras.
 ''It is one of the world's largest collections of English silver from this period,'' Natalya Abramova, a curator of the Moscow Kremlin Museums, writes in the show catalog.
 What makes it, and the show, significant is how rare this early English silver is; it is not a type represented in European and American museums.
 ''It just doesn't exist,'' said Cassandra Albinson, assistant curator of paintings and sculpture at the Yale Center. ''Much of the silver that stayed in England was melted down due to changes in fashion or other kinds of changes, such as the political upheavals during the English Civil War.''
 Silver was also sold to raise cash.
 ''War consumed silver,'' Philippa Glanville, a British silver specialist, writes in the catalog. Charles I, for example, pawned his mother's tablewares and sold some of Henry VIII's royal treasure to finance a war against Spain.
 Nearly all the pieces in the show were originally given in pairs. (Only half of each pair is shown at Yale.)
 ''The idea of symmetry is very important in the way things would have been displayed at the Russian court,'' Ms. Albinson said. ''Silver was placed at different heights in cupboards or on buffets to make it more pleasing to the eye.'' Almost none of it was ever used.
 This is silver meant to impress by its sheer scale, its intricate decoration and its gilding. Its motifs are distinctly English, covered with engraved floral decorations (Tudor roses, English daisies, pinks and lily of the valley) and maritime elements appropriate to a naval power (shells, dolphins, mythological Tritons and sea monsters). 
 ''Oftentimes, an English ambassador would organize a procession through the streets of Moscow, so the people could see the gifts,'' Ms. Albinson said. The parade of gifts might be accompanied by a flourish of trumpets or the firing of cannon, captains on horseback, foot soldiers in caftans and hundreds of officials wearing exotic textiles. 
 The spectacle became increasingly elaborate as it approached the czar's throne inside the Kremlin. Ritual was important at the Russian court. (The ruler was titled czar to recall Caesar of Rome.) 
 Chancellor, the explorer, also noted in a written account the ''exceeding great'' wealth and exoticism of the czar's court.
 ''Chancellor's overall impression was of 'pomp and magnificence,' '' Olga Dmitrieva, a history professor at Moscow State University, writes in the catalog. ''Yet in the 16th century, the image of the Russian Tsar -- the architecture and decoration of his residence, the appearance of his court -- combined both European and Asian features. Their influence by the rich ceremonial traditions of Byzantium, the Orient and Renaissance Europe endured.''
 Chancellor left Moscow in 1555 after persuading Ivan to grant English merchants the exclusive right to trade within the realm of Muscovy, a grand duchy including Moscow. 
 His mission had been a success. Back home, the Muscovy Company was formed under royal charter to conduct trade and represent the crown in Russia, presaging the British East India Company, which came later. 
 Chancellor returned to Russia. Ivan in turn dispatched his first embassy to England in 1557, with requests for English doctors, craftsmen and ''workers in gold and silver.'' 
 Ivan became an Anglophile. And why not? The magnificent silver gifts kept coming with English emissaries. Ultimately, he exchanged a hundred letters with his ''dear sister'' Queen Elizabeth I.
 At some point he suggested a military alliance between the two countries (to counter threats to Russia from Sweden, Poland and Lithuania) and was angered by Elizabeth's lack of interest.
 Elizabeth in turn was once so put off by a Russian ambassador who she felt favored the Dutch that she would receive him only in a cabbage patch.
 ''Such a reception, not surprisingly led to indignation in Moscow,'' Irina Zagorodnaya, a curator at the Moscow Kremlin Museums, writes in the catalog.
 Trade matters went better. In 1584 the English established Archangel, a port on the Dvina River, where they built factories and warehouses. They sold English wool and linen, medicine and scientific instruments. (The heavy uniforms often seen on Russian soldiers in old-master paintings were made of English wool.)
 The English, makers of the finest firearms in Europe, also sold guns, lead, tin, gunpowder and ammunition.
 What the English bought were goods vital to their navy: tall timber for ship masts and hemp for rope. 
 The show at Yale, which includes related manuscripts, books, maps, textiles and letters, travels to the Gilbert Collection in London in October.

HEADLINE: Seeing Art: What's It Worth To You?

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt's economics column appears on Wednesdays in the business section. Email: leonhardt@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
HANGING above each of the four ticket kiosks in the Great Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, nestled between two Ionic columns, is an illuminated menu of prices. Adults, the menu says, cost $15, at least until Aug. 1, when the price will rise to $20. ''Seniors'' and students are $10. 
 Above the prices, in type so small as to be unreadable from the back of a long line of ticket buyers, is a single italicized word: ''Recommended.''
 For years, the word was ''Suggested,'' a choice that museum officials considered gentler than ''recommended'' and more likely to make visitors feel comfortable about paying less than $15. Several years ago, however, they changed it to the more persuasive version. This is the Met's take on a business strategy known as variable pricing. Airlines give discounts to travelers who go to the trouble of buying their tickets well in advance and staying over a Saturday night. A growing number of movie theaters charge less to people willing to see films on weeknights. Book publishers demand less money from readers who don't need to read a book as soon as it comes out and who don't have a problem with a flimsy paper cover. 
 The Met, for its part, has the most flexible arrangement, even if it is relegated to the fine print. The museum charges less -- as little as 1 cent -- to any visitor willing to swallow hard, risk the disapproving glance of a ticket agent and pay less.
 But the point of all these versions of variable pricing is the same. The people selling the product want to attract as large a crowd as they can while still getting the maximum amount of money from each customer. 
 So they set up inconveniences, like the disapproving glance or the Saturday night stay over, that they know bargain hunters will accept in exchange for a discount. The full price -- the one that would scare away bargain hunters if it were the only option -- is reserved for customers able to pay for convenience. 
 The Met announced the increase in its recommended price last week, and it made a lot of art lovers decidedly grumpy. How, they ask, can a museum whose mission is to bring art to the people charge so much? One artist called the increase ''outrageous and wrong,'' telling The New York Times that working-class people were too intimidated by museums to give anything less than the recommended price.
 And there's something to this argument. Sticker prices do matter, even when there are discounts. A lot of poor students don't consider applying to Harvard (listed tuition and fees: $43,655) even though they can now attend the university free of charge. From the outside it's also impossible to know whether the Met has done everything it can to hold down administrative expenses. But it seems beyond dispute that running a museum costs more than it used to. Insurance premiums rose sharply after Sept. 11, 2001, and again after the recent hurricanes. The costs of providing health insurance for employees and of heating and cooling the museum's vast spaces have also jumped.
 So before denouncing the Met's new policy, it's worth considering what the alternatives are. There is no such thing, after all, as a free museum. No matter what the price on the ticket reads, somebody is paying to buy, preserve, protect and display all those van Goghs and Giacomettis. One option is for taxpayers to pick up the bill, in the form of government subsidies. New York City already covers about 13 percent of the Met's $180 million in annual operating expenses, and it -- or the state or federal government -- could theoretically pay the rest as well. 
 This plan, however, seems about as wise as it is likely to happen. If those of us who visit the Met aren't willing to pay for its operation, why should people who don't visit it be asked to pay? Schools, hospitals and roads, all of which could use the money, certainly seem like they should have first claim on the population's collected earnings.
 Another solution would be to find some wealthy benefactors to put up $10 billion or so and make the museum free forever. This too already happens in a more limited way: without the big donations the Met receives, ticket prices would be even higher than they are. But not many people have $10 billion to give away, and it's hard to argue that Warren Buffett made a bad decision when he chose to concentrate his fortune on treating AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
 So that leaves the money from tickets -- and, yes, higher prices than in the past -- to make sure that the Met remains the Met, an institution that appears on any serious list of the world's greatest museums. And once ticket prices have to be involved, there is a certain beauty to the Met's system.
 A large majority of visitors have a bachelor's degree or will get one, according to the museum's research, making them part of the white-collar economy that has done quite well in recent years. Many of them can afford $20 for an afternoon of entertainment. Many of them, in fact, already pay $20 for a ticket to the Museum of Modern Art, $100 for a Yankee Stadium box seat or $110 for an orchestra seat to ''Wicked.'' In a way the new price is like a progressive tax.
 Those who doesn't feel comfortable with it can simply pay the old one, or whatever they would like. There will surely be some well-to-do freeloaders, visitors who pay $1 when they could easily pay $20, but if there were too many of them, the Met's policy never would have survived this long.
 ''It's an imperfect system,'' said Judith Chevalier, a Yale economist who studies pricing, ''but I'm not exactly sure what a better one is.''
 The easiest way to see the virtues of variable prices is sometimes to think about what would happen in their absence. Last week the nearby Neue Galerie said it would charge $50, up from the usual $15, to patrons who wanted to view five Klimt paintings on Wednesdays, a day the gallery is usually closed. A few days later, it abandoned the plan in the face of a public outcry.
 So think about what happens now. People who would have paid the $50 and gone on a Wednesday will instead go on other, more crowded days, causing everyone to have less space to enjoy the Klimts. The museum, meanwhile, will bring in less money. Precisely nobody benefits from the cancellation of the $50 tickets.
 That said, there still is one way the Met could improve its new admission policy. It could rededicate itself to ensuring that price is not a barrier to the museum's treasures, by reaching out to people who are intimidated by the $20 list price. For starters the museum could change the little word on those signs in the Great Hall from ''recommended'' back to ''suggested.'' 
 Just a suggestion.

Broadway

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

*'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

* 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, special theatrical event, 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (George Hunka)

'THE FIELD' John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE HOUSE IN TOWN' A wan new drama by Richard Greenberg about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, in 1929. A miscast Jessica Hecht stars as Amy Hammer, a well-to-do housewife sliding into despair as her remote husband looks on in frustration. Doug Hughes's production is pretty but desultory, as is Mr. Greenberg's typically eloquent but atypically empty writing (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diazand Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00).Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)

* 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this old comedy from the 1930's, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444.(Neil Genzlinger)

* 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th-century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with elan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'SUSAN AND GOD' The Mint Theater Company's fine revival of Rachel Crothers's 1937 comedy about religion, career and family features Leslie Hendrix of ''Law & Order,'' excellent in the role of Susan. Jonathan Bank directs (2:20). The Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, third floor, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Hunka)

'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)

'TREASON' The poet Ezra Pound was a repellent fellow, judging from this play by Sallie Bingham: racist, anti-Semitic, eager to exploit the affections of the women who loved him. Just why women were drawn to him is never clear, but the play is thoughtful, and the acting, especially by Philip Pleasants as Pound, is superb (2:10). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger)

Off Off Broadway

'CHEKHOV & MARIA' Jovanka Bach's final play is a touching, beautifully acted if sometimes slow-paced study of Anton Chekhov's near-final days and his relationship with his sister, who cared for him (2:00). Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Gates)

'FOOD FOR FISH' Adam Szymkowicz's fabulously weird and weirdly fabulous new comedy fools around with cross-dressing, suicidal writers and Chekhovian characters who long for New Jersey (2:00). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, between Second and Third Avenues, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)

Long-Running Shows

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of cliches set to music by Earth, Wind & Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street; (212) 307-4100; closing Sunday. (Isherwood)

'MANHATTAN MADCAPS of 1924' A not-very-madcap story is indeed included, but this is essentially a revue made of up of Rodgers and Hart songs, many of them fairly obscure. Better singing voices in the cast might help show them off to fuller advantage; as it is, the main attraction is a trio of songs with unfamiliar lyrics, but a very familiar tune: the one that, on the fourth try, became ''Blue Moon'' (1:20). Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)

'SCHOOL OF THE AMERICAS' Jose Rivera, who wrote the screenplay for ''The Motorcycle Diaries,'' penned this rickety piece of historical speculation about the final two days of Che Guevara's life (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday.(Jason Zinoman)

'SHAKESPEARE IS DEAD' Orran Farmer's two-character drama about a struggling playwright and a drug-addicted actress-stripper is well-meaning, but tedious and often trite (1:00). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Gates)

'TROUBLE IN PARADISE' Ernst Lubitsch's 1932 film comedy about a con man, the con woman he loves and a wealthy Parisian widow lives again as a giddy, good-looking, quietly amusing play (1:30). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Gates)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)

* 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis)

'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)

'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)

'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)

* 'CHANGING TIMES' (No rating, 95 minutes, in French and Arabic) Gerard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve star in Andre Techine's rich, warmhearted exploration of cultural collision in contemporary Tangier. A half-dozen skillfully interwoven subplots create a set of variations on the theme of divided sensibilities tugging one another into states of perpetual unrest and possible happiness. (Stephen Holden)

* 'LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR MAN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) This enthralling documentary combines pieces of an extended interview with Mr. Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter, poet and author, now 71, with a tribute concert at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005. Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Martha Wainwright and Antony are among the featured performers. (Holden)

'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)

'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)

'EDMOND' (R, 76 minutes) William H. Macy gives what may be the performance of his career in the faithful screen adaptation of David Mamet's raw, epithet-spattered spiritual fable about a buttoned-up milquetoast who heeds his inner demons and plummets into free fall; hateful and unforgettable. (Holden)

* 'EXCELLENT CADAVERS' (No rating, 92 minutes, in English and Italian) Based on the book by Alexander Stille, this tough, brisk documentary follows Mr. Stille to Italy, where he reconstructs the recent history of the Italian mafia, focusing on the careers of two courageous prosecutors who took on organized crime and the political system that protected it. (Scott)

'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Nathan Lee)

'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES' (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis)

* 'GABRIELLE' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chereau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haute bourgeoisie Parisian marriage, circa 1912. (Dargis)

'THE GROOMSMEN' (R, 93 minutes) Just when it seems Edward Burns might have pulled off an American ''I Vitelloni,'' his X-ray vision into life in an Irish-American enclave in New York glazes over and he resolves his characters' anxiety and despair with tearful hugs and phony reassurances. (Holden)

* 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-age white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden)

'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden)

'KILL YOUR IDOLS' (No rating, 71 minutes) S. A. Crary's glib, unfocused music documentary examines the New York No Wave scene of the late 1970's -- an offshoot of punk, the anti-New Wave -- when the music was noisy (and genuinely noncommercial) and the clothes were black (and genuinely secondhand). (Dargis)

'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott)

'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Lee)

'MINI'S FIRST TIME' (R, 91 minutes) Yet another poor little rich girl tends to her festering inner wounds by becoming one of Southern California's children of the damned. Nikki Reed stars alongside the slumming likes of Alec Baldwin, Carrie-Anne Moss, Jeff Goldblum and Luke Wilson. (Dargis)

* 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carriere's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden)

* 'THE OH IN OHIO' (No rating, 91 minutes) A feel-good movie about feeling good, this fresh and very funny sex comedy stars Parker Posey as a woman in search of an orgasm, Paul Rudd as her frustrated husband and a delirious supporting cast: Danny DeVito as a swimming pool salesman, Heather Graham as a sex shop clerk and Liza Minnelli as a masturbation guru who encourages frigid women to ''liberate your labia!'' (Lee)

* 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis)

'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)

'PEACEFUL WARRIOR' (PG-13, 120 minutes) As ludicrous as the title promises yet supremely unembarrassed, this New Age enlightenment parable has its heart in the right place, but a mind of corny mush. (Lee)

'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST' Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott)

* 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)

'THE ROAD TO GUANTANAMO' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom's powerful, slippery new film mixes documentary and fictional techniques to tell the true story of three British Muslims imprisoned by the United States government in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. (Scott)

'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden)

'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis)

'71 FRAGMENTS OF A CHRONOLOGY OF CHANCE' (No rating, 95 minutes) This 1994 film from that great provocateur Michael Haneke follows a handful of seemingly unrelated characters, all of whom -- perhaps by chance, perhaps by divine intervention, though mostly through artistic contrivance -- have the grave misfortune to be in an Austrian bank when a student starts unloading his revolver. (Dargis)

'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)

'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)

'WAIST DEEP' (R, 97 minutes) Tyrese Gibson plays an ex-convict trying to rescue his son from ruthless criminal kidnappers in this far-from-terrible B movie, directed with style and heart by Vondie Curtis Hall. (Scott)

'WASSUP ROCKERS' (R, 105 minutes) The latest provocation from the director and photographer Larry Clark follows a group of teenage Hispanic skateboarders from South Central Los Angeles on a 24-hour adventure that takes them from one hell (the inner city) to another (decadent Beverly Hills) and back. (Holden)

* 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. ( Dargis)

'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)

YOU, ME AND DUPREE' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Owen Wilson stars as the dude who comes to dinner and stays way past dessert in Joe and Anthony Russo's generally unfunny comedy. A fine Matt Dillon and a decorative Kate Hudson also star, rather more wanly. (Dargis)

DICKEY BETTS AND GREAT SOUTHERN (Wednesday) Kicked out of the Allman Brothers, a band he founded, the guitarist Dickey Betts wasted no time in going back on tour with his own group. His chiming, symmetrical guitar solos and the weary but amiable voice from songs like ''Blue Skies'' are intact, and he may even have something to prove. With Kenny Wayne Shepherd. At 9:30 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $52. (Jon Pareles)

MARY J. BLIGE (Tonight) Mary J. Blige has long been emoting through hip-hop and soul for ''all my sisters, my troubled sisters.'' Her latest, ''The Breakthrough'' (Geffen), also finds her in a duet with U2. (She steals the show.) With Jaheim and LeToya. At 8, Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $59.50 to $129.50. (Ben Sisario)

* BRAND NEW (Thursday) This Long Island emo band made a quantum leap with its second album three years ago, from whiny and unchallenging breakup songs to tangles of explosive melody with brooding, sometimes horrific lyrics. What the band will come up with on the as-yet-unscheduled album No. 3 is a subject of intense speculation among fans, who quickly snatched up all tickets for this tour. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario)

JIM CAMPILONGO, JESSE HARRIS, MIKE VIOLA (Monday) Just another night at the Living Room, a plain Lower East Side cabaret that puts on one guitar-cradling singer-songwriter after another, some of them world-class. Mr. Campilongo is a well-traveled guitar whiz who plays with Norah Jones in her country band the Little Willies; here he leads his Electric Trio. Jesse Harris, who wrote Ms. Jones's hit ''Don't Know Why,'' sings in the graceful and guileless manner of Paul Simon and James Taylor when on his own. Mike Viola, jumping from piano to guitar, sings strident power-pop with some jagged wit. At 9 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235; no cover. (Sisario)

* CAT POWER (Tuesday) For her most recent album, ''The Greatest'' (Matador), Chan Marshall, the superbly rueful singer known as Cat Power, recorded with a group of veteran Memphis soul players, yielding some of the most stirring -- and happiest -- music of her career. Performing solo, she is spellbindingly intense and mercurial. At 8 p.m., Hiro Ballroom at the Maritime Hotel, 371 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-4300; $20. (Sisario)

CHEB I SABBAH (Tomorrow) Indian devotional music meets the beat, now and then, in the music of DJ Cheb I Sabbah, who swirls together various styles into heady meditations. He is joined on vocals by the singer Riffat Salamat Sultana, daughter of the Pakistani singer Ustad Salamat Ali Khan. At 7 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested. (Pareles)

BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package.(Stephen Holden)

DON CABALLERO (Tonight) In the mid-1990's, Don Caballero, from Pittsburgh, was one of a handful of overachieving guitar bands whose knotty, laser-precise and deliberately undanceable instrumentals exemplified the fittingly named subgenre math-rock. The band broke up six years ago, but its drummer, Damon Che, has repopulated it with new players; its new album, ''World Class Listening Problem'' (Relapse), suggests that there was more to the old group's appeal than just math. With Blind Idiot God, Alger Hiss, Houston McCoy and the Victoria Lucas. At 8, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $13. (Sisario)

'DOT DASH YEAR IV' (Thursday) Each summer Dot Dash, a little concert promoter in Brooklyn devoted to punk and garage-rock, throws a festival with some big-deal reunions -- big deals in the small and passionate world of garage-rock, anyway. This year its three-day series begins on Thursday with the return of the Dicks, a Texas band from the early 1980's that sang ragged and churlish complaints with titles like ''Hate the Police.'' Also on the bill are the Marked Men, the Carbonas and Live Fast Die. The highlight of the festival will be an appearance by Rocket From the Tombs on July 29. At 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $17. (Sisario)

EARLY MAN, BAD WIZARD, 3 INCHES OF BLOOD (Tuesday) The best retro bands do not just conjure up an old artist or even a specific era, but freely toy with their influences to suggest a past that never quite existed. Three Inches of Blood updates the galloping, swords-and-goblins rock of early-1980's groups like Iron Maiden and Manowar with harsh streaks of violence that recall later death-metal. Early Man, on its debut album, ''Closing In'' (Matador), begins in the comforting mud of Black Sabbath and ends airborne, with a speed and control that comes down from Metallica. Also on the bill is Bad Wizard, whose plodding re-creations of Grand Funk Railroad and Kiss illustrate a less imaginative kind of retro-rock. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sisario)

MELISSA ETHERIDGE (Monday through Wednesday) Love takes on heroic dimensions in the songs of Melissa Etheridge. She puts her own mark on the brawny guitar riffs and raspy-voiced melodies of 1980's heartland rock, as adoring audiences sing along. At 8 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $39.50 to $104.50. (Pareles)

GOLDEN SMOG (Wednesday) Even heartsick alt-country has its celebrity supergroups. Golden Smog includes Jeff Tweedy of Wilco, Dan Murphy of Soul Asylum, Gary Louris and Marc Perlman of the Jayhawks, and Kraig Johnson of Run Westy Run. Opening the show is David Poe, a singer and guitarist, whose wit and sparkle come through largely between songs. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario)

HOLD STEADY (Thursday) Like the E Street Band fronted by Shane MacGowan of the Pogues, the Hold Steady -- from Brooklyn, though with Minneapolis origins -- plays bare-knuckled guitar-rock while its singer, Craig Finn, free-associates about religion and sex in a boozy snarl. ''I guess I heard about original sin,'' he growls. ''I heard the dude blamed the chick.'' At 7 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789. Free; tickets available at 5 p.m., two per person. (Sisario)

JONATHAN KANE (Tomorrow) John Lee Hooker meets La Monte Young in the droning, bluesy incantations of Mr. Kane, a mainstay in the downtown avant-garde scene who has played drums with Swans, Rhys Chatham and Gary Lucas. He has a drummer's sense of steady dynamic development and an unapologetic love of noise. He plays two shows. At 2 p.m., with Dragons of Zynth, Home and Taiko Masala, East River Amphitheater, East River Park, south of Delancey Street, Lower East Side, ermp.org; free. At 9 p.m., with Golden Tongues, Mahi Mahi and Ambitious Orchestra, Sin-e, 150 Attorney Street, Lower East Side, (212) 388-0077; $10. (Sisario)

* JASON LYTLE (Tomorrow and Monday) In Grandaddy, Mr. Lytle sang as if he were Neil Young trapped inside a computer chip: with a voice tiny and yet infinite, yearning to be fully human yet stuck within the strictures of the information age. Grandaddy recently released its final album, ''Just Like the Fambly Cat'' (V2), but it is an unsatisfying epitaph; fans will crowd these rare solo shows for hints of a new direction. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Monday at 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sisario)

MALDITA VECINDAD, KONONO NO. 1, DAARA J (Sunday) What do a ska-flavored Mexican hard-rock band, a Congolese group that makes trance music from amplified thumb pianos and a Senegalese rap trio have in common? Not much except that they can all be lumped into the world-music category, however puzzlingly. Maldita Vecindad paints its ska rhythms with ominous, distorted metal. Konono No. 1 titled one album ''Congotronics,'' an apt term for its polyrhythmic bubblings of amplified likembes -- hand-held thumb pianos made from thin strips of medal. Daara J speed-raps in at least four languages: English, French, Spanish and Wolof. At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested. Maldita Vecindad also plays Sunday night at S.O.B.'s, and Konono No. 1 plays there on Monday. At 8 and 10:30, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $22 in advance, $25 at the door on Sunday; $25 in advance, $28 at the door on Monday. (Sisario)

THOMAS MAPFUMO AND THE BLACKS UNLIMITED (Tuesday) A musical pioneer with a rebel's courage, Thomas Mapfumo made music for the revolutionaries who unseated the white-ruled government from what was Rhodesia and is now Zimbabwe. The music transferred the brisk patterns of traditional thumb-piano music to guitar; the words sometimes sent coded messages. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Pareles)

JOHN MAYALL AND THE BLUESBREAKERS (Tonight) In the 1960's John Mayall ran the premier finishing school for British blues-rock guitarists: at various times his band -- still called the Bluesbreakers despite 40-odd years of lineup changes -- included the young Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor (later of the Rolling Stones) and Peter Green (later of Fleetwood Mac), among others. At 8 and 10:30, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144; $30. (Sisario)

OAKLEY HALL (Tonight) Patient country-folk mutates into dense psychedelic drones in the songs of this Brooklyn band led by Pat Sullivan, a former member of Brooklyn's other masters of psychedelic minimalism, Oneida. With Mike Wexler, Black Taj and Endless Boogie. At 8:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sisario)

* OS MUTANTES (Tonight) The oddest, most exuberant and most wonderfully innovative band of the late-1960's tropicalia movement in Brazil -- when there was no shortage of odd, exuberant and wonderfully innovative musicians -- was Os Mutantes (the Mutants), which filtered American and British psychedelic and garage-rock through bossa nova and a do-what-thou-wilt pop-art philosophy. The band broke up in 1978, and before this brief tour -- with some but not all of its original members -- had never performed in the United States. With Death Vessel. At 6:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $50. (Sisario)

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES, JASON LYTLE (Sunday) In the weeks before the concert giant Live Nation begins to put on big-ticket concerts at the McCarren Park Pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn (its first there is Bloc Party on July 29), a number of smaller, scrappier promoters have been using the space -- a 50,000-square-foot public pool closed since 1984 -- for free shows. Sunday afternoon features Pretty Girls Make Graves, a Seattle band with a knack for angular, heartfelt melodies that cut through clouds of noise; and Mr. Lytle, the lead singer of Grandaddy, who is in town this weekend for a few appearances (see above). With Bon Savants. At 3 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, thepoolparties.com. (Sisario)

RASPUTINA (Tonight) Rasputina is a charmingly improbable project: part Marie Antoinette, part metal. Three women who are cellists in corsets (as well as a drummer) sing about Transylvanian concubines as their music seesaws between elaborate chamber-music counterpoint and grunting hard-rock chords, complete with distortion. At 9, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $20. (Pareles)

BUTCH WALKER AND THE LET'S GO OUT TONITES (Wednesday) Mr. Walker first revealed his fondness for muscular mid-1970's pop-rock and his mocking obsession with stardom as the leader of the Marvelous 3. Now on his own, he hasn't lost his ambition or his sense of irony. With Boys Like Girls and As Fast As. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Pareles)

At 9:30 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $8. (Chinen)

DON BYRON QUARTET (Wednesday through July 30) Mr. Byron is justifiably known for his independent-minded concept albums -- his next one will shine a spotlight on the rhythm-and-blues saxophonist Junior Walker -- but he is, first and foremost, a daring clarinetist. He plays here with several longtime associates: the trumpeter Ralph Alessi, the bassist Lonnie Plaxico and the drummer Billy Hart. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25, $30 on July 28 and 29.

* CELEBRATION OF RAY BARRETTO & HILTON RUIZ (Tuesday through July 30) ''Standards Rican-ditioned,'' recently issued on Zoho Music, was the final studio album of the conga virtuoso Ray Barretto. It also turned out to be the last recorded effort by the pianist Hilton Ruiz. Both were New York-born musicians of Puerto Rican heritage and were pillars of Latin jazz. This tribute, fittingly programmed as the culmination of Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola's monthlong Latin in Manhattan Festival, includes Mr. Barretto's son Chris Barretto, as well as a two more-established saxophonists, Sonny Fortune and David Sanchez. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. with an 11:30 p.m. set July 28 and 29, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P.

ORRIN EVANS QUINTET (Tomorrow) Mr. Evans is a percussive pianist equally attuned to hard bop and hip-hop, and he often surrounds himself with rhythmically assertive sidemen. Here that company includes the saxophonists Abraham Burton and J. D. Allen, the bassist Luques Curtins and the drummer Donald Edwards. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15. (Chinen)

MICHAEL FORMANEK, TIM BERNE, TOM RAINEY (Tomorrow) These three -- respectively a bassist, an alto saxophonist and a drummer -- have worked together often over the years, usually under the leadership of Mr. Berne.

FRED HERSCH TRIO (Wednesday) Mr. Hersch, a pianist strongly associated with solo recitals, leads a trio for this outdoor performance, and not with his usual partners. But the bassist John Hebert and the drummer Eric McPherson should make an excellent rhythm section, and each has experience with Mr. Hersch's literate and cosmopolitan style. At 7 p.m., Madison Square Park, Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street, (212) 538-6667, www.madisonsquarepark.org; free. (Chinen)

At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15. (Chinen)

DONNY MCCASLIN GROUP (Wednesday) As on ''Soar'' (Sunnyside), his most recent album, the tenor-saxophonist Donny McCaslin applies his extroverted style to a Latin American-inspired contemporary fusion, benefiting greatly from the contributions of the guitarist Ben Monder, the bassist Scott Colley and the drummer Antonio Sanchez.

KEVIN NORTON AND JOHN LINDBERG (Wednesday) Mr. Norton is a probing drummer, vibraphonist and composer, although not always in that order; Mr. Lindberg is a versatile and imaginative bassist who also has a way with orchestration. Their interplay promises to be engagingly multilayered. At 8 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)

GREG OSBY QUARTET (Tuesday through July 30) Mr. Osby is an alto saxophonist with a predilection for jagged edges, and yet he's squarely within the jazz tradition.

TIERNEY SUTTON (Wednesday through July 29) Ms. Sutton's clear, sweetly sonorous voice isn't inherently a jazz timbre, but she is irrefutably a jazz singer, as she proved on her fine recent album, ''I'm With the Band'' (Telarc), which was recorded at Birdland. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum.

 * GLIMMERGLASS OPERA (Tonight through Monday, and Thursday) The drive from New York City to the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., typically takes four hours, no matter what route you choose. But it is worth the trip. The company's intimate, airy and well-equipped house is an ideal place to hear opera. And the imaginative productions, which often wind up at New York City Opera, are best seen in their tryouts at Cooperstown. Tomorrow brings the major event of the season: the premiere of Stephen Hartke's opera ''The Greater Good, or the Passion of Boule de Suif.'' Also playing this week are Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Pirates of Penzance'' in a production by Lillian Groag and Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia'' in a production by Leon Major.

(Tommasini)
 * 'HANSEL AND GRETEL' (Monday and Thursday) Humperdinck's orchestration for his opera ''Hansel and Gretel'' is rich and Wagnerian. But in some performances it can overwhelm this lyrical fairy tale. Kathleen Kelly, the music director of the Berkshire Opera, has prepared a chamber orchestra arrangement for that company's new fully staged production of the opera, to be performed in a new English translation by Cori Ellison at the intimate and magnificently restored theater of the Mahaiwe Performing Arts Center in Great Barrington, Mass. Ms. Kelly, an assistant conductor and coach at the Met, conducts. At 8 p.m., (413) 442-0099; $35 to $85. (Tommasini)
 NEW JERSEY OPERA THEATER (Tonight through Sunday) Founded in 2002, the New Jersey Opera Theater is striving to become the state's preeminent opera company. Besides presenting performances, the company also offers master classes and educational outreach programs. The final weekend of its summer season features Mozart's ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' in a production by Albert Sherman, conducted by Steven Mosteller; and an intriguing double bill of Puccini's comedy ''Gianni Schicchi'' and ''Buoso's Ghost,'' a one-act work from 1996 by the composer Michael Ching. ''Buoso's Ghost'' picks up the story of the clever Schicchi where Puccini's opera leaves off. Steven Condy sings Schicchi in both works; James Caraher conducts. ''Schicchi'' and ''Buoso,'' tonight at 8 and Sunday afternoon at 2; ''Cosi,'' tomorrow night at 8; Berlind Theater at the McCarter Theater Center, 91 University Place, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., (609) 258-2787; $42 and $49.

Thursday benefit tickets begin at $50.(Roslyn Sulcas)

HEIDI DUCKLER COLLAGE DANCE THEATER (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Duckler is known as Los Angeles's ''queen of site-specific performance,'' the press release says. This production of ''Laundromatinee,'' part of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council's Sitelines performances, may well show she deserves claim to the title. It involves dancers spinning in dryers and hanging from clotheslines, then -- this sounds like the best bit -- removing their clothes to sing ''Stand By Your Man.'' 8.30 p.m., Laundromat, 168 Elizabeth Street, between Spring and Kenmare Streets; (212) 219-9401, www.lmcc.net/sitelines; free.

* 'TAP CITY 2006' (Tonight and tomorrow) This spirited summer festival suggests that camaraderie and a sense of community are not dead in tap dance, on stage and in the audience. It includes two programs. ''Tap and Song,'' a celebration of traditional vaudeville, comedy and classic song-and-dance, stars the irrepressible Tony Waag, the festival's founder and director. He will be joined by a generous roster of artists, including the veteran tapper Mable Lee, the German Tap and Tray duo, the chic two-woman Tapage and the hoedown tapper Nate Cooper.

Art

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

 Museums

Brooklyn Museum: 'Graffiti,' through Sept. 3. Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Ken Johnson)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedeker's guides, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman)

DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Sept. 3. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Egypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606. (Roberta Smith)

* FRICK COLLECTION : 'JEAN-ETIENNE LIOTARD (1702-1789): SWISS MASTER,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including the young Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter)

SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)

* INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)

* METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 3 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)

* MET: 'TREASURES OF SACRED MAYA KINGS,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. And wait till you see the painted ceramic vessel known as the ''Dazzler Vase,'' with its red and green patterns like jade on fire, you'll understand its name. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710. (Cotter)

* MORGAN LIBRARY AND MUSEUM: 'MASTERWORKS FROM THE MORGAN,' through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontes to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Cotter)

MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE WORD ON THE STREET: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF LARRY RACIOPPO,' through Aug. 20. Photographs documenting vernacular expressions of religious devotion in New York, including spray-painted murals, private shrines and tattoos. Museum of Biblical Art, 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500. (Johnson)

* MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: HERZOG & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer. (212) 708-9400. (Smith)

NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN : CHIHULY AT THE NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDENS, through Oct. 29. Dale Chihuly, the world's most famous contemporary glass artist, has created ambitious installations of his large-scale, technically virtuosic and materially extravagant works inside the spectacular Haupt Conservatory and outside in formal reflecting pools and smaller gardens. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700. (Johnson)

* NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: LEGACIES: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS REFLECT ON SLAVERY, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Cotter)

P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'INTO ME/OUT OF ME,' through Sept. 25. Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084. (Johnson)

* THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART : 'FULL HOUSE: VIEWS OF THE WHITNEY'S COLLECTION AT 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. If ''Full House'' is about one thing, it is about discord, about how harmonious America never was. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)

* WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can.

* HANS BELLMER: ' PETITES ANATOMIES, PETITES IMAGES.' This extraordinary show of more than 70 images takes you beyond the surface obsessions of Bellmer's girl-crazed art to unveil some of his working processes as a sculptor, installation artist, photographer, editor and hand-colorist whose preference for small scale intensifies the voyeuristic nature of his art.

* CRG PRESENTS: KLAUS VON NICHTSSAGEND GALLERY Including works by Liz Luisada, Samuel Lopes and Thomas Ovilsen, this group show of work by 17 emerging artists definitely has its moments, but the strongest impression is made by the gallery-within-a-gallery effect resulting from the re-creation of the storefront facade and reception desk of the small Von Nichtssagend Gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

'Photography Is Not An Art!' More than 100 examples of vernacular, often anonymous photographs from fields of medicine, forensics, space exploration and advertising prove that nonart photography is often as interesting as the fine-art variety.

* Vivan Sundaram: 'Re-Take of Amrita' The photographs in this beautiful, time-haunted show are all of past generations of the Indian artist Vivan Sundaram's family, and include images of his aunt, the modernist painter Amrita Sher-Gil (1913-1941). Thanks to digital technology, those generations mix in logically impossible combinations. The resulting pictures embody the past the way it survives in the mind: edited, layered, compressed, as if in a dream.

* THE NAME OF THIS SHOW IS NOT GAY ART NOW Characterized by its organizer, the artist Jack Pierson, as an ode to the passing of ''the notion of Gay Art,'' this exhibition embraces the work of about 60 artists (gay, straight and otherwise) to create a cacophonous celebration and suggest that everyone is a little bit gay, if they are lucky. Paul Kasmin Gallery, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, closes today. (Smith)

HEADLINE: Reputed Street Gang Leader Gets 37-Year Prison Sentence

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRICK

 BODY:
A man prosecutors have spent years trying to connect to witness tampering, intimidation and murder was sentenced yesterday to 37 years in prison on drug conspiracy and weapons charges.
 The man, Dupree Harris, 32, described by prosecutors as a leader of the Nine Drey branch of the Bloods street gang, is already serving 15 years to life for bribing witnesses in a murder case. But even while becoming a symbol of witness vulnerability and the criminal justice system's limitations, Mr. Harris has not been convicted of the violent crimes prosecutors -- and even a judge -- have ascribed to him.
At the sentencing, Mr. Harris's longtime lawyer, Stacey Richman, sought to underscore that distinction, noting that a court document inaccurately listed a witness-tampering conviction instead of a bribery conviction among his criminal history. 
 ''There is a great difference between the two, in that one is violent and one is not,'' Ms. Richman said. ''Bribery is nonviolent.''
 The efforts to connect Mr. Harris to violence against witnesses unfolded over four years and four trials in Brooklyn, and publicity led prosecutors and even members of Congress to vow to strengthen witness protection procedures.
 In 2003, Mr. Harris was acquitted of a killing in Bedford-Stuyvesant after a trial that prosecutors said was tainted by an orchestrated effort to intimidate witnesses. By that time, he was already awaiting trial for bribery and intimidation of witnesses in the murder trial of his half-brother, Wesley Sykes, who was eventually convicted. A witness whose name was read aloud in court in that trial, Bobby K. Gibson, was killed before he could testify.
 As those trials wound through the state court system, federal prosecutors delved into Mr. Harris's past. Before he was arrested in 2002, prosecutors said, he employed a network of contacts from the housing projects of Bedford-Stuyvesant to operate a cocaine distribution ring in Glens Falls, about 180 miles upstate.
 Relying on addiction, intimidation and economics, the operation sold packages of crack worth $10 in Brooklyn for much more upstate, prosecutors said. At the sentencing yesterday, Judge Allyne R. Ross of Federal District Court said, ''Harris was amply proven to be the leader and organizer of the conspiracy.''
 Mr. Harris entered the courtroom with a grin and a big left-handed wave toward more than a dozen supporters. Ms. Richman filed testimonial letters from family members and friends from the neighborhood and the music business.
 ''Dupree is a kind and caring person,'' wrote his mother, Michelle Harris, ''that tries to help anyone that he can when it is possible.''
 Mr. Harris said the terms of his confinement had been harsh, and he asked for leniency.
 ''I'm a human being,'' he told the judge. ''I'm not the monster these people want me to be.''
 A prosecutor, Lee Freedman, asked for a sentence of life in prison.
 ''If he's permitted to spend one more day out of confinement, your honor,'' he said, ''that's another day that people are at risk.''
 Judge Ross called the drug and weapons charges ''extremely serious'' and pronounced sentence:
 ''Defendant will not be released to society until he is in his 60's.''
 Mr. Harris's relatives stood and waved, and he waved back.
 ''Love you,'' he said. Then the marshals escorted him from the courtroom.

HEADLINE: Economic Data Suggests Slower Second Half

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
A measure of future economic activity and a survey of factory activity in the mid-Atlantic states suggested slower growth ahead yesterday. Separate data suggested that the labor market remained essentially healthy. 
 The Conference Board, a private industry research group, said that its index of leading economic indicators rose 0.1 percent in June, to 138.1, just below market expectations for a 0.2 percent increase.
June's modest rise followed two months of declines and supported opinions that the economy would cool further in the second half of 2006. 
 Kenneth Goldstein, labor economist at the Conference Board, said in a statement, ''The leading economic indicators suggest that the economy could cool even more in the third and fourth quarters of the year.'' 
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its business activity index for the mid-Atlantic region fell to 6.0 in July, from 13.1 in June. That was its lowest since January and well below forecasts for a decline to 12.0. A reading above zero indicates growth.
 Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at Spencer Clarke in New York, said the reports implied that prices were rising while business expansion was slowing. 
 Indeed, the Philadelphia Fed's index of prices paid by manufacturers edged up to 50.3 in July, from 48.7 in June, while the new-orders gauge fell to 10.1, from 17.7. But the survey's employment barometer rose to 12.8, from 6.8.
 In other data, the Labor Department reported that the number of people filing initial claims for unemployment benefits fell last week by 30,000, to the lowest level in a month, amid fewer claims from the automobile industry.
 The new claims dropped to 304,000 in the week ended July 15, from an upward-revised 334,000 the previous week.
 Two weeks ago, jobless claims rose by 20,000 as auto plants closed for annual summer maintenance. 
 Patrick Fearon, senior economist with A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, said the claims report indicates ''there is still some good demand for labor, suggests that firms aren't substantially increasing their layoffs in spite of the slowdown in the economy.''

HEADLINE: Fed's June Notes Show Some Inflation Concern

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board's policy makers worried about the risks of higher inflation at their June meeting but in the end decided that a slowing economy should keep a lid on price pressures. 
 Minutes of those discussions released Thursday indicated that the policy makers worried about a number of potential inflation threats, including anecdotal evidence that businesses were having trouble hiring certain skilled workers and concerns that the jump in energy prices this year could become more of a problem.
Despite those worries, ''inflation was seen by most participants as likely to edge down'' because of the Fed's expectations that growth was slowing, the minutes said.
 The Fed voted unanimously to raise its federal funds rate to 5.25 percent on June 29, but gave a lift to financial markets by providing several hints in the statement that the rate increases could end soon.
 The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, expressed a similar view this week when he delivered the Fed's twice-a-year economic forecast to Congress.
 His comments gave strength to a stock market rally on Wednesday as investors seemed to believe that Mr. Bernanke was signaling that the Fed's two-year campaign of rate increases was drawing to an end.
 The Fed next meets on Aug. 8. Many analysts expect the central bank to raise rates one last time, pushing the funds rate to 5.5 percent, and then move to the sidelines for the rest of the year.
 The minutes of the June discussions showed that a rise in core inflation, which excludes energy and food, had Fed policy makers concerned.
 Many Fed officials said they believed that the jump in price pressures was based on temporary factors, including a spike in energy prices and higher rental costs.
 The Fed concluded that the expected slowdown in the economy -- occurring under the impact of the central bank's previous rate increases, the soaring energy prices and the cooling housing market -- should act to restrain price pressures in coming months.
 The Fed said the slowdown was expected to ease pressures on ''resource utilization,'' an economic term for the supply of available workers and factories' capacity to increase production.
 The Fed noted that its rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, composed of the 7 Fed board members and the 12 regional bank presidents, had decided to increase the number of two-day meetings it holds each year to four, from two.

HEADLINE: More Iraqis Fleeing Strife And Segregating by Sect

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Reporting for this article was contributed by Edward Wong, Omar al-Neami and Wisam A. Habeeb from Baghdad, and an Iraqi employee of The New York Times from Falluja.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 20 

 BODY:
Relentless sectarian violence is forcing Iraqi families to flee their homes in ever larger numbers, according to figures released Thursday by the Iraqi government. 
 Sattar Nowruz, a spokesman for the Ministry of Displacement and Migration, said 1,117 families abandoned mixed areas for Shiite or Sunni strongholds in the last week alone, an increase since March that analysts described as a conservative snapshot of internal migration.
In all, he said, nearly 27,000 families, about 162,000 people, had registered for relocation aid since the bombing of a Shiite shrine in Samarra on Feb. 22, which set off waves of killings, kidnappings and reprisals. 
 The migration was ''a dangerous sign'' of accelerated religious segregation, he said.
 In a rare written statement, Iraq's most prominent Shiite religious authority, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, said he was heartbroken by the widening divide -- the rise of ''terror, displacement, killing, kidnapping and everything that words could not explain.'' 
 He called on Iraqis ''to exert maximum effort to stop the bloodletting.'' 
 The new migration figures, the most specific to date, come at a time when violence is claiming an average of at least 100 Iraqi lives each day, according to a recent United Nations report. 
 American military figures released Thursday showed that the number of daily attacks recorded by the police and allied forces in Baghdad jumped to an average of 34 this month from 24 in June.
 Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki unveiled an enhanced security plan for the capital last month, emphasizing that as Baghdad went, so would go Iraq. But on Thursday, Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, a military spokesman, acknowledged that 50,000 Iraqi forces and 7,200 American troops were struggling to protect Baghdad. 
 ''We have not witnessed the reduction in violence one would have hoped for in a perfect world,'' General Caldwell said. He predicted that it would take ''months not weeks'' to make Baghdad safe. 
 The White House spokesman, Tony Snow, said Thursday that when Mr. Maliki met with President Bush at the White House next week, Baghdad would be among the first issues discussed. Most Iraqis fleeing dangerous areas have been members of the minority sect in their neighborhoods, Mr. Nowruz said. In some cases, killings or death threats pushed them out. 
 Khalid Abdul Wahid al-Janabi said he was one of the few Sunnis living in his Baghdad neighborhood when he was recently kidnapped and tortured by a Shiite militia. ''I was dumped with 13 dead bodies,'' he said. ''I have no enemies but during the last few months Mahdi Army militias started to assassinate so many people.'' 
 He then moved to Falluja, a heavily Sunni area where he said he had crammed into a house with relatives. He said his old neighborhood -- once 15 percent to 20 percent Sunni -- was now almost exclusively Shiite. ''Most of the families that used to live in my neighborhood moved to the west of Baghdad and some of them moved to provinces like Diyala, Salahuddin and Anbar,'' he said. 
 Conversely, Shiite families have moved from Sunni neighborhoods of Baghdad and Anbar Province, the site of intense fighting between American forces and Sunni insurgents, government figures show.
 For Sunnis, Falluja has become a preferred safe haven. Officials there describe the majority Sunni city as a swelling metropolis, with hundreds if not thousands of families moving in every week, crowding homes and seeking identification cards with Falluja addresses to ensure that they are not mistaken for Shiites. 
 Some of Falluja's new arrivals said they were confounded and disturbed by their need to move. Abdul Razzaq Hussein, a former Iraqi Army officer, said he used to live in the mixed area of New Baghdad with his Shiite wife. He said he came to Falluja alone after the Samarra bombing because he feared Shiite death squads. ''Sometimes when we woke up in the morning, we used to find threats,'' he said.
 Anthony H. Cordesman, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the Iraqi migration was probably more widespread than the government statistics suggested. He described the exodus as both a sign of fear and a potential contributor to sectarian volatility.
 ''When you add this to violence and economic problems, it puts the country closer to civil conflict,'' he said by telephone. ''They are relocating not to another province -- what you're seeing are lines being drawn in the middle of cities and people still have to survive. You get enclaves and fortresses where people become violent to the people outside.''
 Concentration in a given neighborhood could lead to being made targets by another sect, he added. ''You have cumulative process of polarization. It all interacts.''
 To protect displaced families, Mr. Nowruz said the government was moving to build four new camps in Baghdad, Mosul, Dhi Qar and Kut. 
 But the additional space may bring little comfort to the fearful. In one of the older camps near the Baghdad airport last week, Shihab Ahmed Hammoudi huddled inside one of roughly 50 tents with his wife and two young children. He said he left his home and his job as a tea seller in the Jihad neighborhood of Baghdad after Shiite militiamen executed as many as 50 people on July 9, pulling them out of their homes and cars, then shooting many in the head.
 Even at the camp, he said it was hard to feel safe. Last Thursday, he said men dressed as Iraqi police officers visited the camp to ask for names of refugees, causing many to fear that the officers were members of a Shiite militia. When families resisted, there was a brief standoff. 
 ''They were pretending to help us, but when they saw how many guards there were protecting the camp, they left,'' Mr. Hammoudi said.

HEADLINE: AT&T Bets Its Brand Is More Than Nostalgia

BYLINE: By Ken Belson

 BODY:
THE venerable AT&T brand was in decline a few years ago. Rivals were outflanking the company in the long-distance market; AT&T Wireless was plagued by service problems; and AT&T had entered and exited the cable television business at great expense.
 These days, executives at AT&T are betting heavily on a brand resurgence. When SBC Communications bought AT&T last year, SBC promptly took the AT&T name. And if its pending purchase of BellSouth is approved, as expected, by the end of the year, AT&T plans to rename that company as well as Cingular, which they jointly own. 
The rebranding campaign is no mere nostalgia trip. Despite its warts, AT&T is still the most recognizable name in the phone business. Like Verizon and other telecommunications companies, AT&T is also selling bundles of services and wants to have a single brand for all its products.
 ''The BellSouth and Cingular names are not just at the iconic level globally,'' the vice president for advertising at AT&T, Wendy Clark, said. ''When you have an integrated solution, the nomenclature of wireless and wireline will become blurred to the point where you need a single brand. It's about one-stop shopping.''
 Like AT&T -- which now has annual sales of about $66 billion -- the effort to rebrand Cingular and BellSouth will be extensive, and not without risks. BellSouth operates in nine states in the Southeast, where it has 20 million local phone lines. Cingular has 2,300 stores and an industry-leading 57.3 million subscribers.
 The company also plans to organize a national campaign to reintroduce its brand on billboards and television, and in newspapers and magazines. Ms. Clark declined to provide specifics about the campaign, but she said the scale and message would be in line with the company's extensive efforts to rename SBC, which has included a redesigned blue globe and the catchphrase ''Your World. Delivered.''
 She added that AT&T would probably retain GSD&M in Austin, Tex., and Rodgers Townsend from St. Louis, the two firms that engineered the current transformation of SBC. She said a decision had not been made about retaining BBDO, Cingular's agency of record.
 Regardless of the agency, some specialists say AT&T would do better to develop an entirely new brand. AT&T's name, they say, lacks the luster it had before the company was broken up in 1984. They also question whether AT&T and BellSouth, which spent heavily to promote Cingular, should abandon a brand that has a fresher feel.
 ''The opportunity that exists for them is to create a completely new name that would reflect the coolness and attraction that Cingular has with youth and diminish some of the negativity of AT&T and bring forward their heritage,'' said Marc Gobe, chief executive of the brand consultant Desgrippes Gobe and author of ''Emotional Branding.''
 Whatever the attraction, the economics of sticking with the AT&T name are compelling. AT&T says that 20 percent of the annual operating expenses it expects to save by buying BellSouth will come from consolidating the three brands. That could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
 That would come on top of Cingular's improving finances. The company said yesterday that profit grew almost fourfold in the second quarter as it reduced expenses related to its purchase of AT&T Wireless in 2004. Cingular earned $540 million in the quarter, compared with $147 million a year earlier. Sales increased 7.1 percent, to $9.2 billion, and the company added 1.5 million subscribers, more than analysts had expected.
 For all its success, though, Cingular's name will never have the clout of its parent, AT&T, the Coca-Cola of the telecommunications industry. Cingular came into being only in 2000, after SBC and BellSouth merged their wireless divisions.
 AT&T, by contrast, has been around more than a century. Colloquially known as Ma Bell, it reminds many older consumers of the days when AT&T was a government-sanctioned monopoly that provided reliable if bland service.
 ''ATT was built a long time before Cingular, SBC or BellSouth,'' said Tom Holownia, the president of Blended Thinking, a consultant specializing in branding. ''You got the baby boomers who grew up with AT&T and the younger generation doesn't even know about the brand so you get to start all over with them.''
 But in an era when electronics have turned into indistinguishable and disposable commodities with spotty service reputations, having a brand that represents stability may not be such a bad thing.
 ''In this category, it's less the name and more the quality of service at the right price,'' said Clive Chajet, chairman of Chajet Consultancy, an image management company. ''Because grandma had an AT&T phone means it is reliable and the company has proven it.''

HEADLINE: In Mexico, Automaking Is a Growth Industry 

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN; Micheline Maynard contributed reporting from Detroit for this article.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 20 

 BODY:
For Mexico, the recent groundbreaking of a new $650 million auto factory was worth celebrating. President Vicente Fox and other dignitaries attended the event. Local executives from General Motors, the investor, flew in to the central state of San Luis Potosi, where the assembly plant now under construction is expected to eventually employ up to 1,800 people and churn out as many as 160,000 compact cars a year.
 During the last dozen years, many foreign manufacturers rushed to build factories in states like Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, inspiring the sobriquet Detroit South. Now Mexico is eyeing that nickname.
G.M., struggling with its own problems, did little to publicize the new factory outside Mexico. But while any talk of increasing production elsewhere or adding low-wage jobs in Mexico risks creating animosity in the United States, there is no hiding the relentless advance of the auto industry here. 
 Automotive production in Mexico is expected to hit record levels this year, surpassing two million cars, as automakers pour billions of dollars of new investment into their Mexican factories.
 The expansion, being fueled by Mexico's top five automakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor, DaimlerChrysler, Nissan and Volkswagen -- stands in contrast to the plans by G.M. and Ford to cut 60,000 jobs in the United States and close two dozen North American plants through 2012.
 The reason for Mexico's new wave of growth is twofold. First, it is next to the world's largest auto market, allowing greater production integration because auto companies can easily ship cars and parts by truck and rail.
 And second, it is still cheap to operate here compared with the United States, where unionized workers earn at least $27 an hour and benefits can double or even triple the total cost. By comparison, Mexico's typical auto industry wage of about $3.50 an hour for an experienced worker -- which doubles with benefits -- looks like a bargain.
 Changing tastes are also starting to work in Mexico's favor. As Americans' love affair with fuel-thirsty S.U.V.'s wanes, some analysts believe that Mexico's low costs make the country the natural place for automakers to assemble the next generation of smaller, cheaper cars. 
 ''In the big picture,'' asked Greg Gardner, an analyst with Harbour Consulting in Troy, Mich., ''can Ford, G.M. and Chrysler build medium and small cars in the United States and survive?''
 Other forces are also at play: Mexico's long track record of producing cars and trucks for the American market; a trained and experienced work force; a critical mass of auto parts suppliers who have migrated here and now produce $24 billion worth of parts annually with 430,000 workers. And more auto parts investments are coming, threatening jobs in the United States. 
 Automakers have spent $4 billion in Mexico since the beginning of 2005, the government says. They are introducing new models -- from mega-trucks to sporty compacts -- assembled in factories retooled to match the sophisticated plants north of the border.
 New investments could raise Mexico's production to three million cars by 2012, depending on growth in the United States, Mexico's main market, according to Emilio Mosso, an official at the Economy Ministry. In part, the boom is a rebound after sales slumped for aging models made in Mexico, and automakers halted production to prepare for new models. Exports are up 50 percent in the first six months of the year from the same period last year. About three-quarters of production goes abroad, mostly to the United States. And analysts say that figure could rise. 
 ''When companies look at where to put a new plant, Mexico is starting to compete a lot more with Detroit South,'' said Gabriel Renero, a consultant at Deloitte in Mexico City. ''They are finding a very attractive work force in this country.''
 In the last year, American automakers have all introduced a variety of new models from their Mexican assembly plants. ''Being able to produce any kind of vehicle looks good in the global market,'' said Mr. Renero.
 George Magliano, director of automotive research for the Americas at Global Insight, a consulting firm, said more models were probable. 
 ''There's been a conscious effort to put them here to begin with and that has accelerated in the last six months,'' said Mr. Magliano. The automakers, he predicted, ''will expand their thinking in Mexico.'' 
 Mr. Denero of Deloitte said, ''We would expect that some other companies will replace production plants in Mexico in the medium term'' to sell to the nation's growing domestic market as well as to American car buyers.
 Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexican-made cars enter the United States market without duties, essentially erasing the border for the auto industry. Free trade agreements with other countries, including the European Union, most of Latin America and Japan, mean that cars from a plant in Mexico can be shipped to much of the world with low tariffs or none.
 Mexico's share of North American production is still fairly modest, about 11.8 percent this year based on earlier forecasts, up from 10 percent last year, said Tina Jantzi, manager of North American forecasting at JD Power Automotive Forecasting in Troy, Mich. She expects that figure to reach 14 percent by 2012. 
 Much of the industry expects a pickup in sales of smaller cars. The question is how sharp that rise will be and how much of that production will come to Mexico. ''This is the difference between two and three million units'' in Mexico, said Mr. Magliano of Global Insight. Any decision to move assembly plant jobs to Mexico raises awkward questions in the United States, which explains why automakers are all quick to point to their far larger investments back home. 
 G.M., for example, is building a new plant in Lansing, Mich.; Ford underscored last month that Mexico accounted for just 5 percent of its North American investment, about the same as Canada. A Chrysler spokesman said that of $9.9 billion the company had spent in North America since 2003, Mexico received just $1.2 billion. 
 As for G.M., it sought to play down the opening of its new plant, not even issuing a news release on its Web site, which is packed with company news. The factory will sell its cars mostly in Mexico, according to Stefan Weinmann, a G.M. spokesman in Detroit. The car will probably be a compact, because compacts account for about half of Mexico's 1.13 million-vehicle annual market. 
 Mr. Weinmann said that Mexico's expanding local market, where G.M. has a 20 percent share, was the main reason for building the plant. 
 Still, the plant sits on the main rail line to the United States, and the question remains how much of its production will find its way to American consumers at some point. The company says exports will be limited but declines to say where they will go. 
 DaimlerChrylser and its suppliers are spending $1 billion at its plant in Toluca, outside Mexico City, which now assembles the PT Cruiser for 60 countries. The new flexible manufacturing scheme, an approach that Chrysler uses throughout its North American plants, means the plant will be able to add new models quite easily to the existing assembly line. 
 If demand warrants it, the plant could increase output by a third, said its manager, Jose Luis Chaparro. 
 Already, the plant is designed so that each PT Cruiser rolls off the line made to order for the customer, down to details like fog lights, leather seats and chrome hub caps. Nearby parts suppliers deliver pieces only hours before they go into the car. 
 Ford's plans are less clear. Last month, Detroit newspapers published articles based on what appeared to be a leaked internal memo suggesting that Ford was planning extensive investments in Mexico. In an e-mail statement, Said Deep, a Ford spokesman, wrote that reports saying the investment would reach $9 billion were inaccurate. A few days after those reports, Ford announced it would invest in its two Mexican assembly plants and its engine plant to strengthen its manufacturing presence in Mexico, though it did not say how much it would spend. 
 One of those plants, at Cuautitlan outside of Mexico City, is operating at less than half its capacity. Mr. Deep would not comment on Ford's plans for the operation. Most analysts predict that Ford will eventually put another low-cost plant in Mexico.
 Nissan's new compact model, the Versa, rolled off the assembly line last month at its Mexico plant after a $1.3 million investment from the automaker and its suppliers. The car, one of a wave of new small cars in the United States, will be in American dealer lots later this summer. 
 Volkswagen, which produces Jettas for the global market at its plant in Puebla, some 60 miles west of Mexico City, will begin production of the Jetta station wagon there in January, according to a spokesman, Thomas Karig.
 And analysts expect that Toyota may also decide to put a second plant in Mexico, where its share of the local market has been growing. 
 Despite the forecasts, Mexico's position is far from assured. Mr. Magliano of Global Insight said that the Mexican government needed to upgrade its infrastructure, cut bureaucracy and invest more in technology if it expected to compete successfully in a global auto market.
 Mexico ''has got to be a better place to operate,'' Mr. Magliano said. ''And we've seen some of it, but not a lot of it.''

HEADLINE: Bernanke Calls Housing Downturn 'Orderly'

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told Congress on Thursday that the once high-flying housing market appeared to be experiencing a safe landing.
 ''The downturn in the housing market so far appears to be orderly,'' Mr. Bernanke said during a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee. 
One of the things that Mr. Bernanke and his Fed colleagues are keeping close tabs on is the extent to which a housing slowdown will dampen overall economic activity.
 Mr. Bernanke's appearance was the second in two days as he gives Congress a semiannual review of the economy. On Wednesday, Mr. Bernanke told senators he believed the slowing economy would help keep inflation in check.
 But record high energy prices are hurting the economy, Mr. Bernanke said.
 ''The increase in energy prices is clearly making the economy worse off both in terms of real activity and in terms of inflation,'' he said. ''There is no question about it.''
 The rise in core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, ''seems to be a broad-based phenomenon, so we don't think it is a statistical illusion,'' Mr. Bernanke said. Fed policy makers pay close attention to this core measure to get a better sense of how other prices are acting.
 On other matters, Mr. Bernanke said that the large holdings of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did ''present a systemic risk'' to the nation's financial system. 
 He previously has called on Congress to restrict their holdings.
 On workers' issues, Mr. Bernanke said that he expected inflation-adjusted wages to rise in the coming quarters without necessarily causing an inflation problem. Last year, most workers' paychecks trailed inflation.

HEADLINE: Whose Opinion Counts?


HIGHLIGHT: The role of a critic. 

 BODY:
Weekends start early in July, at least here in New York, where many businesses close their doors around noon to facilitate beating it out of town. Me? I'm not going anywhere. Newspapers are apparently exempt from the evolved idea of the summer workweek. I think there is a clause in the contract that requires our productivity to rise in direct proportion to the temperature.
I'm not complaining, but I figure if I have to work maybe I can give you a little homework to take to the beach. So here's a question to ponder over cocktails on the deck, as you feign interest in someone else's problems: What is the role of the wine critic?
Oh God, I hear you say, rolling your eyes. Who gives a fig about the wine critic? 
Well, since you insist, allow me to add a little light reading to your weekend workload. First, Tom Wark of the fine blog Fermentation posted his thoughts about the role of the wine critic. Second, Alder Yarrow, who has his own fine blog, posted his own item on critics, and linked to Matt Kramer's column in The New York Sun on wine critics.
Now these outpourings might not provoke much of a response from lil' self-absorbed me if I hadn't also been wondering about the role of the wine critic after my last columnon the rising sensation of sweetness I find in many California wines, and an accompanying post.
What prompted my thoughts were some reactions to the column and the post, like comment No. 30from Tony and this thread at the robertparsite.ker.com The comments made me wonder whether I was being intolerant, narrow-minded and harsh in criticizing this particular style of wine and in stating my belief that wine's home is on the dinner table. If people like these high-alcohol, sweet-tasting wines and prefer to drink them without food, several readers asked, who am I to tell them they are wrong?
That's a good question, and honestly, it was not my intention to assail anybody for finding pleasure in these wines. Nor do I wish to be dictatorial about how, where or what people enjoy. Viva la difference! Or, as the Isley Brothers put it: "It's your thing, do what you wanna do. I can't tell you, who to sock it to.'' 
But, I do think it is my role as a critic to offer my opinions of this style of winemaking. Not only is it my role, it's my job. 
Being a critic, I think, goes well beyond simply offering tasting notes about myriad bottles. It requires thinking about wine in all of its glorious complexity - as a commodity and as a work of art; as a business with its own peculiar economy and as a cultural object with tangled meanings derived from history, customs and lore that stretch back for centuries. It's the product of big business and of individual artisans, of dull bureaucratic types and fascinating personalities. And if wine could talk? Imagine all the history, inspired and depraved, that open vessels have witnessed since the first fermentation. 
More than me thinking and learning about wine, it's my fond hope to encourage others to want to think and learn about wine, too. That's when the fun begins! The last thing I want to do is to demand that people like only what I like and think only the way I think. If I have any agenda at all, it is to promote a diversity of pleasures, not homogeneity. But I do want people to think about why they like what they like and whether other choices are worth considering. 
Part of that requires expressing approval and disapproval at times. That's easy. Explaining the rationale behind an opinion is the difficult part, and as a writer it is my responsibility, as I see it, to be clear, persuasive and diplomatic. Let me put it another way. It is simple and cathartic to call somebody a fool, but it is not effective if your hope is for that person to consider your own point of view. It is much better to explain yourself in a softer way, so that your audience does not feel foolish and defensive. Then, perhaps, they will be open to weighing another opinion. So, I apologize for being harsh. It was not an effective way to make my point.
Let me try another way. I don't much like ketchup. I find it sweet and cloying, and much prefer mustard on burgers and fries. I understand that most people like ketchup on many things. My son Peter is a major ketchup fan. But I don't think that ketchup enhances food. It obscures flavors, which is maybe the point of it. There's a reason that good cooks and fine restaurants don't slap bottles of ketchup on the table. 
I think a heavy, sweet-tasting wine acts in a similar way to ketchup. It obscures and dominates rather than enhancing. But I certainly wouldn't question the right of anybody to enjoy wines of this style with whatever they are eating. In fact, I'm wondering right now how a big, sweet-tasting pinot noir from the Santa Lucia Highlands would go with ribs slathered in sweet barbecue sauce. A good match? I don't have a deck, alas, or a grill, but maybe a little trip to Blue Smoke is in order (though judging by the wine list I may have to bring my own and restrain myself from ordering the Billecart-Salmon, my barbecue accompaniment of choice). 
So please, let's all continue to enjoy wines that we like as we see fit. Do your thing .

HEADLINE: Approvals Clear Way For Yankees To Build

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
The proposed $800 million ballpark for the New York Yankees received final regulatory approval this week, clearing the way for the club to start construction atop two parks across the street from the existing stadium. 
 Yankees officials said they hoped to begin building the 53,000-seat structure by the end of summer.
 Construction will involve paving over large portions of Macombs Dam Park and Mullaly Park and cutting down about 400 mature oak trees. The stadium is scheduled to open in 2009. 
 ''The Yankees are delighted with the wide-ranging support they've received,'' said Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for the Yankees.
 The project, which was approved by the City Council this spring, engendered intense opposition among many of the stadium's South Bronx neighbors and from parks advocates, who protested the loss of the two popular parks and feared increased traffic and pollution problems in an area with high childhood asthma rates.
 While the stadium won the support of nearly all of the Bronx's elected officials, the plan was rejected by the local community board, which had only advisory power. Several of the dissenting community board members were later replaced by the Bronx borough president, Adolfo Carrion Jr., who emerged as the new stadium's most forceful advocate.
 Opponents say they will probably file a lawsuit to halt construction, contending that portions of the 28-acre Macombs Dam Park and 18.5-acre Mullaly Park had been unlawfully taken from the public.
 ''Since Day 1, everything has been predicated on satisfying the desires of the Yankees without a care for the community or the city's taxpayers,'' said Geoffrey M. Croft, president of NYC Park Advocates.
 During the past week, the Internal Revenue Service and the National Park Service gave their approval, respectively, to the stadium's financing plan and to its construction on parkland. The park service approval was required because Macombs Dam Park received about $420,000 in federal improvement funds in the early 1980's. 
 The park service concluded that the neighborhood's loss of Macombs Dam Park would be offset by new parkland the project would provide, including three ball fields at the current Yankee Stadium, which will be partly torn down; a park on the Bronx River; and small parks placed atop stadium garages.
 The I.R.S. approved the stadium's complex financing plan, in which the ballpark will be paid for by the Yankees with $920 million in tax-exempt, low-interest city bonds and $25 million in taxable bonds. The Yankees will repay the 40-year bonds with an annual payment in lieu of taxes. The bonds are to be offered in the next few weeks, said Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the city's Economic Development Corporation. 
 The Yankees will pay rent on the city-owned stadium, as well as payments in lieu of taxes, Ms. Patterson said. The city and state will pay for infrastructure improvements, including new parking garages and possibly a Metro-North commuter station in the area.
 The final community benefits agreement between the Yankees and Bronx elected officials calls for the club to establish the Bronx Community Trust Fund, in which the team will place $32 million over 40 years -- about $800,000 a year. The fund, which will be managed by an administrator who will be chosen by the team and by Bronx elected officials, will be distributed to local community and nonprofit groups.
 The Yankees will also donate $100,000 in equipment and promotional merchandise to community and school groups and give away 15,000 tickets to home games. The average value of each ticket will be $25.
 The community benefits agreement also calls for 25 percent of stadium construction work to go to Bronx businesses, with 50 percent of that total reserved for businesses owned by women or minorities.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 28, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about plans for an $800 million ballpark for the New York Yankees in the Bronx referred incorrectly to the team's financing arrangement with New York City. The Yankees have agreed to repay $945 million in city bonds, but will not pay rent. The article also misstated plans for the current stadium. All of it will be torn down, not just parts of it.

A.M.D. IN ACQUISITION TALKS -- Advanced Micro Devices, the computer chip maker, is in talks to acquire ATI Technologies, a Canadian company that makes computer graphics chips, for $5.5 billion, people involved in the negotiations said.
 Advanced Micro, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., is struggling in the computer chip market against the leading manufacturer, the Intel Corporation, and reported this week that its revenue fell 3.5 percent, to $1.22 billion, as the two companies cut chip prices in a fight for market share.
 People involved in the negotiations, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the deal, said a deal could be reached in the next few days, although the talks could break down.
 Bloomberg News, which reported the talks yesterday, said the purchase would be the biggest in Advanced Micro's 37-year history. 
 Cody Acree, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Company in Baltimore, told Bloomberg News, ''Buying ATI would allow Advanced Micro to package graphics chips with its latest processors and get them to customers faster.''
 ''It may be a step A.M.D. has to take,'' he said. ''They may be saying, 'If I'm going to be an Intel equivalent, I need to be able to offer the market the things Intel can.' '' (NYT)

BELLSOUTH DEAL MOVES FORWARD -- BellSouth Corporation shareholders approved the proposed sale of their company to AT&T for $67 billion in stock. AT&T shareholders later voted to issue new stock in the combined company. The deal would expand the reach of the company, the nation's largest telecommunications provider, and put the two companies' wireless joint venture, Cingular, under one roof.
 Federal and state regulators also must rule on the deal. Once the deal is completed, which is expected by the end of the year, the BellSouth and Cingular names will be phased out.
 ''Our cultures are a good fit,'' Duane Ackerman, above, the chief executive of BellSouth, told shareholders. (AP)

BUSH REJECTS CHINA INQUIRY -- The Bush administration, citing evidence of progress by China to improve labor rights, said it had rejected a petition to begin a trade investigation into Chinese labor practices. The decision turned down a request filed in June by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and two members of Congress -- a Democrat and a Republican -- who contended that the Chinese were violating international labor standards and costing 1.24 million American jobs. (AP)

ORDERS FOR AIRBUS -- Airbus said Singapore Airlines had agreed to buy 9 A380 superjumbos and 20 of its new A350 XWB airliners in a deal worth an estimated $7.5 billion. The order for the A350's was the first for Airbus, which introduced the wide-body plane this week at the International Air Show in Farnborough, England.
 The 9 A380's are in addition to 10 that Singapore Airlines has already ordered. It also has options to buy 20 more A350's and 6 more of the 555-seat A380's. Deliveries of the A350 will start in 2012. Airbus is controlled by the European aerospace company EADS. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)

INQUIRY INTO PLANT DEATH -- Honeywell International, the world's largest maker of airplane controls, said it was a target of a grand jury investigation into events in 2003 at its Baton Rouge, La., chemical plant.
 A federal grand jury has been convened to look into an employee death at the factory, one of three previously disclosed incidents there that year, Honeywell said in a regulatory filing. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department are investigating, Honeywell said. The worker death involved a release of antimony pentachloride, the company said. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)

U.S. COURT SIDES WITH CANADA -- The United States Court of International Trade ruled in favor of Canada in its fight against American duties on Canadian softwood lumber in a decision that could complicate a deal to end the trade dispute.
 The court said United States officials could not bypass a North American Free Trade Agreement panel's ruling that Washington had improperly imposed duties on the lumber used in housing construction.
 ''This is a victory for Nafta,'' said John Allan, president of the British Columbia Lumber Trade Council, a major Canadian industry lobbying group. A spokesman for the United States trade representative's office was not immediately available for comment. (REUTERS)

NET SLIPS AT ERICSSON -- The wireless equipment maker LM Ericsson posted a 2 percent slide in second-quarter profit as it struggled to integrate the recent acquisition of Marconi. The company, based in Stockholm, said net profit was 5.71 billion kronor ($781 million), down from 5.84 billion kronor in the second quarter of 2005.
 Earnings were reduced by a charge of 400 million kronor ($55 million) related to the acquisition of Marconi, which Ericsson bought for $2.1 billion in January. Sales rose 15 percent, to 44.2 billion kronor ($6.04 billion) from 38.4 billion kronor in the year-ago period. (AP)

RADIOSHACK POSTS A LOSS -- The RadioShack Corporation said it lost $3.2 million in the second quarter as a result of restructuring and legal settlement costs. The company said the loss amounted to 2 cents a share, in contrast to a profit of $52.3 million, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue edged up to $1.1 billion from $1.09 billion.
 RadioShack, based in Fort Worth, recorded pretax charges of $21 million related to its overhaul, including lease terminations, store liquidations and other actions, and $8.5 million to settle wage-and-hour class-action lawsuits.
 Shares fell 52 cents, to close at $15.24. (AP)

DETAILS OF HALLIBURTON SPINOFF -- The oilfield services conglomerate Halliburton said yesterday that it would pursue a tax-free spinoff of its engineering and construction unit KBR, the largest United States contractor in Iraq, rather than the previously announced stock offer.
 Halliburton plans to complete the separation in the next six to nine months, saying the environment is not as favorable as it was when the stock offering plans were announced in January. (AP)

PRICES EASE IN CANADA -- Canadian consumer prices fell unexpectedly in June, easing worries about inflation and vindicating the Bank of Canada's decision to call off its drive to raise interest rates.
 Year-on-year inflation slowed to 2.5 percent in June, from 2.8 percent in May, largely reflecting a slowdown in the price rise for gasoline and natural gas and retailers' discounts on clothing and cars before a cut in the federal sales tax, Statistics Canada said. But both overall and core consumer prices eased 0.2 percent from May, to the surprise of analysts, who had forecast a 0.1 percent increase for both. (REUTERS)

HEADLINE: Profit Margins Are Inducing Fear of Heights

BYLINE: By Conrad de Aenlle

 BODY:
DESPITE what the adage says, what you don't know can hurt you when you put money in the stock market. Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, contends certain adverse developments are not factored into valuations, raising the chances of a decline.
 Investors are certainly aware that higher inflation and interest rates pose threats. But they may be missing other risks to earnings growth. 
The problem, Mr. Berner said in a research note, is profit margins -- not that they are too low, but the opposite. Margins reached a 40-year peak in the first quarter as profits climbed to 12.3 percent of sales; when revenue and margins grow, profits grow even faster.
 He identified several factors to explain the margin expansion: higher productivity, lower interest costs and -- here's one for the accountants -- shrinking write-offs for depreciation, which reduce a company's costs with the stroke of a pen and inflate stated earnings.
 All three of these trends may be on the verge of reversing, he warned. That would narrow profit margins, as companies are forced to spread higher costs over a relatively stagnant revenue base. In this situation, earnings growth would drop, making for especially unflattering comparisons with robust recent quarters.
 Duncan W. Richardson, chief equity investment officer at the Eaton Vance funds, questioned Mr. Berner's premise. Post-Enron improvements in corporate governance make earnings reports more trustworthy and less susceptible to cheap accounting tricks, he said, and he expects productivity gains to persist.
 ''When companies make progress on revenue growth, they can translate that into higher earnings,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''I would argue that the market looks very cheap based on the current level of earnings.''
 How much progress companies make is anyone's guess if the economy slows, however, and he said that investors could do worse than to focus on businesses that can maintain their margins in an uncomfortable climate. The first place he suggested looking was among ''critical consumer stocks.'' Some of his favorites include Comcast, Time Warner and other providers of cable television service. They are not exactly life-or-death consumer stocks, but the companies are critical enough to their customers. ''It's not as if people are going to turn off their cable'' if times are tough, Mr. Richardson said.
 ANOTHER resilient sector, he said, is upmarket retailing. Companies like Nordstrom ''are not going to lower prices just because things get a little soft,'' he predicted.
 A third industry he likes for its margin resilience really does involve matters of life and death: military contracting. His choices are United Technologies and General Dynamics. The sector ''has consolidated and unfortunately will have plenty of business going forward,'' he said.
 For the overall stock market, Robert Turner, chief investment officer of Turner Investment Partners, acknowledged that nothing, not even profit margin growth, lasts forever. ''At some point the rate of change slows, and we may be near that point now,'' he said.
 One possible way to avoid the reckoning is to stick with growth companies, which he said ''are able to keep margins higher because they can keep revenues higher.'' The stocks are cheap, too, he said, after six years of underperformance relative to value stocks.
 He favors Internet companies, including Yahoo; aQuantive, which deals in online advertising; and VistaPrint, an Internet-based printing business.
 He also likes shares of companies tied to gambling, notably Las Vegas Sands, International Game Technology and Station Casinos. Their margins are protected by human nature. 
 One sector that he and Mr. Richardson consider a safe bet to maintain or raise margins is health care. Mr. Richardson recommended large drug makers, like Johnson & Johnson, Novartis and Wyeth. Mr. Turner prefers biotechnology companies like Celgene, Genentech and Gilead Sciences.
 What investors don't know can hurt them, but sometimes it can help them, too, Mr. Richardson said. Some potential developments would improve earnings and margin growth, and they are certainly not factored into valuations.
 A decline in energy prices and an end to Federal Reserve credit tightening -- and the easing that would follow eventually -- would serve as ''levers pulling things up,'' enhancing results by fueling corporate investment, he said.
 Mr. Berner's report ''is pointing out what can go wrong,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''I like to think about what can go right.''

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley Was Calming Down. Now, an Options Scandal. 

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN and ERIC DASH; Damon Darlin contributed reporting from San Francisco for this article.

 BODY:
Silicon Valley cannot seem to shake off the sins of its dot-com past.
 Many in the Valley thought, or at least hoped, that they could put the excesses of the Internet boom behind them when all those carpet-bagging M.B.A.'s and other get-rich-quick types who had descended on the area in the late 1990's fled amid the stock price meltdown that began in the spring of 2000. Other signal events in recent years had prompted the technorati to declare optimistically that the dot-com era was officially behind them.
But once again, the corporate scandal of the moment -- the manipulation of stock options -- is placing Silicon Valley and its past practices in an unflattering light. 
 Of the more than 80 businesses that have been caught up in federal investigations or have announced their own internal reviews, technology companies make up the overwhelming majority. That list includes Brocade Communications, the Silicon Valley-based data storage equipment maker, whose two former top executives were charged on Thursday with securities fraud in the doctoring of documents on behalf of employees. 
 While the scandal is chiefly affecting technology's midsize companies, it is also raising a cloud over some of the most powerful institutions in the Valley, including the law firm of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and its highest- profile partner, Larry W. Sonsini. 
 Wilson Sonsini, based in Palo Alto, represents, or at least represented, at least half the Silicon Valley technology companies implicated in the backdated-options scandal, according to The Recorder, a law publication in San Francisco.
 And the connection between Brocade and Wilson Sonsini is even deeper; Mr. Sonsini is a former member of the Brocade board, which granted Gregory L. Reyes, the company's chief executive until early last year, the sole authority to award stock options. The practice was legal, but suggests a lack of checks and balances at a company where an insider headed what court filings have termed a compensation ''committee of one.'' 
 A Wilson Sonsini spokeswoman said the firm represented so many of these companies because it provides legal counsel to a large portion of the Valley's publicly traded companies.
 The practice of backdating options dates to the early 1990's but took on momentum during the frenzied days of the Internet era, when the competition for available talent was fierce. Numerous Silicon Valley insiders described the practice as routine -- so much so that the universe of technology companies ultimately placed under the microscope may well far exceed the dozens already under scrutiny by the Justice Department or the Securities and Exchange Commission, if not both. 
 ''People out there really duped themselves into thinking they were doing this for the benefit of stockholders when in reality they were defrauding them,'' said Pearl Meyer, a managing partner at Steven Hall & Partners, a New York executive compensation firm that has worked with scores of Valley-based companies. ''Talking to people out there, they clearly viewed this as a victimless crime.''
 There is little doubt that Silicon Valley provided the perfect setting for cutting corners. The heady days of the tech boom gave many a sense of entitlement, if not also a sense that they were the primary force keeping America strong in the world economy. It was also a maverick culture where clever ways of gaming the system were admired rather than excoriated.
 ''There's been a lot of stuff going on in the Valley since the 1990's that has been pretty fast and loose,'' said Michael S. Melbinger, an executive compensation lawyer at Winston & Strawn in Chicago. Compensation plans were adopted ''during the dot-com boom and bust,'' he said, ''that were just sloppy at best.''
 Few outsiders scrutinized these practices, though, and some were unaware of them.
 Backdating was often ''a client-driven strategy with the accounting firms saying, 'Sounds O.K. to me,' '' said Allan Koltin, the president of PDI Global, a consulting firm based in Chicago that works with many large accounting firms. ''The client put the suggestion out there and the accounting firm, if they were smart enough and could figure out how to agree with the technology firm's perspective, they pretty much won themselves a new client.'' 
 The same might be said of the law firms that advised these companies on the legality of backdating. As scores of Silicon Valley firms went public in the late 1990's, there was enormous pressure on many accounting firms and law firms to keep their newly minted clients happy.
 ''These guys were dancing on leather tabletops in their leather pants,'' Mr. Melbinger said. ''The rules didn't apply to them. They were the new Masters of the Universe. If they called one firm and they wouldn't do it, you'd have firms lining up to take their business.''
 But some in Silicon Valley, including Joseph A. Grundfest, a former S.E.C. commissioner who now teaches at Stanford Law School, wonder if the technology sector is being singled out prematurely before all the facts are known. 
 ''Options are more highly used in the tech sector than other sectors,'' Mr. Grundfest said. ''So it stands to reason that more tech companies would be caught up in this controversy.'' 
 Brocade might provide ''a rather extreme example'' of backdating, Mr. Grundfest said, ''but you can have options-dating issues that are far less serious and can arise from a simple inattention to detail.
 ''You're going to get the whole spectrum, you're going to get all the colors of the rainbow,'' he added, ''so we need to learn more before we reach for any broader conclusions.''
 Options give an employee the right to buy a stock at some point in the future at the price of the stock on the day it was granted -- commonly referred to as the strike price. The lower the strike price, the more an option is worth to the recipient. (A stock option, however, is valuable only when shares of the company are trading at a higher price than the strike price.) 
 Options have been an especially popular form of compensation in Silicon Valley, where they have been described as the area's very lifeblood. They allow tech companies with enormous upside potential but scarce cash -- companies that a recruiter might reasonably have described as the next Microsoft in the second half of the 1990's -- to lure new talent, even if they cannot match the salaries of larger, more established companies. 
 The manipulation of options has taken on many forms. There have been clear cases of deliberate backdating, with executives fiddling with option grant dates to take advantage of a stock's lower price, to more murky cases when options were granted just before the release of positive news that was likely to cause a jump in a stock's price.
 Some say the problem seems to have grown worse after the dot-com fall, when a steep decline in stock prices rendered so many options worthless.
 ''When these options became worth not very much, people got tricky,'' said Sanford Robertson, a partner at Francisco Partners in Menlo Park, Calif., and a co-founder of the investment bank Robertson, Stephens & Company.
 ''They'd do anything they could to make sure these things were worth something,'' Mr. Robertson said. ''If a stock spiked downward, they would move the date by a week or two, which could be worth a lot of money given the fluctuation in price of some of these stocks.''
 Mr. Robertson blamed an ''options society that had gotten way out of hand in 1999 and 2000'' and also the sense of entitlement so prevalent in Silicon Valley back then.
 Brocade seems a particularly egregious example of backdating, at least if prosecutors are to be believed. Two former officials there are accused of doctoring documents, including the minutes of board meetings and job-offer letters, so that it appeared that workers were granted options when the company's stock was trading at a lower price. 
 While federal investigators are investigating dozens of companies over possible backdating of options, the number that backdated options at some point may be significantly higher, according to Erik Lie, a professor at the Henry B. Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa. The number may be as high as 1,000 companies, Mr. Lie said at a recent investor conference. 
 Linda Chatman Thomsen, chief of enforcement at the S.E.C., said in an interview that the government filed charges against Brocade first ''because it was ready.''
 ''It wasn't necessarily,'' she said, ''the most egregious case.''

HEADLINE: The Power Is Often Off, But the Rates May Go Up

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, July 21 

 BODY:
To the list of daily aggravations in the new New Orleans, add one that augments the heat, spoils the food and drains the cash register: power failures.
 The wind blows and a neighborhood's power goes out. Or it rains and the power goes out somewhere else. Thunder crashes distantly and out goes the power.
Ten months after Hurricane Katrina, the city still does not have a reliable electrical system. Hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of repairs are still needed on a system devastated by flooding, the local utility is in bankruptcy and less than half the system's prestorm customers have returned. Of those who have, many have endured hot and sleepless nights with no air-conditioning. 
 ''How do you expect the city to recover when you don't have a reliable source of electrical power?'' asked Robert Harmon, an engineering consultant in the Bywater neighborhood. 
 So much for the injury; now comes the insult. Entergy New Orleans, the power company here, wants to increase its rates 25 percent to help pay for part of what it says is $718 million in storm losses and revenue shortfalls. That would increase the average household bill by $45 a month.
 ''Higher rates is a very serious issue,'' said Mark Drennen, president of Greater New Orleans Inc., a regional economic development agency. ''We are struggling to recover. This is one more obstacle to economic recovery.''
 The combination of bigger bills and spotty service is not a promising formula, many residents agree, for a city in which rents are now high, where finding groceries can be an adventure and where moving companies are reporting a small boom -- outbound. 
 Last year, the Bush administration rejected a taxpayer bailout of Entergy, and now the utility is hoping the state will give it a sprinkling of the $10 billion in federal housing aid planned for New Orleans. The state has not agreed to that request, however, and if assistance does not come, customers may be forced to foot the bill. 
 For several months after Hurricane Katrina, much of New Orleans was dark; by the end of 2005 most of the city was lit again. But a tiny section of the Lower Ninth Ward, near the levee breach, remains unserved -- an indication of the system's continuing fragility.
 Because of unrepaired damage from the storm, a power company spokeswoman said, the utility does not have the same ability to track power failures -- how many there have been and who has been affected -- as it did before.
 In a city where so many are poor, utility issues -- like the dreaded monthly power bill -- have long been a political flashpoint. Air-conditioning is needed six months out of the year, bills run into the hundreds of dollars even in modest houses, and political reputations have been made by taking on the power company. Before the storm, one of the city's few public advocacy groups, and an effective one at that, was organized around battling Entergy and its predecessor, New Orleans Public Service. 
 But high bills or no, at least the power used to stay on. 
 ''Aggravating? Yes, of course, in the middle of the summertime, you know good and well it's aggravating,'' said Joe Shaheen, who lives in Bywater, which has been hit particularly hard by blackouts recently. His windows are sealed shut; burglars and other criminals are a problem on these blocks. 
 If you see people sitting out on their steps, the power is out, residents here say. In Bywater, they call it returning to the dark ages. 
 Not all areas of the city are similarly afflicted. But in Bywater, an old collection of pastel shotgun houses and cottages by the river that was not flooded by the hurricane, the people are weary of it. 
 When does it go out? ''Every time the wind blows wrong,'' said Ricky Stephens, a contractor on Piety Street, disgusted. ''It's just amazing.'' 
 With temperatures staying in the 80's after dark, the nights can be long. ''I had to go somewhere else to sleep,'' said Nicole Guinchard, a waitress who works a 60-hour week on two jobs. ''It was a hotbox in here,'' she said outside her house on Dauphine Street. 
 ''The deal was, at first, it was every time it rained. Lately, it's been for no reason at all,'' said Linda Morreale, an owner of a neighborhood tavern, Bud Rip's. Ms. Morreale has seen her customers slowly drift away: ''Everybody sits around until they get kind of uncomfortable.''
 There is sudden darkness, then the creeping invasion of the humidity outside. 
 Mr. Stephens, the contractor, detailed the stages: ''You get hot. Your kids get irritable. They drive you crazy. It's a whole big ordeal.'' Not to mention, he said, the extra $400 he has had to spend to replace groceries lost to the failures. 
 Entergy executives say the problem is a complicated mix of uncertainty over how many people to serve, power lines that remain down, and connections that are no longer as reliable. Before the storm, when the electricity blinked out for a moment -- as it did even in normal times, during New Orleans's frequent summer storms -- the utility could immediately switch to alternate lines. That option is far less available now. 
 ''We don't have the same number of power lines,'' said Rod West, an Entergy regional manager. Most of the 22 substations were flooded; Entergy estimates it will need $267 million to fix the remaining damage. 
 For now, knowledgeable outsiders sound more disturbed than the Entergy executives do. 
 ''A lot of the system is really jury-rigged right now,'' said Clint Vince, a Washington lawyer who has long served as consultant on energy to the New Orleans City Council. ''So it doesn't have anywhere near the reliability it had pre-Katrina. A lot of the distribution facilities are damaged. We've looked at their system pretty carefully and we are very alarmed by the state of it.''
 Entergy is struggling along, for now, on a $200 million line of credit provided by its parent company, Entergy Inc. Local politicians are promising to scrutinize the requested rate increase carefully.
 And Bywater is enduring this newest challenge, mostly with resignation. ''We're blessed, compared to the people in St. Bernard,'' said James L. Spence Sr., another resident, referring to the parish just east of New Orleans, which has not begun to recover. 
 Still, ''people can only sit in the heat for so long,'' said Ms. Morreale, quickly shifting to bigger difficulties -- her new life in a trailer in Arabi across the parish line, for instance. ''My whole life right now is unfair,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Rejected by Evangelical Base, Politician Ponders Next Role

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Brenda Goodman contributed reporting from Atlanta for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21 

 BODY:
As a seasoned political strategist, Ralph Reed knew from the first returns on Tuesday night that the news was bad and even laughed at the television pundits who suggested that the race was still up for grabs. 
 But this time the loss he was assessing was not a client's but his own first bid to win elective office -- the lieutenant governorship of Georgia. It would have been the next big step in a seemingly unstoppable career that had already vaulted him to the head of the Christian Coalition at the age of 29, to the cover of Time magazine at the age of 33, and to the inner circle of President Bush's political advisers by the age of 39.
His campaign had struggled for months to overcome the disclosure of e-mail correspondence between Mr. Reed and the lobbyist Jack Abramoff that suggested a mercenary streak at odds with Mr. Reed's Christian image. When the evangelical newsmagazine World carried a series of reports on the subject, the accusations became impossible to dismiss as mere liberal media bias.
 And from the first returns in the Republican primary, Mr. Reed knew that the suburban Atlanta precincts with the biggest megachurches, the conservative Christian strongholds essential to his campaign, had turned against him, friends who watched with him said. 
 ''Our own publication did this hatchet job on him, and we lost that core base of people,'' said his friend Tim Echols, founder of TeenPact, a Christian conservative youth group. ''It was very hurtful to Ralph.''
 Now, a dozen years after Time proclaimed him ''The Right Hand of God,'' some are preparing Mr. Reed's political obituary, wondering what he will do after his rejection by the evangelical churchgoers whose support formed the foundation of his reputation as a political activist and his personal fortune as a political consultant. 
 ''Ralph will have to totally reinvent himself,'' said Matt Towery, a political analyst based in Atlanta who once worked as campaign chairman for Newt Gingrich. 
 Friends say it is too soon to write off Mr. Reed, who is now 45. Deal Hudson, a Catholic conservative who worked closely with Mr. Reed on the last two presidential campaigns and watched the returns with him in an Atlanta hotel suite, said Mr. Reed was already talking about how he might play a role in the 2008 race even on the night of his own defeat.
 ''We forget that there is nobody who is able to craft a message for religious conservatives better than Ralph Reed, and the ability to craft a message does not depend on Ralph Reed and how high his bona fides are,'' Mr. Hudson said, noting that Mr. Reed could still work on direct mail, radio and television commercials, speeches and the like from behind the scenes.
 In a telephone interview on Friday, Mr. Reed said he was proud of his campaign and glad that he had run. ''I have been building the Republican Party and the pro-family movement for over 25 years, and I am looking forward to continuing that important work,'' he said. 
 In his concession speech, Mr. Reed said he was not ''not focused on being a candidate in the future.'' 
 In the interview, however, he said, ''First bids for elected office are always tough, and I am not the first person to lose a first campaign,'' noting several examples, including Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Mr. Gingrich, who went on to become speaker of the House.
 Ken Mehlman, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Friday that he was sticking by Mr. Reed. In an e-mail message, he said Mr. Reed had ''played a vital role'' in building the party's grass-roots networks in Georgia and around the country. He added, ''I look forward to continuing to work with him and value his friendship.'' 
 Mr. Reed has retained his communications and consulting firm, Century Strategies, which in the nine years since he founded it has enabled him to amass a net worth of $4.5 million, according to financial disclosure forms filed during the campaign.
 It remains to be seen how the revelations about his ties to Mr. Abramoff will affect Mr. Reed's relationships with Christian conservative candidates or leaders. A Senate committee's investigation into Mr. Abramoff's double-dealing with his Indian gambling clients determined that he had paid Mr. Reed's firm more than $4 million to organize Christian opposition to new Indian casinos on behalf of tribes with casinos who hoped to avoid competition.
 Mr. Reed, who says he opposes gambling as immoral, has maintained that he did not know the fees came from gambling proceeds. But e-mail disclosed by the Senate committee suggested that Mr. Abramoff did not keep it a secret. 
 In April 1999, for example, Mr. Abramoff e-mailed Mr. Reed to propose a direct payment to him from the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, a gambling client, without bothering to move the money through a third party. ''Any chance that a wire from Choctaw directly would be OK?'' Mr. Abramoff wrote. 
 In internal e-mail messages, Mr. Abramoff and his associates referred to Mr. Reed as an ideologue ''as far as the cash goes.'' In his own e-mail, meanwhile, Mr. Reed pressed for millions in payments and boasted of mobilizing prominent Christian conservatives to lobby government officials at his request. Many of those conservatives, including James C. Dobson of Focus on the Family, have publicly distanced themselves from Mr. Reed in recent months.
 World, an influential evangelical magazine edited by Marvin Olasky, who helped Mr. Bush develop his ''compassionate conservative'' philosophy, concluded, ''The portrait that emerges is one of a shrewd businessman who has spent years leveraging his evangelical and conservative contacts to promote the economic interests of his clients, rather than the principles of the political movement he once led.''
 Some Republicans said the election results themselves had cast a new light on Mr. Reed's past talk of turning out an ''army'' of grass-roots churchgoers. ''For years, we have sat back and said, 'O.K., Ralph, tell us again how you are going to turn out your army,' '' said Mr. Towery, the Georgia political analyst. ''But when it came to turning out his army for himself, they didn't turn out.''
 Pat Robertson, the religious broadcaster who founded the Christian Coalition, said in an interview last year that he considered Mr. Reed one of the most ambitious people he had ever known, suggesting that Mr. Reed had compromised his principles along the way. Many of Mr. Reed's allies have suggested that his bid for lieutenant governor was to be a stop on a carefully plotted career path toward governor, senator or president.
 Mr. Towery, who has known Mr. Reed since his days as a Senate intern, said that he and others tried to dissuade Mr. Reed from running while the Abramoff investigation was looming in the background, but that Mr. Reed was in a hurry. 
 ''He felt that the timetable for his career could not be interrupted, and this was part of the timing,'' Mr. Towery said.
 About seven months ago, Mr. Reed began to respond more directly to the accusations about Mr. Abramoff, telling audiences that he regretted his involvement and had learned from the experience. ''I am a better man and a better leader as a result,'' he told a meeting of TeenPact, the Christian youth group. ''God uses our mistakes to draw us closer to him.''
 His contrition was not enough to win the race, but there were some signs that Georgia's evangelical Christians might be willing to give him another chance. In the last days of the campaign, Clint Austin, a Christian lobbyist who had previously worked for Mr. Reed, circulated a public letter among Georgia Republicans explaining why he had turned against him over what he considered his deceptive tactics. 
 ''It is time for Christians to confront and rebuke Ralph Reed, not make apologies for him,'' Mr. Austin wrote. ''If he truly repents (not just at election time), he can be a leader of unlimited potential.''

HEADLINE: No Time to Waste

 BODY:
Louisiana has begun the long process of distributing federal housing aid, giving hurricane-ravaged homeowners a chance to rebuild at last. It is only a pilot program as officials try to work the kinks out, but the doors are open at the first of what will be 10 offices, and checks should begin to arrive in August. At the same time, debris removal and the demolition of ruined houses have finally sped up. The number of permits issued by the city for home renovations continues to rise. And there is optimism in many corners about the Katrina-induced reform of New Orleans's troubled old school system. 
 These are hopeful signs for a city that has seen so much suffering, so many setbacks, but let's not forget where we really are. When the hurricane ended, did anyone imagine that nearly 11 months later there would be no citywide rebuilding plan? No one warned evacuees that many would still be in a cramped, miserable, unemployed stasis as Katrina's anniversary approached. Over a quarter of displaced evacuees remain jobless, compared with just 5.9 percent of those who could return.
It is a rebuilding effort on an unprecedented scale, but that is no excuse for dithering. There will be some waste and there will be some bad feelings; the effort is too large and too complicated for there not to be. We do not want haste, but people have a right to demand urgency.
 While the federal government has designated $107.8 billion for the Gulf Coast, only a fraction is for long-term reconstruction. The money is spread across five states, from Florida to Texas. Much has already been spent on the immediate sheltering of evacuees and the ill-conceived trailer program. 
 New Orleans will rise again only with the help of private banks and builders. But without a clear plan for the city, developers don't know where they can build and where they can't. Everyone is waiting for someone to take the lead. The federal government and the state have done their part. The city is still playing catch-up.
 Where some see progress, others see a comeback stalled. A Brookings Institution report found that the availability of public services like transportation and health care had gone flat. Evacuees wishing to return are plagued by a shortage of houses. As a result, the rent for a one-bedroom apartment has risen to $803, using a government fair-market estimate, compared with $578 before the storm. Those trying to rebuild have watched the cost of construction materials go up by 20 percent. And even as the power company pushes for a big rate increase, the city is still without reliable electrical service.
 Without sufficient progress, residents may opt to take state buyouts rather than tackle the difficult task of rebuilding. City leaders need to realize that they are still in a fight for the city's survival. The road home leads out of town as well.

HEADLINE: Inflation Crossroads

 BODY:
The stock market went a little manic last week. On Wednesday, prices surged, buoyed by investors' belief that rising inflation would not (necessarily) compel the Federal Reserve to continue in its two-year-old campaign to raise interest rates. On Thursday and Friday, prices dropped, as those same investors apparently changed their minds. But there's no such ambiguity when it comes to the impact of inflation on consumers, especially middle- and low-income people. It hurts. 
 The Labor Department reported this week that consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in June. That was half the pace of May, but the slowdown may be short-lived, since the decrease last month was due largely to lower energy prices, which have since risen. And even with June's relatively tame cost-of-living figure, inflation over the past year came in at 4.3 percent. Because middle- and low-income Americans spend a larger share of their incomes on essentials that tend to rise the most -- like gasoline, food, rent and utilities -- economists generally assume that inflation is more painful for them than for more affluent Americans.
 The pain of higher prices is intensified by stagnating wages. Despite the recent uptick in wage growth, once inflation is taken into account, hourly wages for most American workers fell 0.6 percent from June 2005 to June 2006. Only by working more hours have families been able to keep this year's pay on a par with last year's. But running faster may be an increasingly futile strategy. The new Labor Department figures show that inflation has also been accelerating in the last three months. If price increases were to maintain that recent pace, the annual inflation rate would climb to 5.1 percent. 
 Wall Street is hoping for a pause in interest rate increases, because that would presumably spur economic activity, which would be good for stocks. And investors aren't the only ones who stand to gain. A pause would also help workers because faster growth could further tighten a labor market that has just recently shown signs of tightening, leading -- finally -- to some real gains in wages.
 There's a knee-jerk reaction that says a rate-increase pause in the face of growing wages is a recipe for still more inflation. That's an overly narrow view. Throughout the current economic recovery, now nearly five years old, wages have never been the source of inflationary pressure. Moreover, wage gains do not automatically lead to higher prices. Higher wages could be absorbed by higher productivity or by a narrowing of the stupendous profit margins that corporations have enjoyed for years. 
 Whether Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, will see fit to pause is an open question. What is known is that most working Americans have been stuck for years in an economy that has brought higher prices and stagnating wages.

HEADLINE: Bring In the Quartet

DATELINE: Jerusalem 

 BODY:
With chaos threatening to engulf Lebanon, the need to resolve the conflict in the Middle East has rarely seemed so urgent. The Op-Ed editors went to seven experts with experience in the region, asking each of them what should be the first step toward defusing the crisis.
 
 WITH crisis comes hope that on all sides, people become sadder and wiser. I am sad and wise enough by now to realize that the very best option -- direct negotiations among the Israelis, Palestinians and Lebanese -- is unlikely. We need to turn to the next best option: substantial outside intervention based on the Saudi peace plan of March 2002. Israel's negotiating partner should be the Arab League, led by Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The Arab League can impose its authority on the Palestinians and the Lebanese; even the Islamists might accept an initiative under its auspices as legitimate.
But this course of action is also unlikely. If it doesn't happen, the so-called quartet (the United Nations, United States, European Union and Russia) should establish an international trusteeship over the Palestinian territories and southern Lebanon, with the goal of preparing the sides for direct negotiations. Like the trusteeship in Kosovo, this one would provide security and help the Palestinians create a viable economy and a credible negotiating team that includes all political factions.
 These two options should be tried consecutively: first, the quartet should try to recruit Egypt and Saudi Arabia, so as to resurrect the Saudi plan. If this does not work, the quartet should come up with its own initiative for trusteeship. The prime mover, in any case, is the quartet, and the United States should take the first substantial step. Many of us in the Middle East are sad and wise enough to know that outside intervention is our best shot.

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Worker Says Message on Torture Got Her Fired

BYLINE: By MARK MAZZETTI

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21 

 BODY:
A contract employee working for the Central Intelligence Agency said she had been fired recently for posting a message on a classified computer server that said an interrogation technique used by the agency against some terror suspects amounted to torture. 
 The employee, Christine Axsmith, kept the ''Covert Communications'' blog on a top-secret computer network used by American intelligence agencies. Ms. Axsmith was fired on Monday after C.I.A. officials objected to a message that criticized the interrogation technique called ''waterboarding,'' a particularly harsh practice that the C.I.A. is known to have used on Khalid Sheik Mohammed, who is widely regarded as the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks. 
The episode has opened a window into the new world of classified blogging: an experimental effort being carried out in top-secret computer forums where information and ideas are shared across the intelligence community. Intelligence officials said that since last year, more than 1,000 blogs had been set up on classified intelligence servers. 
 Ms. Axsmith, a computer security expert with a law degree, posted the message this month, shortly after the Bush administration decided to grant some protections of the Geneva Conventions to suspected terrorists in American custody. She said that her message began, ''Waterboarding is torture, and torture is wrong.''
 Ms. Axsmith's firing was earlier reported on several blogs including Wonkette.com on Thursday, and in Friday's Washington Post. 
 ''I wanted an in-house discussion,'' Ms. Axsmith said in an interview on Thursday in her home in Washington. ''Something where I would be educating people on the background of the Geneva Conventions.''
 Instead, Ms. Axsmith was fired by her employer, B.A.E. Systems, which has an information technology contract with the C.I.A. 
 Ms. Axsmith said C.I.A. officials had confronted her and told her that the agency's senior leadership was angry about the blog, which was housed on Intelink, the classified server maintained by the American intelligence community to aid communication among its employees. 
 Besides losing her job, Ms. Axsmith also lost her top-secret security clearance, which she had held since 1993 and used for previous work for the State Department and National Counterterrorism Center.
 She said she feared that her career in the intelligence world was over. ''It was like I was wiped out,'' she said. 
 A spokesman for B.A.E. Systems, Bob Hastings, said privacy issues prohibited him from commenting on Ms. Axsmith's firing. But Mr. Hastings said that company policy prohibited employees from using computers for non-official purposes. 
 Paul Gimigliano, a C.I.A. spokesman, said that the blogs were intended to ''encourage collaboration'' on business issues but that postings ''should relate directly to the official business of the author and readers of the Web site.''
 The C.I.A. denies that it uses torture to extract information from prisoners, although a 2004 report by the agency's inspector general concluded that some of its interrogation practices appeared to constitute cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. 
 In waterboarding, the interrogation technique that Ms. Axsmith criticized, a prisoner is strapped to a board and then made to feel as if he is drowning.
 In March 2005, Porter J. Goss, who was then the C.I.A. director, described waterboarding as a ''professional interrogation technique''; American military pilots and commandos are known to have been subjected to it during highly classified training regimes designed to prepare them to live in captivity. 
 The use of the practice, along with the agency's detention of approximately three dozen ''high value detainees'' in secret jails, has made some C.I.A. employees uneasy and has prompted a debate within the intelligence community. 
 Ms. Axsmith said she believed that the ''vast majority'' of people working for the C.I.A. were opposed to torture.
 And, she said that she believed that the classified blogs could be a critical tool to allow C.I.A. employees -- who are often prohibited from discussing their work even with other agency officials -- to vent frustrations. 
 ''The blogs are a safety valve for people to discuss controversial topics,'' she said. ''It reduces the chances that people may leak to the press.'' 
 In April, the C.I.A. fired Mary O. McCarthy, a longtime employee, for having unauthorized contacts with the news media. 
 Though stripped of her security clearance, Ms. Axsmith still maintains her public, unclassified blog: econo-girl.blogspot.com. On that Web site on Friday, there were several messages supporting her, including postings from anonymous intelligence officials who said that they would miss her ''Covert Communications'' blog. 
 Ms. Axsmith acknowledges that the posting that got her fired was deliberately provocative, and she said that if she had another chance she might have toned down the language. 
 ''I guess I'm just too much of a big mouth for that organization,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Writer Who Is Raising The Bar on Scottish Fiction 

BYLINE: By DINITIA SMITH

 BODY:
Scottish detective fiction, or Tartan Noir as it's called, with its brooding sensibility, brutal humor and fixation on the nature of guilt and punishment, has more in common with the Russian novel than it does with traditional detective writing. And Denise Mina, author of ''The Dead Hour,'' published this month by Little, Brown & Company, is one of a crop of contemporary Scottish writers, like Ian Rankin, Val McDermid, Louise Welsh and Christopher Brookmyre, who have made detective fiction Scotland's best-known literary form. 
 Ms. Mina's new novel is the second in a five-book series about Paddy Meehan, a spunky female reporter from Glasgow's Irish Catholic working class, surrounded by a garrulous group of mostly Protestant, and drunken, male colleagues at the fictional Scottish Daily News. They refer to Paddy, who is plump and always dieting, as ''wee hen'' or ''fat cow.'' But she fights back. ''Did ye lie awake last night, Shug, staring down at your fat, ugly wife in the dark,'' she snarls, ''wondering why your kids grew up to hate ye?'' 
 ''She's a nippy bitch,'' said the gaminlike Ms. Mina, 39, over breakfast recently at the Warwick Hotel in Midtown -- adding, with her nicely rounded ''r's,'' ''She's quite rude.''
 In the first Paddy book, ''Field of Blood,'' Paddy (for Patricia) was a trainee who helped solve the murder of a 3-year-old. In ''The Dead Hour,'' she is promoted to ''night calls'': crimes and accidents. She glimpses a blood-covered woman through a doorway, but a man gives her a $:50 note to go away. Later, the woman is found murdered. Paddy is guilt-ridden. Though she is being stalked, she is determined to find the killer.
 Crime fiction sells better in Scotland than literary fiction, said Andrew Diamond, the crime fiction buyer for a Waterstone's bookstore in Glasgow, where ''The Dead Hour'' was a best seller this summer. ''Literary fiction tends to be seen as English,'' he said, referring to the long history of conflict between Scotland and England.
 Scotland, the birthplace of Robert Louis Stevenson and Arthur Conan Doyle, has a tradition of the detective novel. The efflorescence of Tartan Noir began in the late 1970's amid renewed debates about Scottish independence from Britain, Ms. McDermid said, with William McIlvanney's novel ''Laidlaw.'' 
 ''The Scottish started to question who we are, and the idea of having a Scottish Parliament reared its head again,'' she said. ''Crime fiction is the fiction of social history. Societies get the crimes they deserve.'' 
 Ms. Mina stands out because of her focus on the Catholic underclass, Ms. McDermid said. ''Denise is a great channeler of the voices normally despised and disregarded.'' 
 Ms. Mina's books are also political and social commentaries. A feminist with a law degree, she has written about abused women in the legal system. Her female characters are flawed but strong. The heroine of her first novel, ''Garnethill,'' is a sexually abused former mental patient. In a later book, ''Deception,'' the heroine is a forensic psychiatrist accused of murdering a serial killer. 
 Her writing is imbued with a keen sense of place -- in the Paddy books, the ruined landscape of mid-1980's Glasgow. Once a major industrial city, Glasgow had much of its economy destroyed during the Thatcher years. Tensions festered between impoverished immigrant Irish Catholics, confined to housing ''schemes'' or projects, and Protestants. In recent years the city has undergone a revival and is filled with galleries and boutiques. ''Bigotry is more a feature of soccer now,'' Ms. Mina said. 
 Like Paddy's, Ms. Mina's roots are Glasgow Irish Catholic. Her father, James, escaped anti-Catholic discrimination by educating himself as an engineer and moving his family all over the world as he rode the crest of the new oil prosperity. 
 Also like Paddy, Ms. Mina was a rebel. In the late 1980's she had a Mohawk and piercings and, though she received a law degree, decided not to finish the subsequent training and dropped out. Working in a bar frequented by drunken journalists, she gathered material for her future novels.
 Still ambivalent about a law career, she studied for a doctorate in law and psychiatry and won a grant for a thesis proposal on ''differential ascription to male and female offenders.'' But reading the work of the French deconstructionist Jacques Derrida taught her how subjective language was. She realized that her ideas would reach a wider audience if they were in a story. So, she said, ''I used my grant money to write a novel,'' ''Garnethill,'' published in 1998. 
 For 10 years Ms. Mina has lived with a forensic psychologist; she won't name him because he works with violent offenders. They have two children: Fergus, 2 1/2, and Owen, 11 months. ''I'm terrified to get married,'' Ms. Mina said. ''I'm not getting married till my gay friends can.'' 
 She is currently in the middle of writing 13 episodes of the DC Comics series ''Hellblazer.'' Her story is called ''Empathy Is the Enemy.'' ''I'm interested in other forms of narrative,'' she said, explaining that she is drawn to the dark themes of comics because she is melancholy, and because she likes to tell the kinds of tales that have not been told. ''I am interested in the way stories define a life.'' 
 Ms. Mina intends to make her Paddy novels a history of modern journalism. In the first, ''Field of Blood,'' the reporters are rough and self-educated. ''Journalism is a Darwinian process,'' she said, though ''newspapers are a work of art.'' The chief editor, Farquarson, known as the Beast Master, does his job while drunk. Meanwhile, the top reporter, JT, would ''sell his mammy for a story,'' Ms. Mina said. The sportswriters make up stories because ''there is never enough news.''
 But in ''The Dead Hour,'' journalism has changed. Farquarson is fired and the smooth, educated Ramage is hired to take the paper down-market and raise circulation. Ramage gets rid of the old gang, cuts expenses and demands increased productivity. He creates new columns, which guarantee copy and cost fewer man-hours to write.
 In the third Paddy novel, Ms. Mina said, her heroine becomes a columnist. A typically discontented journalist, Paddy hates it.
 ''To have a very strong opinion all the time is corrosive to a person's intellect,'' Ms. Mina said. ''It becomes your default position. It means that she can't weigh anything properly. This book is her search for something she really does believe in.'' 

Other Masters of Tartan Noir

IAN RANKIN -- The best known of the Tartan Noir authors for his series set in Edinburgh about the foul-tempered, out-of-shape, alcoholic detective John Rebus, who, despite breaking the rules, always solves the crime. So far, Mr. Rankin has written close to 30 books.

LOUISE WELSH -- She broke through with ''The Cutting Room'' in 2003. It tells the story of a gay auction-house worker named Rilke, who, while going through the estate of a wealthy Glaswegian, discovers a collection of Victorian pornography and pictures of an apparent snuff crime. Using his contacts in Glasgow's sexual underworld, he sets out to find the identity of the woman in the photographs.

CHRISTOPHER BROOKMYRE -- Known for his anarchic humor and surreal imagination, Mr. Brookmyre has written at least 10 books. His main character is a caustic investigative reporter in Glasgow, Jack Parlabane, another flouter of rules, who is frequently drawn into solving political crimes.

VAL MCDERMID -- Scottish born, Ms. McDermid lives in England, where she has set many of her mysteries, although they are suffused with her brooding Scottish sensibility. Her more than 20 books often have recurring characters: the criminal profiler Tony Hill, the detective Carol Jordan, the private investigator Kate Brannigan and the reporter Lindsay Gordon. In ''The Distant Echo,'' published in 2003, four friends at St. Andrew's University in Scotland, on their way home from a drunken party, discover a woman dying of stab wounds. There are repercussions for years to come.

HEADLINE: Fewer Treasuries but More Stocks On Foreigners' U.S. Shopping Lists 

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
ONLY two years after foreign central banks had become virtually the only net buyer of United States Treasury securities -- and thus the financier for United States budget deficits -- these banks have turned into net sellers of securities. 
 The Treasury reported this week that foreign central banks were net sellers of Treasuries in May, as they had been in March. The May sales, of $14.3 billion, were the largest for any month since August 1998, when the United States government was running surpluses and the supply of Treasuries was shrinking.
The United States needs to attract big investments from overseas to finance its large and growing trade deficit and its ability to get such investments from private, as opposed to official sources, is closely watched by some traders as a sign of whether the dollar may decline further.
 Thus, the latest results appeared positive. Nongovernment foreign investors plowed $90 billion into American securities, with more money going into corporate bonds than into Treasury securities.
 The charts show totals over rolling 12-month periods, smoothing out what can be volatile monthly figures. In the 12 months through May, foreign official institutions, mostly central banks, bought a net $137 billion of long-term American securities, including Treasuries, government agency bonds, corporate bonds and common stocks. That number, while sizable, is well below the record of $245 billion purchased in the 12 months through September 2004.
 But other foreigners -- whose investments presumably reflect a search for profit rather than the central banks' desires to prop up the dollar -- bought a record $939 billion of such securities. That is more than $100 million an hour for an entire year.
 A substantial part of those investments were in United States common stocks, although enthusiasm for such stocks fell in May, a month of market turbulence; foreigners bought just $3 billion of such stocks then, down from $21 billion in January.
 Even with that decline, however, the 12-month net purchases of stocks came to $125 billion, the highest since 2001, when purchases were falling after the bursting of the technology bubble. As market timers, overseas investors have a very poor record in the American stock market. 
 At one point in 2004, the entire United States budget deficit was being financed by overseas investors, with Americans as a group being net sellers of Treasuries. At that time, the vast majority of overseas purchases were by central banks, and total foreign purchases for the 12 months through October 2004 came to $361 billion. 
 But in the most recently reported 12 months, net foreign purchases of Treasuries, including Treasury bills as well as longer-term securities, came to only $69 billion -- the smallest annual total since early 2002, when United States budget problems were just starting to appear.
 What that means is that it is Americans who are now largely financing their government's deficit, buying an additional $196 billion in Treasuries over the 12-month period. Foreign purchases financed just over a quarter of the United States government's deficit spending, the smallest share since the era of budget surpluses came to an end.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Confirms That It Is Developing a Competitor to the iPod 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The Microsoft Corporation confirmed yesterday that it was developing a portable music player to compete with the iPod from Apple Computer for a share of the $4 billion market for portable entertainment devices. 
 The first products are to go on sale this year and are being developed under the code name Zune, the general manager, Chris Stephenson, said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Part of the project is a service that will compete with Apple's iTunes.
Microsoft is abandoning a strategy of relying on partners to produce devices with its Windows software to compete with iPod. They so far have failed to dent Apple's 77 percent share of the market in the United States for digital music players, according to the market researcher NPD Group Inc. Even with its own product, Microsoft has an uphill climb.
 ''It will take an awful lot for Microsoft to dislodge an entrenched competitor like Apple,'' an analyst with Jupiter Research, Michael Gartenberg, said. ''Given Apple's history with iPod, it's not like they're going to sit back while Microsoft enters the market.''
 Stock in Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., rose $1.02, to $23.87 a share.
 Microsoft's statement, sent by a spokeswoman, Sally Julien, provided no description of the products. She declined to comment further or to make a Microsoft official available. Apple said it had no comment. Record labels and broadcasters may be eager to work with Microsoft to blunt Apple's power in dictating prices, Mr. Gartenberg said. Still, Microsoft will face difficulty matching Apple's appeal both with consumers and media companies.

HEADLINE: What the Naive Consumers Don't Know, Can Help You

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN. 
E-mail: yourmoney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When Xavier Gabaix and David Laibson open a hotel room minibar, they see among the tiny liquor bottles and European chocolates a perpetual battle between companies charging hidden fees and the sophisticated consumer trying to avoid them. 
 The two economics professors -- Mr. Laibson at Harvard and Mr. Gabaix at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Princeton -- have looked at how companies hide fees and costs. They found that sophisticated consumers have somehow learned how to game the system by having enough naive consumers around to subsidize them.
The smartest strategy, they say, is for the sophisticated consumer to choose the service with the most hidden charges and highest add-on prices, but then avoid paying those added costs. ''The sophisticated consumer takes advantage of that,'' Mr. Gabaix said. ''The naive pay all the fees.'' 
 Companies hide add-on costs, of course, because it is lucrative. Hewlett-Packard sells inexpensive printers and makes its profit on high-margin replacement ink cartridges that can cost half as much as the printer. The fastest-growing segment of Wells Fargo's banking business is income from fees, up 14 percent in the latest quarter. 
 Consumers see fees everywhere, in their cellphone and credit card bills, mail-order invoices, mutual fund statements, car rental and hotel charges. Actually, most consumers (particularly those who do not start their Saturday mornings reading financial advice) do not see them or they spot them too late. And that myopia perplexed the two professors.
 Economic theory says shrouded fees should not happen. A competing company should come along and tell consumers just how bad its competitors are for extracting those fees. Epson should be telling the world how much Hewlett-Packard charges for ink. Marriott should be pointing out Hilton's parking fees and phone surcharges. But that rarely happens, and Mr. Laibson likens that to the dog that did not bark for Sherlock Holmes.
 ''My view of the world is that people usually make smart choices, but sometimes they make mistakes,'' Mr. Laibson said. ''Why doesn't the market fix the problem?''
 In a paper appearing in The Quarterly Journal of Economics with the academic title of ''Shrouded Attributes, Consumer Myopia, and Information Suppression in Competitive Markets,'' the professors say that price-cutting and educational advertising do not always benefit the bargain-seeking consumer. A company would hurt itself if it described how its competitor loads on the fees, they said. 
 They argue that drawing attention to the rivals' fees just alerts the sophisticated consumer that the rival is actually offering a better deal. Transparent Hotel could advertise a no-added-fees $100 room and point out that Nontransparent Hotel really charges $145 for its $70 room. If a consumer goes with Nontransparent and avoids the add-on fees, he ends up paying less, the economists said. He would advise going to the hotel with the lowest room rate and avoid any fees, assuming -- which economists love to do -- that factors like location and safety are equal.
 The result for the well-meaning company is harsh. Its advertising might hurt the rival in the sense that consumers pay fewer fees there, but it is increasing the number of sophisticated consumers and teaching them to choose the other guys. It is unlikely to draw in the sophisticates. ''That business won't make much money once you understand how the world works,'' Mr. Laibson said. ''What's the benefit to the company?'' 
 It is a far better business strategy to have the naive subsidize the sophisticated. The way the market solves this problem, in other words, is not by educating consumers, but by having the sophisticated consumer exploit the opportunities. Sophisticated consumers are not really taking advantage of companies, nor are companies taking advantage of consumers, as much as companies are helping those sophisticated consumers take advantage of the less sophisticated consumer. 
 For example, you see an offer for a room at Nontransparent Hotel for $75 (which costs the hotel $100 to provide). The guy checking in behind you also rents a room, but will rack up $70 in fees from the minibar, the phone and garage parking (all of which cost the hotel $20 to provide). You, on the other hand, were not tempted by the minibar, used your cellphone for calls and took public transportation to the hotel. The other guy subsidized your room. 
 Smart consumers now have a strategy. They should go to the company offering the discounted product even if the company has loads of hidden fees. The sophisticated consumer then exploits the company by taking the below-cost product and shunning the fees. ''It's a perpetual battle between the firm that fools consumers into paying fees and the smart consumer who can avoid them,'' Mr. Laibson said. 
 Getting cheaper goods and services subsidized by the naive consumers works as long as you know what you could be charged. But it does not pay if too many people know the same thing.
 Shrouding of information rarely goes away because there are new generations of myopic consumers and even the sophisticated consumers are forgetful or distracted and end up paying for add-ons. The professors say that new shrouding techniques constantly evolve as companies find fresh ways to generate additional revenue. ''Now that the world is more complicated with more products, there are more opportunities for people to make mistakes,'' Mr. Gabaix admits. 
 That said, outsmarting companies is hard work. Hewlett-Packard does not tell consumers the price-per-page cost of its printers on its Web site, for example. You have to hunt for the information and do the math yourself. Hotels in South Florida rarely tell you while you are making reservations or checking-in that you will face a $25 ''resort fee,'' which is ostensibly imposed to cover your use of the pool and deck chairs. A recent study of purchases on eBay showed that consumers responded to direct costs more than to shipping costs. 
 Even the most sophisticated people find it hard to game the system when it comes to fees. In earlier research, Mr. Laibson and two colleagues, James Choi of Yale and Brigitte Madrian of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, learned that even the most knowledgeable people make really dumb decisions even when provided all the information.
 Wharton is a top business school and its graduates will be leading companies. The students there should be pretty smart about financial matters, right? 
 The academics asked a number of the school's M.B.A. students how they would allocate $10,000 among five indexed mutual funds. Each student was given the fund prospectuses, where investment strategies and fees are outlined. The academics expected the students would put all of the money in the fund with the lowest fees since index funds invested in identical stocks. But some students went chasing the highest historic returns. Others wanted to spread risk by dividing the money among a number of funds. Only 6 percent did the expected thing.
 Then Mr. Laibson and his colleagues made the test easier. Instead of giving them just the funds' prospectuses, he gave them a sheet of paper that summarized the fees of the five funds. ''We thought that would make it more transparent,'' he said. ''We were unshrouding the information.''
 Only 19 percent got the correct result.
 Or you could say that the smart segment of the market saved money because it was subsidized by the ignorance of the others.

HEADLINE: Health Secretary Is Questioned On Use of Family Foundation

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21 

 BODY:
Members of Congress expressed concern on Friday about an arrangement under which Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, took more than $1 million in tax deductions for property contributed to a family foundation that gave only small amounts to charity in its first four years. 
 But Mr. Leavitt defended the arrangement as proper. Dane O. Leavitt, a brother of the secretary, said that family members had been ''prudent stewards'' of money that would benefit their community for generations. 
But Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, said that using a family foundation for personal benefit ''does not reflect responsible stewardship on the part of a cabinet-level official.''
 The secretary's parents, Dixie and Anne Leavitt, created the foundation in 2000. They and their six sons gave it stock in an irrigation company appraised at $8 million. Dane Leavitt, chief executive of the family business in Cedar City, Utah, said the foundation contributed relatively small sums to charity from 2001 to 2004 because the stock was not generating much income. 
 But since the stock was sold in 2005, for more than $11 million, Dane Leavitt said, the foundation has given away much larger sums, $567,185 last year and $691,221 in the first half of this year. The biggest recipients include Southern Utah University, in Cedar City, and the Mormon Church, he said. 
 The irrigation company owned rights to water in an area of Nevada settled by the Leavitt family and other Mormon pioneers in the 19th century. Dane Leavitt confirmed that some of the foundation's assets had been lent to insurance agencies under the umbrella of the family business, Leavitt Group Enterprises, of which he is chief executive. 
 In an interview, Dane Leavitt said the borrowers were paying market rates of interest, and he asserted, ''We have been good stewards of the assets of the foundation.'' The value of the water rights has grown in recent years, along with the population of Nevada, the nation's fastest-growing state, he said.
 But several lawmakers cited details of the Leavitt Foundation, reported Friday in The Washington Post, as an example of the type of abuse that Congress should prohibit.
 Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the senior Democrat on the panel, expressed their concern in a letter to President Bush. 
 ''It is not enough to encourage charitable giving,'' the senators wrote. ''We have to make certain that the money given actually goes to help the community and those in need.''
 The senators urged Mr. Bush to support legislation that would crack down on ''supporting organizations'' like the Leavitt Foundation. Such tax-exempt organizations are supposed to support public charities. But the Internal Revenue Service has found that they can be used to benefit wealthy donors and sometimes return money to donors, in the form of loans that are never repaid. 
 Dane Leavitt denied any abuse by his family's foundation and said its loans to Leavitt companies were being repaid on schedule. 
 But the foundation may have to change its practices if Congress approves the new restrictions, being considered as part of a bill to overhaul the nation's pension system. ''If the law changes, we will change our practices to be consistent,'' Dane Leavitt said.
 Michael Leavitt said, ''My family and I are grateful that we have the resources to give back to our community.'' 
 Christina Pearson, a spokesman for Mr. Leavitt, said, ''The activities of the foundation are perfectly legal and appropriate and were reviewed by the Senate Finance Committee during Secretary Leavitt's confirmation.''
 Committee aides said it was misleading to suggest that the panel had signed off on the activities of Mr. Leavitt's foundation. Indeed, they said, lawmakers did not know about the loans when they confirmed his nomination in January 2005.

HEADLINE: Weather Sizzles, but the Fed Chief Stays Cool

BYLINE: By Mickey Meece

 BODY:
A HEAT wave gripped the nation, which kept one wary eye on the bloodshed in the Middle East and the other on a barrage of corporate earnings, Fed news and economic reports at home. 

ECONOMIC UPDATE -- Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, blew cool air on worries about creeping inflation, expressing optimism that 17 consecutive increases in short-term rates may be enough to fend off inflation. The breeze extended to Wall Street, which rallied on his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
On the second day of his semiannual update on the economy, before the House Committee on Financial Services, Mr. Bernanke repeated his message. This time, the market reaction was muted. 
 Minutes from the last Fed meeting suggest that policy makers may pause when they next gather on Aug. 8. The benchmark federal funds rate on overnight bank loans stands at 5.25 percent.

ON THE INFLATION FRONT -- The Labor Department reported that food and fuel pushed wholesale prices to an unexpectedly high level in June. The Producer Price Index rose 0.5 percent; economists had expected a 0.3 percent climb. The higher price of chickens, eggs, fruits and other foods added 0.3 percent to the overall Producer Price Index. Energy prices climbed 0.7 percent.
 A day later, the government said that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent last month, an increase that was in line with forecasts. Still, the core rate, which excludes the more volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.3 percent, a faster pace than anticipated.
 The Fed keeps a close eye on growth in the core rate. Analysts said the wholesale price report suggested that manufacturers might be pressed to pass along higher production costs to wholesalers, who, in turn, could charge retailers more, and, ultimately, squeeze consumers.

TECHNOLOGY MADNESS -- In the middle of a mixed bag of technology earnings, Microsoft announced that it would buy back $20 billion of its own stock by Aug. 17, and another $20 billion over the next five years. Even though its profit lagged in the recent quarter, its shares rose on the buyback plan.
 The story was different for Dell, whose shares fell sharply after it warned that its fiscal second-quarter earnings due out Aug. 17 would fall far short of Wall Street's expectations. Dell cited more intense price competition. 
 Sluggish sales of personal computers and aggressive pricing may also trip up the chip makers Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Computer and component makers are awaiting Microsoft's next operating system Vista, which is expected to ship to consumers in January, but may be delayed by a few months, analysts said.

WAL-MART PREVAILS -- A federal judge struck down a Maryland law that would have forced Wal-Mart Stores to spend more on employee health care benefits. The judge ruled that the federal law governing such benefits should take precedence.
 The Maryland law required companies with 10,000 or more workers -- only Wal-Mart met that threshold -- to spend at least 8 percent of their payrolls on health insurance or pay the difference to the state Medicaid fund.
 The ruling was seen as a major setback to other states considering similar legislation. It is unclear how the decision, which applied to Maryland only, would affect laws already passed in Massachusetts and Vermont. 

THE END IS NEAR? Steven M. Theede, the American president of the Yukos oil company of Russia, resigned in a letter to the board, saying he had exhausted legal avenues to fend off bankruptcy and regain lost assets. He delivered the letter in advance of a bankruptcy hearing in Moscow.
 Creditors, including the state oil company Rosneft, met this week and will reconvene Tuesday to decide whether to recommend bankruptcy or accept a recovery plan presented by Yukos.
 Mr. Theede's exit suggests the end of Yukos is imminent. A ruling in the bankruptcy case is expected Aug. 1. 

U.S. CRACKDOWN -- The United States stepped up its legal efforts to thwart online gambling. Federal agents arrested David Carruthers, the chief executive of BetOnSports, a prominent Internet gambling company that is publicly traded in Britain, and charged him with illegally taking bets from United States residents by phone and the Internet. Mr. Carruthers was detained in Texas en route to Costa Rica, where BetOnSports has operations.
 Through his lawyer, Mr. Carruthers maintained his innocence. The government filed charges against 10 other people involved in BetOnSports and three Florida marketing companies that prosecutors say were involved in promoting illegal gambling.
 A detention hearing yesterday in Fort Worth was postponed and moved to St. Louis, where a new date has not been set. Even though BetOnSports is based in Britain, where its form of gambling is legal, it temporarily shut its Web site.

HEADLINE: Uncle Sam, Deadbeat Debtor?

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
THE United States ''is going broke.'' That's the conclusion of a new article by Laurence J. Kotlikoff, a professor of economics at Boston University who specializes in analyses with really, really long time horizons. You may not want to sell your Treasury bonds just yet, though.
 The article, in the July-August issue of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, asks bluntly whether the United States is bankrupt. But Professor Kotlikoff doesn't use the definition of bankruptcy that is commonly applied to people and companies. 
That definition usually implies an inability to pay the interest on one's current debts, with no future prospect of being able to pay without changes in circumstances. The professor drops the first part of the definition, asking instead whether the nation can pay all of its obligations in perpetuity, given reasonable assumptions. The answer, he says, is probably not.
 He bases this conclusion, in part, on a paper written by Kent Smetters and Jagdeesh Gokhale for the Treasury in 2002 and published by the American Enterprise Institute in 2003. 
 The paper puts the gap between all the government's expected liabilities and its probable revenue at about $60 trillion, in today's money, depending on the assumptions. That's about five years' worth of gross domestic product, or a few decades of tax revenue at current rates.
 Yet as Professor Kotlikoff points out, that enormous number is not the one that traditionally grabs the attention of financial markets. They are more concerned about the government's official debt -- the sum of all the bonds, notes, bills and other loans that are actually outstanding -- and whether it will be able to make its interest payments.
 There's nothing illogical about that; bondholders' main concern, after all, is their bonds. It's in the market for those bonds, however, where Professor Kotlikoff's definition of bankruptcy and the more conventional one may eventually meet.
 When lenders sense that a government may not be able to pay its debts in the future, they start to demand higher interest rates for new loans in the present. With those rates come bigger interest payments, squeezing the government's budget at the worst possible time. 
 As the squeeze tightens, the market demands more and more interest until it finally refuses to lend. Then the government can no longer roll over its debt. Fear of the government's inability to pay tomorrow can produce an inability to pay today. 
 In this market, the first part of the conventional definition -- not being able to pay the interest on one's debts -- is called a default. A default by a government doesn't necessarily imply bankruptcy. Often, a default relates to temporary problems with liquidity. But these defaults do lead to the same sort of events that occur when a company goes bankrupt: a plan to pay off creditors in order of seniority, a reorganization of its costs and a big dip in credit ratings.
 Countries, of course, aren't liquidated if they fail to reach an agreement with their creditors. But if the United States is bankrupt, in the sense Professor Kotlikoff prefers, it will have a limited amount of time -- a ''small window,'' he says -- to figure out how to pay its debts and reorganize itself, default or no.
 There won't necessarily be a big signal when this process begins. So far, there has been mostly talk: talk of changing Social Security, talk of cutting fat from the government budget. That talk hasn't turned to action, though, and under this administration Congress has even added costly benefits to Medicare.
 There is a reason to focus on Social Security, Medicare and the government's spending. During a company's bankruptcy, creditors are paid before shareholders. If countries followed the same rules, bondholders would be paid at citizens' expense. 
 But countries that go into default don't always cut programs and entitlements until they can pay every bondholder. To do so would be politically unpopular, to say the least; what leader would stand in front of the population and say, ''We're going to pay off those foreign investors before we pay your pension''? 
 This strategy of putting citizens before investors worked most recently for Argentina, and American politicians could very well adopt it, too. The problem is that the United States, unlike Argentina, is not exactly a small country in the world's financial markets. A default by the Treasury, whose bonds have long been the markets' gold standard for safety, would be an event of Armageddon-like proportions.
 So, from Professor Kotlikoff's perspective, the United States may already be bankrupt, and may even be trying to reorganize itself, albeit slowly. Unless that process succeeds, he argues, the world could be headed toward the ugliest default in history.
 It is, of course, possible that the American economy will make such strides in productivity that the economy will grow incredibly rapidly, and tax revenue will easily enable Uncle Sam to pay everything he owes. But until there is some concrete basis for that kind of optimism, a crucial question will remain: Who will be the first to start listening to warnings like Professor Kotlikoff's -- the financial markets, or the politicians?

HEADLINE: The Haunting

BYLINE: By John Hodgman. 
John Hodgman is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author of ''The Areas of My Expertise.''

 BODY:
One bright afternoon last summer, I sat in a Chinese restaurant outside Regina, Saskatchewan, talking horror movies with Danny and Oxide Pang.
When it comes to horror, Danny was saying, Americans crave explanation. ''Every detail has to be logical. Why is the ghost flying? Why is the ghost walking? Why does the ghost attack that guy and not the other guy? They keep asking.'' He shook his head slightly in frustration. ''This is a ghost movie,'' Danny said. ''Ghosts are already illogical.''
 Born in Hong Kong in 1965, the Pang twins have directed, separately or together, a half-dozen films: crime stories, thrillers, psychological dramas, comedies. But they will always be known for their ghosts, specifically those that haunted their best-known film, ''The Eye,'' which came out in 2002. It told the story of a young blind woman who has her sight restored by a surgical procedure and soon realizes that her new corneas also allow her to see ghosts. 
 If you must know, the ghosts do not fly. They occasionally walk, and they don't really attack anybody. They mainly just mope spookily around on their own ghostly business, puttering in hallways and hanging out in stairwells, taking turns creeping out the heroine until they are escorted to the afterlife by a mysterious group of smudgy, leotarded grim reapers.
 Like many Pang films, ''The Eye'' deploys a startling visual palette -- strategic blurs, cuts and off-kilter framing that combine, in a way, to blind the audience just as the main character is gaining her sight. The ghosts are felt more than they are seen -- the way we feel the prickle of someone reading over our shoulders in the subway. In one of the film's more memorable moments, the heroine boards an elevator and senses the presence of an elderly man floating somewhere behind her, dryly sucking at the air, seemingly trying to get her attention. We instantly sympathize: the sequence is only marginally more tense than getting caught in an elevator with a stranger who isn't undead, and naturally, she doesn't turn around. Oxide, Danny's very-slightly-older, slightly-more-roguish twin, told me that this scene caused much of Hong Kong to stop taking elevators altogether, but he said it with such self-satisfied mischief in his eyes that it was difficult to take him seriously.
 The Pangs were in Saskatchewan making their first English-language horror film, ''The Messengers,'' due to be released in early 2007. It is the story of a Chicago family who flee the city to the peace of a Midwestern sunflower farm, only to find themselves menaced by a family of ghosts and a murder of angry crows. The film is being produced by Ghost House, one of a number of new all-horror production banners, though Ghost House has a pedigree: it is a joint venture between Joe Drake and Nathan Kahane of Mandate Pictures, on the one hand, and on the other, Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert, who more than 20 years ago made the seminal vacationing-teenagers-stalked-by-evil-wood-spirits film, ''The Evil Dead.''
 When I had lunch with the Pangs, they were already several weeks into shooting. I asked them how it was shaping up. Danny laughed ruefully. ''Right now, it's really logical,'' he said. 
 ''We tried to combine it together,'' Oxide said. ''To make it logical and keep it scary. We're trying to learn.''
 ''The Eye'' was the Pang brothers' first Hong Kong production. Before then, they lived and worked primarily in Thailand, where they started out in commercials. But the particulars of their geography did not seem to matter in 2002. After the underground success of the Japanese haunted-videotape film ''Ringu,'' in the late 90's, and the mainstream success of its English language remake, ''The Ring,'' in 2001, the U.S. was not picky about what part of Asia it got its scares from. And so ''The Eye'' picked up a limited theatrical release in the States, a small eddy in the dark, inky wave of Asian horror films and remakes that have swamped our shores over the past five years. 
 ''The Ring'' led the way, followed by the haunted-house movie ''The Grudge,'' the haunted Roosevelt Island movie, ''Dark Water,'' and the forthcoming haunted-computer film, ''Pulse.'' All derive from Japanese films that were already cult hits on video in the U.S. when they were remade here, and like ''The Eye,'' they are all spooked by similar preoccupations: the supernatural reasserting itself within the rational world, often via the very technology that had banished it (be it VHS tapes, modern medicine or, as in ''Pulse,'' the Internet -- a kind of MySpace.com of the living dead); the replacement of traditional horror movie ''scares'' with slow, spooky elevator rides; and also, creepy children, who either are ghosts or just hang around with them. 
 Though the wave has subsided somewhat, the aftereffects of the Asian ghost boom are still being felt. Once confined to big-city video stores, original Asian horror titles have begun to infect even the most remote suburban chains (largely because of the efforts of Japanese producer Taka Ichise, whose ''J-Horror'' line of original, straight-to-DVD Japanese-language horror films has spawned its own wave of English-language remakes). And more generally, the Asian horror boom has opened America to a provocative new generation of talented foreign directors who might otherwise have languished in art houses or on video. It undoubtedly cultivated an audience for provocative directors like Park Chanwook of South Korea and Takashi Miike of Japan (even though their brilliant, sometimes grueling physical-psychodramas cannot really be described as horror -- their fondness for cutting off tongues and feet in their films notwithstanding). Beyond Asia there is England's Neil Marshall, whose subterranean thriller ''The Descent'' is one of the most anticipated horror films of the summer; France's Alexandre Aja, who recently remade Wes Craven's seminal 70's vacationing-family-stalked-by-mutants film ''The Hills Have Eyes''; and Australia's James Wan and Leigh Whannell, whose $1.2 million Rube Goldbergian mutilation film ''Saw'' boggled Hollywood with an $18 million opening weekend in 2004. 
 For directors like the Pangs, the Asian ghost boom might not get them straight to Hollywood (they will not, for example, be directing the American remake of ''The Eye,'' currently in development), but it did get them to Regina. 
 Though I'd been in Regina for a couple of days, this lunch was the first time I'd ever seen the Pangs together. As is typical of their collaborations, they were directing the film on alternating days: one supervised the set while the other worked on a rough edit of the previous day's shots -- a time-saving technique developed on the perpetually rushed productions they are used to. While both speak English rather proficiently, they had brought along their own assistant director from Hong Kong to interpret their often spare direction: a grim, round man named Cub, who has one of the most imposing deadpans I've ever encountered. Cub described the difference between making a film in Asia and making a film in Hollywood this way: ''There's more food here. Every day, two hours before the real meal, there will be sandwiches. So every day when sandwiches come around, we know: two hours to lunch.''
 I visited the set on an Oxide day. While the interiors were being shot on a local sound stage, the sunflower farm scenes were staged in a hot green valley some 50 minutes north of Regina. In addition to the steady stream of food, there were other cues that this was a set buoyed by the typical though still-startling largess of a Hollywood budget. The Pangs chose the spot in the valley that most appealed to them visually, and a two-story family home was built there from scratch -- all peeling paint and dying vines on the outside; on the inside, a hollow plywood shell. It was surrounded by some 60,000 actual sunflowers, planted from seed, with another 20,000 silk sunflowers from China on standby. 
 Dylan McDermott, who plays the father of the family, was wandering around the set wearing a bloody shirt with pitchfork holes in it. The Pangs were shooting a scene at the house where McDermott's character, Roy, would be taken away on a stretcher as the family of ghosts looked on from an upstairs window. 
 Jason Shuman, one of the film's producers, pulled Oxide aside. 
 ''Did you see Roy? Is it too much blood?''
 ''No,'' Oxide said. ''He'll be covered with blankets.''
 ''And the ghosts.. . .'' Jason said. ''They don't look like ghosts anymore. They just look like people. Is that O.K.?''
 ''Of course, of course,'' Oxide said. 
 Meanwhile, Cub was standing nearby, offering his regular 1,000-yard stare, when he was approached by a young guy who had been hired to take photos of the production.
 ''What do you say in Hong Kong when you want to say, 'Action'?'' the young photographer asked.
 ''Action,'' Cub said, without pausing or even moving his eyes.
 ''Really?'' said the young guy. ''You say 'action'?''
 Cub stared straight ahead. ''Yes.''
 At that moment, Oxide swooped around the ambulance and the stretcher, examining angles. He explained to the visual-effects supervisor what they wanted for this scene.
 ''Camera looks up,'' he said, indicating a second-floor window. ''We see the ghosts. Then it tilts up. The crows fly. Camera tilts down. The ghosts are gone. We can cue them, and they just move. No special effect!''
 Oxide went on to explain how he wanted to have the crows fly out over the roof of the house. The production had a barn up on the ridge full of 16 trained ravens from the Czech Republic, for situations when actual crows are required to perch menacingly, for instance, on the rim of the baby's crib. Oxide prefers the real ravens (''No special effect!''), but in this case he relented and agreed that digital ravens would probably be more practical.
 Then, almost reluctantly, Oxide walked back over to the monitors to let the scene begin and called out: ''Action.''
 Horror, like comedy, has always been something of a reptilian-brain endeavor, unusual among the arts insofar as it is successful only when it is able to produce a single, audible emotional effect -- a scream or a laugh -- that is primal, cathartic and difficult to understand. This is one reason that horror has always been a director's medium: the horror movie is a contraption, and it takes a certain organizational flair to design, pace and frame a scare.
 About a month before I went to Regina, I visited Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert in Raimi's office, along with their partner in Ghost House, Joe Drake. The term that kept coming up was ''roller coaster.'' ''It's the novelty of a horror-movie concept that attracts the audience,'' Tapert was saying. ''They want the new and the different. They want the roller coaster built with new curves in it.'' 
 Tapert and Raimi, who met in college at Michigan State, first learned how to build a horror movie in 1978. They were just 24 and 19, respectively. Along with Raimi's high-school friend Bruce Campbell, Raimi and Tapert had worked on a Super 8 offbeat comedy. But the only kind of feature film they could raise money for, Tapert figured, was a horror movie. So they all went to the drive-in. 
 ''Everyone else was making out in the cars around us, and these three geeks were actually watching the movie,'' Raimi recalled. ''A tremendous amount of European films came into America back then, and they were horror and soft-core for the drive-ins. None of them ever made it to the hard tops.'' Raimi paused and laughed softly. ''That's a term they don't even use anymore.
 ''We'd watch these films, and they always had 30 minutes of slow stuff. Then they had a good scare. Then there was another 15 minutes of slow stuff. Then there was a good suspense sequence. Then there was more slow stuff. Then a good ending. 
 ''So after about 20 of these, Rob and Bruce and I said, 'Why don't we just make one that has all the good stuff and skip the slow stuff?'''
 The result was ''The Evil Dead,'' shot on half a shoestring in a decomposing cabin in the Tennessee woods in the winter of 1979 and released in 1983. Drawing as much from the Three Stooges as from classic horror films, it was economical, unrelenting and infused with a kind of manic ingenuity -- particularly in the swooping evil-spirit P.O.V. shots that would become a Raimi trademark, and the distressing spectacle of a young woman being molested by a tree. One executive who turned the script down in disgust called it 90 minutes of the possession scene from ''The Exorcist.'' Tapert would later tell me with a smile that the guiding principle for ''The Evil Dead'' was this: ''Punish the audience.''
 While ''Halloween'' and ''Friday the 13th'' ushered in a decade of masked-killer films that would define horror in the 80's, ''The Evil Dead'' nestled into the cult following that accrued around a pack of uncompromising American horror films from the 70's, including George Romero's zombie films, Wes Craven's ''Last House on the Left'' and Tobe Hooper's ''Texas Chainsaw Massacre.'' The films were often laced with corrosive social commentary, and their low budgets gave them an amateur, near-documentary feel that would make them all the more harrowing. There were rarely ever any slow parts -- just a constant, anxious buzz. 
 By the 90's, however, horror had waned as a genre. Countless iterations of ''Friday the 13th'' and ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' had fallen into rote familiarity and low comedy and gradually disappeared, to be replaced by the knowing self-parody of the ''Scream'' films. Horror didn't go away, but with the drive-ins gone, it found new, often-profitable exile in the direct-to-video market. Raimi, meanwhile, left the genre behind, making ''Evil Dead 2'' as a kind of satire of the first, and turning to pure slapstick by the second sequel, ''Army of Darkness.'' In 1998 he earned acclaim for his somber, humane thriller, ''A Simple Plan,'' and then brought a reverent, pulp sensibility to ''Spider-Man,'' which made the film among the most successful in history and Raimi an A-list director. 
 It was around this time that Joe Drake founded his own production company, which would become Mandate Films. Drake had spent years selling movies to overseas territories for studios like Lions Gate, and he takes obvious pleasure in measuring the market's appetite. Later he would tell me a story about a producer acquaintance of his who had gone to Indonesia. ''He asked the Indonesian buyers what they wanted, and they said, 'Creature stories.' And so he asked, 'What creatures?' And I don't remember the exact order, but it was something like snakes first, and then alligators, and then tigers. And so he made a movie with a tiger fighting an alligator.'' 
 By 2002, Drake began to sense that there was an audience for well-made, modestly budgeted genre movies that wasn't being served. He and his business partner, Nathan Kahane, decided to start a single-genre production banner, and they wanted a name director to headline it. They were thinking maybe comedy, until Raimi's and Tapert's names came up. Then the path was clear: horror. Drake remembered being amazed by two things about the pair: that they would be interested at all, and that the entire deal was struck with a handshake. ''We actually shook hands,'' he said again, astonishment in his eyes. 
 This was not the way it was supposed to be. Horror was traditionally B-movie territory. It had long been a place where A-list talent might start out -- Francis Ford Coppola with ''Dementia 13,'' for example, or James Cameron with ''Piranha II: The Spawning'' -- but not one where it typically longed to return. But by the early 00's, the distinction between A movies and B movies was blurring, in no small part because of the success of the Asian horror remakes. ''The Ring'' and ''Dark Water'' were attracting Academy Award nominees and lending the genre respectability it hadn't seen since Gregory Peck tried to kill the devil child in ''The Omen.'' 
 In the meantime, the 70's horror library, from the iconic (''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'') to the pedestrian (''The Amityville Horror'') has been profitably plundered for remakes (though curiously, the remake of ''Amityville'' was stripped of its Satanic subtext, filling in the scares with a dare-I-say typically Asian vengeful ghost plot line, plus a rousing gabled-rooftop chase scene). And for the first time in a decade, the hard-core, largely male horror fans who long ago had been ceded by Hollywood to the direct-to-video market are now being lured back to the theaters with a string of violent, hard-R horror films.
 Consider Eli Roth's ''Hostel,'' which opened at No. 1 in January, replacing ''The Chronicles of Narnia.'' Like many horror films, it opened at around $20 million. Not a huge amount, but bear in mind that its budget was less than $5 million. And bear in mind that it was an R movie, thus reducing its potential audience, and what's more that it was an R-rated movie about teenagers running afoul of an elite torture club in Slovakia. Bear in mind that this $4.8 million R-rated torture movie has gone on to earn some $80 million worldwide, and you might get a sense as to why studios seem eager to rely on scare-driven niche films to offset what they're really frightened of: a changing marketplace in which box office is besieged like a teenager in a cabin by DVD sales and the looming threat of the Internet and on-demand cable distribution; where the great mass-market monsters of old like ''King Kong'' or ''Mission: Impossible III'' can open at two to three times the audience of the average horror movie and still be considered, on Monday morning, a tragic, wounded beast. 
 Joe Drake is allergic to the suggestion that he saw any of this coming. ''I think right now the horror feature is defying gravity,'' he said. ''We're all kind of looking at it going, God, another horror movie has opened well. It sort of defies logic.'' Nor is it to suggest that Raimi's and Tapert's instincts to get back in the horror game were in any way mercenary; if anything Raimi seems genuinely delighted to be back, reputedly going over every Ghost House script and marketing campaign with avid, affectionate attention. It's only to say that, while the drive-ins where Tapert and Raimi initially studied the horror movie have disappeared, drive-in movies are thriving in a way they haven't in decades.
 Initially, Raimi and Tapert thought they would give a Ghost House movie a very specific, recognizable structure, going back to the formula they had teased out of the drive-in. ''We did start with a very hard formula of five sequences of six minutes of suspense,'' Raimi recalled, ''no less than 18 scares. Because we knew that three or four would be cut, and three or four wouldn't work, but we'd end up with 10 or 11 really jolting, leap-out-of-your-seat moments for the audience.'' 
 All that changed when they saw the original Japanese-language version of ''The Grudge.'' Tapert and Raimi were not new to Asian cinema and the talents that were incubating there. They had worked a lot of kinetic, Hong Kong-style action into their 90's TV series ''Xena: Warrior Princess,'' and they produced John Woo's first English-language film. But this was a roller coaster that they had not seen before. ''Ju-on,'' as it was originally titled, was a quiet film about a house with a ghost rattling in the attic and a curse that attached itself indiscriminately to even the most casual passers-by. It had little discernible plot or logic, jumped back and forth in time and moved at the speed of dread. This was nothing but the slow stuff. 
 And yet, it was shot entirely on practical locations -- the kind of stripped-down, efficient, uncomfortable kind of horror filmmaking that Tapert and Raimi had started out in. And in no small part because of its novelty and nightmarish strangeness, it delivered a number of new curves. As Tapert put it: ''A little black cat is scary. Evil little kids are scary. But evil little kids who mew like a cat?'' He laughed, still shivering. ''Well, that's a new combination.''
 In an unusual turn, Raimi and Tapert hired the original director of ''The Grudge,'' Takashi Shimizu, to helm his own English-language remake of the film, even though he speaks no English. Shot in Tokyo, it's exceedingly faithful to the original, except with more computer-generated imagery and the pointed addition of a rooftop scene in which a Japanese police office explains to Sarah Michelle Gellar the logic of the story's central haunting. 
 After the success of the ''The Grudge,'' the proposed Ghost House formula would be thrown out the window. Just as Tapert and Raimi had rewritten the rules of the horror movie back at the drive-in, now they would look all over the world for directors who could build them a new roller coaster. 
 The first film the Pangs made together was a ghost story. 
 ''It was so simple,'' Oxide told me on the set one afternoon during lunch. ''A man, at midnight, looking in a mirror, peeling an apple.'' It's a Chinese folk tale, he explained: if you peel an apple at midnight in one unbroken piece, you see your future in the mirror. If you break the peel, a ghost appears.''
 I asked him if that's what happened in this short film. 
 ''It's not complete yet,'' he said. ''I shot it in the corridor of my building. It was low lighting, so when we shot it, it was black. So we didn't finish,'' he laughed. ''We were 14.''
 ''How old are you now?'' I asked.
 ''Fourteen?'' he said, eyebrows raised, and then he collapsed in laughter. 
 In fact, both Pangs are 41, and their lives have entwined with the typical amount of creepy mischief you might expect from identical twins. Growing up in Hong Kong, they regularly switched identities in the classroom, and when they saw my tape recorder, Danny introduced himself as Oxide almost reflexively. After ''The Eye,'' each of the brothers decided to make a movie on his own: ''Leave Me Alone,'' by Danny, and ''Ab-Normal Beauty,'' by Oxide -- both thrillers involving zero ghosts. When they watched the rough edits, they realized that both films featured a pivotal car accident at about the 10-minute mark. It was too good a joke to pass up: Oxide asked for Danny's accident footage to replace his own. 
 They first worked together as adults in 1999 on ''Bangkok Dangerous,'' a fierce, pulpy crime film about a deaf-mute hit man that combined the Hong Kong-style operatic action and the Thai-Buddhist languor of the Pangs' twin homelands. Here they first and most boldly developed their style: an audacious cascade of varying film stocks, colors and speeds that is equally adept at capturing the agonizing slow motion of a sexual assault as it is the strangely painterly image of a man fighting off a horde of phantoms with his own luminous flatulence. 
 This latter scene is from the ''The Eye 10,'' which, despiteits title, is the second and probably final sequel to ''The Eye.'' The film, which the Pangs directed in Hong Kong and Thailand, is controversial even among their fans for jettisoning the story of ''The Eye'' altogether and replacing it with a buffoonish teenage comedy, including a ghostly break-dance fight. In fact, ''The Eye 10'' perfectly captured the Pangs' eagerness to move from genre to genre, to learn and to move on. 
 ''After our action movie,'' Oxide said, ''we wanted to make a ghost movie.''
 ''Why?'' I asked. 
 Oxide said, simply, ''To try.'' 
 ''We want to make action, comedy, ghost movies.. . .''
 ''You want to make everything?'' I asked.
 ''Yeah, yeah, yeah,'' Oxide said.
 When asked what attracted them to this particular movie, Oxide's answer was swift: ''Sam Raimi.'' The Pangs had seen Raimi's work as kids in Hong Kong and loved it.''The pacing, the pacing!'' Oxide exclaimed, perhaps not surprisingly: much of Raimi's early work and all the ''Evil Dead'' films lurch wildly between real, sometimes affecting earnestness and pure clowning.
 When Raimi first invited them to consider the script of ''The Messengers,'' the story involved an evil scarecrow that demanded human sacrifice. This was not entirely to the Pangs' liking, so they proposed two major changes. Instead of a scarecrow, there should be ghosts, and there should be a creepy child: an infant who can see the ghosts but cannot tell anyone about them. 
 Almost immediately, the Pangs started sketching out the scares, designing and framing the film first on scraps of paper and then on storyboards as the script was still being written. They were not terribly concerned with the plot that would connect and make sense of these moments. In fact, talking to Oxide now, the whole idea of plot seemed remote, strange, overly logical. Asian movies, he said, are allowed to be ''unreasonable,'' and to his mind, scarier. ''With a scary movie,'' he said, ''when the audience comes out of a theater, all that matters is whether it's scary. No one says, this scary movie is so cool. It's so reasonable.''
 Later I would speak with Mark Wheaton, a screenwriter, about this view. Wheaton worked on the final draft of ''The Messengers,'' a job he received in part because of the credentials he earned as a writer for Fangoria, the magazine of record for the horror fan base. According to Wheaton, the American horror film had been defanging evil for decades. By the end of the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' series, he said, you pretty much knew what would happen the moment the lights went down: ''Whoever the last girl standing is defeats Freddy.'' But in Asian horror, there is no puzzle to solve that will chase off the illogical ghosts. The characters in ''The Grudge'' are haunted not because of a past sin that they can atone for, Wheaton said. They are haunted because they walked past the house. ''This movie put the fangs back in and said: 'Actually, you aren't strong enough to beat this. Hollywood was wrong. You cannot win.''' 
 ''The Eye'' is a perfect example of this differing sensibility. At the end of the movie, the heroine waits in a traffic jam. She begins to see masses of the grim-reaper ghosts assembling amid the cars. The audience sees that a truck accident ahead is about to set off a gas explosion that will kill everyone for blocks around. As the heroine begins screaming at everyone around her to run for their lives, the American viewer sees, almost disappointingly, a classic resolution: she has only a few minutes to save the day. How will she use her rare and unusual power for good? Will she follow the ghosts to the disabled truck? Will the heroic boyfriend help her? But then the truck explodes, and the heroine is left wandering among the charred remains of mothers clutching their infant children. 
 Oh, thinks the American viewer. Or, that could happen. 
 While it's a grisly scene, it's not so much the fatalities that are alien and troubling as the fatalism -- far more so than a meowing child. Much hay has been made about the connection between the headiness of the horror market these days and the national mood after 9/11. And it is true that, between unrelenting natural disasters and the war on terror, we are feeling pretty jumpy. The last time we were this existentially freaked out as a nation was directly after Vietnam, when Raimi and his colleagues were rewriting the rules of horror. Curiously, though, Hollywood's remakes of those very films often turn them upside down: where the cannibal clan in ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' was a subversive distortion of the classic American family, its remake is not grueling but comforting, drenched in the sheen of big budgets and nostalgia. With few exceptions, we have given over the real scary questions to those who were not born here: Do you need to be threatened with certain death in order to at last appreciate life (''Saw'')? Why go on living once your entire family has been killed (''The Hills Have Eyes'')? 
 Perhaps because it is so difficult to face, we seem to be off-shoring our deepest fear, the creeping terror of the day: despite our rare and unusual power, what if we cannot stop the evil? What if we can't win? 
 I asked Oxide again if there was a reason he and his brother were attracted to ghost stories, other than just wanting to try them out. 
 He nodded. ''It's like U.F.O.'s,'' he said. ''It's something you will never get an answer to.''
 I asked him if that meant he would make a U.F.O. film.
 He nodded quickly, eyebrows raised, ''Later!'' he said. ''Later!''
 I went back to the set on a Danny day. 
 ''They're very into eyes,'' said Penelope Ann Miller, who plays the mother of the family. ''One time, Oxide told me to look to the right and hold it. But I looked to the left for one second. All of a sudden, Cub's arms went up in the air, and I said: 'I'm sorry! I'm sorry!'''
 Both brothers direct with spare efficiency. They are used to telling stories without a lot of language, for international audiences, with very precise visuals, and doing it fast. When one actor asked to go back to an earlier part of the scene to get into character, Danny didn't understand. Why would they go back to something he's already shot? ''Danny told me,'' Miller said, ''you have to empty your cup to drink from my tea.''
 But now, as the sun went down over the sunflowers, Miller told me that the brothers had softened to the American system. In one of the last scenes of the film, Miller's character is supposed to come out to the yard carrying lemonade. The family has survived, but the cost has been high, and the scene is supposed to be silent and calm. But she couldn't help herself. She put her chin up and announced, ''I have lemonade!'' 
 Immediately filming stopped. Jason Shuman, the producer, said: ''No! It's too corny!'' 
 ''But Danny said, 'I love it,''' Miller said. '''It's so American!'''
 With the sun nearly set, the horror over for the day, Penelope Ann Miller laughed. ''I couldn't just stand there. Who makes lemonade without saying they made lemonade?''

HEADLINE: The Case of Marie and Her Sons 

BYLINE: By Daniel Bergner. 
Daniel Bergner, a contributing writer, is the author of ''In the Land of Magic Soldiers: A Story of White and Black in West Africa.'' His last article for the magazine was about a missionary family in Africa.

 BODY:
To make the letter look right, Marie needed a computer, so one day in March she walked to a public library. There she composed at the keyboard, but the writing didn't go well. She had the first of her five children at 13, spent part of her teenage years in a group home and part in the home of her crack-addicted mother and never reached high school. ''You know,'' she told me later, ''the way I sound sometimes doesn't sound like it's supposed to.'' But she wasn't leaving that library without the letter she needed. College students were studying nearby, and Marie, who is 29, interrupted one of the girls. To this stranger, she confided her situation. And soon, with the girl's help, she began again. 
''To whom it may concern,'' she typed, ''I am writing to you to appeal for the return of my children.'' Marie (I am using her middle name, as well as the middle names of her children, to protect their privacy) lost her kids, all of them boys, to the State of Connecticut more than a year ago. The Stamford office of Connecticut's Department of Children and Families has placed the boys in an array of shelters and foster homes; it has recently found potential adoptive parents for four of them; and earlier this month it filed a petition to end Marie's role and rights as a mother. If the department, known as D.C.F., succeeds in court, she will lose her children forever.
 For the time being, Marie is still entitled to spend about one hour each week with her sons. I first met her in early April, in a visiting room at the Stamford D.C.F. office. A cloth wall-hanging of panda bears in a classroom adorned one scuffed wall, and crayon scribbles covered another. Christopher, who is 3 and Marie's second-youngest, was sick that day and had stayed at his foster home, and Joseph, at 16 Marie's oldest, had fled during an outing with the family's D.C.F. social worker, Annette Johnson, the previous October and was nowhere to be found. So just three of the boys gathered around Marie, who is Puerto Rican-American and wore her long fingernails painted pink, her dark hair pulled into a ponytail with a powder blue tie, a gold nose stud, several tattoos, blue jeans and tan work boots. Between the ponytail and her short, square build, she looked half cheerleader and half fullback. She managed her cranky blond year-and-a-half-old baby, Diomedes, in her lap, and played a game called Jumpin' Monkeys with Antonio and Anthony, who are 8 and 6 and shot plastic monkeys from a spring-loaded launcher, trying to hook them in the branches of a little tree. In her low, raspy voice she gave them advice when they missed (''Papi, you got to hit it soft'') and congratulated them when they scored (''You got a banana!'').
 ''Give me a kiss,'' she said, and Anthony, who has black bangs, dark almond-shaped eyes and delicately curved lips that sometimes spread into a beaming smile, did. ''Let me try for Mommy,'' he demanded, and climbed into Marie's lap alongside Diomedes. He launched a monkey for his mother.
 ''Can I use the bathroom?'' Antonio asked.
 ''Don't touch the toilet seat,'' Marie warned.
 ''Could you read us a book before we go?'' Anthony begged, time running out. ''Please, now?''
 Marie took a book from a table and began steadily: ''Simba and Nala at play.''
 Her steadiness lasted through goodbye. But when Johnson loaded the boys into a blue D.C.F. van to be delivered back to their foster parents, and when the van turned out of the parking lot and disappeared, Marie started to tremble. ''They're going T.P.R.,'' she said, referring to the department's plan to file for termination of parental rights. ''I did everything they asked me. I'm trying to believe this is what God wants, but I can't believe this.'' She said that at birth, Christopher had tested positive for marijuana, that Diomedes had been born positive for marijuana and cocaine. ''I fell in the game. I messed up, I know I messed up, but all I did was the drug use. I addressed everything. I've been clean for a year. I went inpatient. I have the paperwork. My kids are going to be taken from me for good.''
 I asked if I could accompany her home. It was a chance to see her house the way the D.C.F. social workers often see the homes of their clients, showing up with no appointment, no warning, allowing no time for the clients to prepare, to clean, to hide the depths of their lives' disarray. I was ready for dilapidation outside, decay within. We took a taxi through Stamford, a city of about 120,000 with glass-sheathed corporate headquarters, beachfront mansions and crouched, decrepit houses fronted by rusty fences. A bright white picket fence surrounded Marie's small home, on a modest, resilient block. The pale yellow clapboard facade looked freshly painted, and inside the wood floors gleamed. So did every surface in the kitchen, except the refrigerator, which was covered with fruit-shaped magnets -- pears, strawberries -- and pictures of the children. I asked how long she had lived here, wondering if she had just moved in, if there hadn't been time for the place to become run-down.
 ''Three years,'' she said. Disability payments for epilepsy and money from the family of Diomedes's father helped pay the rent. She showed me the spotless highchair that awaited Diomedes's return, and in the tiny bedrooms downstairs, the children's beds and toy box and shelves of precisely aligned kids' DVD's, all looking like a display in a furniture store. At the kitchen table, she laid out letters and drug-test results from the state-supported treatment programs she had attended, all proving that for the past year, since a few months after Diomedes's birth in December 2004, she had stayed drug free. One program noted Marie's ''motivation and commitment to her recovery.'' Another wrote that she ''has been a pleasure to work with'' and ''appears to be doing everything that she can to get her kids back home with her.''
 Marie knew that the department doubted not only that she had enough strength to stay clear of drugs but also that she was fully committed to the boys and that she had enough skills to successfully mother them -- especially Antonio, who has attention deficit and hyperactive disorder. She showed me more of her library work: a three-page printout from the Web called ''The Gift of A.D.H.D.'' Alongside her drug-test results she set a gold-trimmed graduation certificate from a state-financed ''nurturing/parenting'' class, where, a letter from the program described, she had been taught ''positive parenting technique'' over a minimum of seven two-hour sessions.
 The next week, at a special outdoor visit with her kids in the park across from the D.C.F. office, Marie arrived with a pink plastic serving bowl full of homemade chicken, yellow rice and peas. She doled out the picnic lunch in red and blue bowls and plucked a small bone from a piece of chicken so Christopher wouldn't choke. After they ate, Antonio and Anthony played with a Wiffle Ball and bat she had bought for the occasion, and after the visit, the social worker who had quietly supervised it, Beverly Maybury, who was not the family's regular worker but had spent 17 years with the child-welfare systems of New York and Connecticut, said, ''People are complicated.'' Maybury is an African-American woman with a nose stud much like Marie's, gold streaks in her hair and a taste for beaded-and-embroidered jeans. ''Maybe some of these people at D.C.F., they think it's cut-and-dried, but people who've seen some of the spice of life, been through some things, they know it's not that way. Those kids are bonded. Maybe someone's going to say she's not parenting, but look at that food, that looked pretty parenting to me. We can't just throw people away. She's clean. She's showing up for her visits. She's playing with them. You've seen that house, it's spick-and-span.''
 During the visit, Anthony noticed something different about Marie in her midriff-baring T-shirt. ''Mommy,'' he asked as she gathered up the bowls, ''you got another baby in your belly?''
 She did, and soon learning this, the department decided it would petition the court while the baby was still in the womb. Based on ''predictive neglect,'' it planned to claim her sixth child, permanently, the instant it was born. 
 Pictures of Marie's children decorate Annette Johnson's cubicle. Perched atop one of the cubicle's partitions, above the piles of case reports on her desk, is a Peter Pan Happy Meal pirate ship, a gift from Antonio on a day Johnson treated him to a McDonald's lunch. A miniature Ninja Turtle, a present from Anthony, sits nearby, beside a figurine of a girl playing the fiddle, an offering from another child Johnson watched over for a time.
 Around her, the 30 or so staff cubicles and eight supervisors' offices form a Stamford D.C.F. headquarters that looks nothing like it did when Ken Mysogland, D.C.F.'s Stamford-area director, started out as a social worker 17 years ago. Back then, he recalls, the electricity was sketchy, the lighting bleak, the phones unreliable. Workers shared broken desks as each strained to deal with caseloads of 50 or 60 at a time. Spurred by a 1989 lawsuit and 1991 federal court consent decree, the department has gradually transformed itself. Its budget has tripled in the last decade, and it appears close to working itself free of court-imposed goals and monitoring. At the Stamford office, all is bright, all is functional; the staff members are each responsible for 15 to 20 cases, and though the work can be frantic, the social workers seem to have at least a bit of time to weigh decisions about the families they investigate and oversee. 
 Most of these families live in hard-pressed sections of the city and its surrounding towns, in a part of the state that lies beside Long Island Sound and is celebrated as ''the gold coast.'' 
 When Johnson, who is black and in her mid-40's, first came to the department two and a half years ago, she desperately hoped that she would never take a child from its family forever. For the child, she explained, her thickly braided hair falling in a spirited way over the collar of a pinstriped suit, the complete and final failure of a parent can be more traumatic than a parent's death. 
 Before following her mother into social work in the early 1990's, Johnson was a marketer for Procter & Gamble, making sure that the company's cleaning products were well placed on store shelves. Yet she had, in fact, seen plenty of what Maybury called ''the spice of life,'' and not only while doing social work with the homeless, substance abusers and mentally ill before joining D.C.F. Her younger brother had been a drug trafficker's mule: he swallowed a cocaine-filled condom, the rubber tore open inside him and he died of the overdose. Six of her cousins died because of addictions to heroin: from overdoses, from AIDS. 
 Johnson's age and master's degree in social work make her an exception among her Stamford colleagues; even her brief time in child welfare makes her ''senior staff,'' she said, joking. Across the room, a 24-year-old with a year's experience was getting ready to seize a newborn, whose enraged mother had tested positive for PCP when she checked into the hospital to deliver. ''You want me to get a car seat?'' a colleague called out, helping the 24-year-old get ready. Child seats lie on file cabinets, beside desks, beneath stairs, waiting.
 Turnover in the office is constant and quick. ''I've seen someone leave a Post-it on her computer, 'I quit,' and never come back,'' Ilia Morrows, a 29-year-old who has spent four years with the department, said. It wasn't only the acute awareness that a child could be killed if you made the wrong decision -- and that it could be you being named on the local TV news. It wasn't only everyone's knowledge of the summer before last: three deaths -- a 14-year-old's suicide; an infant's suffocation, possibly accidental but definitely suspicious; a toddler's baking to death in the back of a car -- two in families under the watch of the Stamford office, the third in a family that had just moved to Stamford after being investigated and cleared by another D.C.F. office. It wasn't only the knowledge of 7-year-old Nixzmary Brown, who had recently been allowed to remain with her family by New York City's child-welfare system and was reportedly beaten to death by her stepfather. It was also the extreme authority, the burden of holding it, of wielding it, the prerogative to enter a family's home and split it apart. ''It's almost hard to comprehend that we have that ability,'' Morrows said. ''It's so huge.''
 The staff is made up of investigators and treatment workers, with investigators handling the initial unannounced knock on the door after a report of abuse or neglect comes into the state's hot line. Investigators have up to 45 days to decide whether to take a kid into D.C.F. custody, or to leave him at home but compel the family to accept the department's long-term help, or to deem a report unsubstantiated and let the case go. During this time they can enter the house again and again and interview school nurses and neighbors, anyone who might know how well or terribly a child is being cared for. To take control of a child for longer than four days, the department needs a judge's approval, but if a social worker senses that a child is at immediate risk, a supervisor's signature on a form known as a ''96-hour hold'' will let her walk away with that boy, that girl or all the children in the house.
 Johnson is in the treatment unit, which inherits cases from investigations and focuses not only on the protracted evaluation of families but also on guiding and, ideally, strengthening them so that children don't have to be removed or so that those who have been seized can be returned. (''Reunification,'' as it is called, is the outcome for about half of the 3,000 children D.C.F. takes into its care each year statewide.) A treatment worker might send an abusive father to group counseling for men who batter, a mother like Marie to a hospital program for substance abusers, a child to individual therapy, all with private providers under contract with D.C.F. But to be part of the treatment unit does not mean that you don't take kids. Morrows, who is now in investigations, told me that during her first year with D.C.F., in another office, she had a treatment case with a family whose three children -- an 11-year-old girl and boys who were 9 and 8 -- suddenly confided that their father, an alcoholic, was coming home drunk, waking them and forcing them to kneel on rice or punching them in the stomach. If they doubled over from his blow, he commanded them to stand bent that way for long periods until he allowed them to straighten. 
 ''You can't do this, you can't take my babies!'' Morrows remembered the mother pleading, collapsed in agony on the floor, when Morrows tried to invoke a 96-hour hold after the father refused to move out of the home and the mother would not leave with the kids. ''Do something!'' the mother screamed at her husband. Outside the apartment, neighbors gathered in the hallway of the run-down complex -- ominously, Morrows said, because D.C.F. is a known and not very welcome agency in the city's poor neighborhoods. Slightly built and self-restrained, she waited. On her cellphone with her office, she was told that the police were on their way. But now, amid the mother's sobbing, the kids told Morrows they would not go, that everything they'd said was a lie. The police, when at last they arrived, had to grab the children, lifting them in their arms. Two of the kids clung to the frame of the front door with both hands as they were carried out. The cops had to pry at their fingers, wrestle their bodies through.
 ''I almost started giggling hysterically,'' Morrows said, describing how she nearly broke down. ''I really wanted to sit on the floor with Mom and cry.'' Then she recalled her feelings hours later, in the aftermath of what had been her first removal: ''I was shocked at what my job is, at the career choice that I had made. I went home thinking, How do I have this power? In this state, in this country, the government can come in and take your kids. Tell you you're unfit to take care of your kids. It was earth-shattering to me. It rocks you to your core.''
 Johnson, in her work with Marie and her boys, longed to turn away from this power. Talking about Marie, she didn't begin with the present, with the clean drug tests; she began, emphatically, with the past, focusing on the crack addiction of Marie's mother. From that, as Johnson told it, anarchy had taken hold of Marie's life: the first child at 13; the group home; charges for robbery; time spent incarcerated; marriage to a drug dealer; the dealer's fathering Antonio and Anthony before being deported to the Dominican Republic; the birth of Christopher, whose father was a drug addict (three men had fathered Marie's first four boys); the marijuana in Christopher's system when he was born; the addict's trying to rob Marie in front of the children, wielding a gun, beating her.
 Johnson wasn't yet with the department at the time of this assault, but she knows the case record deeply and, at her desk in the spring, recounted the history to me in quiet tones of pain and near-helplessness. Above her head, Antonio's pirate ship sailed off toward the horizon, while Anthony's Ninja Turtle gazed down on her like a minute talisman the child had given to his protector to ensure that she do well on his behalf. In October 2003, a few weeks after the assault by Christopher's father, Marie's oldest son, Joseph, then 13, ran away from home and was gone for three days. ''He alleges,'' the case record states, ''that mother hits and punches him in the face. . .that mother has kept him home from school to watch younger children and clean house while she goes somewhere.'' Then, in December 2004, Marie had Diomedes, by yet another man, and the newborn, six weeks premature and weighing three and a half pounds, had cocaine running through his body and brain. Soon the case was Johnson's, and it wasn't long before she was praying over a prospect, T.P.R., she could hardly bear to contemplate. ''I asked God to enlighten me,'' she said. ''I asked God for help.''
 Parens patriae is the legal principle, about four centuries old, that lies behind cases like Marie's. It lies behind the child-welfare investigations into the families of three and a half million children in the United States in 2004 (the last year for which statistics are available). Each year around 300,000 children are temporarily removed and 65,000 to 70,000 of those children are ultimately taken from their parents forever, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Parens patriae is the doctrine that empowers government institutions to venture into the intimate realm of child-rearing and effectively deputizes social workers like Annette Johnson and Ilia Morrows to knock on the doors of family homes and gain entry. Translated from Latin, parens patriae means ''parent of the country''; it entrusted the king of England to be the ''general guardian,'' in the words of the 18th-century legal scholar William Blackstone, ''of all infants, idiots and lunatics,'' of all who were helpless. 
 In colonial America, when parents viewed their children, far more than they may now, as economic assets, as laborers essential to the family's survival, parens patriae played out differently than it does today. Offspring were a family's property, and public authorities kept their distance, according to Brenda G. McGowan, professor of social work at Columbia University. The primary exceptions were orphans and the children of paupers, who were often put in almshouses until they turned 8 or 9. Then they were old enough to be indentured.
 Not until the mid-19th century did American society begin to see itself as responsible, in any modern sense and on any vast scale, for rescuing desperate children. Compelled by the destitution of New York City's thousands of street kids, Charles Loring Brace, a Methodist minister, founded the Children's Aid Society in 1853, proclaiming, ''The great duty is to get these children of unhappy fortune utterly out of their surroundings and to send them away to kind Christian homes in the country.'' He and his staff knocked on the doors of shacks and tenement rooms, persuading impoverished parents to sign their children over to the society and loading them, along with children from orphanages, onto the nation's new trains, headed West. A few days later, in distant towns, where farmland was plentiful and labor was scarce, the children climbed down from the locomotive cars to be lined up on the stages of meeting halls. Farmers squeezed muscles and prodded teeth before agreeing to take them on as members of their families. 
 By the program's end in 1929, more than 100,000 children had ridden toward new homes. Members of the Catholic clergy saw Brace's system as a way to snatch the Catholic children of the urban poor and convert them to the Protestantism of the hinterlands. Other critics made comparisons to the slave trade. But Brace, with his vision of saving the young by settling them in redemptive homes, is credited as a kind of founder of foster care.
 It is the story of a lone 9-year-old girl, though, that stands as the symbolic beginning of work like Johnson and Morrows's. Mary Ellen Wilson ''stood washing dishes, struggling with a frying pan about as heavy as herself,'' wrote the missionary who discovered her in a Manhattan tenement in 1873. ''Across the table lay a brutal whip of twisted leather strands, and the child's meager arms and legs bore many marks of its use.'' The girl's neighbors had told the missionary about the way she was kept locked in an inner room and was never seen outside -- the neighbors didn't know how to help, and neither did the missionary once she talked her way past the girl's caretaker (whom the girl called Mamma but who was not her natural mother) at the apartment's door and had a glimpse of the waif. The missionary was ''tempted to apply to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,'' she wrote, but she ''lacked courage to do what seemed absurd.'' The absurd was her only resort, though, and at last she went to the society's president in New York and persuaded him to take the case. He sent an agent, posing as a census taker, to gain access to the apartment and gather evidence on the girl's condition. Mary Ellen's caretaker was sent to prison after a highly publicized trial in 1874; the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children was started that same year; and similar organizations -- privately run but heeded by the police and the courts -- quickly sprang up around the country.
 Beginning in the late 19th century, driven partly by a growing middle class that could afford to see children as innocents in need of protection rather than as miniature members of the work force and spurred, too, by a multiplying -- and, to many, frightening -- immigrant population that seemed in dire need of socialization, the American public intervened more and more in the way the nation's children were raised. Government agencies replaced the private organizations in the early 20th century. And since the 1960's, according to Martin Guggenheim, a professor at New York University School of Law, the exercise of authority by those agencies to enter the sphere of child-rearing -- and to sever children from their parents -- has surged, propelled by public-health campaigns against child abuse, by media attention to the relatively rare horrific deaths of children from maltreatment in the home and by a quest for swift conclusions, for ''permanency,'' as child-welfare workers call it. Prevailing developmental theory urges that children of parents like Marie should not be allowed to languish long in temporary care while their mothers (the fathers are often secondary figures, at best) try to redeem themselves and reclaim their kids. So while the goal known as ''family preservation'' generates a steady supply of newly designed programs, and while the field of child social work is in constant search for a panacea to keep families together, present policy thinking also reflects a conflicting idea: kids should be channeled efficiently toward adoption. 
 At the level of policy, the emphasis on speed has been influenced not only by developmental theory but also, as Guggenheim sees it, by a confluence of left- and right-wing agendas -- by children's rights advocates, who tend to view the interests of the child in opposition to those of the parents, and by fiscal conservatives reluctant to spend money on lengthy efforts to help underclass women sort out their lives. In 1997, Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which links federal money to states' efforts to move children toward adoption after they have been in temporary care for 15 of any 22 months. Across the country, between 1997 and 2003 (the most recent year for which statistics are available), adoptions through child-welfare agencies increased by more than 60 percent. The legislation honors the current wisdom that establishing new stability is more beneficial for the child than struggling for years, with uncertain results, to preserve the bond with the parent he has known. But one inherent effect is that in the domain of American child welfare, the doctrine of parens patriae is more powerful than it has ever been. 
 For two years before Diomedes's birth in December 2004, D.C.F. investigated and chronicled the chaos of Marie's life with her sons, but it monitored more than intervened, and eight months before Diomedes was born it closed the case, partly because Marie had compliantly gone to be evaluated by a substance-abuse program, which determined that she didn't need treatment, and partly because her household could sometimes seem, to visiting D.C.F. staff members, to be tranquil, with one report noting Antonio doing his homework and, at his mother's direction, obediently pouring orange juice for his younger brother Anthony. 
 Premature and positive for cocaine, Diomedes spent his first month in the hospital, and the department was ready to take all of Marie's kids until she got herself clean. But Marie's mother, who shed her crack addiction years earlier, volunteered to move into Marie's house and care for the five boys while her daughter underwent treatment. At the time, D.C.F. knew nothing about the mother's history; records of her having deserted her own children were buried within old files kept by the child-welfare system of New York City, where Marie grew up. And D.C.F. always tried to find relatives to parent the kids it would otherwise have to put in foster homes, so the children's lives could remain as steady and familiar as possible.
 ''It was Monday, April 11, at 2:15,'' Johnson said, remembering the precise moment in 2005 when, about four months after stepping in as caretaker, Marie's mother walked into the D.C.F. office with Antonio and Anthony, Christopher and Diomedes. She had apparently given up on Marie's oldest, Joseph, a week or so earlier, placing him at a local shelter called Kids in Crisis. Now -- with Marie having just relapsed in an outpatient program, falling back into using cocaine and having disappeared -- she announced to Johnson that the remaining four were too much to handle, that she was finished. ''I begged her,'' Johnson recounted, ''please don't do this, don't do this to these children, you don't know what this will do to them.'' Marie's mother kissed the boys, turned and walked out of their lives.
 ''Even now,'' Johnson said, ''I feel a little tremor over the grandmother bringing them here, a strange office building, and leaving them. I was in shock.'' Then she described Antonio's reaction. Seven years old at the time, he seemed to understand exactly the magnitude of what had just happened. ''He just stared out the window. 'Do you want to eat?' 'No.' 'Do you want to play with something?' 'No.' I took him to stay at Kids in Crisis, hoping that seeing his brother there would help. He put a Venetian-blind cord around his neck and jumped off a chair. He spent months on the child psych ward in Yale New Haven Hospital he was so depressed.''
 Diomedes was taken to one foster home, Anthony and Christopher, then 5 and 2, to another. Licensed foster homes are in such short supply, and space within them is so scarce, that the siblings couldn't be kept together. On the afternoon that Marie's mother abandoned the boys to D.C.F., the Stamford office's ''matcher'' worked her phone. Right away, whenever the office takes custody of a child, the matcher calls her list of local foster homes, and then her list of less local ones, an hour or more away, to see if any might be willing to take another kid, even if there isn't quite enough room, let alone enough energy. On that afternoon, she could find only a Spanish-speaking foster mother for Anthony and Christopher, who don't speak Spanish. In the woman's home, over the next weeks, Anthony repeatedly beat his head against the walls until his nose bled. He drove a hole in a wall with his shoulder. The foster mother threw water in his face to purge him of demons. Johnson begged the matcher to somehow conjure a new placement.
 Meanwhile, Marie seemed to purge something in herself. She fought to get control of her addiction. ''It was the best thing that ever happened to me,'' she told me -- the realization that she could lose her children permanently, though at that point no move toward T.P.R. had been taken. ''I woke up.'' She worked her way through a five-week inpatient program. Anthony and Christopher were moved to a better foster home. Johnson took all the boys on special outings -- to a children's museum, to the fantasy-land restaurant Chuck E. Cheese's -- to make sure they had a constant in their lives. She grew to adore them. She drove up to New Haven twice a week to visit Antonio in the hospital where he was being treated for depression and to take him for haircuts or clothes shopping. She had faith that the family could eventually be put back together. Marie graduated to outpatient sessions. ''Mother,'' Johnson wrote in a report after overseeing a weekly visit in July 2005, ''was appropriate with children and appeared bonded and showed affection.''
 Then, in October, Johnson; two of her supervisors; Stamford's director, Ken Mysogland; a D.C.F. lawyer; a clinical social worker; and a behavioral-health specialist met for a formal review of the case, to reckon with its history for the first time in a completely comprehensive way. Johnson heard that the others didn't share her hope. (Like her, they had come to cherish the kids, Mysogland greeting Christopher with great fanfare as ''Handsome!'' whenever the boy was in the office.) They saw four kids who were acutely fragile, with fissures running through their psyches, and a mother who was too broken to ever help them heal. ''Too high risk, with the emotional instability of the boys,'' Mysogland told me when I asked why, given that Marie had by October been testing clean for several months, they hadn't envisioned returning the boys to her eventually and providing a period of extensive support to assist her as a mother. ''We can load up on services if Mom is capable of meeting her kids' needs.'' He didn't see her as potentially capable, despite the nascent signs of change. He weighed the history of substance abuse and violent men, not only Christopher's father but also Diomedes's father, who had once cut Marie's phone cord with a kitchen knife when she demanded that he leave her house. Mysogland also dwelled on his sense that Marie could not cope with the special needs of her children, like Antonio's A.D.H.D., and on his ''surmise'' that she suffered from mental illness (though, as she would later ask me, ''If I had mental illness, don't you think you would have seen me break down by now, after all they're putting me through?''). The pressure of the boys in her home, he reasoned, would only add to the odds that she would falter, wounding them again. At the meeting, Johnson heard that the department would hire an outside evaluator to confirm their assessment; her superiors believed termination was likely. She began praying -- ''to help me understand why we're doing this.''
 The anguish and incredulity returned quickly to Johnson's voice as she remembered: ''I was like, but she's doing what we asked her to do. The urine's come back clean, the hair test has come back clean.'' Yet her prayers were, more or less, answered. Slowly she learned to think less about Marie's keeping away from drugs than about signs that her life would remain dangerously anarchic. Johnson focused on a car accident in August 2005 that left Marie's leg in a cast -- Marie told her that a New York bus had hit her stationary car, but in October, Johnson learned from city records that witnesses had seen Marie driving fast and erratically before running into the bus with her vehicle. And Johnson focused on domestic violence. In December, her face bruised, Marie told Johnson that she had been mugged and pistol-whipped in the Bronx, but Johnson later found out from the Bronx district attorney's office that Marie's boyfriend, Diomedes's father -- who had recently served several months in prison for kicking a police officer during an arrest on other charges, which were eventually dropped -- had been picked up for beating Marie on the street. This same man was also the father of the unborn child Marie was now carrying. 
 Johnson concentrated on Marie's recklessness, her men, her lies. What if the boys were in the next car that crashed? What if the violence of Marie's lovers turned against her children? Johnson made her peace with the opinion of her superiors, an opinion affirmed by the outside evaluator. Acceptance was made far easier by the fact that Antonio, who was by then out of the hospital, Anthony and Diomedes would probably each be adopted into his current foster home and that Christopher would go to a paternal uncle, a retired policeman. ''I'm 100 percent now,'' she told me, and compared the oldest and youngest of the boys. Joseph had been uncontrollable while living at Kids in Crisis. He had gotten so drunk that he passed out on the lawn in front of his school. He had smashed up the shelter's kitchen, been placed in a detention center and then, in October, after being driven by Johnson to an interview at a residential facility, had asked her to buy him a strawberry milkshake at McDonald's. He fled from the restaurant and has been missing ever since. Johnson imagined his life now as utterly lost, and said, ''His mother made him the boy that he is.'' She envisioned Diomedes's life as full of promise -- starting with the promise of adoption. 
 The four boys would be separated. All of the potential adoptive parents seemed agreeable to keeping them in contact with one another and, perhaps, with Marie, though there would be no legal guarantee that she could ever see them or even talk with them by phone. ''I feel this is in the best interests of the children -- T.P.R.,'' Johnson told me, busy drafting the petition to the court. She had come a long way from her ardent hope of never having to tear a child permanently from its family. And she added, ''I think of my role now as saving children's lives, not just helping families.'' The distinction was not subtle. She had, in this way, reconciled herself to the extreme authority of her work.
 'Ibelieve in the golden rule,'' said Martin Guggenheim -- the N.Y.U. law professor, who represented hundreds of kids in juvenile-delinquency, child-protection and T.P.R. cases as a legal-services attorney -- when I described Marie's situation. ''Test this case against what we would want for our own families.'' He spoke about race and class and suggested that we substitute someone influential for Marie and painkillers for cocaine. ''If we imagine it was substances that important people use, we can't imagine that we would be taking those children.''
 Nationally, two-thirds of child removals are cases of neglect. (Marie's case falls into this category.) Neglect -- not battering, not sexual molestation. The preponderance of neglect cases dates back to the child-welfare work of the late 19th century, Guggenheim said, with its compulsion to rescue children from the alien and impoverished ways of their immigrant families. Objective delineations of neglect are difficult to draw, and poor and minority parents are left particularly vulnerable to agency excesses and misjudgments. A court-appointed lawyer may be assigned when an agency moves to take custody or terminate rights, but this can hardly make up for a parent's lack of wherewithal. ''When should the state exercise its awesome power in severing parental ties?'' Guggenheim asked. ''Only when we are absolutely certain. Because history tells us that the exercise of that awesome power will be carried out against the least privileged of our society.''
 The Stamford D.C.F. office -- with its profusion of stuffed ducks and donkeys and bears sitting above desks -- doesn't look much like a center of awesome and menacing state power. And it didn't sound like one on a recent morning as Johnson talked about a 16-year-old girl who had been abandoned by her mother at 5 and whom Johnson had helped to rescue from alcoholism. ''I'm happy to say,'' Johnson told me, ''that my girl is getting ready to graduate, and I'm getting ready to get some money to buy her a prom dress.'' The department invests in the education of the kids it oversees; it will pay for college or graduate school until a client turns 23, and it will pay for rites of passage like senior proms. Amanda Nowak, who sits in the cubicle next to Johnson's, spoke about a teenager, a talented painter, she had coaxed from homelessness; Nowak would soon be taking her into Manhattan to visit art schools. 
 And most everyone seemed self-aware when it came to their authority and eager to avoid abusing it. Nowak had just given up a string of Saturdays, working successfully to return three children to a cocaine-abusing mother who appeared to have turned her life around. Mysogland, the agency's director, told stories about growing up as one of three biological children of parents who adopted eight others. There was the boy who had been abused and who would booby-trap his bedroom in the Mysoglands' house to keep himself safe. There were the pair of brothers who had lived in 26 foster homes. The younger one had been born addicted to heroin and brain-damaged. Mysogland, whose pale shaved head accentuates his energy and earnestness, remembered that the older one had jumped over and over from a therapist's couch into Mysogland's mother's arms: an exercise to develop the beginnings of trust. ''But I've learned not to apply my family too much in informing my decisions,'' he said. ''This is the most intrusive work. Imagine telling a mother, 'You're never ever seeing your kids again.' Every morning when I turn on the light in this office, I have to put my personal stuff aside. I have to say, Adoption may have been great for my siblings, but it may not be the right decision always.''
 Self-awareness seemed to permeate department thinking about race and class as well. One morning, Connecticut's D.C.F. commissioner, Darlene Dunbar, spoke to the Stamford staff about ''disproportionality and disparate outcomes.'' Of the 6,300 kids currently in the department's custody, approximately 24 percent are black, almost twice the percentage of black minors in the state's population, and 35 percent are Hispanic, more that three times the percentage in the populace. (Nationally, black children are similarly overrepresented. Hispanics are less so, though they are taken into state care at higher rates than whites.) These numbers, perhaps, represent social and economic forces beyond any child-welfare department's control. But another set of Connecticut figures, comparing the rates at which white, black and Hispanic families are investigated with the rates at which their kids are taken, at least temporarily, by D.C.F., are more alarming. Investigated white families are broken apart least often, then black families, then Hispanic -- at twice the rate for whites.
 No one tried to hide the problem, though no one was sure how to solve it. ''When a family presents as more articulate and can gather resources easier,'' Mysogland wrote me in an e-mail message after we talked about these numbers, ''whether those resources are family or finances or provision of services, that changes the overall level of risk or the perceived level of risk. Families that obtain aggressive legal counsel can influence the way the department wants to proceed with a case and the overall outcome of our interventions. We may examine the information a little closer if the family is high profile or wealthy, given that we know they will most likely vigorously oppose the department's decision. We see this in our work, and it would be unethical and dishonest for us to say these issues are not true. We try to give everybody the right types of services. But the statistics tell us we have more work to do.'' 
 Still, behind the thoughtfulness and candor that pervaded the office, and despite everyone's best intentions, something disconcerting hovered around the work: a hint of hubris that had the potential, perhaps, to be as destructive as any abusive boyfriend, as any drug. This force felt all but inevitable; Mysogland only happened to be the one to give it voice, as he declared that he had no doubts about the department's decision in Marie's case. He readily acknowledged that the Adoption and Safe Families Act drove the department toward faster resolutions, created a momentum toward T.P.R. and adoptions and increased the impact of D.C.F. on families. On balance, all this was a good thing, as he saw it; the law took into account ''a child's sense of time,'' the mantra of developmental psychology that is cited frequently in the child-welfare field, stressing a child's urgent need for clarity, for security, for finality, even at the brutal cost of sacrificing his hope of returning to his original family. When Mysogland discussed Marie's family, though, any talk of the influence of legislation was beside the point. The statistics about Hispanics in the system were equally irrelevant. On the subject of Marie's boys, his speech was often plain and tough. ''Those kids are damaged,'' he told me. ''Not broken bones, but broken brain parts.'' Marie was simply not -- and would not be -- fit to mother them. When I asked about the unborn baby, Mysogland's tone was even more definite. He emphasized a newborn's extreme vulnerability, then stated, ''Some people just should not be parents.'' 
 After I'd spent many weeks with the department, I learned that the foster mother who plans to adopt Diomedes is a D.C.F. attorney in another part of the state. Mysogland didn't see this as a conflict of interest; in his eyes, her work with the department made her only more attractive as an adoptive parent, because of her familiarity with the damage that kids taken into D.C.F. care have suffered. But while this made a kind of sense, it was hard not to think of Martin Guggenheim's vision and of a hyperbolic-sounding phrase he had used, ''social engineering.'' It was hard not to consider that a highly privileged woman was being substituted for a terribly flawed but fiercely determined mother.
 And it was hard not to think back to Marie's picnic visit, when Anthony had spoken words that seemed scripted, though there was almost no way they could have been. He may simply have been cued by all that was in the air. ''She shares,'' he proclaimed, as Marie served chicken, rice and peas to me as well as to her boys. ''If that was your mommy, you would be lucky.''
 ''Come here, white boy,'' Marie said to Christopher, in one of the visiting rooms late in May, seven weeks after I first met her. ''Come here, gringo.'' She wrapped her fair-skinned, blond 3-year-old in a hug.
 ''I want to be gringo,'' 6-year-old Anthony complained, his dark brown eyes and light brown face looming dejectedly over the puzzle he and Marie had been working on.
 ''You can't be gringo,'' she said.
 ''I'm gringo,'' he insisted.
 She pulled him into a hug too. ''Why you want to be gringo? You want to be you.''
 Then, at the end of the visit, Antonio, Anthony's older brother, broke down. A half-hour earlier he asked for a cellphone, and Marie said she would try to buy him one, but Johnson took her aside and told her that Antonio, at 8, was too young, that it wasn't appropriate. Now the boy was sobbing, saying that a friend of his had one, and Marie told him: ''You remember what Grandma said? If somebody's got something on their head, you going to stick something on your head? Don't worry about what somebody got. Think about what you got. Mommy's here. You gonna see me every visit.''
 But the concept of ''Mommy'' was about to become more complicated than it already was. Though the court hearings on termination were many months away, the department felt that it needed to tell at least the two older boys about the prospect of their being adopted, to avoid the chance of their hearing about it inadvertently from their foster parents or, in an outburst, from Marie. The telling began that afternoon with Anthony, when Johnson delivered him back to the home of the foster mother who planned to adopt him. A teenage girl, the foster mother's niece, let them into the little blue clapboard house, its front yard surrounded by a chain-link fence, and Johnson followed Anthony upstairs to his room. She sat on the bed, he on the stained, once white carpet with a toy or two. She asked if he loved his foster mother.
 ''Pretty much,'' he said, and added, ''I like her very much.''
 Listening, I recalled Marie's raspy voice during another of our conversations in her kitchen, with the kids' photographs on the refrigerator door: ''What's best for my kids? To come home with their mom. No other place is going to be home.'' Diomedes, she went on, ''is a baby. He does not know me. Real is what real is. But my other kids, they're used to Mom doing things with them. O.K., where they're at, they're safe, I have no doubts. But what is the best thing? I'm here, I'm Mom. I need to see them, but they need me more than I could ever need them,'' she said, as if she knew that in the all but omnipotent judgment of the department her own need carried no weight. ''My mom walked out on us behind drugs. I'm going to fight this until the end.'' 
 One way to fight was to flee: by late June, Marie would tell Johnson that she had moved to New York and planned to deliver her baby there, so D.C.F. couldn't take it. All the department would be able to do was alert New York's child-welfare agency and hope it would open a case on Marie and the unborn child. Marie told Johnson that she would continue visiting her boys, but she missed her chances during the first two weeks of July and seemed, to the department, to be on the verge of vanishing.
 But now in the bedroom of Anthony's foster home, Johnson said to him, ''This is going to be your new home.'' Her voice was thin, a notch higher than usual, yet firm. Her face looked drained; her long, animated braids of hair could not bring it to life. 
 ''Until my mom gets better?''
 ''Getting better'' was the euphemism the department used with the children, to avoid spelling out the drug use, the domestic violence.
 ''Well, maybe your mom's not getting better like she's supposed to.'' Johnson tried to keep the talk focused on his foster mother: ''She'll be the one that's going to take care of you, just like she's doing now.''
 He opened the splintered door of his closet, revealing the mound of toys crammed haphazardly within. ''Do you want to see my Batman clothes?'' he asked her.
 ''Do you understand what I'm telling you?''
 ''That means she's going to be the ruler of me. But how come I can't stay with my mom if she gets better?''
 ''Because I've got to make a plan for you.''
 He took a bucket of Legos out of the closet.
 ''Do you understand what I'm telling you?''
 ''I don't understand.''
 Johnson paused, pulling her thoughts together as Anthony spilled the yellow and red pieces on the floor. ''Remember one time we talked about going back? Right now we're not talking about that anymore. This is the place that you'll stay.''
 ''But when my mom gets better?'' 
 ''I'm not sure she's going to get better. She's been trying and trying and trying.''
 Anthony didn't reply. He turned over the bucket and the last of the pieces plummeted out. ''Could you make a cowboy?'' he asked. A Lego horseman was pictured on the side of the container.
 Though she was dressed somewhat formally, Johnson lowered herself to the discolored carpet. She began to search for the pieces that would create his cowboy. ''This could take some time,'' she said.
 He seemed to consider those words. Perhaps the same language had been used with him once about his mother's recovery and his return to her. And now he was being told new words -- that his mother had, in the end, failed, that it was not going to happen, ever. He seemed to wish for the old words, the old reality and, as he spoke, to dart backward in time to a point when the promise of effort had been enough. ''But you'll try?'' he asked, his voice almost silent, as if he were addressing a mother only he could see. 
 ''I will.''

HEADLINE: After the Bell Curve

BYLINE: By David L. Kirp. 
David L. Kirp, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, is writing a book about the universal preschool movement.

 BODY:
When it comes to explaining the roots of intelligence, the fight between partisans of the gene and partisans of the environment is ancient and fierce. Each side challenges the other's intellectual bona fides and political agendas. What is at stake is not just the definition of good science but also the meaning of the just society. The nurture crowd is predisposed to revive the War on Poverty, while the hereditarians typically embrace a Social Darwinist perspective. 
A century's worth of quantitative-genetics literature concludes that a person's I.Q. is remarkably stable and that about three-quarters of I.Q. differences between individuals are attributable to heredity. This is how I.Q. is widely understood -- as being mainly ''in the genes'' -- and that understanding has been used as a rationale for doing nothing about seemingly intractable social problems like the black-white school-achievement gap and the widening income disparity. If nature disposes, the argument goes, there is little to be gained by intervening. In their 1994 best seller, ''The Bell Curve,'' Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray relied on this research to argue that the United States is a genetic meritocracy and to urge an end to affirmative action. Since there is no way to significantly boost I.Q., prominent geneticists like Arthur Jensen of Berkeley have contended, compensatory education is a bad bet.
 But what if the supposed opposition between heredity and environment is altogether misleading? A new generation of studies shows that genes and environment don't occupy separate spheres -- that much of what is labeled ''hereditary'' becomes meaningful only in the context of experience. ''It doesn't really matter whether the heritability of I.Q. is this particular figure or that one,'' says Sir Michael Rutter of the University of London. ''Changing the environment can still make an enormous difference.'' If heredity defines the limits of intelligence, the research shows, experience largely determines whether those limits will be reached. And if this is so, the prospects for remedying social inequalities may be better than we thought.
 When quantitative geneticists estimate the heritability of I.Q., they are generally relying on studies of twins. Identical twins are in effect clones who share all their genes; fraternal twins are siblings born together -- just half of their genes are identical. If heredity explains most of the difference in intelligence, the logic goes, the I.Q. scores of identical twins will be far more similar than the I.Q.'s of fraternal twins. And this is what the research has typically shown. Only when children have spent their earliest years in the most wretched of circumstances, as in the infamous case of the Romanian orphans, treated like animals during the misrule of Nicolae Ceausescu, has it been thought that the environment makes a notable difference. Otherwise, genes rule.
 Then along came Eric Turkheimer to shake things up. Turkheimer, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia, is the kind of irreverent academic who gives his papers user-friendly titles like ''Spinach and Ice Cream'' and ''Mobiles.'' He also has a reputation as a methodologist's methodologist. In combing through the research, he noticed that the twins being studied had middle-class backgrounds. The explanation was simple -- poor people don't volunteer for research projects -- but he wondered whether this omission mattered.
 Together with several colleagues, Turkheimer searched for data on twins from a wider range of families. He found what he needed in a sample from the 1970's of more than 50,000 American infants, many from poor families, who had taken I.Q. tests at age 7. In a widely-discussed 2003 article, he found that, as anticipated, virtually all the variation in I.Q. scores for twins in the sample with wealthy parents can be attributed to genetics. The big surprise is among the poorest families. Contrary to what you might expect, for those children, the I.Q.'s of identical twins vary just as much as the I.Q.'s of fraternal twins. The impact of growing up impoverished overwhelms these children's genetic capacities. In other words, home life is the critical factor for youngsters at the bottom of the economic barrel. ''If you have a chaotic environment, kids' genetic potential doesn't have a chance to be expressed,'' Turkheimer explains. ''Well-off families can provide the mental stimulation needed for genes to build the brain circuitry for intelligence.''
 This provocative finding was confirmed in a study published last year. An analysis of the reading ability of middle-aged twins showed that even half a century after childhood, family background still has a big effect -- but only for children who grew up poor. Meanwhile, Turkheimer is studying a sample of twins who took the National Merit Scholarship exam, and the results are the same. Although these are the academic elite, who mostly come from well-off homes, variations in family circumstances still matter: children in the wealthiest households have the greatest opportunity to develop all their genetic capacities. The better-off the family, the more a child's genetic potential is likely to be, as Turkheimer puts it, ''maxed out.''
 In seeking to understand the impact of nature and nurture on I.Q., researchers have also looked at adopted children. Consistent with the proposition that intelligence is mainly inherited, these studies have almost always found that adopted youngsters more closely resemble their biological than their adoptive parents. Such findings have supported the assumption that changing a child's life circumstances won't alter the hard facts of nature.
 But researchers in France noted a shortcoming in these adoption studies and set out to correct it. Since poor families rarely adopt, those investigations have had to focus only on youngsters placed in well-to-do homes. What's more, because most adopted children come from poor homes, almost nothing is known about adopted youngsters whose biological parents are well-off.
 What happens in these rare instances of riches-to-rags adoption? To answer that question, two psychologists, Christiane Capron and Michel Duyme, combed through thousands of records from French public and private adoption agencies. ''It was slow, dusty work,'' Duyme recalls. Their natural experiment mimics animal studies in which, for instance, a newborn rhesus monkey is taken from its nurturing biological mother and handed over to an uncaring foster mother. The findings are also consistent: how genes are expressed depends on the social context.
 Regardless of whether the adopting families were rich or poor, Capron and Duyme learned, children whose biological parents were well-off had I.Q. scores averaging 16 points higher than those from working-class parents. Yet what is really remarkable is how big a difference the adopting families' backgrounds made all the same. The average I.Q. of children from well-to-do parents who were placed with families from the same social stratum was 119.6. But when such infants were adopted by poor families, their average I.Q. was 107.5 -- 12 points lower. The same holds true for children born into impoverished families: youngsters adopted by parents of similarly modest means had average I.Q.'s of 92.4, while the I.Q.'s of those placed with well-off parents averaged 103.6. These studies confirm that environment matters -- the only, and crucial, difference between these children is the lives they have led.
 A later study of French youngsters adopted between the ages of 4 and 6 shows the continuing interplay of nature and nurture. Those children had little going for them. Their I.Q.'s averaged 77, putting them near retardation. Most were abused or neglected as infants, then shunted from one foster home or institution to the next.
 Nine years later, they retook the I.Q. tests, and contrary to the conventional belief that I.Q. is essentially stable, all of them did better. The amount they improved was directly related to the adopting family's status. Children adopted by farmers and laborers had average I.Q. scores of 85.5; those placed with middle-class families had average scores of 92. The average I.Q. scores of youngsters placed in well-to-do homes climbed more than 20 points, to 98 -- a jump from borderline retardation to a whisker below average. That is a huge difference -- a person with an I.Q. of 77 couldn't explain the rules of baseball, while an individual with a 98 I.Q. could actually manage a baseball team -- and it can only be explained by pointing to variations in family circumstances.
 Taken together, these studies show that the issue has changed: it is no longer a matter of whether the environment matters but when and how it matters. And poverty, quite clearly, is an important part of the answer.
 That is not to say that an affluent home is necessarily a good home. A family's social standing is only a proxy for the time and energy needed to keep a youngster mentally engaged, as well as the social capital that helps steer a child to success. There are, of course, many affluent parents who do a bad job of raising their children, and many poor families who nurture their kids with care and intelligence. On average, though, well-off households have the resources needed to provide better settings for the fullest development of a child's natural abilities. In ''Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children,'' the University of Kansas psychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley find that by the time they are 4 years old, children growing up in poor families have typically heard a total of 32 million fewer spoken words than those whose parents are professionals. That language gap translates directly into stunted academic trajectories.
 Is there a way to reduce such gaps? In recent years, the case for investing in early-childhood education has become stronger and stronger. The federal Early Head Start program for infants and toddlers is effective when it is well implemented -- in part because it succeeds in getting parents more involved with their children. Recent research also shows that one year of high-quality state prekindergarten can give children as much as a seven-month advantage in vocabulary; this, in turn, is a good predictor of how well they will read when they are in primary school. As you would expect, poor children benefit the most, especially when they are in classes with middle-class youngsters. 
 The push for universal preschool is not a red-state-blue-state issue; the pioneers in the area are Oklahoma and Georgia, not generally known for social progressivism. And with the support of business groups and prominent philanthropists like Susan Buffett, the daughter of Warren Buffett, it may enter the national agenda. If it does, it will be a small step toward a society in which not only the most fortunate children will be able to ''max out'' their potential.

HEADLINE: The Immigration Equation

 BODY:
Roger Lowenstein deserves congratulations; this is the kind of article that we desperately need (July 9). Rather than uncritically presenting opposing positions, in the name of balanced journalism, on important public policy, he explores diverse views, testing them against one another and striving to reach as clear an understanding of the issues as is possible. This is responsible writing. 

Nicholas E. Knorr 
 Chicago

Lowenstein writes that by the mid-90's, the consensus of many economists was that immigration ''depressed unskilled native wages by a little and raised the average native income by a little.'' Even in this best-case analysis, immigration is hardly a boon for the economy. If David Card is wrong, immigration will further widen the economic gap in the various races and classes in the United States. If George Borjas is wrong, limiting immigration would make the nation marginally less economically vibrant. For me, the vital difference between the two positions is in the possible results. Any error in Borjas's argument is remediable by increasing immigration. Acting on Card's analysis, if wrong, could rend the country.

Roger Rice

While illegal immigration may be of negligible benefit to the overall economy, it has greatly benefited immigrants, and it has benefited their employers even more. It is a brave new world, indeed, when many American economists cheer on economic activity that benefits foreign nationals at the expense of their own countrymen. Not to mention that the use of illegal aliens amounts to a costly scheme redistributing wealth from America's working class to the upper classes, who profit from the labor of illegal aliens.

Mark Rustow
 Belle Harbor, N.Y.

I very much welcomed Lowenstein's article but wonder why he and the economists that he spoke to did little to address the issue of whether today's undocumented immigrants are different from the more traditional immigrants who have come to the United States. Do they behave like traditional immigrants or like temporary workers? If they are truly immigrants who plan to stay in the United States, you would assume that they would spend their wages in the United States. If, however, their plan is primarily to earn enough to return to their countries of origin eventually, then wouldn't this have a different economic impact on our country?

Rufina Lee

Economists seem to think within a pretty small and well-defined box. For the rest of us, the question that underlies the immigration debate is, What will it do to our population? Do we want to have 450 million people in the United States by 2050? Has California really benefited from having some five million more residents every decade? What will this largely immigration-driven growth mean in terms of the economics of climate control or providing adequate food and water? These are the kind of questions Congress should be considering as it pursues immigration reform.

HEADLINE: The House That George Is Building

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
IT'S another June evening in baseball and the Boston Red Sox are visiting New York for the latest showdown with their archenemy, the Yankees. As it is at every meeting between the teams, the stadium is packed and crackling with energy.
 Few in the stands, though, notice that the man perhaps most responsible for the revival of their rivalry is not there. George Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees and the man New Yorkers love to hate, now watches more games at his home in Tampa, Fla., than he does in his private box above home plate.
Although he is 76 and noticeably slower than he was when he took over the Yankees 33 years ago, Mr. Steinbrenner remains, according to those who know and work with him, deeply involved in the Yankees operation. Despite rumors that failing health has shrunk his ambition, the Boss, as he is known to all in baseball, is pushing all of his employees to try to win championships -- and spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year to accomplish it. 
 That perennial drive is a big reason, analysts say, that the Yankees have broken new financial ground on the field and off. Bankers, analysts and others familiar with the team's finances say the franchise is now worth about $1 billion, nearly 70 percent more than the next most valuable team, the Red Sox, and nearly three times more than the average major league team is worth.
 Making the most of a winning tradition and their home in the nation's biggest city and media market, the Yankees generate nearly $300 million in annual revenue, according to an individual with knowledge of the team's finances. He requested anonymity because of his continuing professional relationship with the team. 
 But as Mr. Steinbrenner's stewardship of the nation's most-fabled baseball franchise stretches into its fourth decade, his win-at-all-costs business model appears stressed. Yes, the Yankees earn the most money, but analysts say they also spend the most, giving the team razor-thin profit margins. And the Yankees offer such a pre-eminent model for how to milk money from a sports team that its well-being has become a proxy for the financial prospects -- and limitations -- of professional baseball as a whole.
 ''If the franchise that is the beacon for the league is not making an operating profit, that has to be a major concern for any league,'' said Bernard J. Mullin, the chief executive of the Atlanta Spirit, which owns the N.B.A. Hawks and the N.H.L. Thrashers, and a former executive with the Colorado Rockies and the Pittsburgh Pirates.
 The Yankees' haul is produced by its share of the No. 1-ranked regional sports network, YES, as well as the more than four million fans who flock to the Bronx in a season and pay top dollar for tickets, parking and food at the 83-year-old shrine known as the House That Ruth Built. The Yankees also get some of the highest licensing and advertising fees in Major League Baseball.
 TO keep up with the escalating prices that it pays its players -- a surge that Mr. Steinbrenner himself set in motion -- the Yankees need still more revenue. Yet they have extracted about as much as they can from Yankee Stadium, which now suffers from a dearth of luxury boxes, parking and retail outlets. The Yankees' bottom line is also hammered because the team, like the Mets and Red Sox, must pay millions of dollars to prop up less-prosperous teams. Effectively penalized for their success, the Yankees have become a symbol of baseball's partially inverted economics. 
 Mr. Steinbrenner -- now the longest-serving owner in baseball -- shows no intention of stepping down, which is good news for the fans, sportswriters and even team owners who thrive on demonizing him. But the Yankees' juggernaut has been built in part on Mr. Steinbrenner's willingness to routinely fund the team's outsize payroll, a munificence that may not continue when he eventually steps down.
 Mr. Steinbrenner, who declined to comment for this article, is grooming his son-in-law, Steve Swindal, to take over the team. Meanwhile, the Yankees are trying to cut their payroll by using younger and cheaper players when possible and staking their financial future on a new megastadium. 
 ''The new stadium is going to have all the tradition of the old stadium, with all the modern amenities,'' said Randy Levine, the team's president. ''Bleachers will be there. Restaurants will be open. There will be a great hall when you walk into the stadium that can be used for events. The idea is to make this a year-round destination.''
 Set for a 2009 debut, the stadium, including building costs and debt payments, will carry a $1 billion price tag. To pay for it, the Yankees will need to generate an additional $50 million to $60 million a year in revenue, according to analysts. Mr. Levine declined to discuss how much money the team expects to earn in its new digs, though he ruled out selling the naming rights to the stadium.
 Other baseball executives and analysts, though, question whether the stadium will be as much of a bonanza as the team may hope. The Yankees already sell out most of their current seats and suites, they say, and the new stadium will have several thousand fewer seats. To offset that loss, the Yankees plan to have 60 suites in the new stadium, three times as many as they offer now. If the stadium does not create a financial windfall for the Yankees, it is likely to cast a financial pall over other teams that are making an art out of chasing dollars with the same urgency that they chase titles.
 ''The Yankees have created tremendous expectations and have created the need to continue spending,'' said Henry D. Fetter, the author of ''Taking On the Yankees: Winning and Losing in the Business of Baseball.'' ''The Yankees have created a target for everyone else to aim at and been a stimulus for innovative management.''
 High expectations at Yankees Stadium did not begin, of course, when Mr. Steinbrenner, using part of his shipbuilding fortune, led a group that bought the team in 1973. He is only the latest in a line of aggressive, well-heeled Yankees owners who have gone all out to field a winner and to force other teams to adapt.
 That tradition started when Jacob Ruppert and Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston paid $450,000, then a record in baseball, to buy the club in 1915. At the time, the Yankees had spent nearly two decades as cellar-dwellers in the upstart American League.
 Unlike most other owners back then, the men were wealthy enough that they could funnel the team's profits back into the franchise -- and they proved it by buying Babe Ruth from the Red Sox and building Yankee Stadium, which became an instant hit when it opened in 1923. 
 During the 20's, the Yankees earned more than $3.5 million cumulatively, according to Mr. Fetter's book. By reinvesting those profits, Mr. Ruppert -- who bought out Mr. Huston in 1922 -- allowed the Yankees to buy the best talent, win championships and draw more fans, which gave the team even more money to keep the cycle going. . 
 Teams whose owners sucked money out of their business typically suffered over the long term -- teams like the New York Giants, which sank in the standings after reigning as the National League's premier team in the early part of the 20th century.
 Mr. Ruppert also introduced the template for modern sports management, creating a division of labor among managers on the field, general managers who handled trades and contracts and owners who wrote the checks. Mr. Ruppert also set the tone for his franchise, hammering home -- in Steinbrennerian shades -- that winning was everything. ''There is no charity in baseball,'' he said. ''I want to win the pennant every year, and the bigger the margin of victory, the better.''
 THE Yankees won championships so methodically and mercilessly that cheering for the team was sometimes compared to supporting United States Steel. Teams of lesser means had to innovate to compete. The St. Louis Cardinals, led by Branch Rickey, fished for talent on the cheap in the 1920's by developing minor-league teams, a strategy that Mr. Rickey mined later when he ran the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1940's and 1950's.
 Some teams tried to compete by buying big-name players, but those in cities with fewer fans and media dollars inevitably proved unable to support their big payrolls. After they started cutting salaries, their franchises went into competitive and financial tailspins.
 The Yankees were not immune from this vicious cycle. 
 After dominating baseball for decades, the Yankees languished in the years after CBS bought them in 1964. The company thought that the team would help diversify its portfolio, and CBS bean counters saw a bloated enterprise in need of cost-cutting. Unfortunately for the team and its fans, CBS failed to grasp that success in baseball is often more expensive than losing. As it dumped players with big salaries, the team slid into a decadelong funk and regularly lost money. In 1973, CBS sold the Yankees to a group led by Mr. Steinbrenner for $10 million -- $3 million less than what CBS paid a decade earlier.
 Yankees fans and the city's news media, never warm and fuzzy about outsiders, initially greeted Mr. Steinbrenner's arrival with skepticism. He professed admiration for the Yankees, talking about how as a child he could not wait for the team to visit Cleveland, his hometown, to play the Indians. He also promised to take a back seat, leaving the running of the team to others.
 But he quickly did an about-face, bringing in his own people to run things, involving himself in every aspect of the club's operations and alienating employees, players and fans. He publicly lambasted his managers and players -- serially hiring and firing Billy Martin as manager in the 1970's and 80's, for example. The ranting went on for decades; in 1999, he called a pitcher, Hideki Irabu, a ''fat toad.'' 
 Buster Olney, a former sportswriter for The New York Times, summed up the Boss's management style in his book, ''The Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty'': ''George Steinbrenner would never entrust his team to God. That would mean giving up too much control. Instead, the Yankees' owner audited the team from moment to moment, like a caffeinated rent-a-cop monitoring a Wal-Mart through security cameras.''
 Mr. Steinbrenner was capricious, firing employees for perceived infractions, but keeping others on the payroll for seemingly inexplicable reasons. His antics got him attention, whether it meant being lampooned on the television sitcom ''Seinfeld,'' or finding himself in the middle of messier real-life episodes, such as his ban in 1990 from operating the Yankees after he paid a gambler $40,000 for possibly derogatory information about the outfielder Dave Winfield; the ban was lifted in 1993.
 FOIBLES aside, Mr. Steinbrenner, according to associates, cared deeply about the Yankees as a team and an institution, going so far as to cry on national television after a World Series victory. And like Mr. Ruppert, he was also willing to put his money where his mouth was -- a fact he also made abundantly clear soon after he arrived in New York.
 ''When the Yankees signed Catfish Hunter in 1974, it signaled that 'We want to win again and we'll do everything we reasonably can to win,' '' said Donald M. Fehr, the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association. The signing was a watershed in huge contracts for free agents. 
 Mr. Steinbrenner went on spending, luring Reggie Jackson, Goose Gossage and other big-name players. The largess paid off quickly. In 1976, the Yankees won their first pennant in a dozen years; the team won the World Series the next two years. They lost the 1981 World Series, during which Mr. Steinbrenner broke his hand. (He said the injury came in a fight in an elevator with two fans who insulted the team, but his aggressors never materialized. Others suspected that he punched the elevator in frustration.)
 Mr. Steinbrenner's willingness to spend heavily for players helped to drive up salaries across the league -- a boon to players, but the source of endless grumbling among other owners. It has also led to efforts to quantify the impact of money on a team's performance. The most prominent attempt came in 2000 when the baseball commissioner's ''Blue Ribbon Panel on Baseball Economics'' published a study about the matter.
 The panel found that teams with more money did better than those with less money, and that the gap between the haves and have-nots was growing. According to the report, the gap between the clubs with the highest and lowest revenue from tickets and other locally sold items more than doubled from 1995 to 1999. During the same period, no club that ranked in the lower half by payroll won a playoff game.
 ''Too many clubs in low-revenue markets can only expect to compete for postseason berths if ownership is willing to incur staggering operating losses to subsidize a competitive player payroll,'' the panel concluded.
 Many others in baseball, though, say the Yankees and other prosperous teams are good for the sport because they raise the level of competition and force other teams to be more aggressive.
 ''Their success and payroll raise a few eyebrows that one team is so dominant,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economics professor at Smith College and the author of ''In the Best Interests of Baseball? The Revolutionary Reign of Bud Selig.'' ''But I happen to think it's good for baseball that the Yankees and Boston are the teams others can gun for.''
 There is also plenty of evidence to show that money does not necessarily equal success. The Oakland Athletics, with one of the league's smaller payrolls, have consistently fielded winners in recent years. The Chicago Cubs, with fat payrolls and plenty of revenue, have not won a World Series in nearly a century.
 Despite Mr. Steinbrenner's heavy spending and quick success on the field after he became owner, the Yankees lost money in five of the six seasons from 1974 to 1979, according to financial statements prepared by Arthur Andersen & Company and as reported by the sportswriter Murray Chass in The New York Times.
 ''In his willingness to outspend everyone, the team became a focal point,'' said Maury Brown, co-chairman of the business of baseball committee at the Society for American Baseball Research. Mr. Steinbrenner, he said, ''seems to be a man driven to succeed at all costs and pours his money back into payroll.''
 Even with all that spending, the Yankees haven't always maintained a lock on winning. While it currently has a $195 million payroll, the biggest in baseball by a wide margin, and has advanced to the playoffs every year since 1995, the team has not won the World Series since 2000. In 2003, the Florida Marlins -- a team with a payroll one-third the size -- beat the Yankees in the World Series.
 Analysts also say that money alone does not explain Mr. Steinbrenner's success. They note that he has surrounded himself with creative marketers, as evidenced by the team's deal in 1988 to broadcast its games on cable television -- a page taken from Ted Turner, who did the same with the Atlanta Braves. 
 In 2002, an investment group that included the Yankees formed the YES Network, further leveraging the team's brand. YES brought in $257 million last year, surpassing MSG to become the country's top regional sports network for the first time, according to Kagan Research.
 ''It's not just attendance any more,'' said Tracy Dolgin, the chief executive of YES. ''The better you do as a franchise, a cycle develops. When you're winning, there's interest in the team and your ratings are higher. Then attendance increases, you sell more food, more parking. It's an upward spiral.''
 The team has also signed big licensing deals with sponsors like Adidas and formed partnerships overseas, including one with the Japanese newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, many of whose readers follow every move of Hideki Matsui, the Yankee left fielder. Two years ago, the Yankees formed a venture with Steiner Sports Marketing called Yankees-Steiner Collectibles to market jerseys, bats, helmets and other gear that players use.
 ''The Yankees have transcended baseball and sports; they are an iconic brand,'' said Rick Dudley, the chief executive of Octagon Worldwide, which puts together sports sponsorship deals. ''You want to be contemporary, but there's nothing more contemporary than a classic.''
 ALL of these happy economics, however, may be running into a wall, some sports executives say, and the Yankees' new stadium may not provide the revenue gusher that Mr. Steinbrenner and his executives expect. The YES Network already reaps the highest fees of any regional sports network from cable companies -- and those companies are likely to resist paying even more.
 ''The status quo on the revenue side is well established,'' said one former executive who has direct knowledge of the Yankees' finances and requested anonymity because of his contractual obligations to the team. ''George is getting every nickel he can.''
 The challenges of financing the new stadium can be softened in some ways. The Yankees will be able to deduct some of the costs of building and operating the stadium from their contributions to other teams under the league's revenue-sharing agreement. The Yankees will also receive about $400 million in government subsidies, according to Neil deMause, co-author of ''Field of Schemes,'' a 1998 book that dissects stadium deals. 
 The city and state governments will build a parking lot at the stadium, for example. The New York City Industrial Development Agency will also issue bonds, most of which will be tax-exempt and carry lower interest rates. That will save the Yankees millions of dollars in payments over the bonds' life.
 The Yankees need the subsidies, tax breaks and new revenue not only to pay for the stadium, but also the team's hefty payroll. Without that padding, the Yankees might find it harder to assemble a winning team. And without a winning team, it will be harder to raise tickets prices, broadcast rights and other fees.
 An environmental impact statement compiled by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation projects that the average ticket price in the new stadium will be $57, as opposed to $45 in the old stadium. And Mr. Dudley and analysts expect the Yankees to be able to charge a hefty premium for advertising in the new ballpark. The team could also sell personal seat licenses, which are options to buy season tickets, as some N.F.L. teams do.
 SOME sports executives compare the new revenue streams to oil wells because they generate quick and handsome returns once developed. But it is also difficult to find new wells, and the pressure to do so is intense, not only in the Yankees organization but throughout Major League Baseball.
 Teams regularly raise ticket prices and charge more for food, parking and memorabilia. But they walk a fine line between generating more money and appearing greedy and alienating fans. So they are toying with other innovations, like all-you-can-eat promotions, dining clubs and priority parking, and now sell sponsorships to individual games and sections of parks.
 But ''you would have to think there aren't that many more iterations you can do,'' said Mr. Mullin, the chief executive of the Atlanta basketball and hockey franchises. 
 That may bode more darkly for the Yankees than for other teams.
 Of course, an array of baseball insiders have predicted for decades that the Yankees' dynasty would soon end. But the team has almost always found new ways to succeed. Writing in The Saturday Evening Post in 1947, the sportswriter Red Smith asked ''What Broke Up the Yankees?'' Soon after, the Yankees began the most successful run of championships in the team's history.
 The Yankees, many people say, will keep winning at the gate and on the field because they have the most durable brand in the business, which gives them access to money and, in turn, the best players. Other teams also need the Yankees to succeed because the team contributes so much to the league's revenue-sharing plan.
 ''While they curse Steinbrenner under their breath, the other owners are happy to take his money through revenue sharing,'' said Mr. Brown of the Society for American Baseball Research.
 But the owners will not have Mr. Steinbrenner to kick around forever. He attends far fewer games these days and speaks less often to the news media, often making pronouncements through his publicist, Howard J. Rubinstein.
 Questions about Mr. Steinbrenner's health took on a new urgency in 2003, when he fainted after a memorial service for the football great Otto Graham. When Mr. Steinbrenner stumbled while coming down the stairs after one recent Yankee home game, every New York newspaper took note. His malapropisms and off-color remarks are now viewed as a window into his health.
 But those who deal with Mr. Steinbrenner say that he is as involved as ever.
 ''People are taking a larger role, but there's no doubt who the boss is,'' said David Boies, whose law firm, Boies, Schiller & Flexner, represents the Yankees. ''It's still George's team and George's business.''
 Amid questions about his health and his role as the Yankees principal owner, Mr. Steinbrenner has been so successful for so long that, in the end, he has created something that even he may never have intended: an organization that will outlive him.
 ''I don't ever see the Yankees in a rebuilding year -- it flies in the face of the way they have done business for 50 years,'' said Rodney Fort, a sports economist at Washington State University. ''History suggests that after George Steinbrenner, someone else will come in and make even more money.''

HEADLINE: Word From the Fed Helps to Lift the Dow

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Technology stocks slumped, pulling the Nasdaq composite index down for the third consecutive week, but the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index managed to eke out weekly gains. 
 Investors were cheered by statements from Federal Reserve officials that suggested that an end to the long series of interest rate increases might be coming into view. In minutes of their last meeting, which were released on Thursday, Fed policy makers said that inflation was ''likely to edge down'' because economic growth appeared to be slowing.
The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, made similar comments in Congressional testimony earlier in the week. 
 While the broader market rallied, technology stocks fell on disappointing earnings reports by companies like Dell, Qualcomm and Intel.
 For the week, the Dow industrials gained 129.03 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 10,868.38. The S.& P. 500 rose 4.09 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 1,240.29. The Nasdaq fell 16.96 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 2,020.39. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note slipped to 5.04 percent from 5.06 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: From Harvey Road to Crescent Drive, Something Changed

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
SO now we know.
 Thanks to some fine reporting at The Wall Street Journal, we now know that right after 9/11, as the crushed bodies of heroic firemen were still being pulled from the rubble of the World Trade Center, and the nation was in deep, bone-chilling mourning, the smart people who run some of America's biggest and most powerful corporations may have already figured out An Angle.
Certain officers and directors at companies including UnitedHealth, Merrill Lynch, Teradyne, Black & Decker and Home Depot knew that their stock was way down because of panic about the attacks and whether more were coming. They also knew that their long-term prospects were excellent and that their stocks were a bargain. And right after the attacks, they quickly awarded themselves options priced to strike at the super-low prices their stocks reached when the fires at the Pentagon were still smoldering. In many cases, they went on to make serious money from those options.
 The ordinary stockholders (obviously) were not awarded options or anything similar that might allow them to take advantage of the tragedy that had befallen the nation. 
 This -- as I see it -- went beyond war profiteering. This was actual ''death profiteering,'' as my friend, the writer Marina Malenic, put it.
 Now, to be sure, such actions are not illegal. As far as I know, there is no law that says insiders cannot gather together to make an unseemly profit off a national catastrophe. But it's sickening in its breach of faith, and its breach of trust with the society at large. (Some of the companies that granted 9/11 options are also part of an investigation into the backdating of options -- a practice that in some cases could be illegal.)
 As I thought about it all, I picked up Philip Roth's magnificent ''American Pastoral'' and began to read it, thinking as I did: ''How the hell did everything go so wrong in this country? How did we stop giving a damn about our neighbors and viewing this earthly transit, this brief wink between eternity and eternity (to paraphrase the great Hart Crane), as mostly a chance to make money off a nameless, faceless Other?'' And as I read Roth's incredibly potent words about America in the 1940's and 50's, the America I was born into and grew up into, I thought about the Sculls.
 On Harvey Road, our little dead-end street in Silver Spring, Md., overlooking Sligo Creek Park, there were about 30 homes and families. Every family knew every other family, and every mom would take of care of anyone's kid sent home sick from school. 
 In about 1955, one family in the neighborhood, and one family only, built an in-ground swimming pool. That family was the Sculls -- David and Elizabeth Lee Scull and their children, my idol and dear friend David Lee Scull, and his sister, Betsy Blair Scull. In a neighborhood of mostly second-generation middle-class Jews, the Sculls were genuine American nobility. 
 The Sculls were direct descendants of Richard Henry Lee, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and distantly related to Gen. Robert E. Lee. Daughter and son-in-law of one of the largest private landowners in Montgomery County, they would have been aristocrats in the Court of St. James. But they were more than that: they were friends and neighbors.
 When the Sculls built their pool, they made a schedule and passed it around the neighborhood. There was a set of times so that every family on the street could use the pool every week of the summer.
 That is, in the America that had banded together to win World War II, the America bursting with togetherness, community spirit, and the feeling that anything could happen if we all pulled together, the Sculls shared their pool with every single family in the neighborhood as if we all owned it. It was a small, unheated pool, but how we all loved it, and what splash fights and free-style races and underwater breath-holding contests we had there in the wild cathedral afternoons of summertime youth. There was no wall around the pool, or around any lot nearby. It was a neighborhood of trust and sharing.
 Then something happened. Maybe it was the explosion of individualism. Maybe it was new kinds of people who did not speak the language or who seemed different and threatening coming into our towns. Maybe it was just the life cycle of empires. But now life is different.
 Now, in 2006, on my street in Beverly Hills, every home has a pool, as far as I know. Many of them are spectacular and all are heated. But we all have high walls around our homes. I have lived on my street in my house for eight years and know only one neighbor, my next-door neighbors, who throw parties and sing lovely Persian songs. 
 If our son got sick at school and my wife or I were not home, the school nurse would just have to keep him until we could be found. There is not one neighbor on the street who would take him in, or who even knows him. (Sometimes I think my wife and I don't know him, either: the modern American affluent teenager, a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma, to cite Churchill on Stalin's Russia.)
 AS I said, something happened. It happened not only in neighborhoods, but also in corporate America, where the only meaningful units to management are the manager himself and his wealth. The workers are just the most easily varied input of costs, not people to whom you feel any obligation, or by whom you want to be viewed as a kind and decent person. There is certainly no community between workers and management at most companies.
 The stockholders are not owners. All too often -- not always -- they're just chumps who are lucky to get whatever scraps the board leaves them. Owners of the company? That's a joke now.
 And the nation as a whole, under siege by terrorists and militants who are very sure of their values? It's just a mass of strangers you have to be nice to when you want them to invest in your company or when you want them to go off to war to save you while you are making money off of a national tragedy. Otherwise, they're just strangers and you certainly would not want them inside your walls or in your pool. It's nothing personal, as they say in ''The Godfather,'' ''It's just business.''
 As I look back on it, Harvey Road was not a dead-end street at all, but Crescent Drive, Beverly Hills 90210, might be.
 I'll say it again. Something happened.

HEADLINE: Long Live the Nanny State 

BYLINE: By Daniel Akst. 
Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
FIRST the House of Representatives passes a bill restricting Internet gambling. Then the chief executive of a leading offshore Internet gambling company is arrested during a layover in Texas.
 It's comforting to know that, despite the spread of legal gambling from coast to coast, Uncle Sam is defending the virtue of innocent Americans against evil games of chance in cyberspace. But far more important than an apparent crackdown on Internet gambling is a question it raises: In a modern free-market economy, how much should the government try to protect us from ourselves?
I am a believer in markets, but I suspect that the right answer is ''a good deal more than it does now.'' As a matter of fact, this is as good a time as any for a few choice words in defense of that widely derided institution, the nanny state. 
 The issue is so timely because many traditional external restraints on individual behavior have fallen away. Human beings have always had to be self-regulating, of course, but capitalism, technology and social change are making us ever more reliant on self-control while temptation abounds as never before. 
 Social structures like close extended families that once constrained behavior have weakened even as widespread affluence has democratized overindulgence. A result is that Americans eat too much, save too little and absolutely guzzle planet-warming fossil fuel, all to our collective detriment. Forget about the national debt. What we have here is a ballooning self-control deficit.
 Consider that in 1970 only New York, New Jersey and New Hampshire had state-run lotteries, and gambling in a casino required a trip to Nevada. This year, 47 states had casinos or lotteries or both. Is it any wonder that from 1994 to 2004, legal gambling in this country -- bets minus winnings -- roughly doubled, to $78.6 billion? 
 Then along comes the Internet to provide private access to gambling -- not to mention countless other opportunities for failures of self-restraint -- any time and any place. 
 It's tempting to suggest that government shouldn't even be in the business of influencing noncriminal behavior, except that it already is and always will be. States advertise their lotteries constantly, for example, although they rarely mention the infinitesimal odds of winning. Internet casinos are usually a better deal. 
 The tax code, meanwhile, discourages some things (like saving) and encourages others (like McMansions). In his recent book, ''The Conservative Nanny State,'' the economist Dean Baker argues that government nannyism, broadly defined, benefits the rich.
 So there is no point in pretending that government doesn't influence behavior. Some changes in the government's own behavior, in fact, could have a big economic payoff by saving us just a little from ourselves. Taxing consumption rather than earnings, for example, would probably bolster savings and reduce consumer indebtedness even while dampening inflation and increasing productivity.
 The question is, what would an effective nanny state look like? Long national experience with drugs and alcohol suggests that banning things many people want is a sure road to failure. But indulgence can be made costly and inconvenient by hefty taxes, age limits and other rules. 
 Social stigma is always helpful, as in the case of tobacco, and government bans on smoking in restaurants and the like have probably helped condemn cigarettes to broad disrepute. But the potential for positive nannyism is much greater. Imagine the economic and environmental wonders that might be wrought by a broad energy tax, for example.
 The rise of Internet gambling -- estimated to have reached $12 billion last year -- illustrates the difficulty of conducting effective government nannyism as well as a need to supplement individual self-restraint.
 Federal authorities stepped up a fight against offshore Internet gambling last Monday, charging David Carruthers, the chief executive of BetOnSports, a company that is publicly traded in Britain, with racketeering conspiracy related to an illegal gambling enterprise. 
 BECAUSE proximity to casinos and problem gambling appear correlated, nanny theory suggests that it may be sensible to suppress Internet gambling, but it probably would not work.
 While the government can make it harder for Americans to conduct financial transactions with sites like BetOnSports, people who want to gamble always find a way. Perhaps it would make more sense to bring these operations to our shores and regulate the daylights out of them.
 A good nanny could also help by giving gamblers a forum to commit themselves to abstention before succumbing to the lure of the gambling tables. In Missouri, individuals who are doubtful of their own disciplinary stamina can bar themselves from casinos for life -- and be arrested if they show up in one.

HEADLINE: An Unmistakable Face, And a Name You Can't Quite Place

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
JOHN C. REILLY may have appeared in nearly 40 movies in less than 20 years -- including ''Chicago,'' ''Gangs of New York'' and ''The Hours,'' each an Academy Award nominee for best picture in 2003 -- but that doesn't mean people can necessarily match his looping brown curls, lumpen nose and blue eyes to his name, or even to one of his many supporting roles.
 ''I know you,'' said a woman behind the counter at the Weiner's Circle, a food stand here on the North Side, as Mr. Reilly ducked in recently for a Polish sausage. ''You're a musician.''
Later that day, under a drizzle inside Marquette Park, near the gritty South Side neighborhood where Mr. Reilly grew up, a city recreation worker elbowed a friend and exclaimed: ''That guy looks like that guy. He was in 'Boogie Nights' with Markie Mark.'' (Indeed he was.) 
 A few weeks earlier, at the counter of a greasy spoon called the Apple Pan in the Westwood section of Los Angeles, a woman interrupted Mr. Reilly's cheeseburger to say, ''My boyfriend thinks he's seen you on TV.''
 Mr. Reilly immediately swiveled around on his stool to sign an autograph. He then returned to an interviewer, a broad grin arching his pitted cheeks, and said: ''I love that they can't place me. They don't know my name. That's 'mission accomplished' in my world.''
 The mission may be about to change.
 Beginning Aug. 4 moviegoers will be able to see Mr. Reilly in his first co-starring role in a big-budget (an estimated $75 million) screwball comedy: ''Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,'' in which he and Will Ferrell play race-car drivers. The plot can be synthesized as follows: Until things go inevitably awry, Mr. Ferrell's character, Ricky, typically wins each week on the Nascar circuit, assisted by his lifelong friend Cal Naughton Jr. (Mr. Reilly), whose sole role is to box out opposing cars.
 While Mr. Ferrell once again serves up shtick that is as comfortingly familiar as macaroni and cheese -- having jogged down a street naked in ''Old School,'' he runs around the racetrack clad only in white briefs, twice, in ''Talladega Nights'' -- Mr. Reilly manages not only to set up some of his partner's best moments, but to grab some of his own. (In that regard Mr. Reilly's chief competition is often Sacha Baron Cohen, best known for ''Da Ali G Show,'' who plays a flamboyantly gay driver imported from France.)
 If the film has an emotional high point -- however unexpected that may be in a Will Ferrell comedy -- it too is provided by Mr. Reilly's Cal, as he meekly asks Ricky if he might win just one race, a request Ricky shoots down instantly. 
 ''Nothing wrong with silver,'' Cal assures him, with Mr. Reilly infusing his familiar, reedy tenor with a Southern twang. ''I'll just bury it deep down inside. It's painful. But I love you.''
 Those lines were conceived, as the cameras rolled, by Mr. Reilly -- not by Mr. Ferrell or Adam McKay, Mr. Ferrell's co-writer and the movie's director. And Mr. Reilly acknowledges that, as with all good improvisational comedy, he was able to draw on his own life experience, including his long run as a supporting player with a track record not unlike Cal's.
 ''I don't know where exactly that came from,'' Mr. Reilly said, back to his burger and fries at the Apple Pan, not far from his Southern California home. ''But people ask me a lot, 'What's it feel like to be a character actor?' I say that when I work, I always see my character as the main character in his life story, even if it's a small part or a cameo.''
 ''Then people ask me, do you ever want to be center stage?'' he said. ''I don't feel that way. But people say it. Should I?''
 If ''Talladega'' lures a big summer audience, that question will be moot. So too will Mr. Reilly's anonymity. Meanwhile he, Mr. McKay and Mr. Ferrell are preparing to approach the studios with an idea for a comedy that they conceived, one that would give Mr. Reilly top billing with Mr. Ferrell.
 In the proposed film, ''we're basically two adult children of two single people that get together, and we still live at home,'' Mr. Ferrell said. ''It's sort of like 'Brady Bunch' meets 'Kramer vs. Kramer.' ''
 Mr. Ferrell said that he had been struck on the ''Talladega'' shoot by how regularly Mr. Reilly had been able to improvise his punch lines. In one such moment a doctor tells Mr. Ferrell's Ricky that the paralysis he has been experiencing following a race-car accident is psychosomatic. ''When you say psychosomatic,'' Mr. Reilly's Cal interrupts, ''do you mean you can start a fire with your mind?''
 Mr. McKay, who had originally cast Mr. Reilly as the sportscaster Champ Kind alongside Mr. Ferrell in ''Anchorman,'' before they lost Mr. Reilly to ''The Aviator,'' said: ''Right away, he goes up there as one of the seven funniest guys around. I mean, Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn. I don't know if that's the way American public is going to see him. But Will and I do.'' 
 To that end Mr. Reilly, 41, has just begun filming another comedy, here in Chicago, called ''Quebec,'' in which he and Seann William Scott play rivals seeking the job of general manager of a grocery store.
 ''How do you prepare?'' Mr. Reilly said, when asked to contemplate the prospect of more recognizable fame, which has thus far largely eluded him, even after a best supporting actor nomination for his role as the cuckolded husband Amos Hart in ''Chicago.'' ''I know this from my friends Jack Black and Will. There is a different vibe coming at you from the audience when you've been in a comedy. You're regarded as safe to come up to. Daniel Day Lewis, they stay away from him. But once you've made them laugh, it's like: 'He's Cal. We'll ask his wife to take a picture of us!' ''
 To understand how Mr. Reilly could summon the stamina to appear in so many roles over such a relatively short period, it was helpful to meet him in Chicago this month and tag along as he searched for a narrow stage in a concrete fieldhouse on the edge of a seemingly forgotten oasis in Marquette Park.
 For it was here, in front of a maroon velour curtain that still hangs inside a recreation hall operated by the Chicago Parks Department, that Mr. Reilly first sought out acting as an adolescent, as a means to escape the economic hardship and after-school temptations of a ''tough'' life (including several arrests for juvenile mischief) on the South Side. First he played a cheery nephew of Scrooge in ''A Christmas Carol,'' then Captain Hook in ''Peter Pan'' and a narrator in ''Free to Be You and Me.''
 Once at the all-boys Brother Rice High School, about 60 blocks from the park, he moved from the chorus in ''The King and I'' to the role of a Russian commissar in ''Fiddler on the Roof'' to an apostle in ''Jesus Christ Superstar.'' At the same time he found that it was relatively easy for a boy to get cast in productions at the neighborhood's all-girl high schools. 
 And so between rehearsals at Brother Rice, he traversed the South Side to Mother McAuley High, to play Sid in a mostly female production of ''The Pajama Game,'' then went on to Maria High School to play a gangster in ''Bells Are Ringing.''
 Asked, as he reminisced while pacing the Marquette Park stage, if the ulterior motive for these excursions was to meet girls, Mr. Reilly said: ''I went because I wanted to do the shows. How dorky is that?''
 If that experience taught him the joys of being both versatile and resourceful, he learned the value of hard work at a commercial linen supply house and laundry owned by his father. There, in pursuit of pocket money and the means to buy Christmas gifts for his two sisters, three brothers and parents, Mr. Reilly took on the jobs no one wanted: folding the napkins from the Walnut Room at Marshall Field's, and sorting the surgical sheets from a hospital and the dirty underwear from a nearby juvenile hall.
 ''All that stuff makes you a better actor,'' he said while standing on the loading bay of the red-brick building that once housed the laundry plant, virtually abandoned since his father died more than a decade ago. ''You live in the world. You know what it's like.''
 After graduating from Brother Rice in the mid-80's with a middling average, Mr. Reilly said he decided, almost by default, to enroll in DePaul University, only a few miles away from the squat bungalow in which he'd been raised near Marquette Park, but a world apart socially.
 His father had wanted him to study business, but he enrolled instead in the Goodman School of Drama, since renamed the Theater School. There he was befriended by a professor named Patrick Murphy, who taught a first-year acting class in improvisation.
 ''It was no sets, no props, just the actors in the space,'' Mr. Murphy, who has since retired, recalled by phone. ''One day, fairly early in the work, John rode on stage on a bicycle. And the class gasped. Because there was no bicycle. But we all saw it. Here was someone who knew the ancient ways. He had the art of making the invisible visible.''
 Though Mr. Reilly had found his calling, even if it was not yet obvious to him, his life as an actor-in-training on the relatively upscale North Side caused some tension within his family.
 ''I started taking voice and speech classes, where they beat the accent out of you,'' Mr. Reilly said. ''My brothers were like, 'They're brainwashing him.' ''
 Even now Mr. Reilly, who could probably afford to buy a sumptuous pied-a-terre high above the Chicago Gold Coast, said he did not feel at ease in the neighborhood. ''When I come up here,'' he said, outside the elegant, long-term hotel near Lake Michigan where the ''Quebec'' cast is staying, ''I still have that South Side chip on my shoulder.''
 ''But,'' he added, ''I don't exactly belong on the South Side either.''
 Mr. Reilly caught his first break not long after graduating from DePaul, when he was cast in a small role in the Brian De Palma film ''Casualties of War.'' To get to the set, in Thailand, Mr. Reilly flew in an airplane for the first time. Though he returned to the United States after a month, his work complete, he was recalled to Asia almost immediately by Mr. De Palma, who expanded the part of Herbert Hatcher, an Army private, so much so that Mr. Reilly would remain there for five months.
 On the set in Thailand, Mr. Reilly also met his wife, Alison Dickey, now an independent film producer. 
 IN the 17 years since ''Casualties of War,'' Mr. Reilly has worked on so many films with so many prominent directors (Paul Thomas Anderson, Martin Scorsese and Robert Altman among them) that it is almost difficult to keep track. Any abridged list would be incomplete, but his most memorable roles surely include Reed Rothchild, the porn star-magician and sidekick to Mark Wahlberg's Dirk Diggler in ''Boogie Nights'' (1997); Jim Kurring, the moralistic cop who falls for a drug addict in ''Magnolia'' (1999), which, like ''Boogie Nights'' and ''Hard Eight,'' was written and directed by Mr. Anderson; ''Mr. Cellophane,'' as Amos calls himself in ''Chicago,'' in which Mr. Reilly showed how well he could sing; Phil Last, the stoned housepainter married to Jennifer Aniston in ''The Good Girl'' (2002); and Lefty, the singing cowboy in ''Prairie Home Companion,'' released this year.
 If there is one thread he sees running through many of these characters, none of whom is especially bright and all of whom toil among the working classes, it is that they are ''committed dreamers,'' he said. In a precursor to ''Talladega,'' he has also often provided the comic relief in serious movies. 
 Then, in a pre-emptive strike intended to torpedo a reporter's question before he could even ask it, Mr. Reilly insisted that no, he could not possibly identify his favorites.
 ''The most important job, to me, is the one I haven't done yet,'' he said. And then, perhaps channeling something Cal Naughton Jr. might say if he were an actor, he added: ''I view my strongest competition as myself. You're always trying to top yourself, rather than worrying about what other people are doing.''

HEADLINE: Learning by Leaving

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. FISH; As told to Eve Tahmincioglu.

 BODY:
I HAD a completely undistinguished childhood. I was an average student and a second-string athlete, and every college I applied to turned me down -- Michigan State, Kansas, the University of Illinois. The only one that accepted me was Drake University. I went to the college that wanted me. I majored in journalism because I thought I wanted to be in newspapers.
 At Drake I did well but not great. So when I finished I applied to two of the best journalism programs I could find and got turned down again. I was disappointed. But a dean thought I should wing it and apply to Harvard Business School. I actually got in. 
Diversity in those days -- this was 1966 -- was defined differently. We had one African-American and eight women in my Harvard class. I guess I was the only applicant from Iowa and the only journalism major. 
 Once again I would describe my performance as average, but I was the editor of the business school paper, The Harbus, and that attracted the interest of one professor who suggested in my second year that I apply for a travel fellowship from Harvard College. For reasons I don't completely understand, I got one. It gave me one year to do anything I wanted, but I had to spend the full 12 months outside the U.S. 
 I went off to London and enrolled in a couple of courses at the London School of Economics, and one morning I got up and decided to go to India. To this day I don't believe I went to India. I believe India brought me there. India was very poor and people were asking me, ''You're going where?'' I arrived at an ashram and studied meditation and yoga in a very remote place, a small town on the Ganges in Bihar State. I heard about the town when I was in Bombay, and I got on a train to go there. I learned in that period of my life about inner peace and a poise, a balance and a self-reliance. It wasn't about getting up to jog, getting a few chores done, accomplishing a lot. It was about going inward.
 After the year was over, I took a job in Brazil with the Agency for International Development, which is part of the State Department. My goal was to become an ambassador to a developing country, but I realized that would take a long time. So I decided to stay in Brazil but went to work for the Bank of Boston. The bank later sent me off to Japan, and I think I was the youngest general manager of an American bank in Japan. 
 A Japanese colleague once invited me to his home and wanted to show me his moss garden, which was in a relatively large, but not huge, ceramic bowl. It wasn't an acre of land in the backyard. He had been working on that garden for 25 years, watering it with an eyedropper and pruning it with tweezers. I was surprised, and could have laughed, but I took it very seriously. I was grateful for such a special opportunity. Before I went to Japan, I spent two weeks at the Far Eastern center at Harvard and took cultural sensitivity courses. I've come to realize it's all about how you treat people. 
 In 1983, I was brought back to Boston by the bank, and before I knew it I was on the short list to be the next president. I was only about 41. I didn't get the job. I was disappointed and I realized at that time that I shouldn't stay. I was afraid at that point to leave the bank where I had been for 17 years.
 I went over to run the Bank of New England but I was dealt a very big challenge. It was 1990 and the recession was in full gear. The bank was in a much bigger hole than anyone could have imagined, and in 1991 it failed. Then the government sold the bank, with my assistance, and at 47, with a wife and three kids, I was out of a job. 
 The Royal Bank of Scotland approached me in 1992. They had bought a small bank in Rhode Island called Citizens and asked me to run it. I had come to a point in my life, with all the experiences I'd had, that when I took the job at Citizens I felt I was ready to lead.

HEADLINE: No Ordinary Counterfeit

BYLINE: By Stephen Mihm. 
Stephen Mihm teaches history at the University of Georgia. He is at work on two books about the history of counterfeiting in the United States, one to be published by Harvard University Press and the other by HarperCollins.

 BODY:
On Oct. 2, 2004, the container ship Ever Unique, sailing under a Panamanian flag from Yantai, China, berthed in the Port of Newark. As cranes unloaded the vessel's shipping containers, which were filled with a variety of commercial goods, dockworkers singled out a container and placed it aboard a flatbed truck, which was driven to a warehouse a few miles away. There, F.B.I. and Secret Service agents, acting as part of a sting operation, gathered around the container and cracked it open. Beneath cardboard boxes containing plastic toys, they found counterfeit $100 bills worth more than $300,000, secreted in false-bottomed compartments.
The counterfeits were nearly flawless. They featured the same high-tech color-shifting ink as genuine American bills and were printed on paper with the same precise composition of fibers. The engraved images were, if anything, finer than those produced by the United States Bureau of Engraving and Printing. Only when subjected to sophisticated forensic analysis could the bills be confirmed as imitations. 
 Counterfeits of this superior sort -- known as supernotes -- had been detected by law-enforcement officials before, elsewhere in the world, but the Newark shipment marked their first known appearance in the United States, at least in such large quantities. Federal agents soon seized more shipments. Three million dollars' worth arrived on another ship in Newark two months later; and supernotes began showing up on the West Coast too, starting with a shipment of $700,000 that arrived by boat in Long Beach, Calif., in May 2005, sealed in plastic packages and wrapped mummy-style in bolts of cloth.
 In the weeks and months that followed, federal investigators rounded up a handful of counterfeiting suspects in a series of operations code-named Royal Charm and Smoking Dragon. This past August, in the wake of the arrests, Justice Department officials unsealed indictments in New Jersey and California that revealed that the counterfeits were purchased and then seized as part of an operation that ensnared several individuals accused of being smugglers and arms traffickers, some of whom were suspected of having connections to international crime rings based in Southeast Asia. 
 The arrests also prompted a more momentous accusation. After the indictments were released, U.S. government and law-enforcement officials began to say in public something that they had long said in private: the counterfeits were being manufactured not by small-time crooks or even sophisticated criminal cartels but by the government of North Korea. ''The North Koreans have denied that they are engaged in the distribution and manufacture of counterfeits, but the evidence is overwhelming that they are,'' Daniel Glaser, deputy assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes in the Treasury Department, told me recently. ''There's no question of North Korea's involvement.''
 Last September, the Treasury Department took action to signal its displeasure. The department announced that it was designating Banco Delta Asia, a bank in Macao with close ties to North Korea, a ''primary money-laundering concern,'' a declaration that ultimately led to the shutting down of the bank and the freezing of several key overseas accounts belonging to members of North Korea's ruling elite. In a public statement, Treasury officials accused Banco Delta Asia of facilitating North Korea's illicit activities by, among other things, accepting ''large deposits of cash'' from North Korea, ''including counterfeit U.S. currency, and agreeing to place that currency into circulation.''
 The counterfeiting of American currency by North Korea might seem, to some, to be a minor provocation by that country's standards. North Korea, after all, has exported missile technology in blatant disregard of international norms; engaged in a decades-long campaign of kidnapping citizens of other countries; abandoned pledges not to pursue nuclear weapons; and most recently, on July 4, launched ballistic missiles in defiance of warnings from several countries, including the United States.
 But several current and former Bush administration officials whom I spoke with several months ago maintain that the counterfeiting is in important ways a comparable outrage. Michael Green, a former point man for Asia on the National Security Council, told me that in the past, counterfeiting has been seen as an ''act of war.'' A current senior administration official, who was granted anonymity because of the sensitivity of relations between the United States and North Korea, agreed that the counterfeiting could be construed by some as a hostile act against another nation under international law and added that the counterfeits, by creating mistrust in the American currency, posed a ''threat to the American people.''
 Whether counterfeiting constitutes an economic threat, the issue of North Korean counterfeiting is aggravating diplomatic relations between the two countries. According to some analysts, the freezing of North Korea's bank accounts helps explain the regime's decision to launch its missiles on July 4. Bill Richardson, the governor of New Mexico and a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, visited North Korea last fall, not long after the Treasury Department's crackdown. When I spoke with him in mid-July, he said that the missile launch was in part a protest of the department's actions. ''When I was in Pyongyang in October,'' he said, ''my interlocutor raised the counterfeiting issue and the freezing of the assets as a major irritant for the government.'' He continued, ''The counterfeiting issue, and the crackdown on Banco Delta Asia, is a major factor which is contributing to Kim Jong Il's posturing.''
 How much of a concern should the counterfeiting be? Is it worth adding the issue to an already volatile diplomatic situation? The current South Korean government, which has made detente with North Korea a centerpiece of its foreign policy, has shied away from an open confrontation with the regime over the issue. Even many American law-enforcement officials who are upset that North Korea is counterfeiting nonetheless question the view that the counterfeiting poses an urgent threat. In Congressional testimony delivered in April, Michael Merritt, deputy assistant director of investigations for the Secret Service, which is responsible for protecting the nation's currency from counterfeiters, said that the supernote was ''unlikely to adversely impact the U.S. economy based on the comparatively low volume of notes passed.''
 The Bush administration, though, is taking a hard line. In response to a question after a speech in Philadelphia in December, President Bush himself suggested that counterfeiting is among the regime's gravest affronts. ''North Korea's a country that has declared boldly they've got nuclear weapons,'' he said. ''They counterfeit our money. And they're starving their people to death.''

Funny Money
 In December 1989, while counting a stack of $100 bills, an experienced money handler in the Central Bank of the Philippines became suspicious about one bill in particular. It passed the usual tests for authenticity but still felt a bit odd. The bill eventually found its way to the offices of the United States Secret Service. All counterfeits sent to the Secret Service headquarters, in Washington, are examined under a microscope, scrutinized in ultraviolet light and otherwise dissected to reveal their flaws and shortcomings, as well as the printing techniques used in their manufacture. This information is then cross-checked with a database of all known counterfeits.
 As the mystery note underwent the usual scrutiny, it became apparent that this was no ordinary counterfeit. For starters, it was printed on paper made with the appropriate mix of three-quarters cotton and one-quarter linen of real U.S. currency. Making secure paper with this mix requires a special paper-making machine rarely seen outside the United States.
 In addition, the note was manufactured using an intaglio press, the most advanced form of currency-printing technology available. These intaglio presses are far more expensive than ordinary offset, typographic or lithograhic presses, which yield inferior counterfeits. An intaglio press coats the printing plates with ink, and then wipes the surface clean, leaving behind ink in the recesses of the engraving. The press then brings paper and plate together under pressure, so that the ink is forced out of the recessed lines and deposited on the paper in relief. While counterfeits made using the intaglio process had been seen on rare occasions before, this note surpassed all of them in the quality of the engraving.
 As with other new species of counterfeits arriving in the offices of the Secret Service, the bill was given its own flat-file drawer and christened with a sequential number: C-14342. In time, its remarkable quality earned it its more informal honorific: the supernote. But as soon became clear, the supernote was merely one member of a family of counterfeit notes. Technicians at the Secret Service soon linked it to another intaglio note detected around the same time, C-14403. This counterfeit had a few defects that the note from the Philippines did not, suggesting it was manufactured before C-14342. Nonetheless, C-14342 was soon known by the name Parent Note 14342, or PN-14342.
 The Secret Service has drawn up what looks like a genealogical chart of these and related bills, which agents showed me during a visit to their Washington offices this spring. The chart displays the many members of the supernote clan: C-21555, for example, the first ''big head'' $100 (so-called because of the design of the most recent U.S. bills), which was initially identified in London; and C-22500, a more recent arrival that appeared in Macao. The family, which now has 19 members and remains unparalleled even in the world of high-quality counterfeits, also includes two $50 notes: C-20000, a small-head supernote that appeared in Athens, in June 1995; and C-22160, a big-head version, first sighted in Sofia, Bulgaria.
 Thanks to sophisticated tools, including mass spectroscopy and near-infra-red analysis, along with old-fashioned visual inspection, the labs of the Secret Service have established genetic links between the family members. These links are not a matter of resemblance so much as they are an indication of a common ancestry: the notes in the PN-14342 family have been created by an individual or an organization using the same equipment and the same materials, and most likely operating from a single location.
 As the number of supernotes multiplied, the question arose: who created them? In theory, only governments can buy intaglio printing presses used for making money, and only a handful of companies sell them. Those facts alone pointed toward government involvement, but for some time there was no consensus as to which nation was behind the counterfeiting. Many of the supernotes surfaced in the Middle East, notably in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon and in Tehran. In 1992, Bill McCollum, a Florida congressman and chairman of the House Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, issued a report accusing Iran of printing the supernotes. The report estimated that the value of supernotes in circulation might eventually approach ''billions.''
 The Secret Service, however, distanced itself from this accusation. In a letter written in 1995 in response to a Government Accounting Office report on counterfeiting overseas, the Secret Service called the task force's allegations ''unsubstantiated'' and characterized its conclusions as being based on ''rumor and innuendo.'' In reality, evidence was pointing elsewhere.

A Picture Emerges
 With a country as closed and secretive as North Korea, information about government activities is hard to come by. But in the late 1990's, a new source of information arrived in the form of defectors. Starvation, corruption and desperation had prompted thousands of North Koreans, many of them government officials, to flee the country. In 1997, two high-ranking bureaucrats -- Hwang Jang Yop, a former secretary of the North Korean Workers' Party, and Kim Duk Hong, head of a government trading company -- sought political asylum at the South Korean Embassy in Beijing. They were the most prominent officials to defect, but they were hardly alone: thousands of North Koreans have fled to South Korea. Many thousands more have escaped to China.
 In the international intelligence community, vetting accounts from defectors about activities in North Korea soon became a specialty -- as well as a necessity, for the accounts were not always reliable. Raphael Perl, an analyst at the Congressional Research Service who has written extensively on North Korea's counterfeiting operations, told me that ''a lot of defectors or refugees give us information, but they tell us anything we want to know. You have to question the reliability of what they say.'' 
 Nonetheless, the most trustworthy of these accounts, when combined with more traditional intelligence sources, permitted a best guess of what might be happening in North Korea. And as far as counterfeiting was concerned, the picture that emerged suggested that moneymaking had long been a passion for the country's dictatorial ruler, Kim Jong Il, dating back to the 1970's, years before he took over the reins of power from his father, the country's founder and first president, Kim Il Sung.
 Today, on Changgwang Street in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, there is a barricaded compound of government buildings. Judging from satellite photos, these are unremarkable, rectangular structures that suggest no special purpose. Yet according to a North Korean specialist based in Seoul whom I spoke with recently, and who has interviewed many high-ranking North Korean defectors, including Hwang Jang Yop and Kim Duk Hong, these buildings are the home of Office 39, a government bureau devoted to raising hard currency for Kim Jong Il. (The specialist was granted anonymity because of the sensitivity of relations between North and South Korea.)
 While the operatives of Office 39 may well direct legitimate enterprises, including the export of exotic mushrooms, ginseng and seaweed, a substantial portion of the office's revenue comes from its involvement in illicit activities: drug manufacturing and trafficking, sales of missile technology, counterfeit cigarettes and counterfeit $50 and $100 bills. According to Ken Gause, director of the Foreign Leadership Studies Program at the CNA Corporation, a policy group in Virginia that consults on national-security issues, the activities of Office 39 overlap with those of two other offices that occupy buildings in the same complex. The first, Office 38, manages the money acquired by Office 39, he said, while the second, Office 35, handles kidnappings, assassinations and other such activities.
 All three divisions employ the same narrow coterie of elites, and all answer directly to Kim Jong Il, who lives in a villa less than a mile away. The history of the operations of Offices 39, 38 and 35, Gause told me, closely follows Kim Jong Il's own rise to power through the party apparatus. In the early 70's, after helping his father purge the ranks of the Korean Workers' Party of competing factions, Kim Jong Il assumed control of North Korea's covert operations, mostly involving South Korean targets.
 In the mid-70's, according to defector accounts related to me by the North Korean specialist, Kim Jong Il issued a directive to members of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party instructing that expenses for covert operations against South Korea be paid for by producing and using counterfeit dollars. Officials in charge of the operation supposedly brought back $1 bills from abroad, bleached the ink and then used the blank paper to print fairly sophisticated counterfeit $100 bills -- though nothing close in quality to a supernote. Many of these notes were later used by North Korean agents implicated in attacks on South Korean targets, like the operatives arrested for the bombings of a South Korean government delegation in Rangoon in 1983 and a Korean Airlines jet in 1987.
 According to the same defector accounts, Kim Jong Il endorsed counterfeiting not only as a way of paying for covert operations but also as a means of waging economic warfare against the United States, ''a way to fight America, and screw up the American economic system,'' as the North Korean specialist paraphrased it to me. 
 In a similar vein, according to Sheena Chestnut, a specialist on North Korea's illicit activities who has also interviewed several key defectors, counterfeiting was seen as an expression of the guiding idea of the regime: the concept of juche. Often loosely translated as ''self-reliance'' or ''sovereignty,'' the idea of juche entails an aggressive repudiation of other nations' sovereignty -- a reaction to the many centuries in which Korea capitulated to its larger, more powerful neighbors. ''It appears that counterfeiting actually contributed to the domestic legitimacy of the North Korean regime,'' Chestnut told me. ''It could be justified under the juche ideology and allowed the regime to advertise its anticapitalist, anti-American credentials.'' 
 By 1984, as North Korea's planned economy began to fall apart, Kim Jong Il, who by that time was effectively running much of the government, issued another directive, according to the North Korean specialist, who told me he has obtained a copy of the document. It explained that ''producing and using counterfeit U.S. dollars'' was a means, in part, for ''overcoming economic crisis.'' The economic crisis was twofold: not only the worsening conditions among the general population but also a growing financial discontent among the regime's elite, who had come to expect certain perquisites of power. Counterfeiting offered the promise of raising hard currency to buy the elite the luxury items that they had come to expect: foreign-made cars, trips for their children, fine wine and cognac.

Laundering, wholesaling and Redesigning
 Earlier this year, I visited David Asher, a former senior adviser for East Asian and Pacific affairs in the State Department and an outspoken critic of the North Korean regime. In late 2001, he explained to me, Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly asked him to study why the North Korean regime had not collapsed, given that the country's economy had declined even further over the previous decade, with industrial output alone falling by as much as three-quarters. Former Communist countries had ended their subsidies, Kim Il Sung had died, the country was stricken by floods and famine and the food-distribution system had collapsed. (Party slogans betrayed more than a hint of desperation: ''Let's Eat Two Meals a Day'' was one of the era's more uplifting exhortations.) Yet Kim Jong Il, defying all expectations, managed to cling to power.
 ''How this was happening was perplexing, given the huge trade gap, even with adjustments for aid flowing into the country,'' Asher recalled. ''Something just didn't add up. It didn't account for why Kim was driving around in brand new Mercedes-Benzes or handing out Rolexes at parties and purchasing truly large quantities of cognac.''
 As Asher and his colleagues began amassing intelligence, evidence of an array of illicit activities began surfacing -- everything from ivory smuggling to the production of high-grade methamphetamine. And counterfeiting was at the core. ''The more we found out about this counterfeiting of dollars, the more we thought it was outrageous,'' Asher told me. These activities provided what Asher calls ''an alternative framework for existence'' and ''the palace economy of Kim Jong Il.''
 In the spring of 2003, the State Department established the Illicit Activities Initiative, an interagency effort designed to investigate and counter North Korea's criminal activities, and appointed Asher coordinator. The department began to systematically collect a variety of forensic and other evidence gathered by its own investigators, the Secret Service and elements of the intelligence community linking North Korea to the supernotes. (Asher declined to comment on the nature of the evidence, most of which remains classified.)
 In addition, the department put together circumstantial evidence of North Korean counterfeiting that had been accumulating for more than a decade. In 1994, for example, authorities in Hong Kong and Macao apprehended five North Korean diplomats and trade-mission members carrying about $430,000 in bills that turned out to be counterfeits of the supernote variety. Additional North Korean diplomats, including an aide close to Kim Jong Il who was attached to Office 39, were caught trying to launder millions of dollars worth of supernotes over several years, prompting an increased scrutiny of North Korea's diplomatic and trading missions.
 Thwarted, the regime seems to have changed tactics, harnessing new distribution networks and wholesaling the counterfeits to third parties who would funnel them to criminal gangs. In the late 1990's, for instance, British detectives began tracking Sean Garland, the leader of the Official Irish Republican Army, a Marxist splinter group of the I.R.A. According to an unsealed federal indictment in Washington, Garland began working with North Korean agents earlier in the decade, purchasing supernotes at wholesale prices before distributing them through an elaborate criminal network with outposts in Belarus and Russia, as well as Ireland. (Garland denies the charges and is currently fighting extradiction to the United States from Ireland.)
 Details of the actual manufacture of counterfeit notes also began filtering into the State Department, much of the information derived from defector accounts. According to similar accounts compiled by Sheena Chestnut and the North Korean specialist in Seoul whom I spoke with, the regime obtained Swiss-made intaglio printing presses and installed them in a building called Printing House 62, part of the national-mint complex in Pyongsong, a city outside Pyongyang, where a separate team of workers manufactures the supernotes.
 In 1996, frustrated by the high-quality imitations of its currency in worldwide circulation, the United States government redesigned the money for the first time since 1928. Out went the old-fashioned symmetrical designs, replaced by the big-head notes. Almost everything about the new design was aimed at frustrating potential counterfeiters, including a security thread embedded in the paper, a watermark featuring a shadow portrait of the figure on the bill and new ''microprinting,'' tiny lettering that is hard to imitate. The most significant addition was the use of optically variable ink, better known as O.V.I. Look at the bills in circulation today: all 10's, 20's, 50's and 100's now feature this counterfeiting deterrent in the denomination number on the lower-right-hand corner. Turn the bill one way, and it looks bronze-green; turn it the other way, and it looks black. O.V.I. is very expensive, costing many times more than conventional bank-note ink.
 A Swiss company named SICPA is the major manufacturer of O.V.I., and the United States purchased the exclusive rights to green-to-black color-shifting ink in 1996. Other countries followed, purchasing color-shifting inks of different colors for their own currency. One of the first countries to do so, interestingly enough, was North Korea, whose currency, the won, counterfeiters ignore. North Korea purchased O.V.I. from SICPA that shifts from green to magenta. For the purposes of counterfeiting American currency, it would be a smart choice: magenta is the closest color on the spectrum to black. ''The green-to-magenta ink can be manipulated to look very close to green-to-black ink,'' Daniel Glaser of the Treasury Department told me. ''They took this stuff the same year we went to O.V.I.'' According to Glaser, the North Koreans managed to fiddle with the new ink, obtaining an approximation of the O.V.I. on the bills.
 Though there is some dispute on the timing, the first counterfeit big-head supernotes might have arrived on the market as early as 1998. Like the earlier generation of supernotes, the big-head imitations show an ever-growing attention to detail. ''They would certainly fool me,'' said Glaser, who points out that the ''defects'' of the supernote are arguably improvements. He recalled looking at the back of a $100 supernote under a magnifying glass and noticing that the hands on the clock tower of Independence Hall were sharper on the counterfeit than on the genuine.
 From all accounts, superb quality is a feature of much North Korean contraband: methamphetamine of extraordinarily high purity; counterfeit Viagra rumored to exceed the bona fide product in its potency; supernotes. It's an impressive product line for a regime that can barely feed its people. When I discussed this with Asher, he let out a sigh. ''I always say that if North Korea only produced conventional goods for export to the degree of quality and precision that they produce counterfeit United States currency, they would be a powerhouse like South Korea, not an industrial basket case.''

The Threat
 How many supernotes are in circulation, and what sort of provocation do they represent?
 Most government officials interviewed for this story declined to give an estimate, but several, including Michael Merritt of the Secret Service, noted that his agency has removed $50 million worth of supernotes from circulation. That is a far cry from the ''billions'' predicted by Representative Bill McCollum's task force in the early 1990's, and while it may still sound like a lot, it is insignificant relative to the $12 trillion dollar American G.D.P.
 When supernotes are discovered in a smaller foreign economy that makes use of American currency, they can cause a local crisis of confidence in the dollar (this has happened in Taiwan and Ireland, for instance). But in the United States, the economic threat is minimal. For this reason, many analysts, particularly those outside the administration, like Raphael Perl of Congressional Research Service, express concern about making the issue into a diplomatic crisis. Perl, who agrees that the North Koreans are behind the counterfeiting, told me that because American government officials often view the violation of the currency as ''a matter of national honor,'' there is ''an emotional factor that could get blown out of proportion.'' In the process, he argued, counterfeiting can become conflated with other, more pressing problems posed by the North Korean regime, like its nuclear threat.
 This conflation may also be deliberate. According to Kenneth Quinones, who was the North Korea country director in the State Department in the 1990's, hawks in the current administration may be trying to use the counterfeiting issue to impede negotiations with the regime over its nuclear program. Critics of this approach note that the freezing of the North Korean bank accounts took place in the same month that participants in the six-party talks, the multination negotiations over North Korea's nuclear program, hammered out an agreement that the regime would abandon its nuclear-weapons program. North Korea soon reneged on its promise to abandon its nuclear program and has since refused to rejoin the talks until the United States lifts the designation on Banco Delta Asia. The hawks, Quinones told me, ''are attempting to use these sanctions'' to help ''bring down the regime.''
 The senior administration official interviewed for this article dismissed that claim. ''The notion that there was a grand conspiracy by hard-liners is just wrong,'' he told me. ''It's not accurate. This was done as a law-enforcement action by appropriate U.S. government agencies based on the facts of the case.''
 Even if the counterfeiting is not worthy of being a diplomatic issue unto itself, the fact that North Korea is counterfeiting may still serve as a grim reminder of the difficulty of good-faith negotiations with North Korea. Just consider that the supernotes that were seized by law-enforcement officials in New Jersey and California arrived in the United States while the six-party talks were going on. Asher, for one, was stunned by the audacity of the regime. ''If they're going to counterfeit our currency the entire time they're engaged in diplomatic negotiations, what does that say about their sincerity?'' he asked me. ''How can they want normalization with a country whose currency they're counterfeiting? How can they expect it?''
 However the diplomatic standoff is resolved, Asher said that he believes North Korea won't continue to counterfeit much longer. Next year, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is issuing an updated version of the $100 bills. The notes will be expensive to manufacture, requiring the purchase of a new set of presses at a cost that Asher estimated in the ''hundreds of millions'' of dollars. The Treasury Department characterizes the next generation of notes as part of a routine redesign that it will undertake on a regular schedule every decade. But Asher has no illusions as to the timing. ''It might be a routine update,'' he said, ''but it's a routine update that's being instigated by one country: North Korea.''

VERONICA, by Mary Gaitskill. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.95.) A National Book Award finalist, this mesmerizingly dark novel ponders the relationship between beauty and cruelty. Alison, a former Paris model, is haunted by her friendship with Veronica, an eccentric older woman who died of AIDS. (Alison herself has hepatitis C and cleans offices in California.) Moving between past and present, Gaitskill conjures a series of devastating images: Alison as a young runaway in 1970's San Francisco; her debasement by a relentlessly glamorous fashion world; and her exploration of Manhattan's downtown arts scene in the 1980's. The Book Review named ''Veronica'' one of the best books of 2005; our reviewer, Meghan O'Rourke, called it ''a masterly examination of the relationship between surface and self, culture and fashion, time and memory.'' 
ISTANBUL: Memories and the City, by Orhan Pamuk. Translated by Maureen Freely. (Vintage International, $14.95.) In this elegiac memoir of his youth, Pamuk, whose novels include ''My Name Is Red'' and ''Snow,'' sees the collapse of the Ottoman Empire's polyglot capital reflected in the sense of melancholy and spiritual agony -- or huzun -- that casts a pall over the city. In BOOKING PASSAGE: We Irish and Americans (Norton, $14.95), Thomas Lynch, the Michigan poet and undertaker, draws an enticing picture of his home away from home -- Moveen, County Clare, on Ireland's west coast -- that dates back to his first trip there in 1970.
 A SUDDEN COUNTRY, by Karen Fisher. (Random House, $13.95.) Fisher, a former ranch hand and carpenter, captures the beauty and horrors of the Oregon Trail in this first novel, based on the lives of two women who rode in the pioneer wagons: Fisher's great-great-great-grandmother Emma Ruth Mitchell, and her mother, Lucy.
 MARK TWAIN: A Life, by Ron Powers. (Free Press, $16.) This is a lively account of the personality and career of the man who ''found a voice for his country.'' Powers, who grew up in Twain's Hannibal, Mo., recounts the cultural and political history of his subject's time (1835-1910) and makes sense of his crowded, whipsawing life -- as a riverboat pilot, silver prospector, comedian, journalist, traveler and novelist. ''A couple of passages early in this biography are virtuoso performances of descriptive recreation, worthy of Twain,'' Geoffrey Wolff wrote here.
 THE MYSTERIOUS FLAME OF QUEEN LOANA: An Illustrated Novel, by Umberto Eco. Translated by Geoffrey Brock. (Harvest/ Harcourt, $15.) Giambattista Bodoni, the 59-year-old narrator of Eco's provocative hodge-podge of a novel, is a rare-books dealer suffering from a peculiar form of amnesia: he has lost all memory of his existence, except for what he has read. To remake his mind, he searches through a cache of childhood memorabilia -- old newspapers, comics, diaries -- amassed during Mussolini's reign.
 THREE BILLION NEW CAPITALISTS: The Great Shift of Wealth and Power to the East, by Clyde Prestowitz. (Basic, $16.) Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute, presents a thoughtful analysis of America's economic decline under globalization. While China and India surge ahead on the combination of low-cost labor, talent and desire, the United States, Prestowitz argues, struggles with crushing trade and budget deficits, a weak education system and a misguided sense of superiority.
 EPILEPTIC, by David B. (Pantheon, $17.95.) This graphic memoir, by the French cartoonist Pierre-Francois Beauchard (a k a David B.), depicts his family's desperate attempts to deal with his older brother's chronic epilepsy. The Beauchards' futile quest for a cure takes them from surgeons to macrobiotic diets to mediums. In David B.'s dark, antic drawings, these potential solutions become part of a larger cultural history. In the Book Review, Rick Moody said ''Epileptic'' proves that the graphic novel ''can be as graceful as its august literary forebear.''
 MY NAME IS LEGION, by A. N. Wilson. (Picador, $15.) Wilson puts his skills as a novelist, historian and journalist to good use in this sprawling comedy of ideas, in which a radical Anglican monk battles the cynical publisher of a London tabloid over the newspaper's support for an African dictator who is secretly keeping it afloat.
 I DIDN'T DO IT FOR YOU: How the World Betrayed a Small African Nation, by Michela Wrong. (Harper Perennial, $15.95.) Wrong, whose first book, ''In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz,'' was a history of Congo under Mobutu Sese Seko, tracks the bumpy progress of Eritrea, from Italian colony to appendage of Haile Selassie's imperial Ethiopia to sovereign state.

HEADLINE: Echoing the Upper West Side

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY 

 BODY:
THE first condominium tower in the 80-acre Liberty Harbor North redevelopment area is now going up alongside a new light rail stop and the commuter ferry terminal at Pier 11 here.
 Gull's Cove, a 16-story tower that will hold 321 residences, ranging from studios to three-bedroom units, is just a small part of a master plan to transform a former industrial area into a neighborhood resembling the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
The master plan -- recognized in 2001 by the American Planning Association as a model of ''New Urbanism'' because of the way it incorporates high-density housing, multiple transit connections and a pedestrian-oriented streetscape -- was the creation of the Miami architect Andres Duany. He is the designer of Seaside in Florida, where ''The Truman Show'' was filmed; it is considered a New Urbanist icon. 
 Liberty Harbor North is designed to echo the Upper West Side's network of small city blocks with town-house-lined streets intersecting a few broad avenues facing the waterfront, according to Mr. Duany.
 The overall plan includes 6,500 units of market-rate housing, one million square feet of hotel space, 750,000 square feet of retail space, 4.5 million square feet of office space and two parks totaling about 100 acres.
 Two locally based builders, Peter Mocco and Jeff Zak, are the principal developers of the $2 billion project, and control more than half of the redevelopment property. Some sites in the project will be developed by others, as is happening at Gull's Cove. Mr. Mocco and Mr. Zak have yet to announce the details and timing for their own construction plans.
 The other developers that will build pieces of the project include the Applied Companies, which developed the Shipyard mixed-used complex with stores and condominium and rental residences on the riverfront.
 Meanwhile, the Gull's Cove tower is being built by Metro Homes, which is based in Hoboken. It has erected the first five floors of steel for the tower, which is the first phase in a three-building project. Gull's Cove will eventually include another 110 condos in two additional lower-rise buildings.
 Situated about a half-mile west of the Hudson River on the north bank of the Morris Canal, the Liberty Harbor North site offers striking views of Lower Manhattan to the east and the Statue of Liberty to the south, said the Metro Homes principal, Dean Geibel.
 ''The mass transit access from our building can't be beat,'' he asserted confidently one day last week as he stood at the light rail stop opposite the front doors of the building under construction, and looked toward the ferry terminal clearly within sight.
 The light rail system makes a direct connection to the PATH train station at Exchange Place, providing a total commuting time to Manhattan that can be as short as 15 minutes, he said.
 Furthermore, there is nearby street access to the New Jersey Turnpike and the Holland Tunnel, and Newark Liberty International Airport is only 10 minutes away, Mr. Geibel pointed out.
 The condominiums at Gull's Cove, which are being marketed by Century 21, range in size from 548 to 2,415 square feet and are listed at prices ranging from the high $200,000's to $1.2 million.
 Condominium shoppers can view the variety of floor plans available at gullscove.com, the project's Web site, and also see digital renderings depicting apartments finished with the materials and appliances that come with a ''standard' or ''upgraded'' option package.
 Standard features include plank flooring, ceramic tile baths, Whirlpool appliances and black granite countertops. The upgraded package includes cherry or mahogany flooring, marble or porcelain tile, premium-grade KitchenAid appliances, and black or sand-colored granite countertops. In addition, closet spaces can be customized with the upgraded package.
 Gull's Cove will have a 24-hour attended lobby and offer concierge services, Mr. Geibel said. It will also house its own cafe, restaurant, bank, fitness club, child-care center and newsstand.
 A putting green and landscaped deck are to be installed on the roof of one of the lower buildings, and the complex will include three levels of covered parking.
 One of the Liberty Harbor North parks is to be situated on the west side of Gull's Cove, beside the canal. Various views from the condo tower will overlook the park, the harbor, the Statue of Liberty, the Manhattan skyline and, closer at hand, two historic neighborhoods: Van Vorst to the east and Hamilton Park to the north.

HEADLINE: New Condos in Old Spaces Fulfill a Long-Held Dream

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH ABBOTT

DATELINE: Providence, R.I. 

 BODY:
IN 1964, manufacturers were leaving the downtown here in droves, including Brown & Sharpe, a precision toolmaker that once employed 11,000 people in Rhode Island. 
 Like many other companies at the time, Brown & Sharpe relocated to the state's more spacious suburbs, leaving behind 26 dusty acres in central Providence dotted with more than a dozen industrial buildings. The property was just a stone's throw from Providence's mercantile center along the Woonasquatucket River, but with the city's economic future in limbo, prospects for developing it looked bleak.
All along the river back then, empty factories and mills began to loom as Providence's textiles and machine industries moved away. These included a 13-building complex that housed the National & Providence Worsted Mills, and 26 buildings where U.S. Rubber, American Locomotive Works and the Nicholson File Company operated. 
 One developer who saw beyond the desolation was Antonio Guerra. 
 Mr. Guerra, now 79, saw something in the Brown & Sharpe acreage others did not see. Years before Providence began seeing the investment that would lead to its current renaissance, he envisioned a mix of commercial and residential space in the solid, stone structures of the Brown & Sharpe plant, a dream he fully realized this year with the opening of a $50 million apartment complex in four converted factory buildings.
 Mr. Guerra and three partners bought Brown & Sharpe for $3.2 million in 1964, after cobbling together a financing package that included state redevelopment monies, a loan from Industrial National Bank and a loan from Brown & Sharpe. 
 ''It was a tough, tough loan to make,'' recalled Terry Murray, the retired chairman of Fleet Financial Group, who was with Industrial National Bank at the time.
 With the help of his son, Tom Guerra, one of his nine children, Mr. Guerra immediately began leasing space at the Brown & Sharpe site, accepting rents as low as 35 cents a square foot. He redeveloped his first building in 1987 and, since then, has added eight more office buildings and the residential complex.
 Called the Promenade at the Foundry, the complex has 220 units with exposed brick walls, 12- to 18-foot ceilings, and other features that recall the original use of the buildings. The property's industrial past is memorialized in the restoration and display of some of Brown & Sharpe's machinery in common areas and in enlarged historic photographs that decorate the walls. 
 In what once was a workers' cafeteria, there is now a 75-foot pool with a retractable roof. Wooden stable doors, where horses used to pull up with wagonloads of materials and supplies, are painted a fresh green.
 ''You had to see what we started with,'' said Tony Thomas, Mr. Guerra's son-in law and another partner in the project. He noted that most of the windows were broken or missing.
 Rents at the Promenade range from $1,150 for studio lofts to $3,500 for a two-bedroom with a study. About 90 percent of the units are rented, according to Mr. Thomas, despite a surge in the number of new apartments, condos and lofts that have been coming to market. The mix of tenants includes a number of so-called reverse commuters -- people who live in Providence, but work in Boston, he said.
 Promenade tenants have free parking in their own garage -- a luxury for anyone who lives downtown -- and the development is in walking distance to the Providence Place Mall, Water Place Park and other new attractions that have been built during the city's resurgence, Mr. Thomas said. 
 In addition to the residential units at the Promenade, the eight buildings on the Brown & Sharpe site -- now called the Foundry Corporate Office Center -- make up more than a 500,000 square feet of office space, which is fully occupied with approximately 80 tenants. 
 Mr. Guerra said his vision when be bought the property was to create ''a city within a city,'' and while this city really didn't start to materialize until about 10 years ago, Mr. Guerra said he is satisfied with the outcome.
 ''I accomplished what I wanted to accomplish,'' he said.
 That's not to say it was easy. At one point, Mr. Guerra had to spend his retirement savings and mortgage homes in Florida and Providence so he wouldn't lose the complex, Mr. Thomas said.
 Now, of course, it's a different story in Providence. All around the city, old mill buildings and factories are being renovated into the sort of commercial and residential space Mr. Guerra had envisioned. A state historic tax credit that became available four and a half years ago, coupled with the federal historic tax credit, are driving these projects, developers say.
 The Promenade at the Foundry project received state and federal tax credits worth a total of $17 million to the developers, according to Mr. Thomas. The project would have been financially impossible without the credits, he said.
 Since the credit came on line in January 2002, the Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission has approved more than 200 projects, representing more than $1 billion of private investment in Rhode Island, according to Edward F. Sanderson, the commission's executive director. These projects are creating housing units by the score -- 1,616 have been completed throughout the state, with another 2,300 under construction, he said.
 Much of this new development is taking place in Woonasquatucket River valley, where two of Providence's poorer neighborhoods, Olneyville and Valley Street, are located. The projects include Rising Sun Mills, a $55 million renovation of National & Providence Worsted Mills, and American Locomotive Works, a $333 million project planned for 22.5 acres, where U.S. Rubber, American Locomotive Works and the old Nicholson File company used to operate.
 The developer Struever Brothers, Eccles & Rouse of Baltimore teamed up with the Armory Revival Company of Providence on Rising Sun Mills. Struever Brothers is also behind the American Locomotive Works project, which recently won master plan approval from the planning commission.
 The benefits of saving these old buildings and putting them to new use are enormous, said Bill Struever, the company's founder. Not only do they generate tax income and create housing, but, for many people, the old mills represent their community's soul.
 But there is a down side. Providence's artists, who have long used the mills for cheap studio space, have joined with residents from Olneyville and Valley Street to complain about displacement. They are also concerned that the developments will gentrify their neighborhoods and make them unaffordable.
 Mr. Struever said it is not his intention to make Providence too expensive for its residents. For a city to be healthy, it must have affordable ''work force'' housing for families, artists and small businesses, he said. 
 Struever Brothers plans to work with the city and the Rhode Island Housing Mortgage and Finance Corporation, the state's housing agency, to see that the concerns of residents are addressed. And at the request of the agency, the developer will price 20 percent of housing units at the American Locomotive Works project moderately, but Mr. Struever said that might not be enough.
 ''We love to a part of the dialogue on affordable, mixed-income housing,'' he said.

HEADLINE: 'Bonfire of the Vanities' No Longer 

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
THE list of suggested cures for Mott Haven's ills was already long, but it just got longer. Officials working to reduce crime, improve schools, lower the cost of housing and create green space are now pondering how to reach these goals while achieving image enhancement. 
 To that end, the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, nicknamed SoBro, recently bought the warehouse at 130 Willis Avenue, a run-down century-old structure that happens to be the first thing people see when they cross the Willis Avenue Bridge, which connects Manhattan to the Bronx. They plan to rename the building the Gateway, clean it up and eventually have 23 market-rate apartments to sell. With this, it is hoped, Mott Haven will make a better first impression.
''The movie 'Bonfire of the Vanities' portrayed us one way,'' said Richard D. Ross, SoBro's vice president for real estate development, recalling Mott Haven's depiction as a crime-ridden danger zone. ''We've been fighting to change that stereotype ever since.'' 
 By many indicators they have succeeded. What is first noticeable is the row of antique stores lining Bruckner Boulevard, which has been spruced up with pear trees, park benches and imitation gas lamps. 
 Less obvious but perhaps even more significant is the fact that since the 1980's, the area has added hundreds of new apartments (many of which have income restrictions).
 Old factories that languished for decades now offer stylish lofts, drawing people priced out of Harlem, artists seeking work space, and commuters who need to be near highways, as Interstates 87 and 278 arc around the neighborhood. Lots that used to be strewn with litter are now filled with trim multifamily houses. 
 The area's large Latino population -- 72 percent identified themselves as Hispanic in the 2000 census -- is felt especially on the side streets off Willis and Brook Avenues, where older men hunch over intense domino games, their accompaniment a crackly transistor blaring salsa. 
 Crime is down. According to the 40th Precinct, which covers Mott Haven, there were 10 homicides in 2005, down from 13 in 2000. There were 26 reported rapes, down from 38 five years earlier. Over that period, robberies fell to 550 from 618, and burglaries dropped to 241 from 469. 
 Other figures are perhaps more troubling: According to the census, 57 percent of the population have not finished high school and 25 percent of households are on public assistance. A dauntingly large number, 47 percent, live below the poverty line.
 Still, investors are flocking to the neighborhood, convinced that its recovery is gaining momentum.
 ''This will very soon be the place to be,'' said Sonny Tran, who last summer paid $1.55 million for two attached 1920's buildings on Willis Avenue and East 138th Street, with 16 apartments and three storefronts. He puts its value at $2.25 million.
 Leon Joosen would agree. Before November 2004, he and his partner, Charlie Anderson, were living in Hollywood, Calif., in a loft in a converted textile factory that he owned. After the couple moved east, for ''a change of scene,'' Mr. Joosen read online about the evolution of the Bronx and was intrigued. They ended up choosing a 750-square-foot loft in Mott Haven in the Clock Tower, a piano factory converted in 2005, where they pay less than $1,500 a month. The five-story building has 75 units on the second through fifth floors.
 ''It's very safe; there's lots of space and trees; we're steps from Harlem,'' said Mr. Joosen, an animation director in Manhattan. ''This area has definitely come up.''

What You'll Find
 The flattened tip of a peninsula that juts down from the Bronx, Mott Haven stretches from the Grand Concourse in the west to the Bruckner Expressway in the east, and includes a jumble of empty or converted factories, brick row houses, towering city-owned housing and newer two- and three-family homes, with tiny concrete gated yards in front.
 There are three historic districts in Mott Haven, 19th-century brownstone neighborhoods with stoops and fanciful rooflines and, in many cases, neon-tone paint jobs. Most now have more than one family living in them, some illegally, but buyers are converting them back to single-family residences, brokers say.
 The market tilts heavily in favor of renters -- three-quarters of all units are rentals -- but there is a slow shift toward owner-occupied buildings, said Allison Jaffe, a broker with Key Real Estate Services in White Plains, which focuses on the Bronx. 
 There may be more dwellings to choose from over all, as Mott Haven is likely to experience a surge of new housing in the next few years. To start with, the city is expected to continue its rezoning of the area, allowing habitation of sites where factories churned out pianos, metal cupolas and sweaters. That should ease the way for more projects like the Gateway (which is expected to cost $4.5 million) and several others currently in the planning stages. 
 The developer of the Clock Tower, for one, is planning an adjacent building with 100 rental units, according to Chesky Friedman, a property manager for the Carnegie Management and Development Corporation, which owns the empty warehouse on the site. Groundbreaking will begin in a few months, he said.
 Meanwhile, Bradford N. Swett Management, which owns the Glassworks Building, a former beer storage facility at 79 Alexander Avenue, says it may turn newly built-out office space there into apartments. 
 ''I get 10 to 15 calls a day from people who see the building there and think we have live-in lofts,'' said Christopher Gallagher, a leasing agent there. 
 Similarly K & B Furniture is trying to sell a warehouse at 430 Southern Boulevard and East 143rd Street, in hopes that a developer will find its tin ceilings ideal for apartments.
 ''The loft look is happening all over the country,'' said Frank J. Gerage, director of sales for Domain Properties, the broker for the seller. ''We hope it happens here.'' 

What You'll Pay
 Homes in Mott Haven are often sold without their help, brokers say; they estimate that building prices are about half those in Harlem. A 17-foot-wide four-story Alexander Avenue town house that needs gutting might cost $500,000, according to brokers, while a building of the same size in Harlem, needing similar repairs, might cost $1 million or more. 
 Even so, prices are increasing rapidly. Lily Yanhua Li, a sales associate with the Corcoran Group, says she has seen a 50 percent increase in the last three years; for a decade before that, prices were flat. 
 Rents, meanwhile, are climbing by about 4 percent a year, brokers say. But renters in Mott Haven get far more square footage for their money. Mr. Tran, the developer, explained that while $1,000 might get a one-bedroom apartment in Harlem, $1,300 could fetch a three-bedroom in Mott Haven (there are few one-bedrooms in the neighborhood anyway). 
 Most single-family homes for sale in Mott Haven -- those built in the 1990's -- give preference to local and lower-income buyers. 

The Schools
 Area public schools have historically had a bad reputation but seem to be improving. About a dozen elementaries serve the neighborhood; their third- and fifth-grade test scores have steadily climbed over the past few years, said Andy Jacobs, a city education spokesman.
 At the high school level, in the worse old days the graduation rate at the behemoth South Bronx High School hovered around 30 percent, said Kelly Devers, a city education spokeswoman. Several years ago the school was divided up; the new, smaller satellites handedout diplomas for the first time this spring. Scores are not yet available, but graduation rates seem to be higher.
 At Mott Haven Village Preparatory High School, the graduation rate was 81 percent, Ms. Devers said, as compared with a citywide average of 58.2 percent.
 Similarly, at New Explorers High School, in the same building, 73 percent of seniors graduated. At Urban Assembly School for Careers in Sports, the rate was 76 percent.
 By comparison, Alfred E. Smith Career and Technical Education High School, which enrolled more than 1,300 students in the 2003-2004 year, had only a 44 percent graduation rate. SAT scores for that year were 373 for the verbal section and 401 for the math, as compared with 496 verbal and 510 math statewide.
 Parochial schools like Cardinal Hayes High, which also accepts non-Catholic students, draw heavily from Mott Haven, said William Lessa, the guidance director. Typically, 98 percent of graduates go on to either a two- or a four-year college.

What to Do
 For now, Manhattan expatriates tend to flock to Bruckner Bar and Grill, which opened in 2003 alongside the Third Avenue Bridge. Six draft beers are on tap, and the menu includes salads and burgers, but the restaurant also holds poetry readings, and bands occasionally jam. 
 Giovanni's, at 150th and Grand Concourse, just at Mott Haven's edge, was originally a pizzeria but has expanded in recent years, adding an upscale restaurant and a lounge.

The Commute
 Because its main subway stop, East 138th Street on the 6 train, is just one past Manhattan, Mott Haven feels like an extension of it. There is also express service, on the 4 or 5 trains, from the stop at East 138th Street and Grand Concourse. 
 The B15 bus runs down Lincoln Avenue and across the Third Avenue Bridge into Manhattan. To head out of the city, some residents catch Metro-North trains at East 125th Street, four blocks from the bridge.

The History
 Edward J. Flynn, one of many Irish-Americans who grew up in Mott Haven in the early 20th century, was a career politician who became head of the Bronx County Democratic Party, a power in choosing candidates for higher office.
 During the Roosevelt years, Mr. Flynn wielded so much influence that, it is said, he had open access to the White House. Once he picked someone to run, that person was ''in like Flynn,'' according to Lloyd Ultan, the Bronx borough historian.

What We Like
 Even in a city fond of hunting out the next hip neighborhood, Mott Haven exists below most radars, so prices are still relatively low. But that may change. The Gateway building's apartments are supposed to include luxury finishes that have until now been a rarity in Mott Haven, and such an investment could inspire other developers to follow suit. 

Going Forward
 Close to water on three sides, Mott Haven is almost entirely cut off from it by roads and parking lots, though local activists are working to create parks and access. 
 The neighborhood also lacks high-end groceries, though there is a new food co-op at Brook Park, on East 141st Street and Brook Avenue.

HEADLINE: Still Standing in Patchogue

BYLINE: By VALERIE COTSALAS

DATELINE: PATCHOGUE 

 BODY:
A CROWD gathered to watch recently as a 113-year-old house, raised up on bright yellow hydraulic dollies, crept across a cleared swath of community garden, turned onto a stretch of road and descended a ramp of dirt to a new concrete footprint. The event made way for the start of downtown Patchogue's transformation.
 George and Claudia DeFilippo's two-family house, completely intact, with wreaths still hanging on the doors, changed addresses on July 12 from 73 Railroad Avenue in this village to no-number-yet Taylor Lane two blocks away. 
When the house moved, the last obstacle to a development of 80 attached houses, half of them to be subsidized and sold at below-market rates, was removed. 
 ''My mother shed a few tears when the house was coming off the foundation'' the night before the move, said the DeFilippos' son, Leonard, who had been living in the house. ''It's in a little different location, but considering we're in the same basic proximity, I guess we're happy.'' 
 There were 21 privately owned lots on a five-acre site at South Ocean Avenue between Gerard Street and Railroad Avenue when the mayor of the village of Patchogue, Paul Pontieri, chose the area for a new development of affordable homes. The project will be called Copper Beech Village and is to be developed by Pulte Homes of New York. 
 About a year ago, Mr. Pontieri and the Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, said they might condemn some properties of stubborn homeowners, then take the land by eminent domain to create the Copper Beech development and pay homeowners prices based on market rates.
 Many, including tenants, homeowners and business owners, said that they didn't want to leave. Most of the homeowners had two-family homes rented to tenants. The older DeFilippos didn't live in the relocated home, but they had raised their family there over 27 years. They now live elsewhere in the village. 
 The DeFilippos had scrimped and saved and worked for decades to buy and keep the house, their son said. The 1893 home was too sewn into their history, their family, to relinquish it to the wrecking ball.
 Mr. DeFilippo learned from a local newspaper article that the village might condemn his parents' house and others, he said. He went to Village Hall to protest and later took his case to a local television station.
 In the end, the builder agreed to pick up the house and move it to a village-owned parking lot on Taylor Lane, at a cost of $250,000. This covered hooking up to water, electricity and the sewage system; landscaping; preparing the foundation; and pouring the basement. The DeFilippos received an additional $200,000, according to the builder, for agreeing to the move.
 ''Instead of opting for eminent domain, we sat down and said, 'O.K., what can we do?' '' said Peter Brindley, an operations manager for Pulte Homes. 
 Pulte settled with other homeowners to buy their lots at prices of $280,000 to $605,000 and to relocate tenants, said Gerry Crean, a village trustee who brokered the deals.
 Suffolk County also contributed $3.3 million to the village to help pay for the land acquisitions. Pulte paid a total of about $6 million in relocation and acquisition costs, part of the expected $21 million cost for the project. 
 In return for all of its expenditures, the village granted the builder zoning approvals to build 16 attached units per acre, greater density than would otherwise be allowed, Mayor Pontieri said. 
 There are other high-density developments going up nearby in the village, he said, including a 36-unit development on the Patchogue River and 63 town houses on four acres in a former blighted parcel surrounded by old Victorian homes. Those units will be sold at market rates.
 Jim Morgo, the Suffolk County commissioner of economic development and work force housing, said Pulte's plan for Copper Beech Village was approved in half the normal approval period for a market-rate development. ''The reason it was streamlined is because it was 50 percent affordable,'' Mr. Morgo said.
 Twenty of the affordable two-bedroom, two-bath town houses will sell for $158,973 to buyers earning up to 80 percent of the median income, which is $72,800 for a family of four, according to Diana Weir, the vice president of Long Island Housing Partnership, a nonprofit organization that garners state and federal funds for affordable developments.
 The other 20 subsidized units will be priced at $243,695, for buyers earning up to 120 percent of the median, or $109,200 for a family of four.
 The 40 market-rate town houses will be priced at $350,000 to $400,000, Mr. Brindley said.
 In the world of residential development, it seems, builders don't blink an eye at moving houses or paying millions of dollars to buy out stubborn homeowners. Even with the profit on the 40 affordable units limited at 10 percent of the cost to build the homes, high-density zoning and fast approvals reduce a builders' speculative risk.
 Or, as Mr. DeFilippo put it: ''I'm sure they're making plenty of money,'' adding that Pulte Homes had given his parents a fair deal. His father stood next to him, looking up at the house in silence, waving off questions, as a local TV cameraman and newspaper photographers recorded the event.
 Mr. DeFilippo praised the movers, Wolfe House and Building Movers of Bernville, Pa., who toiled for two days in hot sticky weather. ''These are really hardworking people, I've never seen them stop,'' he said. ''We're just in awe of the way they do this.''
 Mr. DeFilippo is staying in an apartment for now. He expects to move back into the Taylor Lane house in about two months. The house looks fine, he said, save for one window that broke when it was hit by a wayward porch floorboard.

HEADLINE: Grease Is the Word: Fill It Up With Fry Oil

BYLINE: By JIM NORMAN. 
Jim Norman is a staff editor for the Business Day section of The New York Times.

 BODY:
ON a recent return trip from Massachusetts to my home in New Jersey, a distance of 160 miles, I burned a total of two cups of diesel fuel in my 2001 Volkswagen Jetta TDI. 
 Since that would indicate fuel economy of more than 600 miles per gallon, something didn't quite compute.
The missing part of the equation was this: I was returning from Easthampton, Mass., where Daryl Beck, a mechanic well versed in such matters, had just installed a secondary fuel system in my car. The main fuel I used on the drive home was not diesel, which the Jetta was designed to burn, but straight vegetable oil.
 I used diesel fuel for only the first 10 miles of the trip. After that, the diesel gauge stayed right where it was while the VW sped happily along on soybean oil -- the same stuff that restaurants use for deep frying and salad dressing. I used less than three gallons of oil for the final 150 miles of my trip home, which calculates out to more than 50 miles per gallon. Not bad. 
 The conversion kit that Mr. Beck installed was produced by Greasecar, a manufacturer of vegetable fuel units for diesel cars; gasoline engines cannot be converted to burn vegetable oil. The kit cost about $900, including an optional temperature gauge and audible warning signal, and another $1,000 for the installation, which takes an experienced mechanic about seven hours.
 Now, after more than 2,000 miles on veggie oil, there seem to be few disadvantages to the transformation. My car seems to get slightly better mileage, it seems to run a little more quietly and it has just as much zip as it does on diesel. According to test results I've seen, vegetable oil burns somewhat cleaner in most categories than diesel fuel, and emits absolutely no sulfur. What a veggie car does emit is a smell faintly redolent of the kind of oil being burned -- or, in the case of used oil, the scent of whatever it might have cooked previously. 
 Vegetable oil, of course, is a renewable resource that emits no more carbon dioxide than next year's crop will absorb and requires no drilling for soybeans in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or anywhere else. The environmentally aware will give you even more points in the game of green for using oil previously used for cooking. 
 You'll get no points, though, from the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which recently issued a statement stating flatly that using vegetable oil as fuel is a violation of the Clean Air Act and that modifying a car for vegetable oil subjects the owner to a $2,750 fine. [Page 2.]
 Justin Carven, the founder and owner of Greasecar, says his company has started the process of qualifying his conversion kit for E.P.A. certification.
 Going veggie is not the gas-and-go type of driving Americans are accustomed to. At discount stores like Costco or Sam's Club, soybean oil costs about $13 for a 35-pound ''cubie,'' a squarish jug that holds about 4 1/2 gallons. That makes it a few cents less per gallon than the current price of diesel fuel. 
 It's possible to pay less -- or nothing at all. I have also collected 20 cubies of waste oil, just for the asking, from various restaurants and from a generous fellow greaser with an excess of oil. Now that I have my filtration station up and running in a corner of my garage, even visits to the local big-box store will be few and far between.
 There are a few things I must be attentive to: I have to remember to purge my fuel lines of vegetable oil and switch back to diesel a few minutes before ending a trip. If I forget this on a cold night, the oil could congeal and make starting the next morning impossible without the aid of a hair dryer. 
 I have to remember to use the purge function on my dash-mounted fuel selection switch for no more than 20 seconds or so. If I leave it in purge position, it can allow diesel fuel to flow back into the vegetable oil tank and overfill it until it flows through the air vent, a mess I would rather not experience.
 Add a few factors to the category of minor inconvenience that accompanies my energy-independence euphoria: I have to carry a spare vegetable oil filter for that inevitable moment when the original says it has had enough. I also have a filter wrench and a pair of oven gloves to let me change filters while the engine is still hot. And I mustn't forget the turkey baster: that's to fill the new filter with vegetable oil from the tank, so I don't introduce an air bubble into the system, causing the engine to stall. 
 My trunk is a little -- no, a lot -- less spacious than it used to be, because of the spare cubie of oil I carry, along with a big funnel that lets me fill the tank without spills. The spare tire also takes up space inside the trunk now; the veggie oil tank occupies the well that used to contain the spare.
 Notwithstanding the inconveniences, my wife, Ginger, is as enamored of this experiment as I am. She has claimed the Jetta as her own, but has volunteered to help with the mechanical work to convert another car for me. She calls the experience the ''Noah project,'' named after our 11-month-old grandson, who she hopes will benefit from a better world if others do the same thing.
 Despite the obvious benefits of using a fuel that contributes to the nation's energy independence, that is relatively cheap and that can be burned after having already served its original purpose -- cooking food -- it is worth noting that vegetable oil is unlikely to replace petroleum anytime soon.
 As the number of conversions rises, users will eventually soak up the supply of used cooking oil. As with ethanol and other agriculture-based fuels, it remains to be seen whether growing soybeans is an efficient way to produce nonpetroleum fuels, since the farming process consumes large amounts of fuel and chemical-rich fertilizers. Also, growing crops for use as fuels could have unforeseen effects on the prices and supplies of food.
 The territory is uncharted in other ways, as well, as seen in the comments posted in an online forum sponsored by Greasecar.com. Take the case of ''Chase,'' a Massachusetts resident who was perhaps not as careful as he might have been in the storage of his cache of oil. ''No BooBoo to be seen,'' Chase wrote, ''but this AM there was a really big black bear with its snout in an opened and overturned 5 gal. Luckily the grease spilled onto my gravel driveway, so it should soak in soon enough. Also lucky she did not get into the 12 other buckets! Some arm waving and yelling sent it packing.''
 A frequent question about vegetable oil is whether cars run more sluggishly on it. Consider ''TDIGuy,'' who sought advice on whether a blown head gasket could have resulted from ''running a VW too fast for too long'' and ''hitting the gas pretty hard.'' After receiving some helpful comments, TDIGuy came clean: ''When I said speeding a little, and a little hard on the gas, I was actually trying to hit 140 in the car. Managed to get 130, but I think I put too much stress on the engine.'' 
 A common concern about converting a car for vegetable oil is that it could harm the engine. But some people who have done conversions say they've seen no damage, even after many miles. Phil Gibbs, a New York City firefighter who makes a 75-mile commute twice a week from his Putnam County home, said he had driven his 2002 Jetta 75,000 miles on vegetable oil with no trouble. 
 The car had 70,000 miles on it before it was converted. ''It runs like it did when it was new,'' Mr. Gibbs said. The key, he added, is making certain not to switch to vegetable oil until it has reached the proper temperature.
 The typical conversion involves installing a parallel fuel system with an independent tank (mine is aluminum, shaped like a hockey puck and holds 13 gallons), a heating system that diverts hot engine coolant through copper coils placed within the tank and wrapped around a specially installed vegetable oil filter in the engine compartment, and a set of solenoid-activated valves controlled by a dash-mounted switch that diverts the flow between diesel fuel and vegetable oil. 
 There is also a fuel temperature gauge that tells the driver when to switch from diesel fuel to vegetable oil after starting out, and a somewhat representational fuel gauge that gives a rough approximation of how much vegetable oil is in the tank. 
 Greasecar, the company that built my conversion kit, was started in 2000 by Mr. Carven, a Hampshire College mechanical design graduate who had experimented as a school project on a junk car he bought for $300. He went on to celebrate his graduation with a cross-country trip in an old VW van that he equipped with a vegetable oil system. 
 Now, Greasecar has 14 employees and ships about 300 conversion kits a month from its shop in a 19th-century brick factory complex.
 Many buyers follow the instruction manuals that come with the kits and do the installations themselves. Others, like me, seek experienced mechanics who know exactly what they are doing and keep up with the latest developments in the art of greasing. Several manufacturers of similar kits have loose networks of recommended installers.
 In addition to the commercially available kits, many home-built systems are being installed by backyard tinkerers all over the country. You can get in touch with them on Internet forums like the ones at the Web sites for Greasecar.com; for another kit manufacturer, Frybrid.com; and at Biodiesel.infopop.cc/eve.
 To convert a car to run on vegetable oil, you have to start with a diesel car; it cannot be done with a gasoline engine. Not all states allow the sale of new diesel-powered passenger cars, and there are different state rules governing the sale of used ones. (I bought mine from B & B Auto Sales in North Providence, R.I., sight unseen, via an eBay auction.) I was a lucky buyer; even though the car had 147,000 miles on the odometer, it was in fine condition, exactly as described by the seller.
 I was surprised to learn that Rudolf Diesel, inventor of the combustion cycle bearing his name, originally intended his engine to run on vegetable oil. In 1912, seven years after he introduced his engine at a Paris exposition, he said: ''The use of vegetable oils for engine fuels may seem insignificant today. But such oils may become in the course of time as important as the petroleum and coal tar products of the present time.''
 For me and my Volksvegan, that course of time is now.

HEADLINE: The Promenade, Soviet Style

BYLINE: By PAUL BERGER

 BODY:
IN provincial Russian cities, the bars and restaurants can be prohibitively expensive. So for most people the only thing to do on a fine summer evening is go for a walk. 
 If the city is an old one that has a kremlin, or citadel, like Novgorod in northwestern Russia, people walk around it. If the city is a newer one with a lake, like Petrozavodsk, also in the northwest, people walk along it. In either case, during warm months and light nights, it sometimes seems as though the whole town is strolling or watching those who are.
The boardwalk in the heavily Russian neighborhood of Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, lies thousands of miles from the motherland, but the long, broad promenade invites its residents to continue the tradition. For the visitor, this behavior turns Brighton Beach into a singularly Russian experience, though many of the people there come not from Russia itself but from former Soviet republics like Latvia, Georgia and Ukraine. 
 The benches are typically filled by old women armed with multicolored umbrellas, which they use to protect themselves from the sun. In Russian towns, these babushkas, as they are known, often gather on seats outside apartment buildings, but on the boardwalk they are at center stage.
 The crowd they survey almost always includes young men shaped like battering rams, with impossibly square heads and haircuts to match. A congregation of wiry, suntanned biznesmeni, dressed in black, is seldom far away, clinching deals on cellphones.
 On a recent Sunday afternoon, three women sat looking across the boardwalk toward the Atlantic Ocean. In the middle, beneath a pink and white umbrella, sat Emma Krasnaia, a stocky 76-year-old, who explained in a patient, kindly way that she came from the resort town of Sukhumi, the capital of a region of Georgia where Greeks, Armenians, Georgians and Jews used to stroll along the shore of the Black Sea.
 ''Everyone got along very well there,'' she said. ''Until they started fighting each other.'' 
 Ms. Krasnaia's friend Lana, who, like many of the immigrants, was suspicious of the authorities and would give only her first name, was from another seaside place, the Latvian city of Riga. She came to New York, she said, because as a native Russian she found Latvia deeply inhospitable. ''Even if both of your parents were Latvian but you were born in Russia, you were not welcome,'' she explained. Pointing toward her chest, she added, ''You just don't have it in your soul.''
 As the women chatted, the boardwalk filled with more people: grandparents gazing adoringly at grandchildren, slim mothers wearing sleek black Spandex and pushing prams, and the occasional long-legged beauty flanked by muscle-bound men dressed in retro-chic tracksuits. 
 In a kremlin park, a makeshift cafe might sell beer and the kebabs known as shashliki to the accompaniment of European and Russian pop music. But Brighton Beach is more refined, lined with boardwalk restaurants with names like Tatiana and Volna, the Russian word for wave. The waiters serve frozen looks on the side; Manhattan notions of service seem yet to have reached this patch of Brooklyn. 
 A little east of the restaurants, two elderly men carefully moved chess pieces on a faded wooden chessboard. One waved his hand in defeat and hurried away from the victor, Boris Bolotnikov, an 81-year-old veteran of World War II, more commonly known in Russia as the Great Patriotic War. Mr. Bolotnikov wore a white shirt and tie, a baseball cap, a pair of impossibly large, mirrored sunglasses, and a blazer decorated with at least 20 badges and medals earned during his time in the Red Army. 
 ''They wanted to remove my leg,'' he said of a war wound, rolling up his right trouser leg to reveal a mass of red and purple skin. ''They wanted me to sign a piece of paper, but I refused.'' 
 Mr. Bolotnikov, who immigrated from Kiev 31 years ago, does not only play chess along the boardwalk. He also sells copies of a book, ''Enchanting Sally Saved the World,'' which he self-published in Russian two years ago. He printed 200 copies of the book, which tells the story of a woman who saves the earth from the forces of evil, and he seems pleased that he has managed to sell half of them. At the end is a reproduction of a letter from President Bush, written in 2004 and thanking Mr. Bolotnikov for his support. 
 Just after 3 p.m., possibly the hottest part of the day, the boardwalk was at its busiest. The number of young people seemed to have grown, though most of the strollers were still over 60. 
 As the crowd headed west toward Coney Island, it thinned and then re-formed into a more familiar New York mix of races, ethnicities and languages. But before the Russian faces disappeared entirely, and still within the limits of Brighton Beach, was a 24-year-old woman named Angela, from the city of Khmelnytskyi in Western Ukraine. She has broad Slavic features and wispy blond hair and carried a black handbag adorned with a silver Dior clip.
 Although Angela left Khmelnytskyi a dozen years ago, she still remembers going for walks by the river with her family. ''Everybody used to hang out there,'' she said. ''There was nothing else to do.''

HEADLINE: New York's Fat Political Budget

 BODY:
It has taken a while for the financial experts to figure out exactly what happened at the end of June in Albany. The last days of any legislative session are always a blur, and deep in the mounds of freshly minted laws there are always a few surprises. 
 But this year the biggest surprise turns out not to be all those sneaky little legislative items that New York's lawmakers have managed to tuck away here and there. It is the total cost of the big final hairball of interconnected supplemental budget laws sometimes called the ''clean-up'' bills. ''Clean out'' might be a better term. 
 Comptroller Alan Hevesi reported last week in his department's preliminary analysis of this year's session that the state will spend over $114.7 billion, including federal funds, in the current fiscal year. That is an increase of $10.1 billion over last year's spending. And the increase in state funds alone is about 13 percent, a full four times the inflation rate. 
 Admittedly, times are good. And the state suddenly has -- make that had -- a $2 billion surplus. But New York's politicians spent the surplus and then some because nobody seems to have thought that this Wall Street boomlet might be temporary. Or that the price of oil might hit three digits. 
 The reason for all this largess is simple: It's an election year. And New York's Legislature and Gov. George Pataki, who is looking at the presidential primaries down the road, did not want to hit the campaign trail empty handed. So a budget was passed and signed that had so many goodies in it that even the people who regularly monitor Albany and are used to such shenanigans were shocked.
 Moreover, Mr. Hevesi's post-session report raises so many red flags, it looks like a Beijing ballet. Spending, up 30 percent, is growing faster than revenues, which are up 15 percent. This is never a good way to plan for the future because it means more borrowing: the state's debt is up by $16.5 billion this year. Some debt, of course, is good -- a chunk of this new borrowing is for necessary projects like New York City schools. But at this rate the state's debt could increase to nearly $65 billion, or more than a third of the projected state budget, in five years. This should sound the alarm, but so far it appears that somebody in Albany left it on mute.
 The state also used part of its surplus for operating expenses. That is like using a one-time bonus to cover the first few payments for a flashy new car. The question is always how you pay once the windfall disappears. 
 At some point, New York's voters will have to take a hard look at the state's spendthrift ways -- item by painful item. For example, legislators and Mr. Pataki made a big splash last month when they announced that a computer chip factory would be built in Saratoga County. The project will cost the state between $1.2 billion to over $3 billion in various tax breaks, loan guarantees and other subsidies. 
 According to one estimate, each new job will cost a whopping $1 million. But here's the clincher: The chip fab, as the factory is called, will be located in the district of the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, one of the three most powerful men in New York State government.
 Mr. Pataki, a self-described fiscal conservative who has signed on to this supplemental legislation, is nibbling away at the bottom line with a few vetoes here and there. But nothing he does can disguise the elemental truth that what Albany has given us is another irresponsible election-year budget that throws out as many goodies as a Mardi Gras float.

HEADLINE: Cities Shed Middle Class, And Are Richer and Poorer for It

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
SOME big American cities are flourishing as at no time in recent memory. Places like New York and San Francisco appear to be richer and more dazzling than ever: crime remains low, new arrivals pour in, neighborhoods have risen from the dead. New York is in the throes of the biggest building boom in 30 years, its population at an all-time high and climbing. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proudly promotes his city as ''a luxury product.'' 
 But middle-class city dwellers across the country are being squeezed.
This time, they are being squeezed out by the rich as much, or more so, as by the poor -- a casualty of high housing costs and the thinning out of the country's once broad economic middle. The percentage of middle-income neighborhoods in metropolitan areas like Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington has dropped since 1970, according to a recent Brookings Institution report. 
 The percentage of higher-income neighborhoods in many places has gone up. In New York, the supply of apartments considered affordable to households with incomes like those earned by starting firefighters or police officers plunged by a whopping 205,000 in just three years, between 2002 and 2005.
 Does it matter if there is less room for a middle class? In strictly economic terms, plenty of economists say, it may not. But they also say that in the long run, those cities may become places where they and other city lovers would prefer not to live.
 Obviously, cities benefit economically from the presence of the rich. Tax revenues go up when the rich pour into what some economists now call ''superstar cities,'' places like New York, San Francisco, San Diego, Boston and Washington that attract highly skilled people but have limits on the ability to build housing. In New York, fewer than 13,000 of the 2.3 million households that pay income tax are expected to account for nearly 30 percent of city income tax paid in 2006.
 In the San Francisco Bay Area, the percentage of households earning more than $100,000 a year rose to over 30 percent in 2000 from approximately 7 percent in 1970, said Joseph Gyourko, a professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''Is that area worse off?'' he asked. ''At least so far, there's a lot of evidence that economically they're better off. Land prices are really high, lots of people want to move there.''
 Edward L. Glaeser, a Harvard economist who studied 300 large cities with a range of levels of income inequality in the 1960's and 1970's, says he found little evidence that those levels later affected the growth of housing prices, income or population there.
 Of course, cities need police officers, firefighters, teachers. But as long as they can get the labor they need from somewhere nearby, some economists say, middle-class shrinkage may not hurt. In Southern California, developers import construction workers from Las Vegas and put them up in hotels; costs go up but rich clients can pay. Firefighters who want to live in high-priced cities can work two jobs, said W. Michael Cox, chief economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. ''I think it's great,'' he said. ''It gives you portfolio diversification in your income.'' Pay for essential workers like plumbers and cabdrivers will tend to go up, he said.
 Professor Glaeser said: ''There's no obvious smoking gun saying cities will be substantially worse off. There's a whole lot of America that does a very good job of taking care of the middle class. The great sprawling edge cities of the American hinterland provide remarkably cheap housing, fast commutes, decent public services and incredibly cheap products available in big box stores. As a New Yorker, I understand the view that exile from New York is consignment to hell; but that's not accurate. The majority of middle-class people that have moved out have presumably found themselves better lives out there.''
 But sociologists and many economists believe that there can be non-economic consequences for cities that lose a lot of middle-income residents. The disappearance of middle-income neighborhoods can limit opportunities for upward mobility, the authors of the Brookings study said. It becomes harder for lower-income homeowners to move up the property ladder, buy into safer neighborhoods, send their children to better schools and even make the kinds of personal contacts that can be a route to better jobs. The Brookings study, which defined moderate-income families as those with incomes between 80 and 120 percent of the median for each area, found that the percentage of middle-income neighborhoods in the 100 largest metropolitan areas had dropped to 41 percent from 58 percent between 1970 and 2000. Only 23 percent of central city neighborhoods in 12 large metropolitan areas were middle income, down from 45 percent in 1970.
 Meanwhile, New York University researchers reported last month that the number of apartments affordable to households making 80 percent of the median household income in New York City dropped by a fifth between 2002 and 2005. Nationally, median household income ranges from just above $20,000 in Miami to around $40,000 in New York and Boston and about $60,000 in San Francisco.
 With a dwindling middle class, rich and poor become more separate. Alan Berube, an author of the Brookings study, said a two-tiered marketplace can develop: Whole Foods for the upper classes, bodegas for the lower, with no competition from stores courting the middle. ''If the two models are check cashers on the one hand and major national financial institutions on the other, who's thinking about how to hold down costs for the basic consumer?'' he asked.
 School systems may suffer, too. While some upper-middle-class families rely on the public schools, many that can afford private-school education opt out. Urban school systems tend to be dominated by middle- and lower-income families. Middle-income parents have the ability and leverage to demand improvements. Similarly, studies show that lower-income students benefit by being in economically mixed schools.
 Politics can become polarized without the moderating force of an engaged middle, sociologists and economists said. And while cities can import middle-level workers, there is a cost in productivity, family time and other intangibles. 
 ''People have a stake in the place that they're living in,'' said Chris Mayer, a professor at Columbia Business School. ''If you have a police and firefighting force saving their city as opposed to somebody else's city, it makes a difference. In the same sense, local shopkeepers just seem to be better. What happened on 9/11 was really about 'our city.' '' 
 Mr. Mayer, who recently moved with his wife and three young children to New York, said he believed that it was important for children to grow up in a place that is racially, ethnically and economically diverse. He calls those places more vibrant. In most places, the upper middle class is less diverse than the middle, he said. New York would be less attractive to him without its still-expansive and lively middle.
 ''This trend toward living and interacting with people who are like you is intensifying a lot,'' said Professor Gyourko, who lives in the affluent suburb of Swarthmore, Pa. ''I do not meet the full range of incomes and social classes within my neighborhood. Well, think about what happens if metropolitan areas like New York, San Francisco and the like turn into my suburb. You'll have even less interaction. The most interesting and potentially foreboding implication of this sorting is that it changes the way we view life.''

HEADLINE: For the U.S., a Newfangled Compass 

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH

 BODY:
OVER the past week, with rockets exploding among the cafes of Beirut and in the streets of Haifa, the world has been stunned by the rising ferocity of the war between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia. But equally surprising, to many, has been the way the conflict has illuminated the sweeping changes that are reshaping the entire Middle East.
 Behind Hezbollah's rockets lurks the specter of a newly unleashed Iran, its patron and supplier. Israel -- which hoped to reap some peace after its withdrawal from Gaza -- has been emboldened to lash out against its enemies more aggressively than it has in two decades. Iraq is in ruins, and the Arab states seem paralyzed. Everywhere, the struts that upheld the region's tenuous stability are wavering, and fierce new winds are blowing.
Whatever the outcome of the current proxy war -- fought on the soil of the suffering Lebanese -- this broader struggle for dominance will continue to play itself out. So the question arises: What is America's role in this volatile new world? Arab democracy may be a distant dream, but there is still much to be gained or lost in the region, from access to crucial oil fields, to fighting terrorism, to the security of Israel. 
 The Bush administration stuck to its playbook through Israel's initial assault, giving a tacit blessing to its airstrikes and maintaining a studied silence: We do not negotiate with bad guys like Syria and Iran. That has left it with little leverage, and virtually no one to talk to.
 Some critics of the administration emphasize the benefit of talking with Syria or Iran. Tehran in particular can inflict pain on American troops and allies in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as Israel. But it is not clear that such negotiations would succeed.
 In any event, all the countries of the Middle East, having seen the American democratic experiment in Iraq go up in flames, may now be less amenable to any of the world powers that have shaped the region for so long. 
 ''My sense is that we are seeing the Middle East entering a new era, one in which external powers count for less, and local actors -- be they states or militias or individuals -- count for more,'' said Richard N. Haass, who headed the State Department's policy planning operation during President Bush's first term and is now president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
 That shift is an important one, Mr. Haass said, and could make relations in the region more complex and unstable for a long time.
 For most of the past century, outsiders shaped the politics of the region. Britain and France literally redrew the Middle East borders after World War I. After the United States followed Britain as the reigning Western power, policies were guided by cold war concerns, with American clients warding off Communist influence and maintaining access to oil supplies. Starting in 1967, the United States also became the chief guarantor of Israel's security, and the lead player in efforts to broker a lasting peace -- a process that came close to success in 2000, but has been in ruins ever since. Over all, stability was the chief goal, and American presidents were sometimes criticized for coddling Arab autocrats.
 All that changed after Sept. 11, 2001, when the Bush administration embraced a bold new plan to transform the Middle East by promoting democracy. But by removing Saddam Hussein, who had kept neighboring Iran in check throughout his reign, the new American effort freed Iran to take on a vastly more powerful role.
 That transformation is the key to the current conflict in Lebanon. For Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Arab states, the specter of a Shiite crescent running from Iran through Iraq to the militant Shiites of Hezbollah in Lebanon is terrifying. It is not just a matter of age-old tensions between Sunni and Shiite Islam. The status, and safety, of the Sunni Arab leadership is at stake.
 ''The Saudis are truly worried about the Iranians,'' said Rachel Bronson, an expert on Middle East politics at the council. ''They think Ahmadinejad is a nut who represents a return to messianic Khomeinism. They don't know what he wants, and they're worried about the nuclear program.''
 That is why Saudi Arabia, along with Egypt and Jordan, performed a stunning turnabout last week by publicly condemning Hezbollah's attack on Israel. For the United States, this would appear to be a good thing: for once, Arab leaders were saying in public what they used to only whisper in private to their American counterparts.
 But the new Arab stance may not be worth much. For one thing, the Arab leaders are vulnerable to public sentiment on their streets, where Hezbollah's attacks on Israel are enormously popular. 
 And the willingness of pro-Western Arab autocrats to ignore or play down their peoples' fury at Israel hardly supports the broader American project of promoting democracy in the Middle East. But that project has already backfired in several places, with elections bringing anti-American zealots to power in Iraq and in the Palestinian government. The Arab leaders' rallying against Hezbollah last week may be the final nail in the coffin.
 ''I think this is a gambit on the part of those regimes to conclusively put an end to democracy promotion in the Middle East,'' said Marc Lynch, a scholar of Arab politics at Williams College. ''They are saying to the Americans: 'Look how useful we are.' ''
 Iran, meanwhile, seems to move from strength to strength. It had already won wide support across sectarian lines for its clandestine military help to Hamas, and for its quick $50 million pledge of support to the Palestinian Authority earlier this year after the United States and Europe declared a financial boycott. 
 ''The joke in Tehran is that Ahmadinejad is even more popular in Cairo than he is there,'' said Vali Nasr, an Iranian-born professor of national affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif. ''The Arab governments all know this will make them more vulnerable.''
 Iran's power is also newly apparent in Iraq, where the government is led by Shiites with close ties to Iran's religious hierarchy. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki forcefully denounced Israel's bombing campaign in Lebanon, a position deeply at odds with the Americans whose invasion allowed the Shiites to gain power. One of Iraq's most powerful leaders, the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, has gone farther, hinting that he might actively support his Shiite brethren in Hezbollah. 
 Iran's influence has economic ramifications, too. ''If Iran emerges as a more powerful state, it will make other states in the region, and external powers like Russia and China, more willing to cooperate with Iran on energy despite U.S. objections,'' said Flynt Leverett, a former director of Middle Eastern affairs at the National Security Council and a former C.I.A. analyst. 
 In light of all this, some argue that the United States has little choice but to open a dialogue. ''If you want a stable security environment in the Middle East, you need strategic understandings with Iran and Syria,'' says Mr. Leverett, who is now a senior fellow at the New America Foundation.
 In that context, Syria could be critical. Like its patron, Iran, Syria has drawn attention to its power in the region by allowing terrorists to cross its border into Iraq, and by supporting Hezbollah and Hamas. But Syria is smaller and more vulnerable, and its leader -- a member of the minority Alawite sect in a predominantly Sunni country -- is in a far more precarious position. 
 By dangling the right incentives -- the economic partnerships that Syria mightgain if it could be removed from the list of state sponsors of terror, for example -- the United States and its Arab allies might persuade Syria to end its decades of supporting terror and reconsider its close ties with Iran, Mr. Leverett said.
 Iran, too, would like to see America come calling, some analysts say. ''Part of this whole war in Lebanon is about the Iranians trying to get the U.S. to relieve the pressure on them,'' said Steven A. Cook, an expert on Arab politics at the Council on Foreign Relations. 
 It is also possible that such deals are fantasies, or just too costly. Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, for instance, is furious about the United Nations investigation into the killing of the former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri, last year.
 Investigators from the United Nations have made clear that Mr. Assad's government appears to be implicated in the killing, and he would like to see the possibility of a trial scrapped. He would also like security guarantees, as no doubt would Iran. Even all that might not be enough.
 ''They might not believe us even if we did give them security guarantees,'' said F. Gregory Gause III, director of the Middle East studies program at the University of Vermont. ''They think the Bush administration wants to overthrow them.'' 
 That may be the truth. If it turns out that Iran actually ordered Hezbollah to carry out the raid that sparked the current conflict on July 13, as opposed to merely supplying the weapons, some kind of reckoning is almost certain, Mr. Gause said. 
 With all the ill winds blowing through the Middle East -- and the limited success of American efforts there -- pulling away from the region might seem like a more appealing course. For the moment, though, that seems unlikely, and not just because of oil, or commitments to Israel. 
 ''We learned from Afghanistan that we cannot just leave a volatile territory on its own,'' Mr. Nasr said. ''There is no broader security organization like NATO for us to try to pass the buck to. So in some ways we're stuck with it.''

HEADLINE: In This Chinatown, Chinese Is Just a Start

BYLINE: By Jennifer 8. Lee. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
CHINATOWN is not the biggest Chinatown in New York City.
 That distinction belongs to the one in Flushing, Queens, which surpassed the Chinatown in Manhattan as home to the nation's largest Chinese population east of the Rocky Mountains a few years back.
Of course, it is not just the Chinese who have revitalized the once-faded commercial center. Koreans, Indians, Pakistanis, Salvadorans and Greeks -- all of whom have arrived in large numbers over the last 15 years -- have made Flushing one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in the most ethnically diverse borough in New York. More than 150 languages are spoken there. 
 Flushing is where women in saris shop for seafood in Chinese supermarkets as their children ogle live frogs destined for cooking pots. Where the library branch has collections in Russian as well as in Punjabi and Gujarati, two languages of India. Where a Mexican grocery worker cries ''Yikuaiqian! Yikuaiqian!'' (One dollar! One dollar!) -- in perfectly accented Mandarin Chinese -- to lure passers-by. Where the Sheraton offers event catering in Indian, Spanish, Korean and Chinese menus. Where the newspaper stand still carries Irish and Jewish newspapers, an echo of past immigrant populations.
 The immigrant presence has fueled an entrepreneur-driven boom that has been an engine for economic growth for Queens, according to a report issued last month by the state comptroller's office. Employment in Flushing grew by 4.4 percent in 2004, the most recent year for which data is available, compared with 0.5 percent citywide. 
 Flushing has one of the highest demands for residential and commercial real estate in the borough, and residential rents, with a median of $1,000 per month, are the highest in Queens. Commercial developers do not even need to advertise to get calls from doctors, accountants and travel agents looking to open or expand offices in Flushing. 
 ''There is a nucleus and we happen to be at the center of it,'' said Eugene Morimoto Tsai, 29, president of the Asia Plaza Corporation, a real estate and construction company. Mr. Tsai, who commutes from Murray Hill in Manhattan, grew up in Flushing and worked at Goldman Sachs and a private equity group before turning his attention back to Queens. 
 His father, Jentai Tsai, started Asia Bank, based in Flushing, in the early 1980's in part to help immigrant entrepreneurs who lacked the financial histories that would pass muster with mainstream banks. Today, Flushing has 30 to 40 banks within a half-mile stretch and serves as a regional financial center. There is an extraordinarily high demand for safe deposit boxes.
 That the northwest corner of Queens, which started as a settlement named for a Dutch town, Vlissingen, would become the economic anchor for a borough is somewhat curious given that much of the city's economic development radiates outward from Manhattan, and that Flushing is about five miles away. 
 But Flushing's original appeal was in its role as a regional transportation hub. It is the terminus of the No. 7 subway line, a nexus for 24 bus lines, and a stop on the Long Island Rail Road. It is also easily accessible by highway, which appeals to Chinese-Americans who live on Long Island and in Westchester County and New Jersey. The Bloomberg administration, taking notice of Flushing's rising economic role, has created a business improvement district and a land use plan for the area. 
 Flushing's immigrants, who now make up 60 percent of the population, have climbed an economic ladder over the last decade. Mr. Tsai likes to talk about a street vendor who sold tofu custard -- like flan only made with soy -- out of a shopping cart in front of his father's bank in the mid-1990's. He was considered a nuisance but could not be shooed away, so Jentai Tsai made a deal with him: as long as he watched for bank robbers and helped customers with shopping bags, he could stay.
 Today, that vendor has a flower store on Roosevelt Avenue, right off Main Street. He is known in the neighborhood as Soy Bean Chen, or Doufu Chen. While he makes most of his money off bamboo and orchid sales, he still gets up at 5 every morning to make tofu custard.
 ''It's what I started with,'' he said. ''Some of my customers today are ones from when I had my shopping cart.''

HEADLINE: New York's Fat Political Budget

 BODY:
It has taken a while for the financial experts to figure out exactly what happened at the end of June in Albany. The last days of any legislative session are always a blur, and deep in the mounds of freshly minted laws there are always a few surprises. 
 But this year the biggest surprise turns out not to be all those sneaky little legislative items that New York's lawmakers have managed to tuck away here and there. It is the total cost of the big final hairball of interconnected supplemental budget laws sometimes called the ''clean-up'' bills. ''Clean out'' might be a better term. 
 Comptroller Alan Hevesi reported last week in his department's preliminary analysis of this year's session that the state will spend over $114.7 billion, including federal funds, in the current fiscal year. That is an increase of $10.1 billion over last year's spending. And the increase in state funds alone is about 13 percent, a full four times the inflation rate. 
 Admittedly, times are good. And the state suddenly has -- make that had -- a $2 billion surplus. But New York's politicians spent the surplus and then some because nobody seems to have thought that this Wall Street boomlet might be temporary. Or that the price of oil might hit three digits. 
 The reason for all this largess is simple: It's an election year. And New York's Legislature and Gov. George Pataki, who is looking at the presidential primaries down the road, did not want to hit the campaign trail empty handed. So a budget was passed and signed that had so many goodies in it that even the people who regularly monitor Albany and are used to such shenanigans were shocked.
 Moreover, Mr. Hevesi's post-session report raises so many red flags, it looks like a Beijing ballet. Spending, up 30 percent, is growing faster than revenues, which are up 15 percent. This is never a good way to plan for the future because it means more borrowing: the state's debt is up by $16.5 billion this year.
 Some debt is good -- a big chunk of this new borrowing is for necessary projects like New York City schools. But at this rate the state's debt could increase to nearly $65 billion, or more than a third of the projected state budget, in five years. This should sound the alarm, but so far it appears that somebody in Albany left it on mute.
 The state also used part of its surplus for operating expenses. That is like using a one-time bonus to cover the first few payments for a flashy new car. The question is always how you pay once the windfall disappears. 
 At some point, New York's voters will have to take a hard look at the state's spendthrift ways -- item by painful item. For example, legislators and Mr. Pataki made a big splash last month when they announced that a computer chip factory would be built in Saratoga County. The project will cost the state between $1.2 billion to over $3 billion in various tax breaks, loan guarantees and other subsidies. 
 According to one estimate, each new job will cost a whopping $1 million. But here's the clincher: The chip fab, as the factory is called, will be located in the district of the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, one of the three most powerful men in New York State government.
 Governor Pataki, a self-described fiscal conservative who has signed on to this supplemental legislation, is nibbling away at the bottom line with a few vetoes here and there. But nothing he does can disguise the elemental truth that what Albany has given us is another irresponsible election-year budget that throws out as many goodies as a Mardi Gras float.

HEADLINE: Bad Example? Anti-Family? New-Wave D.A. Calls It Business 

BYLINE: By Robin Finn. 
E-mail: theisland@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Mineola, N.Y. 

 BODY:
DECISIONS, decisions. A recent one made by Kathleen Rice, the new-wave Nassau County district attorney (she's young, she's a techie, and she's the first woman to be elected district attorney on Long Island), to ban part-time prosecutors from her domain has cast her as a skirt-wearing Simon Legree. Even her sister lawyers at the serious-minded New York Women's Bar Association, to which she belongs, are furious with her.
 Ms. Rice's contends that she is simply trying to deliver 24/7 law enforcement to the citizenry that elected her to this $150,000-a-year post, and that part-timers do not belong in litigation, appeals and investigative positions on her 170-member staff. That doesn't fly with the bar association. It's commendable that she raised the number of women in senior positions to seven from two; nice that she has put in place the strictest D.W.I. policies in the state, established special victims' and economic crimes bureaus, and revamped the rackets bureau; but not nice that she marginalized a chunk of her staff en route. 
It's a bad example, says the bar association, to inform the 12 part-timers on her staff, all of whom happened to be female, most juggling careers and parenthood, that their services would no longer be required unless they worked full time. How retro to issue an ultimatum. Not to mention anti-family-friendly, in a ''Devil Wears Prada'' sort of way. Ten of the 12 part-timers knuckled under and stayed. Two resigned, but did not go quietly. They brought their complaints to the bar association. Unlike Ms. Rice, who grew up in Garden City with nine siblings and honed her argumentative skills at the dinner table, they have the association's backing.
 The association's president, Elaine N. Avery, says that it is totally unconscionable that the most powerful female prosecutor on Long Island has, six months into ascending to a pulpit that belonged to a man for the last three decades, issued a decree ''that sets us back 30 years'' on the issue of balancing a law career with family-friendly life choices. The association fears Ms. Rice's my-way-or-the-highway management style will deter bright young women from applying for prosecutorial slots in Nassau and elsewhere. Ditto bright young men with work-life issues. 
 ''Here is a woman who should be a role model for us, and now this decision may have a trickle-down effect,'' said Ms. Avery, who visited Ms. Rice in her cavernous office here last month to seek a policy retraction -- or at least a policy softening -- and left empty-handed. Further negotiations are pending. But Ms. Avery and her bar associates aren't the only women fuming.
 ''I shattered a glass ceiling when I was elected district attorney, I was the first D.A. in the history of this office to place women in two of the top three executive positions, I quadrupled the number of female bureau chiefs, and I'm incredibly disappointed that the association is treating me like a traitor,'' says Ms. Rice, flexing her freckled fists as she grips a cup of ice water that is not doing an especially good job of cooling her down. ''I'm a grown woman, so they can call me all the names they want to, and I'll go home and cry myself to sleep at night, but what I won't apologize for is trying to give the people of Nassau County a quality product. I wasn't elected to keep the status quo.''
 Ms. Rice is hopping mad about the way her policy, which she defends as fiscally and morally responsible, has been transformed into the wrong kind of cause celebre. She maintains that she gave her 12 part-timers 90 days to adjust to a full-time schedule. And she says she hopes to establish an Early Case Assessment Bureau by year's end that will offer part-time positions. But no one will be ''grandfathered'' into part-time slots anymore. 
 If that makes her a harridan, so be it. ''It's a polarizing issue, I understand that,'' Ms. Rice said, ''but there can only be one boss.''
 As for being family-unfriendly, Ms. Rice begs to differ. Here's her proof: One prosecutor leaves the office each Thursday at 4 p.m. during baseball season to coach Little League. But that is not, she notes, the same as leaving daily at 2 p.m., the arrangement the part-timers enjoyed in exchange for reduced salaries. 
 For the record, Ms. Rice, 41, single and childless -- ''So I'm an easy target for them'' -- would like it to be known that she does not wear Prada. Can't afford it. She sticks to sensible suits and black pumps and a diamond peace sign around her neck. But she did read the novel ''The Devil Wears Prada,'' about a tough-as-nails fashion boss, and counts the film version as the most recent movie she has seen. What a coincidence! 
 About belonging to a club like the New York Women's Bar Association, well, she's starting to feel a bit Groucho Marx-ish.
 Decisions, decisions.

HEADLINE: Variable Loans Help to Put Off Mortgage Pain

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and RON NIXON

 BODY:
It is the latest twist in the gravity-defying world of the high housing prices and exotic low-rate mortgages: As monthly payments on adjustable-rate mortgages are starting to balloon, many Americans have found a way to put off the day of reckoning.
 They are refinancing with new adjustable-rate mortgages that keep monthly payments low -- for now, that is, though their payments will likely rise even higher in the future.
''Some people would say I am a little crazy,'' acknowledged R. Lance Perry, 42, of Danville, Calif., one of the new breed of people refinancing their mortgages. But faced with a sharp increase in his monthly payments and a need to take cash out of his home, he refinanced earlier this year to keep his payments the same. 
 By the time the rate goes up, he figures, his income will have increased enough to cover the higher payments, he will have refinanced again or he will have moved. 
 Like Mr. Perry, millions of Americans have turned to adjustable-rate mortgages, or A.R.M.'s, in recent years to afford a home as prices soared. 
 Typically set at artificially low rates in the first years of the loan, these mortgages are then reset at the prevailing interest rates. For borrowers, the bet was that interest rates would remain low. 
 Now, the first big wave of the mortgage boom is cresting as more than $400 billion worth of adjustable-rate mortgages, or about 5 percent of all outstanding mortgage debt, will readjust this year for the first time, according to Loan Performance, a research firm. Next year, another $1 trillion in loans will readjust. 
 When that happens, for instance, a typical borrower with a $200,000 A.R.M. could see his monthly payments increase nearly 25 percent when the A.R.M. adjusts from 4.5 percent to 6.5 percent. In total dollars, that is an increase from $1,013 a month to $1,254.
 Yet instead of paying more now, many borrowers are refinancing into their second or third adjustable-rate mortgage, loan data indicate and industry experts confirm. 
 So far, the number of borrowers refinancing this way is relatively small -- several hundred thousand in the estimate of the credit ratings firm Fitch Ratings -- but mortgage industry officials and analysts expect the numbers will surge next year. In doing so, these borrowers are pushing out any eventual shock of higher payments by another two or three years, if not longer. 
 ''They get another two- or three-year hybrid with a low introductory rate to keep payments down,'' said Frank E. Nothaft, a vice president and chief economist at Freddie Mac, the mortgage buyer. ''They're trying to put it off forever, which is O.K. as long as interest rates are low. But when they start to spike, then it's going to be more problematic.''
 For now, this mini-refinancing boom is assuaging fears that rising interest rates and higher monthly payments would drive some borrowers into foreclosure or force them to scale back sharply on other spending. As a result, consumer spending may hold up better than some economists had thought.
 But the refinancing also represents a doubling-down on a bet that housing prices will continue to rise on the West and East Coasts and in other hot markets. If the value of the home falls closer to the amount of the loan, that could curb the ability to refinance, and may prompt the homeowner to either invest more in the home or to sell it. 
 Still, borrowers like Mr. Perry say the loans make sense because in a few years they plan to move to another home, earn more or refinance again, often using the same assumptions they made when they took out their earlier loans.
 With his new loan, his third adjustable-rate mortgage, Mr. Perry, a former technology project manager, cashed about $200,000 out of his home's equity and is investing it into his four-year-old financial planning business. ''I could have sold my house and made my family move,'' said Mr. Perry, 42, who lives with his wife and a 3-year-old son in Danville, about 20 miles east of Oakland. ''But I didn't do that. I said, 'Look, I want to start a new business,' and this product allowed me to do that.''
 He said he was taking on more risk than many of his clients would be willing to because he believes his business will continue to grow. After spending 15 years in the technology industry, which put him on the road constantly, Mr. Perry said that being self-employed allowed him to spend more time with his family, which he also expects to grow. As far as the house, he said: ''I am not going to be here for 30 years. Why is it important to have a fixed mortgage?''
 That sentiment resonates nationally, and especially in California.
 Even as mortgage applications over all are falling because of slowing home sales and rising rates, adjustable-rate mortgages made up about 30 percent of all loans in May, down only slightly from 34.2 percent in May 2005, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. In the San Francisco Bay area, adjustable mortgages of the kind Mr. Perry borrowed make up 49 percent of all refinance loans so far this year, according to Loan Performance.
 Though they have been around for decades, the use of adjustable-rate mortgages has soared in the last several years, helping fuel the housing boom by letting people borrow more than they might have been able to. For buyers who do not intend to stay in their homes for long, they can cost a lot less than 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages.
 Adjustable loans come in many forms. Most have low and fixed teaser rates initially. Many, like interest-only or ''option'' A.R.M.'s, also let borrowers pay only the interest portion of the debt or even less than that. After the introductory period ends, lenders require bigger payments and ratchet up interest rates. And rates have been rising as the Federal Reserve continues a campaign to make credit more expensive. 
 The national average rate on a five-year adjustable-rate loan was 6.28 percent in June, up from 5.02 percent in early 2005, according to Freddie Mac. The average rate on 30-year fixed loans increased to 6.68 percent from 5.63 percent.
 For businesses involved in financing real estate, adjustable loans and the refinancing they generate assure a steady stream of transactions. The beneficiaries include mortgage brokers, appraisers, banks, mortgage companies and Wall Street, where home loans are increasingly bundled and sold as securities.
 Industry officials say that adjustable-rate mortgages cater to borrowers' changing tastes and strategies. With interest rates still near historical lows and lifestyles that are more transient, many borrowers view the standard 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage as an anachronism.
 Borrowers no longer ''ask me what is the quickest way I can pay off my mortgage,'' said Jack Williams, the president of the California Association of Mortgage Brokers and a broker in Orange County. ''I haven't heard people say that for 15 years.''
 Many home buyers, however, say they have used adjustable-rate mortgages to manage their finances in the short run with the expectation of going to a fixed-rate loan.
 Maribel Chino and her fiance, Felix Burgos, refinanced the option A.R.M. on their town house in Brooklyn four months ago with a fixed-rate mortgage with a 7 percent rate after seeing the levy on a prior adjustable loan climb past 6 percent from an initial rate of 4.25 percent.
 The $800 increase in the couple's mortgage payment, now $3,100 a month, has forced them to budget more carefully, but they believe that the $8,000 to $12,000 a year they saved in payments for the first three years they owned their home made the A.R.M. worth it.
 ''It was good to start with,'' Ms. Chino said. Mr. Burgos added: ''Now we are paying 20 to 25 percent more, but we are comfortable.''
 The ability to refinance with additional adjustable-rate mortgages diminishes when housing values fail to keep up with the rise in the household's debt. So far, use of A.R.M.'s tends to be concentrated on the East and West Coasts, where housing markets have remained relatively robust. And even as interest rates rise, consumer default and delinquency rates have remained low.
 ''Before you see a distress sign, you have to have distress,'' said Susan M. Wachter, a professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''And the distress will be higher unemployment and declining home values.''
 Stress, however, is starting to build in some regions and among certain borrowers.
 Midwestern states have seen a rise in foreclosures and defaults because of job losses in automobile and other manufacturing industries. In the South, the aftermath of last year's hurricanes is still rippling through family finances.
 Yet these regions do not have as heavy a concentration of adjustable loans as the East and West Coasts do, which suggests that an economic downturn may be far more devastating in coastal markets.
 California, which has 14 percent of the country's housing stock, leads the nation with 21 percent of homes purchased with adjustable-rate mortgages, and 44 percent of California borrowers have refinanced with option-A.R.M. loans so far this year, according to Loan Performance. Other markets where those loans are popular include Arizona, Nevada, Florida, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. 
 Another group that draws concern are borrowers with subprime credit, a group that has been a growth market for many mortgage companies.
 About 6.28 percent of all outstanding subprime, adjustable mortgages were in foreclosure or delinquent for more than three months during the first three months of this year, up from 5.23 percent in the same period a year ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
 While those numbers are still lower than they were at the start of the decade, economists say there is reason for concern. An analysis by Fannie Mae, the mortgage buyer, of subprime adjustable loans issued from March 2003 to March 2004 that have adjusted showed that 16 percent of subprime borrowers have defaulted or are late in making monthly payments; another 14 percent have not yet refinanced. About 70 percent have refinanced.
 The fate of subprime borrowers, industry experts and economists say, will be closely tied to home values and the job market. If they make more money and the value of their homes continues to appreciate, they will be able to refinance and make higher monthly payments.
 If home prices fall or stagnate, homeowners will have less collateral against which they can borrow, said Grant Bailey, a director in Fitch Ratings' residential mortgage-backed securities group. 
 ''They kick the can out two years,'' he said, ''and everything works fine as long as there is pretty decent home price appreciation.''


GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: ''Betting Everything on the House''A growing number of homeowners -- particularly on the West Coast and in Florida -- are refinancing with exotic adjustable-rate mortgages that may keep their monthly payments low, but cause their loan balance to grow (known as negative amortization). The loans may make sense as long as home values keep rising.

HEADLINE: U.S. Cuts in Africa Aid Hurt War on Terror and Increase China's Influence, Officials Say 

BYLINE: By MARK MAZZETTI

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22 

 BODY:
The Bush administration and Congress have slashed millions of dollars of military aid to African nations in recent years, moves that Pentagon officials and senior military commanders say have undermined American efforts to combat terrorist threats in Africa and to counter expanding Chinese influence there.
 Since 2003, Washington has shut down Pentagon programs to train and equip militaries in a handful of African nations because they have declined to sign agreements exempting American troops from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
But the policy, which was designed to protect American troops, has instead angered senior military officials, who say the cuts in military aid are shortsighted and have weakened counterterrorism efforts in places where the threat of international terrorism is said to be most acute. 
 Some cite this as a case where the unintended consequences of the go-it-alone approach to foreign policy that Washington took after the Sept. 11 attacks affected the larger American efforts to combat terrorism. 
 The cuts have also prompted outrage in Latin America, where several nations that have refused to sign the agreements have been cut off from certain military aid programs. 
 Last year, the United States cut off $13 million for training and equipping troops in Kenya, where operatives of Al Qaeda killed 224 people when they bombed the American Embassy compound in Nairobi in 1998. 
 In 2003, the flow of $309,000 annually was suspended to Mali, where Pentagon officials contend an Algerian separatist group with ties to Al Qaeda -- known as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, or G.S.P.C. -- has established a base. Money has also been cut for Tanzania, Niger and several other African nations. 
 Citing Kenya as an example, Pentagon officials say it makes little sense to ask for Kenya's support in fighting terrorism while denying it the money it needs for training and equipping troops. 
 ''Kenya is a key partner in our counterterrorism strategy and our goals in Africa,'' a Pentagon official who works on Africa strategy said. ''This hurts us, there's no question about it.'' 
 Several officials interviewed for this article were given anonymity because they were discussing a continuing debate in the government and because some were discussing intelligence matters. 
 Some military officials also argue that the aid cuts have given China an upper hand in what they describe as a modern Great Game -- a battle for influence in Africa between the powers, similar to the 19th-century rivalry in Central Asia between the British and the Russians. 
 Specifically, the officials cite the millions of dollars the Chinese government has spent on infrastructure projects and military training in Africa to help lock up government contracts for natural resources like oil, timber and metals. 
 ''It's hard to compete with China because of the agility they have in obtaining contracts and then starting projects very quickly without worrying too much about human rights,'' Gen. James Jones of the American European Command, which has military responsibility for most of Africa, recently told a Senate panel. ''So we have our work cut out for us.'' 
 China has substantially expanded its presence in Africa in recent years. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, China's trade with Africa doubled to $18.5 billion between 2002 and 2003, and the figure exceeded $32 billion in November of 2005. China has overtaken Britain to become the continent's third most important trading partner. But it is the impact on counterterrorism efforts in Africa that most alarms military officials. 
 The situation in Mali is of great concern because the Salafist group is believed to have established a foothold in that desolate country's northern region. A recent State Department report said Mali's northern territories had turned into a ''safe haven'' for the group's fighters. 
 The Salafist group's ability to attack the Algerian government is believed to have diminished in recent years, but intelligence officials are now concerned that the group is expanding its ties to Al Qaeda and other groups, and has used networks in the Middle East to send fighters into Iraq. 
 In recent years, the Pentagon has sent Special Forces trainers into Mali as part of a broader counterterrorism initiative to strengthen the abilities of Mali's army to deal with organizations like the Salafist group.
 But counterterrorism experts see such operations as short-term solutions. They argue that without a serious investment in Mali's army, the ramshackle military has little hope of rooting out terrorists. 
 ''Mali doesn't have any power production capabilities, and its military can't extend any power up into the north,'' said an American official, who recently made a fact-finding trip to the Sahara. ''The terrorist organizations can run around up there because the army can't get to them.'' 
 Passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush in August 2002, the American Servicemembers' Protection Act prohibits certain types of military aid to countries that have signed on to the International Criminal Court but have not signed a separate accord with the United States, called an Article 98 agreement. 
 Specifically, the law cuts off funds that provide training to military officers of friendly nations, known as IMET funds, and funds for foreign militaries to buy new weapons and equipment. 
 Under the terms of Article 98 agreements, which the Bush administration has pressed more than 100 nations to sign, nations pledge not to surrender American citizens to the international court without the consent of officials in Washington. 
 The Bush administration has refused to endorse the court, contending that overzealous prosecutors could charge American soldiers or civilian officials with war crimes for their roles in carrying out American policies abroad. 
 White House opposition to the court led Congress to severely restrict military and economic aid to countries that have not signed Article 98 agreements. 
 In March, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said blocking military assistance to nations seeking to combat terrorism was ''sort of the same as shooting ourselves in the foot,'' and the Pentagon's recent Quadrennial Defense Review calls for the government to consider separating military funding from the 2002 law. 
 Congress is also considering a bill to repeal some of these measures. But the policy still has advocates in Washington, especially in the White House. 
 In Latin America, some of the countries that have lost funding have been major Pentagon partners in the effort to eradicate cocaine production. Ecuador, for instance, has been a staging ground for American surveillance planes on counternarcotics missions and has lost millions of dollars in military aid for refusing to sign an Article 98 agreement. 
 The cuts have drawn the ire of American military officials with responsibility for Latin America. 
 ''Now when I go through the region, the fact is that the foreign military financing is gone,'' Gen. Bantz J. Craddock of the United States Southern Command told the Senate this year. ''IMET is gone.'' 
 ''Other nations are moving in,'' he said. ''The People's Republic of China has made many offers.''

HEADLINE: Cashing In on Home Equity

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
NEAR-RECORD numbers of owners are still cashing in on the increased value of their homes, and they continue to use that cash for purposes that raise eyebrows among financial advisers. Yet, because the housing market has been so strong in recent years, it is unlikely that the free spending will undermine most borrowers' long-term financial health.
 According to Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the government-sponsored company known as Freddie Mac, which helps finance a large percentage of the mortgages in the United States each year, homeowners are on pace this year to take $170 billion in cash out of their home equity as they refinance their mortgages. 
 That figure is down from last year's record, $244 billion, but it is still far higher than in other recent years -- in fact, about 10 times higher than it was in 1996.
 ''Families still have a whole lot more home-equity wealth than they previously had,'' said Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac's chief economist, ''and they're tapping into it.''
 Cash-out refinancing has become so popular because house valuations have jumped 57 percent, on average, in the last four years, in many cases giving homeowners hundreds of thousands of dollars more in equity than they had when they bought.
 Say, for example, that a couple's house has a $400,000 mortgage and has grown in value to $600,000. They can now refinance the mortgage, taking out much or all of the increased equity in the process.
 If they take out $100,000, the new loan is for $500,000, minus whatever principal they had paid down on the original mortgage.
 Homeowners have not only completed more of these transactions in recent years than ever, but they have also grown more aggressive in how much cash they are taking out. According to Freddie Mac, more than 20 percent of each refinanced loan will be taken as cash this year, virtually the same as last year. That is more than double the average of the previous five years.
 Instead of saving or investing, some of these borrowers will spend $6 of every $10 they take out in home equity, said Raphael Bostic, a professor of economics at the University of Southern California. More important, he added, consumers often spend much of the money on things like cars, furniture, vacations and home-entertainment systems. 
 ''Households have really been leaning on their home equity in an important way,'' Mr. Bostic said. ''It's one of the reasons you've seen the general economy continue to perform, which is good in that it's another way for households to smooth consumption.''
 But the difficult thing, Mr. Bostic added, ''is when you're consuming things where you're repaying for a lot longer than you're getting the service.''
 As an example, he cited cars, which typically carry five-year loans. 
 ''If you pay for that car through a house refinance,'' he said, ''you're paying for that car for 30 years -- long after you've stopped getting value from it. Talk to financial folks, and they'll say you shouldn't buy short-term pleasures with long-term money.''
 Barring a crash in housing prices, though, such behavior should not be catastrophic for consumers.
 ''Even with the record volume of home-equity extraction with refinances last year, the total amount of home equity wealth in the country actually increased,'' said Mr. Nothaft of Freddie Mac.
 ''I'm sure if you look hard enough you'll find someone who's sucking all of the equity out of their house, but that's not typically what people are doing.''

HEADLINE: Grading Public and Private Schools 

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Spinning a Bad Report Card,'' by John Tierney (column, July 18):
Our public schools directly serve the founding credo of our nation, that all citizens are equal, and entitled to the same fundamental opportunities. They provide access and opportunity to all Americans, not merely those with the financial means or the winners of a random lottery.
 Any voucher program, successful or not, is a stopgap political solution that will never match the greater service of our public system. 
 There is no arguing against the value of a quality education in the advancement of individuals and communities. The question we face is which individuals and which communities will benefit from that value. Our schools should be a public good, not a private purchase.

To the Editor:
 John Tierney's automotive analogy -- that General Motors would not celebrate the news that its $40,000 Cadillac performed almost as well as a $20,000 Honda, while public schools celebrate test results comparable to private schools spending half as much per student -- may be better than he realizes.
 General Motors and the public schools unwillingly bear the costs of social mandates -- respectively, pension and health care costs for workers, and difficult student populations. Honda and the private schools can shift those costs to government or directly to the competition.

Albert Tucher
Westfield, N.J., July 18, 2006

To the Editor:
 John Tierney's column is excellent. 
 The scientific evidence based on randomized experiments indicates that some voucher students performed better than students who stayed in public schools, and that African-American students benefited more than white students.
 Voucher programs are popular among African-Americans in cities like Milwaukee, where vouchers are available on a limited basis. Why are there nevertheless so few voucher plans operating in the United States?
 It is not only because public school teachers are masters of spin, as is well demonstrated by Mr. Tierney. In California, whites living in communities with privileged public schools typically vote against voucher systems. Could it be that even though they also tend to vote Republican, they are more interested in maintaining their children's comparative schooling advantages than in promoting equality of opportunity?

To the Editor:
 I am an alumna of a Bronx private school who just finished a year teaching English at a large Bronx public school. The school at which I taught was dank and crowded, but students absorbed knowledge and passed their Regents anyway. As the report John Tierney discusses demonstrates, students can surmount obstacles to learn -- and intelligence is universally distributed.
 But test scores go only so far. A child attending a school like my alma mater, in a clean building with attention from her teachers, probably feels good about education. A child who walks through mice-infested halls to fight with 30 classmates for her teachers' time probably doesn't. Who is more likely to give up?
 Teachers in the maligned unions know that public schools bleed wasted potential. Public schools need more money, not less.

Sarah Seltzer
New York, July 18, 2006

To the Editor:
 John Tierney tries to play down the significance of the Education Department's study comparing the performance of public and private school students by noting that public schools spend more to educate their students.
 But the vast majority of families don't look at overall per-pupil expenditures when deciding whether to send their children to public or private school. Instead, they weigh the cost of tuition against the quality of education they believe their children will receive in private school.
 The Education Department study demonstrates that in many cases they are not receiving additional value for their tuition dollars. So contrary to what Mr. Tierney would have us believe, the study is good news for public education.

To the Editor:
 John Tierney concludes that private schools are better than public schools because parents of poor, urban students who received private school vouchers through lotteries were happier than their counterparts whose children lost the voucher lotteries and remained in public schools. (He also notes test-score improvements among the African-American winners.) 
 Actually, such a comparison tells us nothing about the relative merits of private and public education, but does suggest that high-poverty schools tend to be less appealing than those where the poor are largely kept out. If the lottery winners had attended the public school of their choice, I suspect that the parents would likewise have been happier.

Michael Dowd
Brooklyn, July 19, 2006

To the Editor:
 Re ''Public vs. Private Schools'' (editorial, July 19): 
 You write, ''American schoolchildren are performing at mediocre levels in reading, math and science -- wherever they attend school.'' This is not surprising.
 As evidenced by the publication of ''A Nation at Risk'' in 1983 and passage of the No Child Left Behind law in 2001, we have been in a neoconservative era of education that stresses cramming facts into kids' heads, sees learning as skills and drills, and tests children mercilessly.
 The problem is that this is simply not the way children actually learn. 
 Both public and private schools will improve when children's learning looks something like learning does in the real world. Having students do more superficial learning driven by test preparation can never yield results.

HEADLINE: Anger Management at American Air

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY

DATELINE: Fort Worth, Tex. 

 BODY:
A GRAND experiment is playing out behind the scenes at American Airlines. Just listen.
 Top executives complain openly that they are underpaid. Mechanics swear up a storm at their bosses as they explain the proper way to operate maintenance plants. Gate agents freely tell pilots to consider working longer hours so their company can become solidly profitable. Pilots refuse to discuss working more because they are angry about management's $100 million bonus program.
Chaos? Actually -- at a company throwing off its famously buttoned-downed culture and endeavoring to replace management-by-edict with freewheeling collaboration -- these are the early, uncertain sounds of survival and possible renewal.
 ''If we go down the tubes, we all go down together,'' said Anne Helton, a gate agent in Nashville who is weary of brinkmanship between pilots and management, two groups that make a lot more money than gate agents do. ''I'm sorry they're not feeling the love,'' she said of the pilots. ''You've got to suck it up. We all go home dead tired at the end of the day.'' 
 For his part, Gerard J. Arpey, American's 47-year-old chief executive, has traded away the bankruptcy card used by most of his competitors -- which gave them shelter to prune debt while also tossing out labor contracts and pensions -- for the hope of trying to motivate workers. ''Our fundamental objective is to make organized labor and our front-line employees our business partners,'' he said, asserting that the world's largest airline cannot become more efficient without such collaboration. ''If they don't want to do it, it ain't going to happen. It doesn't matter how brilliant you are.''
 ''Call me old-fashioned,'' he added. ''But I think companies ought to pay people back. And I think companies ought to make good on commitments to employees and communities.''
 American is the only old-line domestic airline that has never filed for bankruptcy protection, and Mr. Arpey intends to keep it that way by fostering open dialogue, teamwork and a relentless focus on efficiency. Three years into his experiment, he can claim one huge and as yet uncompleted success: an agreement with mechanics to operate maintenance plants more effectively that could save American more than $1 billion a year by 2008. 
 He won that victory, however, only because union workers sensed that their jobs could be largely outsourced, as they were at other airlines. Other workers at American, particularly pilots and flight attendants, have tried to collaborate with management to become more competitive -- but then walked away from the process in January after American disclosed management's bonus program.
 Mr. Arpey now needs pilots, flight attendants, and everyone else back at the same table. He wants management and labor to stop fighting each other, a decades-old pattern at the company that has sapped productivity and forced it to shrink in recent years. Mr. Arpey has voluntarily forfeited his own raises and bonuses recently -- an unusual gesture in an era when excessive executive compensation has drawn heightened scrutiny. He also plans to make good on $11 billion of pension obligations and offer a little more job security to a work force of 86,500 that remains shellshocked after losing more than 20,000 colleagues to layoffs and attrition since 2001.
 Some of American's numbers are promising. Its parent company, the AMR Corporation, reported a $291 million second-quarter profit last week, and analysts expect the company to eke out a profit for the year. It has about $5 billion in cash on hand and by many measures is operating far more efficiently that it did in 2003 when, on the brink of bankruptcy, it handed the chief-executive reins to Mr. Arpey. But like any executive taking a sizable gamble, Mr. Arpey is toeing a delicate line.
 The airline industry as a whole has lost more than $40 billion since 2000 and is contending with rising fuel prices and intense competition. American itself lost $861 million last year, is saddled with $20 billion in debt and has a pension plan that is underfunded by about $3.2 billion. Without the wage cuts that other airlines are extracting through the bankruptcy process, American could hit the next economic downturn in a vulnerable state. If that happens, Mr. Arpey stands to catch the blame, regardless of his enthusiasm for corporate warmth and collaboration. 
 ''It's a risk,'' said Robert Hughes, president of Overland Resource Group, a consulting firm hired to help American and its unions work together. ''If it doesn't go well, he's put himself out there.''
 There is plenty of room for American to loosen its corporate screws. Flight attendants often need a doctor's note to take a day off. But with the airline covering most medical costs, whom does that policy hurt the most? The company so strictly defines which flight attendants can handle certain flights that it finds itself needlessly shorthanded at times. At its maintenance bases, managers once turned a deaf ear to mechanics, a group that includes many compulsive and adept problem solvers.
 In short, American has been a command-and-control organization in danger of suffocating itself. Mr. Arpey intends to change all of that.
 An airline executive's son, Mr. Arpey seems an unlikely candidate for such an abrupt corporate overhaul. He spent most of his career in finance, away from flesh-and-blood workers who fly planes and load bags. Rail thin with a wide smile, his demeanor seems positively Sunday-school-teacher-like when compared with his better-known mentor, Robert L. Crandall, who ran American like a drill sergeant until the late 1990's.
 BUT for the task at hand -- persuading distrustful employees that management is sincere in seeking collaboration and is not just trying to smooth-talk its way to more labor concessions -- Mr. Arpey may be the better man. ''Gerard has a nice way about him,'' said Edward A. Brennan, the retired Sears chairman and a longtime AMR board member, noting that it was Mr. Arpey who convinced dubious board members that collaboration was a wise strategy. Mr. Arpey's personal distaste for bankruptcy also helped to strengthen the board's resolve about avoiding Chapter 11. 
 Even with willing workers, however, few companies ever truly master continuous improvement -- the task of making and sustaining incremental productivity gains that, compounded over time, propel an operation past competitors. Dell once did it with computers, as did Wells Fargo in banking. And -- this comparison stings at American's headquarters -- Southwest Airlines has done it. 
 Mr. Arpey will not easily move American into such a rarefied club. American's managers and workers, in seeking to improve, mostly compare themselves with other airlines. Southwest aside, that is hardly stiff competition. The recent management bonuses, in fact, were made fatter because American's surging stock price looked even better when compared with a group that included Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines, both now in bankruptcy, their shares all but worthless.
 Also working against Mr. Arpey is a fading sense of urgency. Since 2001, domestic airlines trimmed fleets while the economy grew. That resulted in fuller planes and higher fares. Even with oil above $70 a barrel, much of the airline industry may report an annual profit for 2006. American's labor costs were relatively low after unions made $1.62 billion in annual concessions in 2003 to stave off bankruptcy. But United Airlines, Northwest and Delta, running through bankruptcy, have since pushed their costs lower.
 The big draw of collaboration is the opportunity it provides to tap into workers' knowledge so the enterprise as a whole can find and exploit unseen efficiencies. At American, that means more than simple wage and cost cuts. It means changing how the entire company functions. One of the most telling examples is American's giant maintenance base in Tulsa, Okla.
 The base employs about 7,000 workers and two years ago seemed a candidate to have most of those jobs outsourced. Every five years, Tulsa overhauls American's MD-80's, the workhorses of the company's fleet, for about $1 million a plane. If outsourced, the cost would be about $500,000. Cutting costs at the base seemed unlikely, Mr. Arpey said, because ''it was a very hostile work environment, labor and management virtually at war on a day-to-day basis.''
 Mechanics, represented by the Transport Workers Union, literally sat, often playing cards or reading the newspaper, for more hours than they worked on MD-80's, a joint analysis by the company and the union showed. Fearful of giving more work to an unproductive crew, American had outsourced many small tasks at top dollar. Realizing all the jobs were at risk, the union and management set aside hostilities and brainstormed at an offsite retreat. Since then, they operate in two-man teams with one manager and one union representative, led by Carmine J. Romano, an American vice president in charge of the base, and Dennis Burchette, the Tulsa union chief.
 Overhauling each MD-80 now costs about $750,000 in Tulsa, and that figure is still declining, American says. Now, 400 workers do what 700 once handled. Rather than laying off the surplus workers, American is bringing in maintenance work from other airlines to keep them employed. 
 ''I built this model,'' Mr. Romano said of the old approach in Tulsa. ''It's not working. I confessed.''
 Mr. Burchette has his own confessions. ''It's not all fun,'' he said. ''I've walked out of meetings. He's walked out of meetings.'' 
 After one argument, Mr. Burchette said, he and Mr. Romano were headed to the same flight but drove separately to the airport. Cooling down as they passed through security, Mr. Burchette turned to Mr. Romano and said, ''Sorry, dude.''
 ''Now, we kind of feel bad'' after a blowup, Mr. Romano said.
 Cooperation has allowed the plant to overcome deep dysfunction. A fuel-efficient tail cone American had been buying for $240,000 each from a manufacturer is now fabricated on site for $39,000. Broken pumps on airplane toilets are fixed for $50 instead of replaced for $3,000. And a waste hauler now pays $330,000 a year for the plant's scrap metal, up from a giveaway price of $7,000 before.
 Beyond maintenance, American is a service operation where labor is, in many instances, a fixed component: two pilots and three or more flight attendants per plane, a set baggage crew for each airport gate. There is no opportunity to radically reconfigure work, so in many cases people either have to work longer hours or for less money if American wants to be more efficient.
 American pilots fly an average of 608 hours a year, or about 51 hours a month, largely because of work rules in the pilots contract. That means American has to employ roughly five pilots for every four working at Continental Airlines, where pilots fly 754 hours a year, or about 63 a month.
 In December, Ralph J. Hunter, president of the Allied Pilots Association, and other union officials and consultants visited nine cities to present American's pilots with the findings of a union-management group survey that had looked into productivity. The pilots, who had given up $660 million a year in the 2003 concessions, were suspicious. By pushing them to consider being more productive, Mr. Hunter said, ''I went out on a limb.''
 American flight attendants make about $7 an hour more than those at United, a difference that amounts to an extra $100 million a year in costs. Just before managers and union officials were about to brief flight attendants on that and other data in January, American disclosed to employees that several top executives were getting bonuses of more than $1 million (Mr. Arpey had taken himself out of the program.) American was still losing money, but the program, covering nearly 1,000 managers, took into account American's buoyant stock price.
 Union leaders felt betrayed. ''Cancel it. Cancel it now,'' Mr. Hunter said he advised Mr. Arpey. ''I told Gerard, these may well be the most expensive bonuses you've ever paid out.''
 The episode was a near-repeat of a 2003 dust-up. Then, Mr. Arpey's predecessor, Donald J. Carty, had put in place retention bonuses for executives and also funded a pension plan for top officers in a trust to protect those pensions in the event of a bankruptcy filing. Unions, preparing to give back $1.62 billion a year to avert bankruptcy, were livid, and the issue cost Mr. Carty his job.
 Although Mr. Arpey personally retains the respect of union leaders, talks with pilots and flight attendants on significant productivity improvements have stopped. 
 EXECUTIVES were unapologetic about the bonuses, and it became clear that management and labor -- efforts at collaboration aside -- live in very separate worlds. Bob Reding, a senior vice president overseeing pilots and maintenance, collected $1.6 million under the bonus plan. He said American's brass is underpaid and the company is in danger of losing its best talent. ''I am sure we are all getting calls from headhunters,'' he said. ''Why did people get upset? It's because they don't understand management compensation. None of our investors were upset.''
 Mr. Reding is not alone. Daniel P. Garton, an executive vice president, collected about $1.9 million and said headhunters call him, too. ''And I obviously answer the phone,'' he said. ''There are days when the executive compensation issue becomes a little overwhelming. Why am I doing this?''
 So is Mr. Arpey's budding partnership with unions crumbling? ''I don't control them,'' he said. ''I'm continuing to press on many fronts.'' 
 Indeed, initiatives aimed at saving fuel, reducing costly workplace injuries and speeding the turnaround of planes between landing and takeoff are all gaining momentum. At some American locations, the number of union grievances filed against the company has declined sharply.
 But that is mostly small stuff, financially speaking, compared with pilot and flight attendant labor productivity, said Roger E. King, an analyst at CreditSights. ''Airlines are a service business,'' he said. ''At the end of the day labor has to decide how much it is willing to give up.''
 Mr. Arpey says he can be patient. ''The only schedule I have is continuous improvement,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In the Streets, Aid to Hezbollah Stirs Iranian Fear and Resentment

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: TEHRAN, July 22 

 BODY:
There is a huge amount of anger here about what is happening in Lebanon, but it is not all the result of Israeli bombs, missiles and artillery.
 ''Of course I am angry,'' said Hamid Akbari, 30, a deliveryman. ''All our income is going to Palestine and Hezbollah.''
 For decades, Iran has been Hezbollah's prime patron, helping create it as a Shiite Muslim militia and then nurture it with money, expertise and weapons. But now that Hezbollah is in the midst of full-blown fighting with Israel, Iranian officials have been adamant in insisting that they had nothing to do with the events that set off the crisis. 
 Part of the reason may be fear, or concern, that the United States and Europe would punish Iran, if it were proved otherwise. But Iranian officials may have a wary eye on their public. In interviews in central Tehran Saturday, person after person said the same thing: Iran should worry about Iran's problems and not be dragged down by others' battles. 
 ''We Iranians have a saying,'' said Ali Reza Moradi, 35, a portrait artist who works in a small booth downtown. ''We should save our own house first and then save the mosque. A lot of people think this way. The government should help its people first, and then help the people in Lebanon.''
 With the ouster of the Sunni-led government in Iraq, and the routing of the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran has seen its regional influence grow stronger. As the Sunni Arab capitals of Cairo, Amman, Jordan, and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, witnessed their own political influence in the region waning, Iran tried to fill the gap. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has become extremely popular among many Arabs for his strong anti-Western and anti-Israeli language. And Iran's role as patron of Hezbollah and Hamas has given it unrivaled influence over two radical groups that have set the regional agenda, more so than governments.
 But the picture in Iran itself is a bit more nuanced. Although Iran sits atop one of the largest known oil reserves, it cannot refine enough gasoline to meet its own needs -- and so prices are rising. Mr. Ahmadinejad may have been elected on a populist economic message, but on the streets people report more pain, more unemployment and higher prices. 
 Hamidreza Jalaipour, a sociologist and former government official, said that on this point Iranians might agree but that they were also fickle.
 ''Iranians are very sensitive and want our money to stay in the country and be spent for Iranians to solve their problems,'' Mr. Jalaipour said. ''But, you cannot rely on what they say because their opinion changes quickly, and if the war continues, they might say something else.''
 Nevertheless, the Hezbollah crisis occurred at a time of already heightened anxiety. Many Iranians were already nervous about the potential for sanctions as a result of their government's nuclear program. Iranians have rallied behind the line strongly promoted by their government, that nuclear power is their inalienable right. And while they may have been willing to tolerate further public isolation over something they see as their right, there is far less unity about standing up for Lebanon, many people said Saturday. Despite the country's authoritarian leadership, Iranians are often outspoken about their political beliefs, and many were willing to be quoted by name.
 ''Let them fight with each other until they get tired,'' said Reza Muhammadi, 33, who runs a small grocery in the center of town. ''Arab countries are not supporting Hezbollah, but my country is? They are giving my share to the Arabs.''
 Mr. Muhammad said he worked six days a week from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. to feed his family. So, he said, he had no tolerance for his government's financial commitments abroad. ''One percent of our budget has been approved by my Parliament to give to Palestine,'' he said. ''Why should I not get angry about this?''
 In a recent edition of the daily newspaper Aftab-e Yazd, one reader wrote in saying: ''Radio and television broadcast so many programs about Arab countries that I sometimes wonder if it is the Iranian TV or an Arab TV. Such vast and big propaganda has caused a kind of indifference and even negative sense toward Arab nations.''
 Of course, such sentiments are not universal. There are people like Zahra Etefaghian, 51, who runs a small coffee shop near the art museum, who said: ''We should really support them, and we should bear the consequences. At emergency times like this, we have to help Muslim people.''
 But talk of direct Iranian actions in Lebanon is being officially discouraged -- and denied. On Tuesday, a group calling itself the Headquarters for the Glory of Martyrs of the International Movement announced that it had an army of 55,000 would-be suicide bombers among its members and had already dispatched 27 to fight with Hezbollah in Lebanon. 
 A few days later Muhammad Hejazi, commander of the vigilante force known as the Basiji, said that reports about would-be suicide bombers going to Lebanon ''have nothing to do with official organizations in the country.''
 Everybody here, it seems, is going to great lengths to insist that Iran had no role in setting off this crisis, saying that Hezbollah was too far away, and too independent, to be controlled from Tehran. 
 ''The Hezbollah forces have done a great job and have resisted well,'' said Ali Akbar Hasehmi Rafsanjani, the former president and chairman of the Expediency Council, in recent public remarks. But, he added, ''it is misleading to say that Iran and Syria are carrying this out.''
 Even a figure like Ali Akbar Mohtashamipour, who had been one of the founders of Hezbollah in Lebanon, commented cautiously about Iran's role in the current conflict. ''Iran cannot play an instrumental role because of the long distance,'' he told the daily Etemad Melli recently. ''Besides, Arab countries consider the issue of Palestine and Lebanon as an Arab issue,'' he added, suggesting that Iran, as a non-Arab nation, should keep its distance.
 Whether or not Iran played a role in actually inciting the crisis seemed irrelevant to people interviewed Saturday. 
 Ali Muhammadi runs a small DVD shop, a closet-size booth where he sells pirated DVD's for about $1 each. ''I don't think it's an important issue for us,'' he said of the conflict in Lebanon. ''I think the government should take care of its people first.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Propose Moving Up Nevada in Presidential Caucuses

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22 

 BODY:
The Democratic Party moved toward the most significant changes in its presidential nomination process in 30 years on Saturday, a rewriting of its election-year calendar for 2008.
 The party's Rules and Bylaws Committee, in a decision that is likely to alter fundamentally the way the party chooses its nominee, voted for early contests in two new states -- a caucus in Nevada and a primary in South Carolina. Party officials said the change was almost certain to be ratified by the Democratic National Committee next month.
The immediate effect would be to decrease the influence of Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states that have started -- and some party officials argued, unfairly dominated -- the nominating process since 1976. 
 The change was resisted by officials in New Hampshire, which would be sandwiched between a caucus on the Saturday before its famous primary and another primary on the next Tuesday. Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat, warned in a private letter to Democratic officials that the state party might defiantly try to invoke a New Hampshire state law to move the primary earlier.
 Republican Party officials said that they were watching the Democratic maneuvering closely, and that it was likely, but not certain, that Republicans would also change their calendar along these same lines.
 The change was applauded by Democrats who have long argued that the current system gave too much power to two states that were economically, geographically and ethnically not representative of the nation. In turning to Nevada and South Carolina, Democrats said they were looking to give blacks, Hispanics and union members more of a say in the selection of the nominee.
 By calling for contests in the West and the South, Democrats were looking forward to the general election of 2008, prompting candidates to raise an early flag in two regions of the country that are critical to the outcome of presidential elections, but where Democrats have been flagging. President Bush won Nevada with a 2.5 point margin over his Democratic opponent, Senator John Kerry, in 2004.
 The cost, many analysts said, could be the loss of what made New Hampshire and Iowa so distinctive: The kind of intimate, living-room, one-on-one campaigning that has characterized politics there and that has been cited by such Democrats as Bill Clinton as critical to their learning about issues and concerns of the voters.
 With four contests spread over two weeks in different parts of the country, Democrats said that kind of early, intimate campaigning could well be subsumed by campaigns of chartered aircrafts and televisions advertisements as candidates seek to campaign in all four places at once. That would give an immediate advantage to the wealthiest candidates.
 Harold Ickes, a longtime member of the committee, warned that placing four states at the start of the process could end up producing a nominee so early that most Democrats would have no say in who it is. 
 ''Are we doing something where we end up choosing a stronger candidate or a better candidate?'' Mr. Ickes said in an interview. ''I am not sure that this does that. And we are just exacerbating the front-loading of the system: we are going to end up with an eight-month general election, which is just nuts.''
 Another committee member, Donna Brazile, said that would produce better-rounded candidates who had been selected by a wider cross-section of the party.
 ''Yeah, we run the risk of starting the general election in March or April, but I don't think that's a bad idea,'' Ms. Brazile said. ''And it could lose some of the intimacy. But modern campaigns don't start in the year of the nomination. They start at least two or three years out. These guys are running now. And gals.''
 The party's chairman, Howard Dean, who had pushed for a change, issued a statement saying a new calendar would produce a candidate who reflects the ''racial, regional, and economic diversity of the Democratic Party.'' 
 That said, the one thing the Democratic Party has learned over the years is that major changes tend to have unexpected consequences. Indeed, it seems completely plausible that a little-known candidate could do again in Iowa what Jimmy Carter did in 1976 to put that state's caucuses (and Mr. Carter) on the map: Go in there and win a victory over better-financed candidates and use the burst of publicity to roll through the next three states.
 In a series of votes, the committee recommended that South Carolina be permitted to hold a primary one week after New Hampshire, defeating a bid by Alabama, among other states, for that slot.
 It also voted that Nevada hold a primary on the Saturday between the Iowa caucus, which will continue to start the selection process, and the New Hampshire primary. The other states seeking a caucus were Arizona and Colorado. The Iowa caucus would be Jan. 14 and the New Hampshire primary Jan. 22.
 The vote does not guarantee an end to fighting over an issue that has been simmering for years. New Hampshire state law requires that there be no political event within seven days of its primary; national Democratic officials argued that the prohibition did not apply to caucuses, so having the Nevada caucus on the Saturday before the New Hampshire primary was permissible.
 Under New Hampshire law, that determination is left to the secretary of state, William M. Gardner, who will schedule the state's primary in the fall of 2007. Reached at home on Saturday to see what he might do, Mr. Gardner responded, ''do not call me here,'' and hung up the telephone.
 The New Hampshire Democratic chairwoman, Kathy Sullivan, said she could not predict what Mr. Gardner might do, but said she thought the change was bad for the party and its nominating process.
 ''We are heading into a process where we are cramming a few states into a few days: You will have candidates who stumble at an early event and don't have time to recover,'' Ms. Sullivan said. ''I worry about that.''
 Iowa also has a statute requiring that its caucuses be scheduled seven days before any other event. Lt. Gov. Sally Pederson, who is also the Iowa Democratic chairwoman, said: ''This does violate Iowa law. I can't draw a conclusion about what happens next because there are a lot of unknowns here.''


CORRECTION-DATE: July 26, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday reported on efforts by the Democratic Party to revise its election-year calendar for 2008 to include an early caucus in Nevada and an early primary in South Carolina. It said that William M. Gardner, secretary of state for New Hampshire, was reached at his home on Saturday and said, ''Do not call me here,'' and hung up the telephone when the reporter tried to get comment on how these changes might affect his state's first-in-the-nation primary. 
 On Monday, Mr. Gardner called the reporter and said he had never spoken to him Saturday. He also said the phone number the reporter had used was not his home number. The reporter had identified himself to the person who did answer the phone, had asked ''Is this Mr. Gardner?'' and had been told ''Yes, this is Bill.'' Later the reporter left a message at the same number, explaining why he was calling, but received no response by deadline. The reporter assumed he had reached the correct Bill Gardner, who lives in Manchester, but had actually called a Bill Gardner who lives in Rochester. 
 The article also misidentified the change proposed for Nevada at one point. It would be a caucus held on the Saturday between the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary. It would not be a primary election.

HEADLINE: Shop That Sells Bait to the Stars Is Moving Soon

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
A river doesn't run through the Hotel Chelsea, where Dylan Thomas exclaimed, days before he died from drink in 1953, ''I've had 18 straight whiskeys!''
 There are no mounted elk heads with antlers, either, or spools of 30-pound fishing line in the Hotel Chelsea lobby, which is filled with modern art like the purple sculpture of a fat woman on a swing.
And there are no eight-ounce bags of frozen fish bait anywhere near the famous bathroom, where, in 1978, Sid Vicious, the punk rocker, discovered his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen, dead. 
 But two doors down from the entrance to the Hotel Chelsea, and part of its ornate 11-story complex, is a world where such things are quite familiar: Capitol Fishing Tackle, the only bait and tackle shop in Manhattan.
 About the size of a large fishing cabin, Capitol Fishing has been purveyor to youngster and grandpa, the wealthy and not, to the trout angler in streams and the big-game mahi-mahi fisherman in the ocean, as well as to Andy Warhol and Fabio.
 For 42 years, the store has been selling to fisher folk as if it were located in Montana or the Florida Panhandle, instead of between an acupuncture store and a guitar shop on West 23rd Street.
 Next week, Capitol Fishing, complete with its old oak fixtures and its hot-yellow neon sign, is moving out of the Hotel Chelsea, the shrine for the hip and literati, because of rising rents. 
 To the relief of the New York fishing community, the store is reopening on Aug. 1 on West 36th Street, near Broadway, in the garment district. 
 ''I am so glad it's moving and not closing,'' said Ricky Williams, 51, a landscape architect from Ossining, N.Y., who likes to fish striped bass. A Capitol Fishing customer for 22 years, he wandered the store, taking photographs with his cellphone.
 In other words, this is not the end-of-an-era story, although, at one point, the store did come close to shutting its doors.
 Which is not to say that things are going to stay the same. For one thing, the worlds of angler and artist won't meet any more on this stretch of West 23rd Street.
 ''Sid Vicious used to come in here with Nancy Spungen,'' said Richard Collins, 51, a former clerk who has owned the store for the past 32 years. Mr. Collins, who is known as Richie, makes this statement as if he were describing Sheriff Andy Taylor dropping by with his young son, Opie, on ''The Andy Griffith Show.''
 The bass player for the Sex Pistols and his heroin-addicted girlfriend were depicted in the 1986 film ''Sid and Nancy,'' starring Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb. The real Sid and Nancy used to live in the Hotel Chelsea. He died of a drug overdose a few months after she died.
 Dressed in black leather and sporting a Mohawk, Sid Vicious liked browsing, Mr. Collins recalled. ''He bought a couple of rods and reels, so I know he was freshwater fishing,'' Mr. Collins said. ''He was hot and heavy for a little while,'' and then Mr. Collins's voice trailed off, not knowing whether the musician's drug addiction had finally stopped him from visiting the store.
 Most of Mr. Collins's customers have nothing in common, except the love of fishing, he said. An example: Lewis Glucksman, the Wall Street financier who died this month.
 ''Lew Glucksman,'' Mr. Collins said, ''would sit here and come in, with his limousine parked out in front, and Lew would sit down on a bench and have lunch and talk to local guys who were fishing, just like he was a local guy.''
 And then there are the unlikely customers Mr. Collins likes to mention, like Fabio, the model, who came in to buy items for his brother. Or Andy Warhol, who would buy high-test fishing line to hang paintings. Or the late Harold Robbins, author of potboilers like ''The Carpetbaggers.''
 Unlike Orvis, a specialty retailer famed for its $1,800 bamboo fishing rod, Capitol Fishing is more of the General Motors of fishing supplies, but closer to Chevy than to Cadillac.
 A box of fishhooks goes for $3, hip waders for $30. Even so, if a customer needs equipment for giant tuna, he can spend $2,000 for a heavy-duty rod and test line, with a reel the circumference of a long-playing record.
 Mr. Collins, who was born in Brooklyn and raised in North Miami, is the son of a fishing-tackle maker. Mr. Collins moved to New York in 1973 to work for a family friend, Charles Neeff (pronounced Neff), the owner of Capitol Fishing.
 Mr. Neeff's family had started the business in Germany in 1897 (proud immigrants, they named the business after the Capitol in Washington). The Hotel Chelsea was its fourth location in the city.
 In failing health, Mr. Neeff sold the business to the young Mr. Collins.
 The recession after the Sept. 11 attack, as well as new government restrictions on fishing, hurt the retail business. Facing higher rent if he stayed at the Hotel Chelsea, Mr. Collins considered closing the store. Luckily, a real estate broker introduced him to Steven J. Kaufman, who offered Mr. Collins a modestly higher rent, but less than he would be paying at the hotel if he stayed, and a 15-year lease in the garment district.
 Mr. Kaufman has been a Capitol Fishing customer for more than 30 years. Sitting next to Mr. Collins, Mr. Kaufman smiled as Mr. Collins talked about the new store.
 ''I never want to move this store again,'' Mr. Collins said. 
 Mr. Kaufman shrugged and said, ''Me neither.''

HEADLINE: Obesity Surgery Often Leads to Complications, Study Says

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23 

 BODY:
Four of every 10 patients who undergo weight-loss surgery develop complications within six months, the federal government said Sunday.
 The number of such surgical procedures has been rising rapidly, along with the incidence of obesity, which now afflicts 30 percent of adults in the United States, health officials said.
 Obesity surgery is helping thousands of Americans lose weight and reduce the risk of diabetes and other life-threatening diseases, said Dr. Carolyn M. Clancy, director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, a unit of the Public Health Service. But she added, ''This study shows how important it is for patients to consider the potential complications.'' 
 Many of the complications were so serious that patients were readmitted to hospitals or visited emergency rooms within six months.
 In the procedure, known as bariatric surgery, doctors reduce the number of calories that a person can consume and absorb. One of the more common techniques restricts the size of the stomach and the length of the intestine, where nutrients are absorbed.
 Federal researchers found that complications from obesity surgery significantly increased costs. 
 Over all, said William E. Encinosa, an economist at the health research agency, medical spending averaged $29,921 for obesity surgery and six months of follow-up care. For patients who experienced complications, spending averaged $36,542. And for those with complications that required readmission to a hospital, the average was $65,031.
 Past studies found that 10 percent to 20 percent of patients had complications while they were in the hospital. In the new study, Mr. Encinosa said, federal researchers found that 39.6 percent of patients had complications within 180 days of surgery.
 The most common complications included vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal hernias, infections, pneumonia and respiratory failure, as well as the leaking of gastric juices caused by imperfect surgical connections between the stomach and the intestines.
 Joanne Kayser, a retired New Hampshire state employee, said she weighed 320 pounds when she had weight-loss surgery in 2003. ''The operation went well,'' she said in an interview. ''It reduced my food intake. After the surgery, I lost 60 pounds.''
 But Ms. Kayser, now 64, said: ''My incision did not heal for seven months. I could not exercise, and I stopped losing weight. The incision became infected, and I had to have surgery by a wound care specialist. In addition, after four months, I developed a hernia, a bulge in my tummy.''
 Bariatric surgery often alleviates conditions that occur with obesity, like diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. That was the case with Ms. Kayser, who said she no longer needed to take diabetes medications because her blood sugar levels were under control. 
 Dr. Philip R. Schauer, president of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery, estimates that 175,000 to 200,000 weight-loss procedures will be performed this year, up from 47,000 in 2001. The number of people receiving the operation ''may be less than 1 percent of those who need it,'' said Dr. Schauer, director of bariatric surgery at the Cleveland Clinic.
 The government study was based on insurance claims filed with health plans offered by 45 large employers in 49 states. The data included information on 2,522 weight-loss operations in 2001 and 2002. 
 Dr. Schauer said surgical techniques and the quality of care had improved, so patients were less likely to suffer complications. In 2001 and 2002, he said, ''there were not a lot of standards for doctors and hospitals getting into the field of bariatric surgery.'' Since then, he said, the society has adopted standards, and some hospitals that specialize in the procedure have been designated ''centers of excellence.''
 In addition, Dr. Schauer said, more than half of the operations are now done with a technique known as laparoscopic surgery, which requires only tiny incisions. This approach sharply reduces some types of complications, he said.
 In the cases reviewed by federal researchers, 85 percent of the patients were women.
 Dr. Schauer suggested several reasons: ''Women have a somewhat higher incidence of obesity. Women seek medical care more than men. And obesity is more socially acceptable in men than in women.'' But Dr. Schauer said, ''Obesity is more deadly in men because they are more likely to have secondary effects of obesity like heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes.''
 Arthur G. Richards, an insurance agent in Portland, Ore., said some insurers were refusing to pay for obesity surgery and its complications. Such complications can lead to lawsuits, even when doctors meet the prevailing standards of care. Mr. Richards said his company was developing special insurance policies that would pay doctors for treating foreseeable complications.

HEADLINE: Investors Say Flaws At School Are Deeper

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
The problems at Interboro Institute, one of the largest, fastest-growing profit-making colleges in New York State in recent years, were deeper even than those outlined by the State Education Department last year, according to papers filed late on Friday in a class-action securities fraud complaint against Interboro's parent, EVCI Career Colleges Holding Corporation.
 The complaint, filed in Federal District Court in the Southern District of New York, alleged that cheating in determining whether students were eligible for federal and state financial aid was routine, not unusual, and that the company dismissed employees who failed to meet quotas in enrolling students. 
Joseph D. Alperin, EVCI's general counsel, said yesterday that he could not comment on the complaint because the company was in litigation, except to say, ''We will defend ourselves vigorously.''
 Interboro, which seeks to enroll low-income students who have not graduated from high school, grew in five years from about 1,000 students to more than 4,000, in part through subway ads offering the opportunity to earn a high school equivalency degree and a two-year college degree in 16 months. It has four sites, three in New York City and one in Yonkers. 
 The Education Department found several instances of cheating on financial aid eligibility tests and other problems. It ordered Interboro to improve its academics, raise its graduation rates and hire an outside company to do admissions testing -- and to reduce enrollments while it corrected the other problems. 
 EVCI executives have said numerous times that their problems were less pervasive than the state has said, and were the fault of a few ''rogue employees'' who have been dismissed. A review of Interboro, by a law firm hired by EVCI's outside directors, concluded after dozens of interviews with employees that the company's top executives did not encourage cheating and were unaware that there was any.
 The securities fraud complaint also named EVCI's chairman, Arol A. Buntzman; its chief executive officer, John J. McGrath; and its former chief financial officer, Richard Goldenberg, as defendants, and said they had ''exploited economically disadvantaged students for personal gain.'' 
 The complaint filed on Friday cited interviews with several former Interboro employees. They said that after Dr. McGrath became EVCI's chief executive in 2003, he directed admissions officials to increase enrollment by 20 percent each semester, and told employees they risked dismissal if they did not bring in 120 new students each semester.
 The complaint did not identify the witnesses it quoted, but said they included a former dean and several people who had worked in admissions, including one who was fired for not meeting quotas.
 The complaint also quoted former employees as saying that admissions workers routinely changed answers and scores on completed exams used to determine whether students were eligible for federal and state financial aid, which accounted for more than 90 percent of Interboro's revenue. 
 To qualify for federal financial aid, students without high school diplomas must show they have the ''ability to benefit'' from post-secondary education by passing a test approved by the federal Department of Education. 
 The legal complaint said one confidential informant who had worked in testing at Interboro said graders were paid $50 or given other gifts to pass students who would otherwise have failed. 
 It said shareholders were misled by EVCI's reports that its soaring enrollments resulted from the company's improved efforts to help students stay in school. ''Those enrollments were generated through fraud, not the company's 'retention strategies,' '' the complaint said.
 The complaint was filed by Darnley D. Stewart and Alyson C. Bruns of Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, representing the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, which invested more than $2 million in EVCI stock and claimed a loss of more than $1.7 million. Judge Colleen McMahon of Federal District Court designated the Arkansas teachers as lead plaintiff in May, when she combined several complaints against EVCI into one. 
 EVCI's stock fell sharply after its problems were first disclosed, to less than 60 cents a share on Friday from more than $6 a share last October.
 The company also owns Technical Career Institutes in New York and a business school in Pennsylvania.

HEADLINE: Sacrificing One Challenger So the Other Might Win 

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Representative Edolphus Towns is one of Brooklyn's longest-serving members of Congress, with 12 terms of service. But many Democrats also consider him to be one of the most vulnerable. Unions are angry with him. His critics say his record is lackluster, with a larger-than-average number of missed votes, and he has had two tough primaries in the last eight years.
 But Mr. Towns, a Democrat, has one thing going for him as he campaigns for a 13th term: a divided field in the party primary on Sept. 12. With two well-known officials challenging him, many Brooklyn Democratic leaders say that Mr. Towns could waltz back into office if his opponents split the anti-Towns vote. 
Now, however, those challengers -- City Councilman Charles Barron and Assemblyman Roger L. Green -- are talking about joining forces. And the two men have been meeting to decide whether one may drop out of the race.
 ''There is no question that it becomes more difficult if both of us are in the race,'' Mr. Green said in an interview. ''And Charles and I have talked about that. We've had numerous conversations, and we intend to sit down again soon and see if we can come to some kind of consensus.''
 Mr. Green said that he and Mr. Barron would be meeting as early as today to discuss the possibility of one of them withdrawing from the race.
 ''We will be looking at both of our campaigns objectively,'' Mr. Barron said. ''We want to look at who has the money, who has the infrastructure and who has the best chance of winning. But with both of us in the race, it makes it hard to beat an incumbent who has raised almost $1 million.''
 Both men see Mr. Towns as being highly vulnerable. Six years ago, the congressman survived a strong challenge from Barry D. Ford, a lawyer, in the Democratic primary. Mr. Towns got 57 percent of the vote, considered a narrow victory for a longtime incumbent. Two years earlier, Mr. Towns received 52 percent of the vote in a three-candidate primary, the weakest showing of any incumbent member of Congress that year.
 In the last year, Mr. Towns has been widely denounced by labor groups, largely as a result of his vote for the Central American Free Trade Agreement. The agreement would lower barriers to trade and investment between the United States and six other nations, including Costa Rica and El Salvador.
 The candidates challenging Mr. Towns for the Democratic nomination in the 10th Congressional District have also criticized his record of missed votes and taken issue with his history of support for the tobacco industry. They say he is not widely available to constituents in the district, which stretches from East New York and Bedford-Stuyvesant through Fort Greene and into Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill.
 Both Mr. Green and Mr. Barron said they represent what they called ''the progressive movement'' within Brooklyn politics. Mr. Green said labor unions had been reluctant to choose between them ''because we're alike on the issues in so many ways.''
 Mr. Towns said in an interview on Friday that he did not think he was vulnerable. ''The feedback I get from people as I move around the district makes me feel good,'' he said. ''The response has been tremendous. People know who I am and they appreciate the fact that I have been so available.''
 Despite discontent from unions, Mr. Towns has a great deal going for him. An array of Brooklyn officials, at all levels of government, have endorsed him. And he has raised nearly $900,000 for his re-election, with $400,000 on hand, according to campaign finance reports filed last week. 
 Moreover, Mr. Towns, 72, a North Carolina-born Baptist minister and former deputy Brooklyn borough president, is widely considered a master campaigner. Despite criticism that he is not available to voters, as a campaigner he is seen as being energized by the prospect of meeting voters at subway stations and community meetings.
 His rivals are well known in their areas, but each faces difficulties in the race, including problems raising money. Mr. Barron has raised $100,000 for his congressional campaign, with nearly $70,000 on hand. Since being elected to the Council in 2001, he has been outspoken in his criticism of police brutality and his advocacy of reparations for descendants of slaves. He has not always endeared himself to his Council colleagues, such as by calling Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg a racist or calling Speaker Christine C. Quinn too close to county political bosses. 
 Mr. Green has been a distant third in fund-raising, having raised $35,000, with almost $5,000 on hand and a campaign debt of $20,000. He pleaded guilty in 2004 to petty larceny involving improperly billing the Assembly for travel expenses. He agreed to three years' probation and restitution, and he paid a $2,000 fine.
 Another Democratic candidate, Kevin Powell, a writer and lecturer, withdrew from the party primary this month.
 Despite their willingness to discuss the need for one candidate to leave the race, it is unclear whether either Mr. Green or Mr. Barron will be willing to withdraw.
 ''We are both more than qualified,'' Mr. Barron said. ''We have both shown that we have substance and that we have solutions to the issues of education and the economy. But the biggest question is: Who can win?''
 Mr. Barron added that his Council district ''is completely within the Congressional district. Most of the voters in Towns's district already know me. And I think that's where I have the edge.''
 Mr. Green pointed out that he had been in the Assembly as long as Mr. Towns had been in Congress. ''And I have the experience to do the job.''
 He added: ''The challenge for us is to see if we can arrive at a decision about who will be the standard-bearer for the progressive movement in Brooklyn politics. We'll work hard to come to a decision. And we'll see what happens.''

HEADLINE: Vacant Lot Was Their Paradise

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Technically, the lot on East 139th Street near Willis Avenue in the South Bronx was vacant, according to city records.
 Yet there was nothing vacant about it.
Over here was the camper where the guys from the neighborhood watched football games on Sundays. Over there was Izzy's 1981 Yamaha motorcycle, an old motorboat, a wheelchair, three Rottweilers and the cages for Mr. Lopez's chickens. Children from across the street used it as a playground. There were parties, domino games, volleyball matches, auto-repair workshops and pig roasts.
 About 12 years ago, Geraldo Justiniano decided to reclaim the abandoned lot for the neighborhood. He put up a chain-link fence, laid down some gravel and mowed the grass. And though he lives in a two-bedroom apartment a few blocks away, he would often sleep in the camper on weekends, soaking up life in the great outdoors of East 139th Street, the morning crows of a rooster his alarm clock.
 When the construction crew arrived this month, no one was really surprised. Mr. Justiniano -- people call him J. J. -- watched one day last week as a giant claw tore a deep hole in the soil. Five three-family homes are going up on the lot, which had become known in this corner of Mott Haven by two names: La Yarda and Paradise. 
 ''A lot of memories,'' said Mr. Justiniano, 39. His friends and neighbors have been feeling equally nostalgic: On the Fourth of July, they threw him and La Yarda a farewell party.
 The commercial and residential development that has transformed the South Bronx in recent years has done more than added jobs and housing. It has altered the physical landscape, filling in the empty topography that in the 1970's and 80's came to symbolize the decline and abandonment of entire parts of American cities.
 The vacant lots of the area's past -- the eerie urban prairies strewn with garbage and the rubble of dead tenements -- graced the covers of books and the pages of newspapers. They starred in Hollywood movies like ''Fort Apache, the Bronx.'' They drew visits from local politicians, a president, a future president and even a pope.
 Yet for many South Bronx residents, the empty land was something more than an eyesore or an emblem of urban blight. Lots remained abandoned for so long that they took on an unexpected, improvisational life of their own in one of the poorest communities in the country. Now, as new apartment buildings, homes and businesses rise in the area, this small piece of gritty South Bronx history -- the abandoned lot -- is disappearing.
 These lots were unloved for the most part, but not unused. They were dumps, drug bazaars and a breeding ground for illegal activity, but they also became community gardens, outdoor churches and places where streetwise entrepreneurs set up shop. They were home to wooden crosses, discarded couches, oil spills, beat-up cars and people like Jorge Luis Manzo, known as Choco, who years ago lived in a small wooden shack on a burned-out stretch of St. Ann's Avenue, one of many streets devastated at the time by rampant arson.
 Anthony Perez Cassino, a lawyer who is the chairman of Community Board 8 in Riverdale and grew up in the South Bronx in the 1970's, said the abandoned lots cast the entire borough in a negative light, a reputation that continued long after they began to be replaced by much-needed housing. ''It's good to see it go,'' he said of the empty spaces. ''In the bigger picture, it's for the better.''
 According to land-use and geographic data from the Department of City Planning, there were 1,300 vacant parcels in the South Bronx in 2005. Many are now construction sites or are no longer empty, the result of the borough's building boom. Since 2002, $3 billion in private and public money has been invested in residential, commercial and institutional development projects in the Bronx, according to figures from the borough president's office. The number of new Bronx addresses issued in 2005 was 1,352, nearly double the number in 2001.
 The empty lots that remain are narrow slices of pavement or large expanses of urban wilderness. Some are impromptu junkyards. Others have five-foot-tall weeds. Chain-link fences act as billboards advertising mattresses for sale and Carlo's Lite Mover. The fences do not keep people out so much as keep them in. There are dining room chairs set on the grass, crushed beer cans, cigar butts and tables.
 At a lot on Fox Street, there is a touch of gallows humor: a freshly dug mock grave and a cross at the edge of the sidewalk. At a lot at Prospect Avenue and East 156th Street, there is Mama Isabels Place, a food van that has been a neighborhood staple for years. People sit beneath the van's canopy on cafeteria-style chairs, eating $1.25 pastelillos de carne, or meat turnovers.
 And there is La Yarda.
 The 100-by-100-foot space, which is being developed by the Jackson Development Group of Bellerose, N.Y., has been the scene of an unusually friendly property dance, as Mr. Justiniano, the lot's unofficial tenant, moves out and the company, which bought the site six months ago, moves in. The developer even hired Mr. Justiniano to work as a security guard during construction.
 Mr. Justiniano is short and stocky, and he has a tan as deep as any lifeguard's from spending so many hours in the lot. He grew up in the apartment building next door, and his unorthodox view of public and private property began early, when he took over one empty lot on the block at age 9 and another at 19. Now he runs an office-supply delivery company and is the vice president of the Bronx chapter of the Lunatics, a New York City motorcycle club.
 As he sat on a bench that used to be the back seat of someone's van, he talked about the old times in Paradise. He and his friends brought in a projector to show movies on the wall. They had an Easter egg hunt for neighborhood children and once hitched a motorized water scooter to the back of a Jeep during a snowstorm. ''Our own field of dreams,'' said Mr. Justiniano's friend Izzy Fortuna, 45.
 At the goodbye party on the Fourth, neighbors signed a banner spray-painted with the words ''Farewell La Yarda.'' A woman named Sandra wrote: ''We will miss the good times.'' Someone else scrawled: ''Home never has a name.'' Jose E. Serrano, the Bronx congressman whose district includes Mott Haven and who happened to be in the neighborhood that afternoon, signed the banner and took home a plate of food.
 ''This is an example of a spot in the neighborhood that became sort of an oasis,'' Mr. Serrano said. ''I've always seen people using a lot. I've never seen anyone say goodbye to one.''
 Mr. Justiniano is storing the camper, the children's toys and other items at another lot at the corner. It is much smaller than La Yarda. But he thinks it will be perfect for a pig roast.

HEADLINE: Ross, Buyer Of Assets, Is Selling Own Firm

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the New York investor who has made a fortune buying troubled companies -- including much of the American steel industry -- is selling his own firm in an effort to make it bigger.
 Amvescap, a global investment company based in London, is acquiring W. L. Ross & Company for $130 million to $375 million, depending on performance goals, Mr. Ross and Amvescap announced yesterday. Mr. Ross will remain with the company and manage Amvescap's private-equity business.
 ''We're now in era of megafunds,'' Mr. Ross said yesterday in a telephone interview. ''In a different, earlier period, $3.5 billion, which is about what we have under management, seemed like a lot. Nowadays, it's not.'' 
 In addition to the enormous payout, the deal gives Mr. Ross access to more capital at a time when rising interest rates and a surge in high-yield debt has laid the groundwork for more of the sort of distressed-company buyouts that are his specialty. 
 The Federal Reserve has been steadily raising its benchmark interest rate since mid-2004 in an effort to slow the economy, and rising interest rates can sometimes lead to the collapse of struggling businesses or risky financial strategies. 
 Mr. Ross said that his business typically grew a couple of years after an outpouring of high-yield bonds and leveraged loans, which has occurred recently.
 Amvescap will pay Mr. Ross $100 million personally when the transaction closes, which is expected this fall. It will then pay up to $55 million a year over the next five years, depending on how many investment funds he introduces and how large they are.
 The first annual payment will be at least $30 million, according to Amvescap, which is best known in the United States for its Invesco and AIM Funds subsidiaries. Future payments are not guaranteed.
 Amvescap's recent private-equity efforts ran into trouble when its corporate executives clashed with the more freewheeling investment managers who ran Invesco Private Capital. The managers criticized the Amvescap executives for micro-managing the fund and forcing them to attend corporate meetings that had nothing to do with private equity.
 ''It was impossible to do what I wanted to get done,'' Parag Saxena, who ran Invesco Private Capital until resigning in April, said this spring.
 Mr. Ross, though, said he was confident that Martin L. Flanagan, Amvescap's chief executive for almost a year, had created an entrepreneurial atmosphere.
 Mr. Flanagan said in a telephone interview, ''I feel very strongly that you really need to have dedicated, separate management teams in place and really do everything you can to have them stay focused.''
 Though the details have not been worked out, Mr. Ross's name will remain prominent in the business, Mr. Flanagan said. Mr. Ross, who employs about 50 investment professionals, will inherit as much as $2.3 billion now being managed by Amvescap's private-equity business, which has focused on early and midstage investments.
 Amvescap's payout will go entirely to Mr. Ross, who also signed a five-year employment contract, he said. Other managers at his firm will receive Amvescap restricted stock as part of the agreement.
 Mr. Ross, 68, once owned the company that publishes ''Who's Who in America'' and was previously married to Betsy McCaughey Ross, lieutenant governor of New York from 1995 to 1999. He has made millions in recent years by buying troubled businesses and then combining them. After costs are cut, the businesses have often been more profitable together than they were apart.
 In 2002, he created the International Steel Group, which acquired Bethlehem Steel and LTV before being sold last year to Mittal Steel. International Steel owned the Sago mine in West Virginia, where 12 miners died in an accident early this year. The mine had been cited for numerous safety violations before the accident, and its injury rate last year was three times the national average. Mr. Ross has said that the company did not compromise worker safety and he called the day of the accident ''the worst day of my life,'' according to The Wall Street Journal.
 Besides steel companies, Mr. Ross's firm has also purchased Burlington Industries and other textile companies. Over the last year, it has concentrated on the ailing auto-parts industry.
 Mr. Ross predicted yesterday that the Amvescap deal would be a landmark that would have ''quite a few echoes.'' 
 He added, ''I believe we're going to start to see a trend toward the institutionalization of the private-equity community.'' Some firms will be bought out, Mr. Ross said, and others will go public to gain access to more capital.
 De Guardiola Advisors and Goldman Sachs served as advisers to Amvescap, which will pay for the deal with a combination of cash and debt.

HEADLINE: Black and Blue

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
According to the White House transcript, here's how it went last week, when President Bush addressed the N.A.A.C.P. for the first time:
 THE PRESIDENT: ''I understand that many African-Americans distrust my political party.''
AUDIENCE: ''Yes! (Applause.)'' 
 But Mr. Bush didn't talk about why African-Americans don't trust his party, and black districts are always blue on election maps. So let me fill in the blanks. 
 First, G.O.P. policies consistently help those who are already doing extremely well, not those lagging behind -- a group that includes the vast majority of African-Americans. And both the relative and absolute economic status of blacks, after improving substantially during the Clinton years, have worsened since 2000.
 The G.O.P. obsession with helping the haves and have-mores, and lack of concern for everyone else, was evident even in Mr. Bush's speech to the N.A.A.C.P. Mr. Bush never mentioned wages, which have been falling behind inflation for most workers. And he certainly didn't mention the minimum wage, which disproportionately affects African-American workers, and which he has allowed to fall to its lowest real level since 1955. 
 Mr. Bush also never used the word ''poverty,'' a condition that afflicts almost one in four blacks.
 But he found time to call for repeal of the estate tax, even though African-Americans are more than a thousand times as likely to live below the poverty line as they are to be rich enough to leave a taxable estate.
 Economic issues alone, then, partially explain African-American disdain for the G.O.P.
 But even more important is the way Republicans win elections.
 The problem with policies that favor the economic elite is that by themselves they're not a winning electoral strategy, because there aren't enough elite voters. So how did the Republicans rise to their current position of political dominance? It's hard to deny that barely concealed appeals to racism, which drove a wedge between blacks and relatively poor whites who share the same economic interests, played a crucial role. 
 Don't forget that in 1980, the sainted Ronald Reagan began his presidential campaign with a speech on states' rights in Philadelphia, Miss., where three civil rights workers were murdered in 1964.
 These days the racist appeals have been toned down; Trent Lott was demoted, though not drummed out of the party, when he declared that if Strom Thurmond's segregationist presidential campaign had succeeded ''we wouldn't have had all these problems.'' Meanwhile, the G.O.P. has found other ways to obscure its economic elitism. The Bush administration has proved utterly incompetent in fighting terrorists, but it has skillfully exploited the terrorist threat for domestic political gain. And there are also the ''values'' issues: abortion, stem cells, gay marriage.
 But the nasty racial roots of the G.O.P.'s triumph live on in public policy and election strategy.
 A revelatory article in yesterday's Boston Globe described how the Bush administration has politicized the Justice Department's civil rights division, ''filling the permanent ranks with lawyers who have strong conservative credentials but little experience in civil rights.'' 
 Not surprisingly, there has been a shift in priorities: ''The division is bringing fewer voting rights and employment cases involving systematic discrimination against African-Americans, and more alleging reverse discrimination against whites and religious discrimination against Christians.''
 Above all, there's the continuing effort of the G.O.P. to suppress black voting. 
 The Supreme Court probably wouldn't have been able to put Mr. Bush in the White House in 2000 if the administration of his brother, the governor of Florida, hadn't misidentified large numbers of African-Americans as felons ineligible to vote. In 2004, Ohio's Republican secretary of state tried to impose a ludicrous rule on the paper weight of voter registration applications; last year, Georgia Republicans tried to impose an onerous ''voter ID'' rule. In each case, the obvious intent was to disenfranchise blacks.
 And if the Republicans hold on to the House this fall, it will probably only be because of a redistricting plan in Texas that a panel of Justice Department lawyers unanimously concluded violated the Voting Rights Act -- only to be overruled by their politically appointed superiors.
 So yes, African-Americans distrust Mr. Bush's party -- with good reason.

HEADLINE: A Test of Friendship for India's Leader

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA; Hari Kumar contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, July 23 

 BODY:
Manmohan Singh, the prime minister of India and an ever-more-important friend of the United States government, is poised to face a storm of criticism this week when Parliament returns for the aptly named monsoon session.
 Much of the criticism, it seems, implicates his friendship with the United States.
 Mr. Singh, an avowed economic reformist who has made nuclear partnership with the United States a central element of his policy agenda, is likely to face a beating over at least three issues -- terrorism, economic liberalization and nuclear bargaining -- all bearing consequences for India's relationship with the United States. 
 In fact, the budding friendship is complicated precisely by the messiness of democracy. 
 ''I wouldn't like to be in his shoes,'' said K. Subrahmanyam, the chairman of the government's Task Force on Global Strategic Development. 
 First, even as Mr. Singh has secured a groundbreaking initial nod from the United States Congress on acquiring civilian nuclear technology, the negotiations have lately tripped over several hurdles involving the required American legislation, leading the government's critics to pounce. 
 One would compel India, which is not a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty but has promised to segregate reactors for civilian and military use, to open its nuclear facilities to inspections by the Americans in addition to those by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Another would bar the sale of certain nuclear technology. A third, nonbinding measure asks India to support the United States on Iran. India, with a large Muslim population and a soaring demand for energy, is extremely sensitive on the subject of Iran. 
 Officials in Mr. Singh's government have openly voiced their apprehensions about these measures. Nevertheless, the complications in the nuclear deal, which if passed by the United States Congress would allow India to expand its civilian nuclear program, have already spurred the government's critics to accuse Mr. Singh of mortgaging India's strategic needs to overbearing American lawmakers. 
 ''It is for India to decide Indian policy,'' fumed D. Raja, a national secretary of the Communist Party of India, which supports the coalition government led by Mr. Singh's Congress Party. ''The P.M. told us that the nuclear deal is based on reciprocity, but to us, this is doubtful and superficial.''
 The criticism has come both from the left, which is consistently distrustful of American intentions, and from the right, which is pro-American by nature but savvy enough to recognize that anti-Americanism is still a good stick with which to beat the prime minister. As Prakash Javdekar, a spokesman of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, put it, ''We do not mind the closeness of prime minister with the U.S. or any other country, but if that closeness is not getting desirable results then what is the advantage?'' 
 The stew over the nuclear deal has most recently been spiced by a memoir by Jaswant Singh, the former foreign minister in the Bharatiya Janata-led government that was routed by voters two years ago. In the book, Mr. Singh, who bears no relation to the current prime minister, contends that a mole in the former Congress Party-led government under P. V. Narasimha Rao, then the prime minister, leaked secrets to the United States about India's nuclear program. He has refused to identify the mole.
 Second, the prime minister is under scrutiny for the July 11 bombs that struck Mumbai's commuter train system. Bharatiya Janata, in particular, is braced to charge Mr. Singh with being soft on terrorism. 
 The prime minister says he includes an improvement in relations with Pakistan among his foreign policy priorities. But the July 11 train attacks and the public outrage they unleashed prompted Mr. Singh to assail Pakistan over what he called its failed promise to dismantle support for anti-Indian militants. Pakistan has testily demanded proof. 
 The United States maintains its support for both India and Pakistan. Publicly, American officials describe the Pakistani president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, as a vital ally in the campaign against terrorism, even as they privately urge him to go further in reining in militant groups.
 ''Our relationship with Pakistan is far more important in the near term; our relationship with India is far more important in the long term,'' said Ashley Tellis, who recently returned to his post at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace after a four-month stint advising the State Department on the Indian nuclear deal. ''The script that we follow is a script worth following.''
 Mr. Singh is also vulnerable on the question of the economy. There have been serious blows to planned economic changes, a pivotal demand of the United States, which has doubled exports to India in the last four years to nearly $8 billion in 2005. The most recent setback came when plans to sell off a partial government stake in a state-owned coal mining company set off such stinging opposition, even from members of the governing coalition, that Mr. Singh said he would delay all pending disinvestment proposals. 
 The back-step in disinvestment was roundly criticized here and abroad by those who are pressing for economic changes. But it also underscored the political trouble that such efforts at change can produce. 
 A public opinion survey conducted in person last week by the the Center for the Study of Developing Societies, a research group in Delhi that examines democracy-related issues, found that only 34 percent of the 1,884 Indians interviewed in person described the prime minister as ''pro-poor,'' while 56 percent said they were unhappy with price increases -- both numbers signaling a grievance with Mr. Singh's economic agenda. 
 ''It will take some time for benefits to flow to the poor,'' Prithviraj Chavan, minister of state in the prime minister's office, conceded in an interview Saturday night with CNN-IBN, a private television channel that commissioned the poll.
 His critics would do well, though, not to lose sight of another major finding of the same survey: two years into his tenure, Mr. Singh enjoys a robust 56 percent approval rating.

HEADLINE: Scintillating Send-Offs for Don Giovanni and Mozart

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH

DATELINE: LENOX, Mass., July 23 

 BODY:
As if to lay the Mozart anniversary year to rest, James Levine and the Boston Symphony Orchestra spent much of the weekend here at the Tanglewood Festival concerned with last things.
 The Friday evening program juxtaposed Mozart's final piano concerto (No. 27, the ''Coronation'') with his final symphony (No. 41, the ''Jupiter''). The opera ''Don Giovanni,'' presented in concert on Saturday night, dispatched its antihero to his just reward in hell very near the witching hour. And on Sunday afternoon the Tanglewood Festival Chorus joined the orchestra in sending off Mozart himself, to the strains of his own unfinished ''Requiem.''
 Given Mr. Levine's wealth of experience in opera and his expertise in choosing and working with voices, the ''Don Giovanni'' performance shaped up in advance as the highlight, and it met expectations. With the surest of hands, Mr. Levine set a scintillating pace and maintained impetus throughout the long evening. He kept the reduced orchestra in fine balance with the singers and traced a persuasive arc in the drama (largely left to the imagination) as well as in the music. 
 The cast was strong, despite two late substitutions. For one, the young bass-baritone Luca Pisaroni took the role of the Don's sidekick, Leporello, replacing an indisposed veteran, Ferruccio Furlanetto, on four days' notice. Tamar Iveri, a Georgian soprano, had a little more time to prepare for the role of the doubly wronged and vengeful Donna Anna, replacing Barbara Frittoli, also for medical reasons.
 Mr. Pisaroni, lanky and animated, made a worthy foil to Mariusz Kwiecien's Don Giovanni, sometimes upstaging him. But vocally, Mr. Kwiecien, a fast-rising baritone, more than held his own with robust yet agile tone, wide-ranging expressiveness and a winning swagger. 
 Ms. Iveri brought well-focused drama and a rich, clear voice to her early numbers but increasingly veered toward the melodramatic, sacrificing vocal finesse in the process. She might well have chewed the scenery if there had been any to chew. Some of that fiery temperament might have benefited Soile Isokoski, who gave a lovely but restrained portrayal of Donna Elvira, whom the Don alternately melts and enrages.
 Matthew Polenzani made much of the typically thankless role of Donna Anna's wimpy betrothed, Don Ottavio, imparting lively character even to the relatively colorless aria ''Dalla sua pace,'' which drew one of the evening's biggest ovations. Patrick Carfizzi, another accomplished baritone, sang the country bumpkin Masetto, occasionally rivaling Mr. Kwiecien and Mr. Pisaroni in vocal quality and power.
 Heidi Grant Murphy, with typically sweet tone as Masetto's (and the Don's) beloved Zerlina, was working on a smaller scale than the rest of the cast: too small, at times, to register clearly in the big shed. Morris D. Robinson's cavernous sound was appropriate to the avenging statue of the slain Commendatore, if not, earlier, to the living person. 
 There were no props or scenery. Well, there was one prop; in a curious whimsical moment, Mr. Levine, now trimmer and more agile, dismounted the podium, waded through the orchestra and presented his conducting score to Leporello as a stand-in for the catalog listing the Don's many conquests. Physical interaction among the characters was economical and well judged. (With no director credited, Mr. Levine was presumably doing the judging.)
 Bare-bones though this canny account might have been, it drew a listener more surely and deeply into the music, and even the drama, than many a ''Don Giovanni'' has at Mr. Levine's Metropolitan Opera, especially in the monumental production by Franco Zeffirelli, now happily retired. 
 The ''Requiem'' on Sunday was scarcely less impressive. The early-music movement has ''problematized'' (as academics like to say) the performance of the Baroque and Classical repertory, and choral music has become the most problematic of all. Should choral and orchestral forces be reduced to period size, and how should they be balanced? Or should larger, conventional forces be used discreetly to produce a smaller, quainter sound?
 Mr. Levine was having none of musicology here. With the festival chorus, meticulously trained by John Oliver, weighing in at about 80 voices, Mr. Levine simply let it rip. The wall of sound at the start was stunning, and the performance remained compelling throughout, mostly for its power, but also at times for its subtlety.
 The hard-working Ms. Isokoski picked up where she had left off the night before, singing the soprano solos, and in this elevated music the restraint worked to her advantage. With less to do, the other soloists -- Susan Graham, mezzo-soprano; Kenneth Tarver, tenor; and John Relyea, bass-baritone -- also rose to the stirring occasion. 
 But first on Sunday came Mozart's lengthy ''Posthorn'' Serenade (K. 320), and sandwiched between ''Don Giovanni'' and the ''Requiem,'' it sounded like so much Mozartean make-work: pretty good make-work, to be sure, but perhaps ill advised in this lofty context. The work takes its name from an extended solo on the posthorn, a small horn that used to signal the comings and goings of mail coaches. (It is used even more centrally in Mahler's Third Symphony.) Charles Schlueter, the orchestra's principal trumpeter, was not quite the instrument's master here, but the work also gives prominence to the woodwind section, and the players responded with spirit and polish.
 The other odd interpolation in the weekend, opening the Friday program, was the extended concert aria ''Ch'io mi scordi di te Non temer amato bene,'' which is not often performed because it calls for a solo pianist as well as a wide-ranging female voice. But it received considerable attention in January in connection with an internationally televised concert on Mozart's birthday in his hometown, Salzburg, Austria. The soprano Renee Fleming, who was to sing the piece with Riccardo Muti conducting the Vienna Philharmonic and the pianist Mitsuko Uchida, withdrew late in the game because of vocal discomfort with the piece and was replaced by the mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli.
 On Friday, too, it was given to a mezzo, Ms. Graham, with Mr. Levine doubling as pianist. She sang it richly and beautifully, and if she lacked some of the coloratura flair that Ms. Bartoli threw at it in Salzburg (and who doesn't?), Ms. Graham's dramatic approach might have served the music better.
 Richard Goode, the pianist in the ''Coronation'' Concerto, performed with his usual probity and fluidity. The orchestra did its job well there and at the start of the ''Jupiter'' Symphony, though without any evident passion or commitment. Paradoxically, the ''Jupiter'' perked up in the Minuet, despite a relaxed mood and a leisurely pace, and the mighty finale was the mind- and ear-bending event it was always meant to be.
 On Thursday Tanglewood turns its attention to its annual Festival of Contemporary Music, which runs until July 31. But the Mozart year, far from having been laid to rest, remains alive and well elsewhere, with the Salzburg Festival having just begun its survey of the Mozart operas, and the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center opening on Friday.

The Tanglewood Festival continues throughout the summer in Lenox, Mass.; (888) 266-1200 or tanglewood.org.


CORRECTION-DATE: July 27, 2006

 CORRECTION:
A music review on Tuesday about the Boston Symphony Orchestra's weekend concerts at the Tanglewood Festival referred incorrectly to Mozart's piano concerto No. 27, which was performed on Friday night. It has no title; it is his piano concerto No. 26 that is called ''The Coronation.''

HEADLINE: U.S. May Push Its Crackdown, but Internet Casinos Won't Die Easily 

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL and HEATHER TIMMONS

 BODY:
Can the United States handcuff online wagering?
 Glen Walker, a professional sports bettor in North Carolina who places up to 70 bets a week of $2,000 to $5,000 each during football season, does not think so. ''They're not going to stop the offshore sports books,'' Mr. Walker said. A crackdown will ''just force it back to the black market.''
Last week, one such wagering site, BetOnSports.com, a publicly traded company in Britain, became the focal point of an American crackdown on offshore casinos, where gamblers anywhere in the world can use the highly profitable sites to place wagers on sporting events. They can also play casino games like blackjack and poker from their personal computers. 
 Federal agents arrested the British chief executive of BetOnSports, David Carruthers, who was in the United States on a flight layover. He is in custody in Fort Worth; the betting site has temporarily suspended operations to satisfy a temporary restraining order that prohibits the company from taking bets from United States residents. Mr. Carruthers is awaiting a hearing on his detention. 
 In Washington, the House overwhelmingly approved legislation recently that would clamp down on Internet casinos in part by restricting the ability of American financial institutions to process wagers. 
 The legislative-prosecutorial one-two punch appears to be the most concerted effort yet by the federal government to undermine Internet gambling in an era of well-organized, publicly owned offshore casinos. For the first time, Washington has succeeded in temporarily shutting down a publicly owned site and its effort has gained the attention of the operators, whose share prices plummeted last week.
 Still, few experts expect the crackdown to do anything more than dent the industry. Sebastian Sinclair, an analyst with Christiansen Capital Advisors, which tracks online gambling trends, said offshore gambling could be ''curtailed but it cannot be stopped.''
 Other experts see the recent moves as little more than an elaborate cat-and-mouse game serving only to benefit Las Vegas and Atlantic City casinos, along with Indian gambling operations, rather than seriously protecting Americans from falling prey to excessive gambling.
 Some eight million Americans like Mr. Walker wager $6 billion annually through the Internet, many making bets on their favorite sports team or the N.C.A.A. basketball pool. About half of all online wagers come from the United States.
 Critics say that online gambling is the equivalent of putting a slot machine in every home, providing an easy chance to lose money with a few mouse clicks, all without the social controls at a bricks-and-mortar casino.
 Mr. Walker disagrees. ''We're not doing anything immoral or illegal,'' he insisted. ''I just don't see that I'm harming anyone.'' 
 While prosecutors argue that Internet casinos violate the law, there is no federal prohibition against actually placing a bet. So how much success the federal push can have ''is a very profound question,'' said Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, the co-author of the legislation, who says the gambling is detrimental to families and the economy. 
 But even he concedes that Washington's best efforts will lead only ''to a reduction but not necessarily to an ending'' of online gambling.
 The question of further curbing Internet gambling has been a perennial issue in Congress in recent years. But people involved with the legislation say the reason for its success, at least in the House, is mainly explained by lawmakers wanting to distance themselves from the corruption scandal involving the convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his association with Indian casinos. Mr. Abramoff had lobbied vigorously against versions of the bill in the past. Still, some politicians in the House came out strongly against the bill, including Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who called it ''cultural authoritarianism.''
 Industry executives and analysts say similar bills have failed in the Senate, and many feel that it is unlikely to gain traction there. Analysts from Dresdner Kleinwort in London call the measure inconsistent and unenforceable.
 Nevertheless, executives, lawyers and analysts say that Washington, depending on the resources it is willing to commit, can at least make life more miserable for the offshore casinos. They say the effort resembles attempts to restrict the sex and drug trades, an endless pursuit in which users and suppliers constantly develop new ways to skirt law enforcement.
 Offshore casinos ''are going to continue to thumb their noses at the Department of Justice,'' Mr. Sinclair said. ''The operators will say, 'I'm sitting here in Costa Rica drinking a mai tai. What are you going to do?' ''
 And, he said, if the government succeeds in shutting some sites, others will pop up.
 This is not the first time that the American government has taken on Internet gambling. In 2001, a federal court sentenced Jay Cohen, the operator of an Internet sports book in Costa Rica, to 21 months in prison for taking bets from Americans.
 But there is a new intensity to this latest crackdown, particularly with the simultaneous attacks from Congress and law enforcement. Legislators and prosecutors said their efforts were not coordinated, but industry analysts view it as a powerful combination.
 And by going after Mr. Carruthers, a British citizen who runs a company listed on the London Stock Exchange, Washington has upped the ante. ''This is absolutely a legitimate business in the U.K.,'' said Tim Evans, a lawyer representing Mr. Carruthers.
 Mr. Carruthers, among the outspoken executives in the industry, has traveled frequently to the United States to meet with investors and media companies, and to debate the merits of online gambling. In April, he took part in a debate on the subject with Representative Leach.
 Catherine L. Hanaway, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri, who brought the indictment against Mr. Carruthers, said the fact that the activity was legal in Britain and Costa Rica, where BetOnSports has major operations, ''does not entitle them to do business in the United States.''
 Asked if Mr. Carruthers's British citizenship created a problem for the prosecutors, Ms. Hanaway said, ''thus far, no.''
 Mr. Evans said his client faced up to 20 years if convicted of conspiring to operate an illegal gambling operation.
 Lawrence Walters, a lawyer who specializes in Internet gambling law, said prosecutors faced serious jurisdictional questions. One central question is whether any illegal activity is taking place on American soil; the bettors, he said, are not breaking the law, because placing a wager is legal.
 Further, he said, there are legal questions about whether prosecutors can establish that offshore casinos have met the test for ''minimum contact'' in the United States, a standard needed for prosecutors to have jurisdiction.
 ''The government has to show that BetOnSports has sufficient ties and contacts with the U.S.,'' he said. ''That's an open question -- they have no offices or representatives here.''
 Many online gambling companies based outside Britain list on the London Stock Exchange because the British government made offshore gambling companies legal as part of a sweeping Gambling Act passed in 2005. The government's intent is to regulate the industry and stop gambling proceeds from going to criminal interests. 
 The investors in the companies have included some of America's largest investment houses, among them Goldman Sachs and the FMR Corporation, parent of Fidelity Investments, which bought shares for some of its mutual funds. Share prices of those funds plummeted after the arrest of Mr. Carruthers, but have recovered somewhat in recent trading.
 The issue has fueled a political fire in Britain, where the United States recently extradited several white-collar suspects in an effort to prosecute them for actions that Britain did not consider illegal, or that British courts chose not to prosecute. 
 Opponents say that United States prosecutors are reaching outside their boundaries and the opponents are lobbying the British government to protect its own citizens.
 But Mr. Walters said prosecutors might be able to mitigate the jurisdictional challenges because they also brought charges against BetOnSports' founder, Gary Kaplan, and several of his relatives, who worked for the company and are American citizens. 
 The government could argue that the company has a fundamentally American origin and continuing ties, he said.
 The case could dictate how much breadth and power prosecutors have to enforce gambling laws. It ''could be a chance to clear up the gray area that's always existed'' as to the legality of offshore casinos, said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for BetOnSports. 
 Prosecutors argue that the Wire Act of 1961 prohibits not just Internet sports betting but also casino games, including online poker. Some industry executives, legal experts and analysts, even those without a vested interest, say it is not clear that the Wire Act was intended to cover those casino games.
 The legislation approved by the House would make it explicit that the wire act covers these games. It also seeks to create a new enforcement mechanism by criminalizing the processing of payments for Internet gambling. It would prohibit banks, credit card companies and online payment processors, like PayPal, from transacting such business.
 ''For the first time, we have a methodology that has enforcement clout,'' Mr. Leach said. ''This legislation has a lot of teeth.''
 Yet this is not the first effort to cut off payment methods. In November 2001, many major banks that issue credit cards began voluntarily refusing to process credit card payments for gambling. That gave rise to new overseas payment processors, like Neteller and FirePay, in which customers can deposit money to be forwarded to offshore casinos. 
 Having new overseas processors can spring up does present a problem, Mr. Leach said. But if the bill becomes law, it would also prohibit American financial institutions from transferring money to overseas payment processors known to do a lot of business with casinos. In turn, it could make people work harder to place bets.
 ''It could quite effectively reduce impulse betting,'' Mr. Leach said. ''It might be a slightly less-effective barrier to some of the poker kinds of games. I aspire to total curtailment. But I cannot guarantee that will occur.''

HEADLINE: Blight, Like Beauty, Can Be in the Eye Of the Beholder

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
Of all the real estate jargon, bureaucratic buzzwords and plain old insults exchanged over the proposed Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn, no term has evoked quite such unruly passion as ''blighted.''
 During the last two years, the word has hung like a scythe over the 22-acre site, most of it on the northern edge of the Prospect Heights neighborhood, where the developer, Forest City Ratner Companies, hopes to build its $4.2 billion project.
For the developer, it is a fitting description of the abandoned auto-repair shops, collapsing brownstones and gloomy vacant lots that blemish the area, and of the eight-acre railyards that slice through the neighborhood just south of Atlantic Avenue. For many of the several hundred people who still live there, ''blighted'' is a term of abuse, one that ignores the sleek, recently renovated buildings on Pacific and Dean Streets, the bustling neighborhood bar, and other signs of revival. Even some supporters of the project, like Assemblyman Roger L. Green, disagree with the description.
 ''That neighborhood is not blighted,'' Mr. Green, whose district includes the Atlantic Yards site, said at a hearing last year. ''I repeat, for the record, that neighborhood is not blighted.'' 
 The long-running blight debate took a major turn in favor of Forest City Ratner last week, when the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's lead economic agency, formally declared the project site blighted. It was the first step in a process that could eventually allow Forest City to acquire, through eminent domain, the few remaining parcels that the company has not been able to acquire privately over the last few years.
 But for all the freight the word carries around Prospect Heights these days, ''blighted'' is a word with no fixed definition, legal or colloquial.
 It is not unlike Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart's famous remark about pornography -- ''I know it when I see it'' -- said Joseph M. Ryan, a land-use lawyer who has consulted for the development corporation before but has no involvement with the Atlantic Yards project. ''Usually it's a high crime rate, debilitated buildings. Often you'll have pollution, or inadequate usage of land.''
 Under past court rulings, for example, an area can be declared blighted even if particular parcels within it are not. Similarly, a given plot of land can be declared ''underutilized'' if what is built there is smaller or shorter than zoning laws would otherwise allow, even if the building in question is not dilapidated. Moreover, it is largely up to government officials to decide how prevalent a condition must be -- how much crime, for instance -- in order to label an area as blighted. 
 ''There are no hard and fast rules regarding blight,'' said Jessica Copen, a spokeswoman for the development corporation. ''There's a large area of subjectivity in evaluating the indicia of blight.''
 Such rules as there are have been carved out by state and federal courts over the years. But because condemnation itself is essentially a legislative power rather than a judicial one, courts have tended to grant government officials wide latitude to make findings of blight.
 ''Reasonable people could differ as to whether something is overcrowded or has too much crime or too many sanitary problems or is losing jobs,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''But the courts will defer to the agency if they have a reasonable and rational basis for condemnation.'' 
 Hence the 381-page blight study issued by the development corporation last week. Conducted by AKRF Inc., a consulting firm with long experience in land use and environmental engineering, the study amounts to a painstakingly detailed walking tour of the Atlantic Yards' potential home. Hardly a crack in the sidewalk escapes notice in the study, which declared the project site replete with ''structurally unsound buildings, debris-filled vacant lots, environmental concerns, high crime rates and underutilization.''
 Fifty-one out of 73 parcels on the 22-acre site ''exhibit one or more blight characteristics,'' the study found, including buildings that are at least 50 percent vacant or are built to 60 percent or less of their allowable density. The study also noted that, before Forest City came along, 76 parties controlled the land making up the site. Such fragmented ownership, real estate developers say, is what makes large-scale private urban development difficult without government intervention.
 The study also dwells in some detail on the eight-acre railyards that make up about one-third of the site, and which also fall within an urban renewal zone the city established along Atlantic Avenue in the late 1960's. The railyards hindered hoped-for development in the renewal zone for decades, the study notes, and continue to do so on those blocks to the south and west of the yards where the project would be. 
 Critics have long accused the development corporation of favoring developers. Opponents of Atlantic Yards, say that in that project, the corporation is essentially using the railyards, which constitute blight almost by definition, as a cudgel to obtain additional land through eminent domain or the threat of it.
 ''No one is arguing that the railyards should not be developed. That's a pretty commonly agreed-upon point,'' said Marshall Brown, an architect who helped draft the beginnings of an alternative plan for the railyards that would not have required eminent domain. ''It just doesn't make sense that the railyards themselves cannot be developed alone.'' 
 The study also included a look at crime in the area. Because the Police Department does not collect crime statistics block by block, the study could measure only indirectly whether the site has more crime than the area surrounding it. AKRF examined three police ''sectors'' in Brooklyn, each of which overlaps parts of the site but extend well beyond it. The study compared the combined crime rates in those three sectors with the combined crime rates for their respective police precincts. Finding the precinct numbers lower, the study declares that ''residents and businesses on the project site are more susceptible to crime'' than those in surrounding neighborhoods.
 Overall crime in the three precincts, however, decreased slightly between 2004 and 2005.
 ''They make the footprint sound like it's a Lower East Side slum,'' said Daniel Goldstein, the spokesman for Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, an umbrella organization for groups opposed to the project.
 The building that Mr. Goldstein lives in on Pacific Street is now owned by Forest City and is one of two within the footprint of the project that were redeveloped into luxury condos during the past several years. (Mr. Goldstein moved into his apartment shortly before the project was announced in 2003.) 
 Another building within the project footprint, an old bakery, was widely considered ripe for conversion by its owner, the real estate developer Shaya Boymelgreen. He has since sold it to Forest City, which now owns almost all the property it needs for the project. Company officials say they have paid high premiums on that land to minimize the need for eminent domain.
 The blight study began last summer, after Forest City, the development partner of The New York Times Company in building its new headquarters on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, had already bought up large parcels of land for the project. Some critics have questioned whether Forest City's acquisitions -- and the implicit threat of eminent domain since the project was announced in late 2003 -- deterred development.
 ''How much of the blighted conditions were the result of the cloud of eminent domain hanging over that property, and of Ratner's successful efforts to purchase property there?'' asked Tom Angotti, a professor of urban affairs and planning at Hunter College, who studied the site with his graduate students this year. ''We call it 'planner's blight.' You create the cloud of eminent domain, you force people to sell, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.'' 
 Residents also point to several Dean Street buildings just outside the project site, and Prospect Heights' generally strong residential real estate market, to argue that much of the site might have developed on its own.
 Deborah Wetzel, a spokeswoman for the state development corporation, stood by the study's findings. ''Irrespective of the recent property acquisitions by Forest City,'' Ms. Wetzel said, ''we believe it highly unlikely that the blighted conditions currently present will be removed without action by the public sector.''

HEADLINE: As the Price of Oil Soars, So Does Its Power to Shape Politics From Washington to Beijing 

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24 

 BODY:
As violence spreads in the Middle East, the Bush administration is grappling with an unwanted side effect of its policies: higher oil prices caused by fears of a disruption in global oil supplies. 
 While the administration seeks to confront Iran, give Israel more time to defeat Hezbollah, and secure stability in Iraq, higher oil prices reduce its maneuvering room overseas and frustrate American consumers at home.
Oil prices reached $78 a barrel last week before dropping back to $75. Although there are many reasons for the surge in prices, oil analysts agree that one is a ''fear factor'' of potential shortages. 
 Worries that the unabated conflict in Lebanon could draw in Syria, or Iran, which in turn could threaten the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf, have compounded those jitters, as has the Bush administration's confrontation with Iran over its suspected nuclear weapons program. 
 But just as international politics are complicating the oil market, the oil market is complicating diplomacy as it reshapes the global balance of power. 
 Some analysts think Iran is now debating internally whether to cut off its oil exports if it is threatened, either as a result of the Lebanon conflict or over its nuclear ambitions. Iran has sent contradictory signals, with a key nuclear negotiator, Javad Vaeedi, saying in March that Iran would consider such a move, only to have Iran's oil minister say later the same day it would not. 
 Any step by Iran to cut off its own oil revenues would be so hard politically for the government in Tehran that many experts say it would not be tempted to go down that road. 
 But even a temporary shut-off would be a huge psychological blow to the global market, and Iranian leaders may calculate that there would be an advantage in the economic damage to Europe and the United States.
 For months, the United States has sought to tighten the noose around Iran by getting the United Nations Security Council to threaten sanctions over its suspected nuclear weapons program. Iran says its nuclear program is civilian in nature.
 Russia, China and some European leaders, fearful that Iran could follow through on its threat to turn off the oil spigot in reply, even if temporarily, have resisted. 
 The difficulty of getting other countries to cooperate aside, even American officials acknowledge that any sanctions would exclude Iran's energy sector. 
 Given Iran's dependence on oil exports for income that supports a broad range of subsidies for food, fuel and other necessities for its people, excluding energy from any sanctions plan raises real questions about how effective such a step would be. 
 American officials acknowledge that oil complicates American diplomacy but insist that they will not alter basic policies, especially on Iran, which the West accuses of supporting groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. 
 ''The fact that Iran has oil power has not made one whit of difference in our determination to stop them from acquiring nuclear weapons,'' said R. Nicholas Burns, under secretary of state for political affairs. ''I don't think it has with our allies, either. We are not going to allow Iran's supposed oil power to exert any leverage over us.''
 But Iran's ability to rebuff the West on these matters has only increased as oil prices have risen from about $27 a barrel at the start of the Iraq war, to $65 a barrel in the spring as tensions rose over Iran's nuclear program, to $75 on Monday as the conflict continued in Lebanon.
 Indeed, according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates, each $5 increase in oil prices translates into $85 million a week for Iran's bank account, emboldening its leaders and making whatever aid it supplies to Hezbollah easier to finance even as the crisis threatens to spread.
 ''Oil has been embedded in our diplomacy for decades,'' said Stuart E. Eizenstat, who was an aide to President Jimmy Carter and undersecretary of state for economics under President Bill Clinton. ''It's always given producing countries leverage, but now that leverage is magnified more than ever before.''
 Oil has also always had ramifications for the United States' domestic politics. Iran's new leverage comes not just from its rising oil revenues but also because the price of gasoline at the pump is a potentially damaging liability for the Bush administration, as it has been for other American presidents.
 At least since 1973, the year of the last full-scale war between Israel and its neighbors and the imposition of an OPEC oil embargo, oil has occupied a central space in the American political psyche. Six years after the oil shock came the overthrow of the shah of Iran, the doubling of oil prices and gas lines at home that helped hustle President Carter from office. 
 Today the Bush administration faces rising criticism from hard-liners that its Iran policy is not stiff enough. But if the diplomatic course is challenging, the military options may be more treacherous and, analysts say, would almost certainly drive the price of oil even higher. 
 That possibility has not stopped conservatives like William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, who was a major booster of the decision to wage war on Iraq, from calling for an airstrike on Iran's suspected nuclear weapons facilities. 
 Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a speech this year, ''No one who is honestly assessing the decline of American leverage around the world due to our energy dependence can fail to see that energy is the albatross of U.S. national security.'' 
 Indeed, the extraordinary power of oil to transform world politics today extends far beyond Iran, or even the Middle East. 
 In April, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice complained that the hunt for oil and gas was ''distorting international politics in a very major way.'' Now that comment is turning out to be both prophecy and understatement.
 New oil money has given not only Iran but also Russia more resources to resist Western pressure. As he played host to the Group of 8 summit meeting in St. Petersburg last week, President Vladimir V. Putin was able to swat away criticism from President Bush about Russian domestic and foreign policies. 
 He boasted, in fact, that Russia's oil, natural gas and nuclear energy capacities made it the biggest energy player in the world.
 Months before the summit meeting, Russia was hoping to use the final communique to endorse its approach on energy, in which the state basically controls the oil sector. The Bush administration joined with Europe to block such an endorsement, American officials say.
 But energy remains a major American irritant with Russia and by extension China.
 The Bush administration has stepped up its efforts to support pipelines that would carry oil and natural gas to the West, bypassing Russian territory. 
 Russia, in turn, has pressured Central Asian countries to oppose American energy projects and the use of the area for military bases.
 To do that, Russia has joined with China to mobilize a five-year-old group called the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, whose members include several Central Asian countries. The Defense Department is even worried that the group could move from its focus on energy to become a military alliance to rival NATO.
 Many American analysts say energy issues are driving Russia and China into each other's arms politically, and that if anything American policies are accelerating the trend.
 Meanwhile, the new oil politics are rearranging the international playing board, not simply giving Iran latitude in the Middle East but allowing Venezuela, for another example, to try to blunt Washington's influence in Latin America. 
 ''We are seeing a radical change in how countries like Russia, Iran and Venezuela on the supply side, and China and India on the demand side, bring the world marketplace to bear on foreign policy,'' said Carlos Pascual, a former top aide to Ms. Rice and now foreign policy studies director at the Brookings Institution.
 ''I don't think any of us have done a terribly good job of thinking through how far behind the eight ball we are on these issues,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Oregon's Property Rights Law Kicks In, Easing Rigid Rules

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: BEND, Ore. 

 BODY:
With 50,000 acres of lakes, lava flows and otherworldly rock features that offer a peek into central Oregon's geologic tumult, the Newberry National Volcanic Monument is one of the more theatrical of the nation's protected natural wonders. 
 In the eyes of James R. Miller, who owns a doughnut hole of private land inside the monument, all that volcanic energy just below the surface makes the big caldera a perfect place for a pumice mine and power plant. 
And under a landmark property rights law enacted by Oregon voters two years ago, Mr. Miller now says the government must allow him to go ahead with his development or pay him $203 million in compensation.
 The claim may be the biggest yet among hundreds of filings by Oregon property owners since voters approved Measure 37, the property rights proposal, in 2004. The measure says that when land rules reduce the value of property, the government must compensate the owner or waive the regulations. 
 Voter approval of Measure 37 was a shot heard around the property rights world. Several states, including neighboring Idaho and Washington, now have similar measures on their ballots this fall. 
 The Oregon law could remake the face of the state, where some of the most restrictive land-use rules in the nation are designed to keep forest and farm areas intact and cities compact. After a bumpy ride through the courts, backers of the measure were handed a clear victory this year.
 Government officials say the measure has essentially knocked out ''the Oregon way,'' the distinct set of rules that have long angered many property owners but delighted the urban-planning community. It has made for chaos at the county level, many officials say, by taking away local government's ability to plan for development in an orderly fashion.
 In some suburban neighborhoods, residents say property claims would allow gravel pits, industrial plants and used-car lots to be built next to their parks and homes. And some farmers say Measure 37 threatens Oregon's rural economy.
 ''One thing is clear,'' Sheila A. Martin, a professor of urban planning at Portland State University, wrote earlier this year in a report on the initiative, ''Measure 37 has disabled the tools used over four decades to prevent sprawl and preserve agriculture and forest land in Oregon.''
 Since the measure was approved, Oregon property owners had filed 2,755 claims covering 150,455 acres, according to the university's Institute of Portland Metropolitan Studies, which is tracking the measure's impact. If all the claims were paid, state officials say, it could amount to more than $3 billion in compensation. But not a single claim has been paid, the institute reported.
 Instead of paying property owners, local government agencies have routinely chosen to waive the regulations, clearing the way for numerous developments in rural areas.
 ''They want to put all these five-acre lots and build houses right in the middle of our valley,'' said Bill Rynearson, a farmer who lives near La Grande, in northeast Oregon. He has been fighting a developer's request to build a housing subdivision on 1,750 acres.
 But supporters of the measure, which was approved by 61 percent of voters, say that the worst fears of opponents have not been realized, and that the law simply gives Oregon property owners the right to basic compensation when regulations harm the value of their land. 
 ''This has turned out to be the most overhyped measure in the history of Oregon,'' said David Hunnicutt, president of Oregonians in Action, which sponsored the initiative.
 The number of claims was inflated, Mr. Hunnicutt said, because a single claim against both the state and county was counted by the Portland Institute as two. The real number is closer to 1,500, he said.
 The imperious nature of Oregon's slow-growth regulations brought on a backlash, Mr. Hunnicutt said, adding that voters fully understood the implications of countering those rules. ''The mess created by Oregon's land-use laws led to the passage of this measure,'' he said.
 While other Oregon groups have reacted with outrage to the request to drill and mine inside the Newberry national monument, Mr. Hunnicutt defended the landowner's demands and said there were remedies that could keep the scenery intact.
 The active volcano was made a national monument in 1990. Deschutes County, which regulates property in the surrounding area, designated Mr. Miller's property as open space in 1992, limiting development.
 A resident of Portland, Mr. Miller said he had had an ownership stake in 157 acres just south of here since 1969. ''You could get a really good-sized geothermal plant in there,'' he said, ''and the only thing you'd see from afar is a big cooling tower with a nice little plume.'' 
 Across Oregon, which has been accustomed to the praise of out-of-state groups that hold the state up as model for how to grow without destroying the state's special features, the unraveling of the political consensus on property compensation is the subject of much soul-searching. 
 Oregon has protected more farmland than any other state, environmental leaders say, but it has lost the support of many farmers for those regulations.
 ''We've learned something,'' said Elon Hasson, of 1,000 Friends of Oregon, an active antisprawl group. ''It's clear that some people have been hurt by the laws, and there needs to be a way to deal with that.''
 Polls taken since Measure 37 was approved show consistent support for Oregon land-use regulations. But they also show that people want protection for private property and compensation for government actions.
 ''Oregonians are saying they want it all,'' said David Bragdon, president of the Metro Council, which oversees many government functions in the Portland metro area. ''They want to be able to eat chocolate cake three times a day and never get fat.''

HEADLINE: Syria, Traditional Refuge for Displaced Arabs, Is Strained by 120,000 More

BYLINE: By KATHERINE ZOEPF

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, July 24 

 BODY:
With the number of Lebanese refugees who have crossed into Syria now estimated at more than 120,000 and increasing by the day, many Syrians are privately expressing concern about the potential economic effects on their country. While wealthier and better-connected Lebanese are staying in hotels or with relatives, and planning to travel on to other countries, tens of thousands are staying with volunteer hosts or finding floor space in schools or mosques. They face an increasingly uncertain future. 
 Though Syrian officials are publicly pledging solidarity with ''the Lebanese national resistance,'' as the Lebanese militia Hezbollah is called in the state-run media, and vowing to aid the Lebanese refugees for as long as the fighting in Lebanon continues, for many Syrians the wave of Lebanese is a new and unexpected burden. 
Syria, a country of 19 million, is already home to about 420,000 Palestinian refugees, according to the United Nations. Since the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, Syria has also taken in about a million Iraqi refugees, according to Syrian government figures. 
 ''Enough now!'' said one young Syrian woman, a teacher, who lives in the predominantly Christian neighborhood of Bab Touma and would not give her name because of the political delicacy of the Lebanese issue. ''Have you seen the price of real estate these days, or the price of food? Syria can't take any more refugees.'' 
 It is not geography alone that makes Syria a natural destination. Baathist-led Syria, the last bastion of pan-Arabism in the Middle East, allows the citizens of any Arab country to enter without visas, and even to settle here permanently. That right is enshrined in the Syrian Constitution, and according to Faisal Kalthoum, a constitutional law professor and a member of the Baath Party's central committee, Syrian officials even avoid the word ''refugee,'' preferring to talk about the Lebanese as fellow members of a greater Arab nation. 
 ''When the Syrian Constitution was laid down in 1973, the first article stated that Syria is part of the Arab nation,'' Mr. Kalthoum said. ''From this constitutional background, all Arabs have the right to enter Syria without a visa. Any Arab may enter Syria with the Constitution behind him. He is free to own property, to be educated here, and he has the same rights to social and health services as any Syrian.''
 Tawfik Walid Kamle, 30, a Palestinian taxi driver who was born in Kuwait, said that during the Persian Gulf war of 1991, his family tried to settle in several different countries. 
 ''Never anybody helped us except for Syria,'' Mr. Kamle said, with emotion. ''No other country would take the Palestinians of Kuwait, but here they help all the Arab people. Now I have a house, a car and I have work. The Syrian government will do the same now for the Lebanese people.''
 Though Syria's pan-Arab stance is undoubtedly appreciated by the hundreds of thousands who have made new homes here, many Syrians say tensions are rising. Refugees are driving up the costs of housing and food to near-unbearable levels for many Syrians, and there is a popular perception that they are contributing to a rising crime rate. 
 On June 23, riots broke out in Jaramana, a southern suburb of Damascus that is home to about 50,000 Iraqi refugees, after the killing of a young Syrian man. Although no one has been convicted yet, many local Syrians say they are convinced that an Iraqi refugee was to blame.
 In the riots, Syrian mobs attacked Iraqi shops and houses, and hundreds of Iraqi-owned cars were burned. The violence is being widely discussed here as a sign that Syria is filled to the bursting point and that its citizens are fed up.
 Maher, a Syrian Druse resident of Jaramana who would not give his last name, said that for the moment, most Syrians still distinguished between the Lebanese, who were viewed as being given temporary shelter in a time of crisis, and the Iraqis and Palestinians, who had become a longer-term burden. 
 ''As for the Lebanese refugees, I feel that this is a transitional stage for them, but the Iraqis have been here for more than three years now,'' Maher said. ''Like any state, Syria has limited economic resources, and so any large influx of refugees will create problems.''
 But Joshua Landis, an expert on Syrian history at the University of Oklahoma, said he expected Syria to remain the last refuge for citizens of other Arab countries. 
 ''In the Middle East, the nation-state is still in a period of gestation,'' Mr. Landis said in a telephone interview. ''Nation-states here are these fragile structures, and they need tender loving care.
 ''What the U.S. and its idea of nation-building have done is to overburden this delicate process and to cause these delicate states to collapse. We've been seeing this in Iraq, in Palestine, and now in Lebanon. And so the refugees are all ending up in Syria, the one state in the neighborhood that hasn't failed.''

HEADLINE: Drain America First 

 BODY:
Congress's default response to the nation's manifest energy problems is to increase supply, while doing nothing to reduce demand. Earlier this year, the House rebuffed a modest effort to increase fuel economy standards while approving a bill whose main purpose is to end a long-standing federal moratorium on drilling for oil and gas on the Outer Continental Shelf. In similar spirit, the Senate today will take up a bill to open eight million more acres of the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas drilling. 
 The Senate measure is narrower and less mischievous than the House bill. Yet it, too, is aimed exclusively at increasing production.
This is mind-boggling. The bill's stated purpose is to reduce fuel prices. But while the gulf may hold enough natural gas to affect the price of that commodity, the same cannot be said of oil. No matter where it looks, a country that consumes one-quarter of the world's oil supply while holding only 3 percent of the reserves will never be able to drill its way to lower oil prices, much less oil independence.
 A small bipartisan group of senators -- led by Richard Lugar, a Republican, and Jeff Bingaman and Barack Obama, both Democrats -- will try to correct the bill's bias toward production by adding an amendment that would improve fuel efficiency for cars and light trucks.
 The amendment has been carefully drawn to satisfy objections from the automakers and thus end the sterile impasse over fuel standards. But so great is Congress's appetite for the quick fix that neither this nor any other amendment that seeks a more rational approach is likely to see the light of day. The betting now is that Senate leaders will try every trick in the book to ensure the bill's unobstructed passage.
 This may be good parliamentary strategy. But it will produce a terribly one-sided energy policy.

HEADLINE: Testing for Mad Cow

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''U.S Reduces Testing for Mad Cow Disease, Citing Few Infections'' (news article, July 21): 
 How do you spell complacency?
The Agriculture Department's decision is a mistake. We know the economic consequences of one diseased animal detected in the food supply, but we do not know its consequences on human health.
 If the new lower testing rate had been in place in the last two years, would it have caused the department to miss the two infected animals that were found? 
 One major result of vigorous testing is better behavior by those who raise and sell beef. The new decision values industry preferences over the public's well-being.

HEADLINE: Raise Wages, Not Walls

BYLINE: By Michael S. Dukakis and Daniel J. B. Mitchell. 
Michael S. Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts from 1975 to 1979 and from 1983 to 1991, is a professor of political science at Northeastern University. Daniel J. B. Mitchell is a professor of management and public policy at the University of California at Los Angeles.

 BODY:
THERE are two approaches to illegal immigration currently being debated in Congress. One, supported by the House, emphasizes border control and law enforcement, including a wall along the Mexican border and increased border patrols. The other, which is supported by the Bush administration and has been passed by the Senate, relies on employers to police the workplace. Both proposals have serious flaws. 
 As opponents of the House plan have rightly pointed out, walls rarely work; illegal immigrants will get around them one way or another. Unless we erect something akin to the Berlin Wall, which would cost billions to build and police, a barrier on the border would be monitored by largely symbolic patrols and easily evaded. 
The Senate approach is more realistic but it, too, has problems. It creates a temporary worker program but requires employers first to attempt to recruit American workers to fill job openings. It allows for more border fencing, but makes no effort to disguise the basic futility of the enterprise. Instead, it calls on employers to enforce immigration laws in the workplace, a plan that can only succeed through the creation and distribution of a costly national identification card. 
 A national ID card raises serious questions about civil liberties, but they are not the sole concern. The cost estimates for producing and distributing a counterfeit-proof card for the roughly 150 million people currently in the labor force -- and the millions more who will seek work in the near future -- extend into the billions of dollars. Employers would have to verify the identity of every American worker, otherwise the program would be as unreliable as the one in place now. Anyone erroneously denied a card in this bureaucratic labyrinth would be unemployable. 
 There is a simpler alternative. If we are really serious about turning back the tide of illegal immigration, we should start by raising the minimum wage from $5.15 per hour to something closer to $8. The Massachusetts legislature recently voted to raise the state minimum to $8 and California may soon set its minimum even higher. Once the minimum wage has been significantly increased, we can begin vigorously enforcing the wage law and other basic labor standards. 
 Millions of illegal immigrants work for minimum and even sub-minimum wages in workplaces that don't come close to meeting health and safety standards. It is nonsense to say, as President Bush did recently, that these jobs are filled by illegal immigrants because Americans won't do them. Before we had mass illegal immigration in this country, hotel beds were made, office floors were cleaned, restaurant dishes were washed and crops were picked -- by Americans. 
 Americans will work at jobs that are risky, dirty or unpleasant so long as they provide decent wages and working conditions, especially if employers also provide health insurance. Plenty of Americans now work in such jobs, from mining coal to picking up garbage. The difference is they are paid a decent wage and provided benefits for their labor. 
 However, Americans won't work for peanuts, and these days the national minimum wage is less than peanuts. For full-time work, it doesn't even come close to the poverty line for an individual, let alone provide a family with a living wage. It hasn't been raised since 1997 and isn't enforced even at its currently ridiculous level.
 Yet enforcing the minimum wage doesn't require walling off a porous border or trying to distinguish yesterday's illegal immigrant from tomorrow's ''guest worker.'' All it takes is a willingness by the federal government to inspect workplaces to determine which employers obey the law.
 Curiously, most members of Congress who take a hard line on immigration also strongly oppose increasing the minimum wage, claiming it will hurt businesses and reduce jobs. For some reason, they don't seem eager to acknowledge that many of the jobs they claim to hold dear are held by the same illegal immigrants they are trying to deport. 
 But if we want to reduce illegal immigration, it makes sense to reduce the abundance of extremely low-paying jobs that fuels it. If we raise the minimum wage, it's possible some low-end jobs may be lost; but more Americans would also be willing to work in such jobs, thereby denying them to people who aren't supposed to be here in the first place. And tough enforcement of wage rules would curtail the growth of an underground economy in which both illegal immigration and employer abuses thrive. 
 Raising the minimum wage and increasing enforcement would prove far more effective and less costly than either proposal currently under consideration in Congress. If Congress would only remove its blinders about the minimum wage, it may see a plan to deal effectively with illegal immigration, too.

HEADLINE: Strong Earnings and a Big Buyout Turn Investors Bullish

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
The stock market's recent hypersensitivity to global and economic developments paid off yesterday as a batch of positive economic news put investors in a buying mood.
 The announcement of the largest leveraged corporate buyout in history sent stocks on a rally early in the day. That rally widened as two pharmaceutical giants, Merck and Schering-Plough, reported unexpectedly strong second-quarter earnings.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average both gained 1.7 percent. The Dow's 183-point gain propelled it back above the 11,000 mark, to 11,051. The Nasdaq rose 2 percent, to 2,062. 
 ''You had a combination of a couple of fundamental bullish developments,'' said Todd Salamone, senior vice president for research at Schaffer's Investment Research. ''And more importantly, it comes at a time when we're seeing a lot of pessimism in the market. You can have stronger-than-expected reactions from the overall market when people are so pessimistic.''
 Merck, which closed up 4.3 percent, to $38.95, said that its second-quarter profit doubled compared with the year-ago quarter; Schering-Plough swung from a loss a year ago to a profit in the quarter and closed up 5.7 percent, to $20.55. 
 Both companies beat Wall Street's expectations. 
 Merger news also buoyed the market. HCA, the nation's largest operator of for-profit hospitals, said yesterday that it would sell itself to a group of private investors in a deal valued at $33 billion. In addition, ATI Technologies, a computer chip maker, said it would be acquired by Advanced Micro Devices in a $5.4 billion deal. 
 These developments were a welcome turn of events for investors, who have been left with little good news lately.
 Turmoil in the Middle East, record oil prices and some lackluster corporate earnings had been depressing stocks over the last two weeks. Analysts said part of yesterday's upturn could be explained as a bounce back from the recent sell-off. 
 ''On Friday, I think you saw investors saying they didn't want to hold over the weekend,'' said David Bianco, chief United States equity strategist for UBS. ''On Monday, things didn't deteriorate in the Middle East too much. And with the earnings coming in strongly as well, there's no reason not to have the market rebound.''
 Bonds remained flat yesterday, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note keeping steady at 5.04 percent. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, fell 1/32, to 10020/32.
 Yesterday's upswing in the stock market was also a continuation of the market gyrations of the last several months. Last week alone, after a 212-point gain on Wednesday, the Dow fell a combined 143 points on Thursday and Friday. The S.& P. 500 had similar swings.
 ''We've had these crosscurrents of good news, bad news,'' Mr. Salamone said. ''The result is these volatile advances, volatile declines and very little net movement.''
 Last week, the S.& P., the Dow and the Nasdaq finished the week not far from where they began. 
 This week, more earnings from corporate giants like AT&T, General Motors and Exxon Mobil combined with several major economic reports could send the stock market on another wild ride. 
 With investors uneasy over whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again when it meets next month, the government's economic reports have become a reason for the market to soar or dive. Because reports indicating weaker economic growth and lower inflation could give the Fed a reason to stop raising rates, those reports tend to send the market up. Reports showing continued rapid growth do the opposite. 
 ''Macro events are what's dominating the market's direction right now,'' said Henry McVey, chief United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. ''It's not until the Fed is out of the picture that the macro takes a back seat to the micro.''
 This week, investors will be closely watching reports on home sales and second-quarter gross domestic product figures. 
 ''The world is strange right now,'' Mr. Bianco said. ''Slowing economic news is good news.''

HEADLINE: From Planning to Warfare to Occupation, How Iraq Went Wrong

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:

Fiasco
The American Military Adventure In Iraq
By Thomas E. Ricks
482 pages. The Penguin Press. $27.95.
 The title of this devastating new book about the American war in Iraq says it all: ''Fiasco.'' That is the judgment that Thomas E. Ricks, senior Pentagon correspondent for The Washington Post, passes on the Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq and its management of the war and the occupation. And he serves up his portrait of that war as a misguided exercise in hubris, incompetence and folly with a wealth of detail and evidence that is both staggeringly vivid and persuasive. 
 By virtue of the author's wealth of sources within the American military and the book's comprehensive timeline (beginning with the administration's inflammatory statements about Saddam Hussein in the wake of 9/11, through the invasion and occupation, to the escalating religious and ethnic strife that afflicts the country today), ''Fiasco'' is absolutely essential reading for anyone interested in understanding how the United States came to go to war in Iraq, how a bungled occupation fed a ballooning insurgency and how these events will affect the future of the American military. Though other books have depicted aspects of the Iraq war in more intimate and harrowing detail, though other books have broken more news about aspects of the war, this volume gives the reader a lucid, tough-minded overview of this tragic enterprise that stands apart from earlier assessments in terms of simple coherence and scope.
''President George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq in 2003 ultimately may come to be seen as one of the most profligate actions in the history of American foreign policy,'' Mr. Ricks writes. ''The consequences of his choice won't be clear for decades, but it already is abundantly apparent in mid-2006 that the U.S. government went to war in Iraq with scant solid international support and on the basis of incorrect information -- about weapons of mass destruction and a supposed nexus between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda's terrorism -- and then occupied the country negligently. Thousands of U.S. troops and an untold number of Iraqis have died. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent, many of them squandered. Democracy may yet come to Iraq and the region, but so too may civil war or a regional conflagration, which in turn could lead to spiraling oil prices and a global economic shock.'' 
 Much of the material dealing with the time just before the war has been chronicled in earlier books (not to mention an outpouring of newspaper and magazine articles), but Mr. Ricks provides a succinct narrative that emphasizes how this period ''laid the shaky foundation for the derelict occupation that followed.'' He reminds us that when it came to the threat posed by Mr. Hussein, the administration consistently emphasized ''worst-case scenarios'' even as it was '' 'best-casing' the subsequent cost and difficulty of occupying the country.'' And he shows how this blinkered outlook resulted in a failure to plan for the realities of the occupation and a failure to allocate sufficient manpower and resources.
 Mr. Ricks's narrative is based on hundreds of interviews and more than 37,000 pages of documents, and many of the book's most scorching assessments of the White House and Pentagon's conduct of the war come from members of the uniformed military and official military reports. 
 An after-action review from the Third Infantry Division underscores the Pentagon's paucity of postwar planning, stating that ''there was no guidance for restoring order in Baghdad, creating an interim government, hiring government and essential services employees, and ensuring that the judicial system was operational.'' And an end-of-tour report by a colonel assigned to the Coalition Provisional Authority memorably summarized his office's work as ''pasting feathers together, hoping for a duck.''
 Mr. Ricks writes in these pages as both a reporter and an analyst, and many of his findings amplify observations made by other journalists and former insiders in earlier books: namely that the Bush White House routinely ignored the advice of experts (be they military, diplomatic or Middle East experts); that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's determination to conduct the war with a light, fast force had crippling consequences for the American military's ability to restore law and order in post-invasion Iraq; and that infighting between the State and Defense Departments, between civilians at the Pentagon and the uniformed military, and between the military and the Coalition Provisional Authority severely hampered the making and execution of United States policy.
 ''Fiasco'' does not possess the dramatic combat details of ''Cobra II'' by Michael R. Gordon (chief military correspondent for The New York Times) and Bernard E. Trainor (a retired Marine Corps lieutenant general and former military correspondent for The Times), but unlike that book, which basically ends in the summer of 2003, it goes on to chronicle America's flailing efforts to contain a metastasizing insurgency over the next three years.
 Mr. Ricks argues that the invasion of Iraq ''was based on perhaps the worst war plan in American history,'' an incomplete plan that ''confused removing Iraq's regime with the far more difficult task of changing the entire country.'' The result of going in with too few troops and no larger strategic plan, he says, was ''that the U.S. effort resembled a banana republic coup d'etat more than a full-scale war plan that reflected the ambition of a great power to alter the politics of a crucial region of the world.''
 This was partly a byproduct of the Pollyannaish optimism of hawks like Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, who slapped down the estimate by the Army's chief of staff, Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, that several hundred thousand soldiers would be required to secure Iraq. And it was partly a byproduct of a conviction shared by Secretary Rumsfeld and Gen. Tommy Franks that speed, in Mr. Ricks's words, ''could be substituted for mass in military operations.''
 Mr. Rumsfeld's stubborn reluctance to acknowledge a growing insurgency and his resistance to making adjustments, Mr. Ricks says, contributed further to the military's problems on the ground. A continuing shortage of troops meant that borders could not be sealed, armament caches could not be secured, and security and basic services could not be restored. As a consequence support for the occupation rapidly dwindled among the Iraqis. 
 To make matters worse, Mr. Ricks adds, the Army seemed to have ''forgotten almost everything it had learned in the Vietnam War about counterinsurgency.'' During 2003 and much of 2004 effective counterinsurgency measures aimed at winning the political support of the Iraqi people were not being employed; instead, an emphasis was put on ''the use of force, on powerful retaliation and on protecting U.S. troops at all costs.'' 
 There were mass roundups of Iraqis (many of them bystanders caught up in the sweeps), and some of those detainees were harshly treated by American troops who had not been ''trained or mentally prepared for the mission'' they faced in postwar Iraq. Mr. Ricks sees the Abu Ghraib scandal not as an anomalous incident but as ''the logical and predictable outcome of a series of panicky decisions made by senior commanders, which in turn had resulted from the divided, troop-poor approach devised months earlier by Secretary Rumsfeld and Gen. Franks.'' 
 Mr. Ricks notes that the Bush administration has tended ''to dismiss critics as 'Monday morning quarterbacks,' '' but he points out that that phrase ''conveniently disregarded the fact that many of the critics had expressed their worries before the war even began.'' His book is replete with warnings from Middle East experts and military veterans (like Gen. Anthony C. Zinni and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf), who presciently cautioned that the invasion and its aftermath would not be as simple or as fast as many in the administration predicted.
 In late 2002, Mr. Ricks reports, 70 national security experts and Mideast scholars met at the National Defense University to discuss the looming war and concluded that occupying Iraq would ''be the most daunting and complex task the U.S. and the international community will have undertaken since the end of World War II.'' The group's emphasis on the importance of ''maintaining a secure environment'' in post-invasion Iraq and its recommendation against a swift dissolution of the Iraqi military would be ignored in the ensuing months.
 ''It isn't clear that a large and persistent insurgency was inevitable,'' Mr. Ricks concludes, adding that ''the U.S. approach, both in occupation policy and military tactics, helped spur the insurgency and made it broader than it might have been.'' Among the crucial post-invasion missteps made by the Bush administration, he suggests, were the decision, after the fall of Baghdad, not to send two additional divisions of troops immediately, which might have helped keep the lid on the insurgency, and the orders issued by the head of the American occupation, L. Paul Bremer III, disbanding the old Iraqi army and banning thousands of Baath Party officials from returning to their government jobs. 
 The failure to contain the insurgency would have dire consequences as the war dragged on. While the occupation of Iraq (which Mr. Wolfowitz had predicted would basically pay for itself through oil revenue) was costing American taxpayers an estimated $5 billion a month in 2004 and 2005, the chaos-ridden country was replacing Afghanistan as a training ground for a new generation of terrorists. Meanwhile, writes Mr. Ricks, the United States Army found itself in a strategic position that ''painfully resembled that of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in the early 1980's.''
 Not only had the war ''stressed the U.S. Army to the breaking point,'' a study published by the Army War College's Strategic Studies Institute declared, but it had also turned out to be ''an unnecessary preventive war of choice'' that ''created a new front in the Middle East for Islamic terrorism and diverted attention and resources away from securing the American homeland'' against further attacks from Al Qaeda. The war ''was not integral'' to the global war on terrorism, the report concluded, but was a costly ''detour from it.''

HEADLINE: Climate Experts Warn of More Coastal Building 

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Ten climate experts who are sharply divided over whether global warming is intensifying hurricanes say that this question, a focus of Congressional hearings, news reports and the recent Al Gore documentary, is a distraction from ''the main hurricane problem facing the United States.'' 
 That problem, the experts said yesterday in a statement, is an ongoing ''lemming-like march to the sea'' in the form of unabated coastal development in vulnerable places, and in the lack of changes in government policies and corporate and individual behavior that are driving the trend.
 Whatever the relationship between hurricanes and climate, experts say, hurricanes are hitting the coasts, and houses should not be built in their path.
 But coasts are attractive places to live, and political pressures on states and Congress tend to result in discounted insurance costs for property in harm's way, the statement said. 
 The scientists added that reimbursement for losses can spur more building in the wrong places. ''Federal disaster policies,'' they said, ''while providing obvious humanitarian benefits, also serve to promote risky behavior in the long run.''
 ''These demographic trends are setting us up for rapidly increasing human and economic losses from hurricane disasters, especially in this era of heightened activity,'' they concluded, stressing that a storm like Hurricane Katrina or worse ''was (and is) inevitable even in a stable climate.''
 The statement was posted yesterday at wind.mit.edu/emanuel/home.html. 
 The scientists, several of whom had publicly debated the hurricane-climate connection in recent months, said they were concerned that the lack of consensus on the climate link could stall actions that could cut vulnerability -- no matter what is influencing hurricane trends. 
 Philip J. Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University who disputes the idea that global warming is linked to stronger storms, said the social and economic trends were completely clear.
 ''There is likely to be an increase in destructiveness from tropical cyclones regardless of whether they are getting more intense or not,'' he said yesterday. ''This is largely due to the increase in coastal population and wealth per capita in hurricane-prone areas.''
 Kerry A. Emanuel, a climatologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, drafted the statement and conducted one of several recent studies asserting that the building energy of hurricanes in recent decades was probably related to human-driven warming of the seas. 
 ''We as a community have said for a long time that this is a big social problem right now,'' Dr. Emanuel said in an interview. ''A lot of us are tired of the climate question being set up as a bigger conflict than it is.''

HEADLINE: Clinton Releases Proposals To Help the Middle Class

BYLINE: By ANNE E. KORNBLUT

DATELINE: DENVER, July 24 

 BODY:
With divisions in the Democratic Party on full display nationwide, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton sought to stake out the center here on Monday, issuing a broad policy platform geared toward helping middle-class voters and the working poor through a series of tax credits and other modest government programs.
 Titled the ''American Dream Initiative,'' Mrs. Clinton's 20-page plan was the culmination of a yearlong project she led at the Democratic Leadership Council, the group of moderate Democrats that helped start her husband's presidential bid in 1991. ''To paraphrase the 1992 campaign: It's the American dream, stupid,'' Mrs. Clinton said in her keynote address at the council's convention, a reference to her husband's ''It's the economy, stupid'' refrain from his first race. 
Mrs. Clinton, who leads many polls for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, continued: ''Democrats stand ready to lead again. Now all we have to do is win elections.''
 The leadership council, which gained prominence by advocating a ''third way'' of governing from the middle of the political spectrum, has in recent years become a target for liberals who say the party establishment has sold out its core values, refused to stand up against Republicans and lost two successive presidential elections in the process. 
 But at the two-day convention, participants harked back to the Bill Clinton era as a model for winning elections and governing, and debated how to reunite the Democratic Party at a time when its members are sharply split over Iraq.
 In addition to Mrs. Clinton, other possible presidential contenders, including Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana and Governors Tom Vilsack of Iowa and Bill Richardson of New Mexico, also made appearances. Gov. Mark Warner of Virginia, another likely presidential candidate who has centrist, business-friendly credentials, was absent; Al From, the council's founder and chief executive, said Mr. Warner was on a long-planned family vacation in Europe.
 Mrs. Clinton spoke as her husband was in Connecticut campaigning on behalf of another committed centrist, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who is facing a brutal primary campaign from a liberal Democrat, Ned Lamont, opposed to the war in Iraq. 
 Mr. From, a longtime Clinton ally, dismissed the notion that Mr. Lieberman was a bellwether for hawkish Democrats. He said that while the war was critical to Democratic primary voters, who tend to be liberal, the key for Democrats should be to keep an eye on the general election. Although Mrs. Clinton has gone much further than Mr. Lieberman in criticizing the management of the war in Iraq, both of them voted to authorize it and have not apologized for their positions since.
 In her address, Mrs. Clinton mapped out a program of relatively small-scale initiatives she said would help middle-class voters regain the financial stability they had lost during the Bush presidency and help the poor in moving up the economic ladder. Among her proposals: a $3,000 college tax credit; ''baby bonds'' that would deliver a $500 savings bond to every child at birth and age 10; an expansion of the home mortgage tax deduction to low-income people who do not itemize their tax returns; and ''American dream accounts'' requiring companies with five or more employees to provide traditional retirement benefits or the option for workers to save through 401(k) accounts.
 Mrs. Clinton also called for a freeze on raises in Congress and at the White House ''until the incomes of average Americans start to rise again.'' She did not, however, go as far down the populist path as other possible presidential candidates, in particular Senator John Edwards, who is focused almost exclusively on poverty as he campaigns in early primary voting states.

 BODY:

STEM-CELL DEBATE DEEPENS -- President Bush's veto of legislation to expand federal funds for embryonic stem-cell research has had the unintended effect of drawing state money into the field and moving the debate into election campaigns across the country. [Page A1.] 


STYMIED IN GENEVA -- Talks aimed at reaching a new global trade agreement collapsed, touching off recriminations between the United States and Europe over farm trade barriers and dealing a blow to the Bush administration's international economic agenda. [A1.]

LARGEST LEVERAGED BUYOUT -- HCA, the for-profit hospital company, agreed to sell itself to three private equity firms and the family of Senator Bill Frist, the company's founders. The deal is the largest leveraged buyout in history, eclipsing the $30.6 billion takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1989. The buyout trend is expected to continue. [A1.]

60 AND OUT -- Nearing the company's mandatory retirement age of 60, BMW's chief, Helmut Panke, introduced his successor, Norbert Reithofer, left, even as he suggested that the retirement age for senior executives had become outdated. But Mr. Panke did not contest the rule. [C3.]

TAKING THEIR CHANCES -- Gamblers anywhere in the world can use the Internet to place wagers on sporting events and play casino games. Although the recent arrest of the chief executive of BetOnSports made headlines, few experts expect the crackdown to do anything more than dent the industry. [C1.]

SCANT PAYDAY FOR A HIT -- When a movie takes in $180 million around the world, one would suppose that the people who created the film would become very rich. But with ''Crash,'' the Oscar winner for best picture of 2005 and a sleeper hit at the box office, that has not been the case. [E1.]

VISTA ON THE HORIZON -- Video-game enthusiasts are likely to welcome the Vista operating system from Microsoft, replacing Windows for PC's. But to judge from a test of an early version, Microsoft still has some critical work to do. [E3.]

SEARCH FOR THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT -- With more than 80 companies under investigation concerning stock options, it is unclear where the line of criminality will be drawn. The vast majority of cases may wind up being civil matters. [C1.]

WINNING WHILE LOSING -- Stock options made Gregory L. Reyes, the former chief executive of Brocade Communications Systems, very rich, and now it is abuse of options that may send him to prison. He and the company are prime examples of how executives can enrich themselves even while many public shareholders -- and the company itself -- lose money. [C1.]

BIG PHARMA GAINS -- Medicare prescription coverage is fueling profits in the pharmaceutical industry, and the revival continued as Merck and Schering-Plough reported second-quarter profits that were well ahead of analysts' expectations. [C1.]

DOUBT ON A.M.D. DEAL -- Advanced Micro Devices's $5.4 billion offer for the graphics chip maker ATI Technologies received negative reaction from Wall Street analysts and investors, partly because of the debt financing involved. A.M.D.'s shares fell 4.76 percent, to $17.39, while. ATI's shares closed at $22.44, up 19.6 percent. A.M.D. hopes the merger will propel the company into the consumer products market, where growth is projected to remain strong as PC sales slow. [C3.]

WILTING IN THE HEAT -- Days of prolonged heat and humidity have driven demand for electricity to record highs in California and other states. Transformers and other equipment shorted out and left tens of thousands of people without power. [A14.]

DANGER AT THE EDGES -- A group of climate experts contends that the debate over global warming is a distraction from the severity of the hurricane problem facing the United States and its risky coastal developments. [F2.]

HEADLINE: TRADE TALKS FAIL OVER AN IMPASSE ON FARM TARIFFS 

BYLINE: By TOM WRIGHTand STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Tom Wright reported from Geneva for this article and Steven R. Weisman from Washington.

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 24 

 BODY:
Negotiations aimed at reaching a new global trade agreement collapsed here Monday, touching off a bitter new round of recriminations between the United States and Europe over farm trade barriers and dealing a blow to the Bush administration's international economic agenda.
 After two days of wrangling by negotiators from six leading trade nations and blocs, the director general of the World Trade Organization, Pascal Lamy, formally suspended the talks, declaring that he no longer had hope of overcoming resistance in wealthy countries to sharply reducing domestic protection for their politically powerful farm industries.
With the apparent failure of the negotiations -- which have been proceeding in fits and starts for five years -- went the hopes expressed recently by President Bush and the leaders of other industrial nations for a deal they have said would create jobs at home while reducing poverty in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The World Bank called a trade deal essential to its goal of alleviating human suffering.
 The breakdown in the talks does not mean that the global effort to reduce trade barriers is dead. But there now appears to be little chance of a trade accord being negotiated before the end of President Bush's term in office. 
 A deal, its proponents said, would have benefited Americans by greatly expanding the exports of farm products, reducing prices for a variety of food and creating new opportunities abroad for insurers and other financial services providers. Nearly 30 percent of American agriculture products are exported.
 But some farmers and their representatives in the United States had grown concerned that whatever new markets were gained would not offset the reductions in government subsidies contemplated by the trade talks. The farm lobby is so powerful in Congress that its opposition would doom the chances of any deal's winning legislative approval. 
 American trade officials said that with the suspension of the trade talks, and the wide gap between the United States and the European Union on reducing tariffs and other barriers on farm goods, there seemed little prospect of anyone coming back to the table anytime soon.
 ''This is a serious failure we find ourselves in, and the question is how do we regroup,'' the United States trade representative, Susan C. Schwab, said. 
 The European Union's agriculture commissioner, Mariann Fischer Boel, added, ''It is a big failure and whether it is going to be definitive, only time will tell.''
 The pessimism about future talks was rooted in a timetable laid down by Congress, which gave Mr. Bush the authority to negotiate a trade deal, and get a simple up-or-down vote on it, without amendments. That authority expires on June 30, 2007.
 Negotiators had said that without at least the broad outlines of a trade accord in place this summer, it would be hard for Congress to approve it before then. Beyond that, lawmakers in Washington are notoriously resistant to trade deals because they almost always come with a loss of some jobs at home, even when there are price advantages for consumers in products like cotton, grain and sugar, and gains particularly for American exporters.
 The failure of the talks was especially embarrassing because at the Group of 8 meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia, earlier this month, Mr. Bush and other leaders had called for a redoubled effort to break the impasse on farm goods. The goal was also to create opportunities for African, Asian and Latin American countries to gain stronger footholds in the global economy by growing more crops for export and developing basic industries that would help put their vast numbers of unemployed and underemployed to work.
 The collapse of the current talks at the W.T.O. is unlikely to stop trade from expanding, business groups said, mainly because trading powers like the United States and the European Union will continue to sign two-way and regional trade agreements. But it could introduce a higher level of tension into the global economy and contribute to growing pressures for more subsidies and domestic protection, rather than less. 
 Before the talks fell apart, the Europeans on Sunday evening had offered to move further than they had previously to reduce tariffs on agricultural imports, European and Indian officials said, but adding that Ms. Schwab and Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns said the offer did not go nearly far enough.
 As a result, the American officials said, they would not formally propose the concessions they said they would be prepared to make to get an agreement. The impasse involved both tariffs and what are called trade-distorting subsidies that enable farmers to compete with farm imports.
 ''We are ready to be flexible,'' Mr. Johanns said. ''There just was nothing there to grab onto to let us take that step.''
 But European negotiators said that Washington had been intransigent in not recognizing that the European Union had gone through a series of painful cuts in tariffs and subsidies for its own farmers. They also said the prospective American concessions were not as significant as the Americans contended they were.
 ''Unfortunately, the Americans were not able or willing to do their part,'' the European trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, argued. ''They preferred to stand still.''
 The United States maintains that the Europeans are far more protective of their farmers and need to do much more because their tariffs on farm products are already twice those of the United States. The Bush administration had called on Europe to cut average farm tariffs by 66 percent and for big developing nations like India, Brazil and China to reduce them by 44 percent.
 The Americans also proposed to cut those subsidies that most violate the principle of free trade by 60 percent. But the Europeans said this cut left intact certain subsidies and price supports, long part of American farm programs, to help farmers cope with periodic economic slumps.
 Mr. Lamy, the World Trade Organization chief, had spent the week since the St. Petersburg meetings in fruitless private consultations with various trade envoys, asking them what they would be prepared to give up if others made similar concessions. He declined, though, to blame one side or the other.
 ''There are no winners or losers in this assembly,'' he said. ''Today, there are only losers.''
 Developing nations like Brazil and India have been demanding that the big industrial nations tear down tariff walls and eliminate billions they spend annually protecting their farmers before the third world begins to open markets to Western manufactured goods and services.
 Given the history of rough going in Congress for trade deals, the Bush administration concluded that it could not get approval for an agreement involving cuts in help to American farmers without those farmers' being assured of more access for their products in Europe, India, China and elsewhere.
 The administration considered itself stymied because the farm bloc has become so distrustful of protectionist practices overseas, including the use of health and safety standards in Europe, that it warned officials against a trade deal that only incrementally improved exports.
 In recent years, the European Union has reduced subsidies to farmers, defying what has always been a powerful bloc, particularly in France but also in Britain, Germany and other countries. In the end, Europeans made common cause in blocking further tariff cuts with countries like India and Indonesia, where farmers are also powerful.
 India's trade minister, Kamal Nath, said after the talks collapsed that it was unacceptable for his country to reduce aid and price supports for farmers, because the long round of talks, begun in Doha, Qatar, in 2001, was supposed to help poor nations more than rich ones. India has been jolted by news of farmers' committing suicide in recent months.
 It was not clear where any trade discussion might go now. The World Trade Organization, founded in 1995 in an effort to deepen trade liberalization begun after World War II, could become a forum for an array of complaints filed by farmers and manufacturers in its 149 nations.
 But the Bush administration said it remained committed to the W.T.O. and would try to see if there was interest in reviving the talks later this year. Ms. Schwab said such efforts would take weeks and probably months. It is theoretically possible, though unlikely, for Congress to extend Mr. Bush's negotiating authority past next year or to give a future president such authority in 2009, continuing the Doha process.
 Christine Lagarde, the French minister for foreign trade, was quoted by Agence France-Presse as saying in Paris: ''There have been other rounds before Doha that lasted much longer than foreseen, which dragged on, and one cannot rule out this being the case for the Doha round. For now, we are somewhere between a long delay and failure.''
 Trade has continued to grow in recent years despite wrangling at the World Trade Organization. Worldwide merchandise exports, which exclude services, increased to $9.12 trillion in 2004 from $6.45 trillion in 2000, according to W.T.O. statistics.
 But the worry, said Celine Charveriat, head of Oxfam's fair trade campaign, is that two-party agreements leave out the poorest countries, many of them in Africa, that the Doha round was supposed to help.
 ''We are concerned,'' she said, ''that the European Union and the United States will turn to damaging regional trade agreements to break open developing-country markets.''

HEADLINE: Creamy, Healthier Ice Cream? What's the Catch?

BYLINE: By JULIA MOSKIN

 BODY:
IN its quest to create ice cream as voluptuous as butter and as virtuous as broccoli, the ice cream industry has probed the depths of the Arctic Ocean, studied the intimate structures of algae and foisted numerous failures on the American public. 
 ''I have tried them all as they came down the pike: dairy-free, fat-free, sugar-free; with tofu, yogurt, rice, whatever,'' said Linda Calhoun, a teacher who lives near Flagstaff, Ariz., cataloguing the disappointments she has tasted over the years. ''They always make me sad.''
For Americans who spend each summer wrestling with temptation, there is fresh hope in the freezer case. New industrial processes, including one that involves a protein cloned from the blood of an Arctic Ocean fish, have allowed manufacturers to produce very creamy, dense, reduced-fat ice creams with fewer additives. The new products appeal to those who have acquired a taste for superpremium high-fat ice cream but cannot stomach its fat content. 
 Edy's (branded as Dreyer's west of the Rockies) has tripled sales in its reduced-fat line since replacing its Grand Light with Slow Churned in 2004. Breyers introduced Double Churned flavors last year and has nearly doubled its product line. More than just marketing-speak, slow-churned and double-churned each refers to a process called low-temperature extrusion, which significantly reduces the size of the fat globules and ice crystals in ice cream. 
 Banking on the creamy mouth-feel of these new formulations, even Haagen-Dazs launched a line of Light ice creams last year to complement its butterfat-rich line. ''We waited years and years for this technology,'' said Gulbin Hoeberechts, a marketing manager for the company. ''Before, our only choices would have been adding air, water or ingredients that don't belong in ice cream.'' 
 Almost all commercial ice creams contain industrial ingredients that mimic the luxurious effects of butterfat and egg yolks: some are natural, like carrageenan, extracted from algae plentiful in the Irish Sea; others are synthetic, like mono- and diglycerides. 
 But using new technologies can be risky for manufacturers. The other new method for making supercreamy ice cream was caught up last month in the global debate over genetically modified foods. In June, Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate, applied to Britain's Food Standards Agency for permission to use a new ingredient in its frozen desserts -- a protein cloned from the blood of an eel-like Arctic Ocean fish, the ocean pout. 
 Instead of extracting the protein from the fish, which Unilever describes as ''not sustainable or economically feasible'' in its application, the company developed a process for making it, by altering the genetic structure of a strain of baker's yeast so that it produces the protein during fermentation. 
 This ingredient, called an ice-structuring protein, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is used by Unilever to make some products in the United States, like some Popsicles and a new line of Breyers Light Double Churned ice cream bars. 
 ''Ice-structuring proteins protect the fish, which would otherwise die in freezing temperatures,'' said H. Douglas Goff, professor of dairy sciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario. ''They also make ice cream creamier, by preventing ice crystals from growing.'' 
 In Britain, where Unilever's Cornetto cone is as iconic as the Fudgsicle is in the United States, the news media have leapt in with headlines about ''vaneela'' ice cream. Britain, like the rest of the European Union, requires labeling for any food that has contact with genetically altered material, even if that substance is not present in the finished product. In its application Unilever stressed that no DNA or other ''material from fish'' is used in the process. But genetically modified foods have yet to gain wide acceptance from the European public, and Unilever has found itself the unwilling center of attention. 
 ''It's unfortunate that this happened to come out during our so-called summer when people are interested in ice cream,'' said Trevor Gorin, head of media relations for Unilever in the United Kingdom. ''I can't tell you how many times I've had to explain that no, the Cornetto will not taste fishy.'' 
 The United States has no regulations requiring the labeling of genetically modified food, which has become increasingly common at every point in the food chain. Until recently, its practical applications were mostly in developing strains of crops, like soybeans and corn, that are more resistant to stresses like disease, weather and insects.
 But research by people like Professor Goff is beginning to bear fruit for the processed-food industry: proteins like the ones found in the ocean pout are an example. 
 For consumers, the benefit is that ice-structuring proteins and low-temperature extrusion have raised the ''creaminess'' bar for the ice cream industry. 
 ''The ice creams produced with the new methods are simply better than any ice creams have ever been,'' Professor Goff said. ''Quite definitely better in texture, and much better tasting.''
 A tasting by the staff of the Dining section found the Breyers Light Double Churned chocolate ice cream bar with the ice-structuring protein very creamy, even dense. It was the favorite of five ice cream bars tasted. The Haagen-Dazs Light and the Breyers Light chocolate ice cream, using low-temperature extrusion, were also very creamy and did not seem to be low-fat. But tasters found that the new ice creams still lagged behind full-fat versions in flavor.
 ''The quest has always been for the taste and texture of full-fat ice cream,'' said Tyler Johnston of Edy's. ''Since the 1980's it's been about adding ingredients,'' he said, referring to the gels and gums that commercial producers churn into reduced-fat ice cream to improve and stabilize its texture. ''Now we have a complicated process, but the recipe can be simplified,'' he added, referring to the industrial freezers that reduce the ice cream from minus 5 to minus 25 degrees Celsius for low-temperature extrusion.
 The public seems persuaded. Shelf space for Dreyer's/Edy's Slow Churned, Breyers Light Double Churned and Haagen-Dazs Light has consistently expanded since they appeared. The category to which they belong, reduced fat, is the only part of the ice cream market that has been increasing in sales. As defined by the F.D.A., light or reduced-fat products can contain up to half the fat grams and two-thirds the calories of the original. (For a product like Haagen-Dazs dulce de leche ice cream, this means a reduction from 18 fat grams to 7 in the Light line; a low-fat product can have no more than three fat grams per serving.) 
 While full-fat ice cream still makes up more than 65 percent of the total market, the International Dairy Foods Association says that sales in the category have been flat for three years and that sales of low-fat and nonfat ice cream have gone down in the same period. 
 Professor Goff said that outside the United States the significance of the new technologies would be noted not on the palate but on the pallet. ''American companies are getting ready to export ice cream to China, India, the Philippines,'' he said. ''These are places that have very real cold-chain issues,'' he said, referring to the challenge of keeping ice cream consistently frozen throughout the shipping process. 
 Products produced with the new technologies are less affected by partial thawing than traditional ice creams, which become dry, sticky and hard in fluctuating temperatures. (This is why letting a container of ice cream thaw on the counter before scooping it is a bad idea.)
 ''Ice crystals are everyone's enemy in ice cream,'' said Arnold Carbone, the head of the Ben and Jerry's research lab in South Burlington, Vt. (Ben and Jerry's, now also owned by Unilever, does not use either new process.) ''Ice cream is an emulsion of air, fat and water, and emulsions are always fragile because the elements want to separate.'' 
 Every time ice cream thaws slightly, the emulsion is compromised and the ice crystals combine into larger, jagged crystals that destroy the ice cream's texture. ''This is the drama of the cold chain,'' he said. ''Every minute that ice cream sits on a loading dock, it suffers incredible abuse.''
 Professor Goff, whose lab is working on a process of extracting ice structuring proteins from winter wheat, has a low-tech solution for those trying to avoid crystallization. ''It's simple,'' he said. ''Never leave a container of ice cream unfinished.''


CORRECTION-DATE: August 2, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article last Wednesday about new techniques for making lower-fat ice cream inaccurately described a government labeling requirement. A product that contains no more than half the fat and two-thirds the calories of the original can be labeled light, not reduced fat. (To be reduced fat, the product cannot contain more than three-quarters of the fat of the original.)

HEADLINE: On the Trail, at Last, to the Big City

BYLINE: By DANA BOWEN

 BODY:
AT his Greenwich Village restaurant, Mas, Galen Zamarra serves duck from Ulster Country, goat cheese from Connecticut, trout from the Neversink River in upstate New York. Even the cocktails are garnished with local fruit. 
 But the first year he was open, in 2004, Mr. Zamarra didn't have a source for fresh local steak. So he served no steak at all.
Yet in a meadow beside a storybook barn a few hours north, Donald Leab tended a small herd of Black Angus that had exactly the grass-fed, corn-finished flavor Mr. Zamarra was looking for. 
 The farmer didn't know the chef existed, and vice versa, so the meat was sold frozen for a fraction of its urban worth. 
 In an era when chefs and shoppers are seeking out foods raised close to home, fresh meat feels like the final frontier. Aside from what you find in coolers at farmers' markets, it's still easier and cheaper to get fresh meat finished at gargantuan feedlots on the Great Plains than from nearby farms. 
 But recently a small group of farmers and entrepreneurs have come up with creative ways to get fresh local meat to the lucrative New York market by figuring out how to get the meat processed. 
 So many slaughterhouses have closed in recent years, because of increases in costs and the tightening of regulations, that farmers must wait for months and often drive 100 miles or more to have animals processed. 
 ''The slaughterhouses here are the biggest problem,'' said Joshua Applestone, 36, who opened a butcher shop in Kingston, N.Y., called Fleisher's two years ago and soon became a matchmaker between chefs and farmers like Mr. Zamarra and Mr. Leab on the side.
 It was that ''so close yet so far'' quandary that drove Mr. Applestone, a chef who was at the time a vegan, and his wife, Jessica, an author, to a career in cutting meat. Ms. Applestone had decided to indulge in the occasional rib-eye from farms she had visited and trusted, but couldn't find anyone who would sell her a single fresh steak.
 If they had a shop, they thought, they could sell the rib-eyes everyone wanted, as well as stock from bones, sausage from scraps, even soap from suet. For Mr. Applestone, the idea had nostalgic pull: his great-grandfather Wolf Fleisher had been a butcher in Borough Park, Brooklyn.
 ''People told us we were crazy,'' Ms. Applestone said one busy afternoon in the shop, a place so old-fashioned it seems as if it should be experienced in black and white. 
 When they started visiting farms they began to think that the doubters might be right. Most were too small to supply a steady flow of meat and were already overwhelmed by the logistics of processing. So the Applestones took over the logistics, booking weekly reservations with processing plants and arranging to have animals from several farms trucked in.
 ''It makes it a lot easier,'' said Mr. Leab, whose family has owned Ioka Valley Farm in Hancock, Mass., since 1936. ''They take care of all of that.''
 It was Mr. Applestone who first took Mr. Leab's meat to New York City. (Mr. Leab now works with distributors in Boston too.) 
 After Mr. Applestone fills his truck with fresh meat at a slaughterhouse he delivers the priciest pieces to places like Mas and Il Buco in Manhattan and less expensive cuts and hamburger meat to neighborhood places like Diner and Sparky's in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Everything else is cut and sold in the shop, along with other products, like the farm-cured bacon that ultimately wooed him back to the camp of carnivores.
 Marty Broccoli, an agricultural economic developer for Oneida County, N.Y., estimated that New York State now has only half as many slaughterhouses inspected by the federal Agriculture Department as it did 20 years ago. (Federal inspection allows the sale of meat across state lines and to resellers.) At the same time there are more part-time farmers and back-to-landers raising animals for the booming natural and grass-fed meat market.
 The number of slaughterhouses was suddenly reduced again, by one, on Monday, when a fire destroyed Fresh Farms Beef in Rutland, Vt., which was booked through the fall with orders destined for city restaurants. Farmers and distributors that used Fresh Farms, including Fleisher's, scrambled to find other facilities.
 Steve Krut, executive director of the American Association of Meat Processors, said the shortage of slaughterhouses is a national problem. Over the past five years, 188 slaughterhouses, most of them small, withdrew from federal inspection or closed, leaving fewer than 1,000, Mr. Krut said.
 Even businesses like Niman Ranch, one of the most successful purveyors of naturally raised meats, are stymied. Bill Niman, the founder, lamented that the company might end relationships with small hog farmers in North Carolina because the slaughterhouse it was using cannot work with it anymore.
 Kathleen Harris, who owns Currytown Farm in Montgomery County, N.Y., sold the meat from her animals to chefs in New York until all three slaughterhouses she worked with closed two years ago. So largely with state agricultural development grants she helped start the Northeast Livestock Processing Service, which connects farmers looking for services like organic meat processing with suitable slaughterhouses, and handles details like scheduling.
 Without such services, said Rick Bishop, who is an owner of Mountain Sweet Berry Farm in Sullivan County, N.Y., and was until recently an agricultural extension agent, farmers often sell meat for half what chefs pay, sometimes at conventional meat auctions. (That means a rare bit of luck might get you a great local steak at Key Food.)
 Mr. Bishop has been helping his neighbors by giving their meat a free ride on his vegetable truck to the Union Square Greenmarket, where he hands it off to the chefs who have ordered it. Realizing that this underground railroad of fresh local meat was more of a patch than a fix-it plan, Mr. Bishop applied for federal and state grants and private financing to build a new slaughterhouse in Liberty, N.Y., specializing in boutique meat. It is to open in spring 2007.
 Mario Batali wrote a letter of support for the grants, and Kurt Gutenbrunner, the chef at Wallse and other restaurants -- and a member by marriage of a family of Austrian butchers -- is an adviser on the project. 
 There will be temperature-controlled lockers where chefs can cure and age meat, and equipment to handle the carcasses of larger, more flavorful, heritage breeds, which most slaughterhouses turn away.
 The idea, Mr. Bishop said, was to create a prototype that other counties, even states, can employ. ''Ultimately, the Hudson Valley needs two or three,'' he said.
 But the new slaughterhouses would have to meet chefs' fastidious demands, said Jennifer Small, an owner of Flying Pigs Farm in Sushan, N.Y., and a founder of Farm to Chef, a network of two dozen upstate farmers making weekly deliveries of products including fresh and frozen meat. Started with a government grant in 2004, it is now owned by chefs and farmers.
 ''A lot of small slaughterhouses are sloppy,'' Ms. Small said. It's not uncommon, distributors say, for porterhouses to come back as hamburger meat or for oxtails to fall off the back of the truck. That is why Ms. Small and Fleisher's covet slaughterhouses like Hilltown Pork, a small family-run operation near Pittsfield, Mass., that works with a longtime country butcher, Ted Johnson.
 Because Fleisher's, like most butcher shops, isn't federally inspected, the Applestones can't butcher meat destined for restaurants. So they work with Mr. Johnson, who took them under his wing when they were learning to butcher, dividing carcasses into manageable cuts, known as subprimals, and giving chefs a crashcourse in butchering at their restaurants.
 ''If you want to be a part of this sustainable agriculture and local livestock, you've got to learn how,'' said Dona Abramson, chef of the Bright Food Shop in Chelsea, uneasily carving a four-foot-long shoulder clod into flatiron steaks as Mr. Applestone watched. 
 But Patrick Martins, a founder of Heritage Foods USA, which distributes naturally raised Kansas meat, said that having chefs butcher is not the answer. So when he decided this year to add fresh local meat to the line he sells to New York chefs, he joined up with Pat LaFrieda Wholesale Meats in the meatpacking district of Manhattan.
 They're an odd couple. Patrick LaFrieda III, 35, the president, said his father, Pat, who ran the business before him, was never interested in locally grown meat because there was already plenty of great-tasting western prime. ''But some of my customers have been asking about this stuff,'' Mr. LaFrieda said. Mr. Martins has whole carcasses shipped to LaFrieda, where old-school pros, with years of experience giving chefs what they want, go to work.
 Those chefs can be particular. ''They're like, 'We want a French rack with a big eye and a three-inch bone,' '' Mr. Martins said. 
 Now that they can get it, he said, ''that's what's going to help local farms.''

HEADLINE: A Video Installation for MoMA

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL; Compiled by Steven McElroy

 BODY:
The artist Doug Aitken will use the Museum of Modern Art's exterior as his canvas this winter, projecting a site-specific multiscreen video for the 53rd and 54th Street facades, right, as well as those overlooking the sculpture garden. Inspired by the dense urban grid of Midtown, the video is Mr. Aitken's first public art project in the United States. It will be shown from Jan. 16 to Feb. 12 from 5 to 10 p.m. and was commissioned by the Modern in collaboration with the nonprofit group Creative Time, which presents art around the city. ''We wanted to do something to say thank you to New York for all the help we got during our expansion,'' Glenn D. Lowry, director of the MoMA, said. The museum reopened in November 2004 after the completion of an $858 million addition designed by Yoshio Taniguchi. ''This multiscreen video is a story about New York at night,'' Mr. Lowry said. ''It's very poetic and extremely engaging.'' The art project was detailed yesterday at a news conference at which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced the results of a study projecting that MoMA would inject $2 billion into the city economy during a three-year period beginning in mid-2004. CAROL VOGEL

HEADLINE: Trade Focus Now Shifts to Regional Deals

BYLINE: By TOM WRIGHT; Saritha Rai contributed reporting from Bangalore, India, for this article, and Steven R. Weisman from Washington.

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 25 

 BODY:
Two weeks ago, countries in the World Trade Organization agreed on rules that would make it easier to track two-way and regional trade deals. Negotiators were concerned that the proliferation of regional deals would detract from efforts, already faltering, to reach a global trade pact. 
 On Tuesday, those regional deals moved to the forefront after the collapse for the foreseeable future of global talks that began five years ago in Doha, Qatar. 
 ''Europe cannot refrain from addressing bilateral and regional priorities,'' the European Union's trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, said. ''We need to focus on new economic opportunities in Asia.''
 India's commerce minister, Kamal Nath, said his government was signing an agreement with Japan and was talking with the European Union. 
 ''India will pursue economic engagements on a bilateral basis with other countries and regional groupings,'' Mr. Nath said. 
 Politicians are not willing yet to pronounce the multilateral talks dead, largely because the potential economic gains from a global agreement would outstrip the effects of regional deals that include only a few countries. But given the stalemate in the global talks, regional agreements are likely to become a more important motor of trade liberalization in years ahead, said Guido Glania, director of international trade at the Federation of German Industries.
 The problem, economists say, is that while regional deals can help expand trade in the absence of a global agreement, they are also likely to create varying or overlapping rules, and sharper tensions between those involved in the agreement and those left out. Moreover, the poorest nations, in areas like sub-Saharan Africa, which were supposed to benefit the most from the latest round of global talks, are likely to lose out since they have the least to offer. 
 ''The cost of failure in the Doha talks is that trade could become more regional, discriminatory and there will be more conflicts,'' said Jean-Pierre Lehmann, founder of the Evian Group, a free trade advocacy organization in Switzerland.
 Two-way and regional trade deals are not new. The W.T.O. estimates there are about 200 such agreements, accounting for about half of the total value of global trade.
 The European Union, which started its internal free market in the early 1990's, now comprises 25 nations. The North American Free Trade Agreement, which involves Canada, Mexico and the United States, went into effect in 1994. Other areas, like Southeast Asia, have also formed free trade zones. 
 The United States has been especially active in seeking two-way openings, recently signing agreements with booming economies like Singapore and Chile. 
 In Washington, Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative, said Tuesday that she would travel this summer and fall to try to revive the global trade talks. ''We're not giving up,'' she said shortly after returning from Geneva.
 She said that if the outlines of a favorable deal emerged this year or next, the administration might ask Congress to extend President Bush's authority to conclude an agreement and have it receive an up-or-down vote in Congress. That authority expires June 30.
 The trade office also plans to try to reach more bilateral deals with trading partners. Recently Congress approved a deal with Oman. Ms. Schwab's office said the 26 bilateral deals that have been negotiated since 2001 or are still being negotiated would together constitute the United States' third-largest export market.
 A spokesman said the countries with which the United States has two-way deals, including Canada, Mexico and Israel, account for 14 percent of the world's economy.
 Ms. Schwab said Asia would be a prime target for trade deals. Countries like China and India, with fast-growing economies and a large middle class, are seen as especially lucrative markets for Western companies that manufacture goods or provide banking and insurance services. 
 Ms. Schwab said she would be able to discuss such deals next month at a meeting of Southeast Asian economic ministers in Malaysia. 
 Asian countries are also moving to sign agreements among themselves. China, Japan and South Korea are discussing a regional free trade area with Southeast Asia, although an agreement is likely to take years.

HEADLINE: For Out-of-Way Destinations, Small Jets Could Be Air Cabs

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 25 

 BODY:
Jam-packed planes. Endless delays. Long security lines. Sprints through an airport to make a connecting flight. 
 It is enough to make someone, particularly a business traveler, yearn for another option.
Enter the air taxi, an idea whose time has come. At least that is the hope of the entrepreneurs placing big bets on a new niche they plan to create in aviation. Their idea is to offer faster, more convenient air travel at a price that falls somewhere between private jets and commercial airlines. 
 For years, questions about the size of an air taxi market have been largely theoretical. But that will change this year, as Eclipse Aviation of Albuquerque begins building the Eclipse 500, a six-seat plane. The company expects the plane will receive its long-awaited certification from the Federal Aviation Administration as soon as this week.
 With the Eclipse, two start-up airlines, Linear Air and DayJet, say they can ferry business travelers to hard-to-reach outposts with fewer frustrations -- and get them home in time for dinner with their families. 
 ''One of the first things they teach you in sales is to look for the pain,'' said William E. Herp, chief executive of Linear Air, an air charter company that has ordered 30 Eclipse planes at a total cost of $50 million. ''And there is a lot of pain out there among business travelers who are flying on commercial jets.''
 How much pain remains to be seen. Some industry analysts question whether air taxi services will be cheap enough for average consumers, or comfortable enough for business travelers, to gain a wide following. 
 Air taxi operators say they can offer customers seats ranging from $1 to $3 a mile, compared with $9 to $13 a mile on charter jets, or up to $15 a mile on slightly larger private jets. Regional commercial airlines like SkyWest, by contrast, average less than 16 cents a mile flying 50-seat planes, but as much as five times that on less-traveled routes where air taxis plan to compete, industry executives say. 
 The 33-foot Eclipse plane, which will cost $1.5 million, can carry two pilots and four passengers and fly at speeds of over 400 miles an hour. By comparison, a twin-engine Cessna CJ-1, a jet that also carries four passengers, costs about $4.3 million and can fly 448 miles an hour. Categorized as a very light jet at less than 10,000 pounds, the Eclipse offers comfort more akin to flying in a leather-appointed sport utility vehicle than a bigger corporate jet with a wet bar. There is also no bathroom -- a fact that has caused some aviation industry veterans to pass up the plane for an air taxi service. 
 ''The absence of a lavatory is going to be a problem,'' said Robert L. Crandall, the retired chairman of American Airlines who is now chief executive of Pogo Jet, a start-up airline looking to get into the air taxi business in the Northeast.
 Mr. Crandall said the jury was still out on the Eclipse plane and he has yet to order any. Nevertheless, Eclipse, which has received more than $500 million in investment, including an undisclosed sum from Microsoft's founder, Bill Gates, has received contracts to build 2,500 aircraft for a total of $3.5 billion in sales, an order book big enough to keep the company busy through late 2008, said Vern Raburn, Eclipse's chief executive. Mr. Raburn, an early employee at Microsoft, is a friend of Mr. Gates. 
 Among the first to put the Eclipse into service will be Linear Air, founded in 2004 by Mr. Herp, an entrepreneur. His airline started as a charter service, flying wealthy travelers to Martha's Vineyard from Boston and New York in Cessna turboprop planes. The company now also markets its services to small teams from consulting firms and other businesses who need to travel together to see clients or visit remote offices or factories. Because of the Eclipse's faster speed, Mr. Herp said it made sense for him to expand his airline to Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
 ''Eclipse is the game in town right now,'' said Mr. Herp, speaking from the Albuquerque airport last week after visiting Eclipse's production plant, where the company is assembling the first 10 Eclipse 500's. Mr. Herp was enthusiastic about how Eclipse's production was automated, unlike the more time-consuming construction methods used to make other private jets, and about how Eclipse, for the moment, had three production shifts running around the clock, seven days a week. 
 Other makers are rolling out planes that could also compete for a slice of the air taxi market. Adam Aircraft, based in Englewood, Colo., is awaiting federal certification for its A700, a six-passenger light jet (or five with a bathroom) that costs $2.25 million. Embraer Air's four-passenger Phenom, which costs $2.85 million, is expected in 2008. And on Tuesday Honda, after years of study, announced that it would build a six-seat jet with a top speed rivaling that of the Eclipse. 
 But not everyone believes that the Eclipse and other very light jets awaiting government approval will be able to establish a new aviation niche. And some analysts are skeptical about whether there is enough demand to justify hundreds, if not thousands, of new flying limousines. 
 ''This is one of the most promising aviation markets in years,'' said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group. ''But are the economics of these new planes revolutionary compared to what is out there? Absolutely not.''
 Mr. Aboulafia said he believed that projections by Eclipse that more than 500 new planes could be absorbed a year, primarily by an air taxi industry, are overly optimistic, in large part because not that many travelers will want to pay a premium for the service. 
 ''The air travel consumer is a very fickle beast,'' he said. ''He is eager to complain but yet he is more cost-sensitive than ever.''
 Others in the travel business see air taxis as a potentially attractive option. ''Now is a good time for these guys to be bringing this to market,'' said Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, an advocacy group for buyers of business travel services. 
 Corporate travel managers are struggling to find a better mix among corporate jets, corporate charters and commercial airlines, said Caleb Tiller, a spokesman for the National Business Travelers Association, which represents 1,700 corporate travel managers. Since 2002, the number of travel managers booking with charters or corporate jets has climbed from 27 percent to more than a third, Mr. Tiller said.
 For now, Linear Air and DayJet pursue starkly different models. 
 Mr. Herp is trying to steal disgruntled travelers from the major airlines in major metropolitan areas. ''We prefer to fish where the fish are,'' he said. ''There are more people for the car-service-with-wings model in New York than any other place in the country. And that's why we are going after Washington next.''
 To win new customers, Mr. Herp's team has identified about 5,000 people it believes are good candidates for the service and reached out to them through direct mail and e-mail. He said these were people who were willing to pay a premium for the service. He cited the example of a Boston-based consulting firm whose managers occasionally visit a client in Elmira, N.Y. On a commercial airline, the limited schedules would force them to fly at 5 a.m. from Logan Airport in Boston through Newark to get to Elmira, where they would hold their meetings and then return home around 11 p.m. On short notice, the tickets cost more than $600 apiece, or about $2,400 for a team of four. 
 With Linear Air, they drive directly to the plane at Hanscom Field, in a suburb of Boston, for a 7 a.m. direct flight, hold their meetings in Elmira and fly out at 3 p.m., returning to Boston at 4:30 p.m. A car service waits for them at the Elmira airport and valets meet the consultants with their personal cars as they step off the plane in Boston. Total cost for the air taxi: $3,000. (With the Eclipse jet, he noted, the flight time to Elmira would be cut from 90 minutes to 45 minutes.)
 At DayJet, the chief executive, Ed Iacobucci, is pursuing a sharply different strategy in the seven Southeastern states where he plans to start the business with Eclipse planes late this year. DayJet plans to go where the major airlines are not -- to airports like Gainesville, Fla., and Huntsville, Ala. 
 ''We are going to all the places where no one in their right mind would want to put a scheduled service,'' Mr. Iacobucci said. ''But never in the main flow of things, where all that congestion is.''
 Mr. Iacobucci said DayJet was not going after commercial airline customers, but rather business travelers who have chosen to drive. ''The people that would be traveling with us are not the C.E.O.'s,'' he said. ''They are the people that would have to drive 8 to 10 hours, spend a night at a Holiday Inn and then drive back. This could double or triple the productivity of mission-critical employees. And they can come home at night.''
 Rather than rent out the entire ''taxi,'' DayJet will offer individual seats on demand. That means prices will vary from $1 to $3 a mile, depending on the passenger's schedule flexibility and DayJet's ability to match up other customers to fill all the seats in the Eclipse. DayJet will not publish fares but encourage customers to book at least two to three days ahead to get the best price.
 The service, the company says, compares favorably with the major airlines on some routes. For a 420-mile flight from Augusta, Ga., to Mobile, Ala., for example, passengers on DayJet would pay $420 to $1,260 each way, or a maximum of $2,520 round trip, for a flight that could leave by 8 a.m. and return in the early afternoon. On USAir, which offers the cheapest seven-day advance fare on Orbitz, a passenger would have to leave at 6 a.m. and fly through Charlotte, N.C. The passenger would have a choice of getting back to Augusta at 6:08 p.m. or 12:04 a.m. Total cost: $777, or 93 cents a mile. (Driving would take about 7.5 hours and cost about $210, plus overnight expenses.)
 Making Mr. Iacobucci's flying limo work will require substantial computing power to analyze routes and passengers' schedules almost instantly. That does not deter Mr. Iacobucci, who spent his career in the software industry, first at I.B.M. and later at Microsoft. He spent $20 million and four years developing DayJet's reservation system. DayJet has already ordered 239 Eclipse 500's, making it Eclipse Aviation's biggest customer. 
 DayJet is working with five cities, including Gainesville, to establish ''Day Ports'' with a DayJet desk, rental car counters, wireless Internet and snack bars. ''These communities are starved for direct connections,'' Mr. Iacobucci said.

HEADLINE: Sales Slow For Homes New and Old

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Selling a new home is getting harder and harder: just ask the builders who are being forced these days to entice potential buyers with expensive inducements like free swimming pools and fancy kitchen cabinets.
 At the same time, the torrid pace in the existing-home market is slackening, as prices are leveling off and properties are staying on the market a lot longer than they used to.
Adding it all together, a variety of experts now say, the housing industry appears to be moving from a boom to something that is starting to look a lot like a bust. 
 ''Housing has had a great five-year run,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief investment strategist for Oak Associates, a money management firm in Akron, Ohio, and a longtime bull on the economy. While he still does not expect a housing downturn to damage the overall economy severely, he predicts that the housing industry itself is entering a longer decline.
 ''Instead of being a seller's market,'' he said, ''it became a buyer's market. And once the psychology changes, it could take a while to reverse. Buyers recognize there's no need to rush out to buy a home.''
 The latest housing data, released yesterday by the National Association of Realtors, made clear that a significant slowdown is under way. It showed that the sales pace for existing homes fell for a third straight month in June -- the ninth monthly decline since hitting a record last June. 
 On a seasonally adjusted annual basis, the rate of existing-home sales dropped to 6.6 million, down from 6.7 million in May and well below the record 7.3 million pace reported last June. The number of existing homes still on the market, meanwhile, grew to a record of 3.725 million units, representing a 6.8-month supply at the June selling pace, up from 6.4 months in May.
 The shift of the upper hand from seller to buyer is showing up in home prices. Last month, the national median price rose to $231,000, less than 1 percent higher than in June 2005. That was the smallest year-over-year increase in more than 11 years.
 Builders are losing their grasp on the new-home market, which is why so many of them have responded by being more aggressive in their use of promotions to sell homes. A check by the National Association of Home Builders of 369 builders across the country found that 75 percent are currently including add-ons like pools or garages at no additional cost when they sell a home. That compares with 50 percent a year ago. 
 A handful of builders reported offering free vacations. None did last July.
 Builders are also helping buyers finance their homes. The survey found that 33 percent of builders are currently absorbing financing points on mortgages, which allows homeowners to pay lower monthly rates. Only 18 percent reported doing so a year ago. 
 When people were lining up to buy, ''the only thing they had to complain about last year was getting enough material, labor and land,'' said Michael Carliner, an economist with the home builders association. But now, he added, ''things are slowing down.''
 The home builders association reported last week that builder confidence had fallen to its lowest level in 14 years.
 Mike Wainwright, a realtor with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Mesa, Ariz., says that each time he walks into the sales office of a new housing development, the incentives seem to change. 
 ''It varies from week to week,'' he said. ''Sometimes it'll be a pool or $25,000 or even more than $50,000.'' He said he has seen cars, kitchen cabinets and flooring thrown in free. Regionally, the slowdown in sales of existing homes last month was most pronounced in the South. The Northeast also fell, while sales in the Midwest and the West held steady compared with May.
 One consequence of the slowing housing market, economists and real estate experts said, is a strengthening of the rental property market. With interest rates rising, buying a home is becoming less affordable to more and more Americans. That gives landlords improved pricing power that home sellers now lack.
 ''A lot of the people that wanted to make a jump to their own home are waiting,'' Mark Obrinsky, chief economist for the National Multi Housing Council, a trade group for the apartment rental business. ''This year is going to be a much better year than we've seen for quite a few years.''
 The housing council is predicting the biggest net increase in apartment rentals this year since 2000, Mr. Obrinsky said.
 With a growing number of potential buyers moving into rental units or holding onto the homes they own, builders across the country are canceling or delaying housing developments. From Las Vegas to Dallas to Washington, some developers now report abandoning condo projects because sales are not meeting expectations.
 Earlier this month, D. R. Horton, the nation's largest home builder, said it would build fewer homes this year than it initially predicted. It also sharply cut its earnings guidance for the year by 30 percent, citing growing inventories of unsold homes and the increased use of incentives as part of the reason.
 And Kenneth Simonson, chief economist with the Associated General Contractors of America, said he thought more projects would be canceled as demand falls.
 ''Certainly more projects will be scrubbed,'' he said. ''The risk is too great that they're going to wind up paying more for the project and collecting less.''
 Mr. Yardeni of Oak Associates added: ''Home builders will tell you it feels like a recession.''

HEADLINE: Why Syria Has Much to Lose If Hezbollah Is Finally Halted 

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, July 25 

 BODY:
As the war between Israel and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah ended its second week, Syrian officials and analysts said the nature of the longstanding relationship between Damascus and the militia appeared to be shifting, with Syrian leverage rapidly diminishing. 
 For the decades when Syrian soldiers were deployed in Lebanon, Damascus kept firm control over the pipeline of arms to Hezbollah and could generate or suppress its activities with little trouble. Now, analysts argue, even if asked, Syria may have trouble tamping out the flames.
''The cards are being thrown in the air in a significant way, and it's not clear how they will land,'' said one Western ambassador, declining to be identified further because he lacked permission from his capital to speak officially. ''There may be a new strategic situation in the making because Israel does not have the overwhelming strategic superiority that it thought it had.'' 
 The basis of that new equation is Hezbollah's continued ability to land rockets deep inside Israel despite two weeks of punishing assaults, with plenty of indications suggesting it can fire for weeks, if not months. 
 Indeed, with each passing day, the sight of an Arab force hitting Israel with rockets makes Hezbollah increasingly popular across the region and therefore more costly to restrain, particularly because the Israelis have labeled the struggle a death match. Given the chilly United States approach to Damascus, with no promise of anything for cooperating, it is also not clear why Syria would want to squash Hezbollah. 
 ''Essentially you are asking them to connive in their own demise,'' the ambassador said. ''Persuading Hezbollah to commit hara-kiri doesn't make sense from Syria's point of view. It would mean the loss of their No. 1 card, not only in Lebanon, but with Israel.'' 
 Hezbollah is believed to have enough of the 13,000-plus rockets it announced were in its arsenal in 2005 to keep going for a couple of months anyway. 
 Ironically, by forcing Syria to withdraw its military from Lebanon last year, the United States and its allies diluted the significant direct leverage Syria might have had over Hezbollah. 
 The consensus here is that Iran, Syria and Hezbollah were all taken aback by the ferocity of Israel's response to the capture of two soldiers; the seizure seemed to fall within the unspoken rules of limited engagements. Similar operations had prompted prisoner exchanges in the past, the current demand by Hezbollah for ending the fighting. 
 Syrian officials are coy when queried how they might rein in Hezbollah, deflecting the question by saying all the problems in the Middle East could be solved through a comprehensive plan to end the Arab-Israeli dispute. But they hint broadly that Syria can deliver, arguing that the omission of Syria, Hezbollah and Iran from diplomatic talks in Rome on Wednesday renders those discussions meaningless. 
 ''I don't think there is any possible solution without Hezbollah and Syria being at the table,'' said one Syrian official, speaking on condition of anonymity because diplomatic relations are so fraught. ''Any solution has to take into account the real force in the region. Syria and Hezbollah are a growing force; they are not getting weaker, they are getting stronger.'' 
 President Bush, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and others in the administration have said repeatedly that Syria can and should leash Hezbollah, suggesting that maybe Washington's Arab allies can wean Damascus away from its alliance with both Iran and Tehran's militant Shiite offspring. In some ways, those are two separate questions, the alliance with Tehran being rather more a passing necessity than a real desire. 
 Strengthened ties with Iran make Syria feel stronger in the region, along with other factors, like the election of Hamas to lead the Palestinian parliament, and the situation in Iraq. But the link is not hugely popular in Damascus. One prominent economist compared it to a ''pleasure marriage,'' a temporary union between a man and a woman that Shiites allow for immediate gratification. 
 ''The relation with Iran is the kind of relation created under pressure, when you close all doors in front of Syria,'' said the economist, Samir Seifan, noting how the United States, the West and their Arab allies have all shunned Damascus for over a year. ''This is the only door we have: Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran. But it is not in the long-term interests of Syria.'' 
 Investments in Syria from Arab states bristling with oil wealth, for example, have basically dried up. There is no sign that will change, particularly because the people orchestrating the street demonstrations in Damascus push participants to chant against Arab leaders who have criticized Hezbollah. 
 ''Abdullah, you pig, tomorrow we will drag you in chains,'' went one recent refrain, referring to the king of Jordan. Another suggested that President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt was a lowly real estate broker who should be dumped. 
 Ultimately, Syria still hopes the crisis will provide an opportunity to reassert itself as a country that needs to be consulted, particularly when it comes to Lebanese affairs. 
 Moreover, being in the mix allows it to chase two essential goals of the ruling Baathist Party -- the spoken desire to regain the Golan Heights, taken by Israel in the 1967 war, and the unspoken desire to remain in power for a good long time by forging alliances that bring prosperity and development. 
 ''The priority is to preserve the regime; the Golan will come later,'' said Mohamed Shahrour, a political activist.

HEADLINE: Slovenia Strides Westward and Does Not Look Back

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: LJUBLJANA, Slovenia 

 BODY:
The Kinodvor, the sole art house movie theater in Ljubljana, is the sort of place that would be recognizable in any European capital -- small, smoky, decorated with posters, frequented by a culturally tuned-in crowd that tends toward the cosmopolitan left of the political spectrum.
 And, judging from the comments made there the other day, not well disposed toward Slovenia's current rightist government, which has increased government influence over the press and state-owned businesses in recent legislation, placing loyalists in key positions.
 ''It's a return to totalitarianism,'' one person in the crowd whispered to a reporter, perhaps exaggerating the dissatisfactions of the art house.
 But in the broader circles of society, people are more forgiving of the country, which was the first state in the Yugoslav federation to win independence as Yugoslavia slowly and violently unraveled. 
 Now it belongs to an entirely different federation, the European Union, which it joined two years ago. And it seems to be thriving, while other new members fret about losing their identity and are prone to mean-spirited and nationalist politics.
 To some experts on Europe, Slovenia is almost a model new member of the union. In January, it will become the first of the 10 countries admitted in 2004 to join the European currency union. It will take Europe's coveted presidency for a six-month term in 2008, the first of the new members to do so. Its per capita gross domestic product has grown to 81 percent of the European average. Some 80 percent of its small population -- just under two million people -- is connected to the Internet.
 ''We were able to start with the transformation immediately, and now we see the difference,'' Prime Minister Janez Jansa said in an interview in his office here. He meant that once Slovenia became independent of Yugoslavia in 1991, it began the transition to a market economy straightaway.
 ''In 1991, people left Slovenia because they thought that things would be safer in Belgrade,'' Mr. Jansa continued. ''Now they are coming back.''
 But how, he was asked, has Slovenia apparently avoided some of the sourness of other countries like Poland, where a new rightist government has criticized its predecessors for having been so eager to join the union that Poland's interests were sacrificed in the process.
 Issues like these are easily manipulated, Mr. Jansa said, but to succeed, they need a political force pushing them. ''In Slovenia there were no strong political parties that opposed'' membership, he said.
 Slovenia always had certain advantages over other Balkan countries and other Communist countries of Eastern Europe. Not least, it borders both Italy and Austria, and it enjoys a very small coastline (about 10 miles) on the Adriatic, which gave it readier access to the West than most other nations of Eastern Europe.
 In addition, Slovenia, with a largely homogeneous population that is 90 percent Slovene, split first from the rest of Yugoslavia, and was able to avoid the devastating wars that accompanied the rest of the nation's breakup.
 Not that politics here is without its troubles. Mr. Jansa himself, as the comments about him at the Kinodvor suggest, is not universally popular. Taking over from a social-democratic government that was in power for a decade, he has promised a faster pace of privatization and a reduction of the state.
 But according to his critics, he has increased the power of the government by, for instance, winning enactment of a media law that enabled him to place party loyalists in key positions in the commission that controls the government-owned radio and television stations. He has gained influence over the largest national newspapers by changing officials in the funds that own them.
 ''They totally control the biggest newspaper, the biggest radio station, and the biggest public television station,'' said Anton Rop, a former prime minister and a continuing rival of Mr. Jansa, describing what he said were the effects of the change in the media law. 
 ''They are talking about reforms, but they are anti-reform,'' Mr. Rop said. 
 He complains that soon after taking power, Mr. Jansa increased pensions, a popular move but one that, in Mr. Rop's view, threatens Slovenia's historically low budget deficit, which is necessary for membership in the European currency union.
 ''They like to talk about history,'' Mr. Rop continued, ''especially about what they did in the war for independence, but in reforms they are unable to do anything.''
 Mr. Jansa has been involved in a continuing skirmish with Mladina, the magazine where he worked when he was a pro-independence Slovene dissident in the 1980's, but which has criticized him ever since he took power at the end of 2004. 
 In a much noted comment a few weeks ago, Mr. Jansa darkly suggested that ''some editors'' of Mladina, as well as other journalists, welcomed the Yugoslav Army's interference in Slovenia or criticized the Slovene government during the struggle for independence.
 ''From time to time I have the impression that he's still angry because he was in prison,'' said Ali Zerdin, the current deputy editor of Mladina, and a colleague of Mr. Jansa at the magazine in the late 1980's.
 Still, compared with Poland and its tilt toward religious nationalism, or with Slovakia, where the governing coalition includes a right-wing nationalist party, or even compared with France or the Netherlands, where public fear of competition from cheap eastern labor has produced a deep disillusionment with the European Union, tiny Slovenia seems to be experiencing little of such a reaction. 
 ''People here are satisfied with their economic circumstances,'' Mr. Rop said, in a statement that few European politicians could reasonably make.
 The sights around the country confirm this view, from the numerous open-air cafes in this city, a small capital with a jewel-like old city, redolent of the Austro-Hungarian past, to the country's Adriatic seaside, linked to the capital by a world-class superhighway, and crowded with visitors from all over Europe.
 To be sure, Slovenia has a certain modest scale. Ljubljana's airport is tiny. In the whole country there is only one soccer stadium adequate for international play. There is no convention center worthy of the name, nor are there any five-star hotels. The country, a NATO member, has steadfastly supported the United States in its foreign policy (Mr. Jansa met President Bush in Washington recently) but its entire contingent in Iraq consists of four police trainers.
 But Slovenia seems largely optimistic.
 ''This is the first time that we have our destiny in our hands,'' Mr. Jansa said. ''It's a historic achievement. Never was the neighborhood, the region, Europe so kind to small countries. We are aware of that, and we want to use this opportunity.''

HEADLINE: Downtown Rebuilding Agency Says It Is No Longer Needed

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the state agency created to help rebuild the area south of Houston Street after terrorists destroyed the World Trade Center, will soon go out of business, its staff was told yesterday.
 ''The L.M.D.C. had a mission and we're nearing the end of the mission,'' said its chairman, Kevin M. Rampe.
By that, he meant selecting a master plan and a memorial design for the trade center site; allocating more than $2.7 billion in federal grants, including support for downtown residents and businesses; financing park renovations and cultural programs; and planning the revitalization of Fulton Street, from river to river. 
 Stefan Pryor, the president of the corporation and its first employee, said its role as a planning and financing body was always intended to be temporary. ''The greatest accomplishment of a public agency such as ours is to successfully work itself out of existence,'' he said.
 Among its legacies, he said, was Daniel Libeskind's master plan for rebuilding ground zero, adopted in 2003, ''which has held through all the controversies, debates and negotiations over the years.'' 
 There are currently 54 employees, Mr. Pryor said. Almost all attended yesterday's meeting at the agency's office at 1 Liberty Plaza, opposite ground zero. They were told that the agency would effectively come to an end within months.
 The corporation will probably endure as an entity for legal purposes, with little or no staff. It is a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation, which is the sole stockholder. Its 16-member board is composed equally of directors appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
 Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said it was an appropriate moment for transition. ''The L.M.D.C., through a very often excruciating period, managed very effectively the many difficult tasks of the recovery, then the planning and now the implementation of a really fabulous plan for Lower Manhattan,'' he said.
 An important bit of unfinished business is the completion of design guidelines for the office towers at the trade center site and for public spaces, storefronts and signs. Mr. Rampe said he hoped they would be ready in the fall.
 Other unfinished jobs will be passed on.
 Construction of the memorial, for instance, will fall to the private World Trade Center Memorial Foundation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Fulton Street revitalization project may end up in the hands of the Department of City Planning and the city's Economic Development Corporation. Cultural grants may be administered by the Department of Cultural Affairs.
 ''I think what you will see is a significant increase in the city's role at the site,'' Mr. Doctoroff said.
 The Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center, established in 2004 by the governor and the mayor to coordinate rebuilding efforts downtown, is likely to assume responsibility for the long-delayed demolition of the former Deutsche Bank building at 130 Liberty Street, Mr. Pryor said. 
 The tower was badly contaminated on Sept. 11, 2001, and harbors untold numbers of human remains. This has been one of the corporation's most difficult jobs, involving complex environmental regulations and tremendous sensitivity among victims' relatives.
 ''We've always questioned the wisdom of having the L.M.D.C. involved in that project, given that they have no background in environmental issues,'' said Julie Menin, the chairwoman of Community Board 1 in Lower Manhattan.
 Speaking generally about the corporation's end, she said: ''If elected officials have more of a direct role, rather than through an intermediary, this might be a step in the right direction. It's one less layer of bureaucracy.''
 Ms. Menin did not agree that the corporation had accomplished its mission, pointing to the almost empty site at ground zero. ''It's very unfortunate that we're approaching the five-year anniversary and we still have a hole in the heart of our community,'' she said.
 The Regional Plan Association, a private group, noted that the public would lose a role in decision-making. ''The L.M.D.C. does deserve a lot of credit for doing more than any other public agency to date to engage the public,'' said Petra Todorovich, a senior planner at the association. ''The problem was that they did not always have the authority to act on the input they received. Pataki always called the shots.''
 A persistent critic, David Dyssegaard Kallick of the private Fiscal Policy Institute, said the announcement yesterday ''just formalizes what has been clear for some time: the L.M.D.C. is not serving any useful purpose.
 ''Disbanding the L.M.D.C.'' he said, ''is a step in the direction of transparency, democracy and the checks and balances of the normal political process.''

HEADLINE: Yonkers Plan Clears Hurdle, But Still Faces Opposition

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

DATELINE: YONKERS, July 25 

 BODY:
Now that the developer Forest City Ratner Companies has won approval for its ambitious Ridge Hill Village development here, officials representing the city and the developer are turning their attention to resolving an environmental challenge to the project from neighboring Greenburgh.
 Construction on Ridge Hill is expected to begin by the end of the year, according to the developer. The $660 million residential, retail and commercial project, near the New York Thruway in the northern part of this city, is expected to create 7,000 jobs and generate $24 million a year in gross revenue for Yonkers -- a virtual lifesaver that might just pluck the city out of its perpetual financial pit, its supporters say. 
But Ridge Hill has also generated fierce opposition from the Town of Greenburgh, which abuts the project and has battled Yonkers before over development along the town's border.
 In April, Greenburgh filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court challenging the adequacy of the project's environmental review. The pending suit does not prevent the Ridge Hill project from moving forward, but it could deter its progress down the line, city officials said.
 ''Our goal is not to be obstructionists, it's not to kill the project,'' Greenburgh's supervisor, Paul J. Feiner, said in an interview. ''Our goal is to negotiate a settlement,'' 
 Officials in Greenburgh have voiced concern about the increased traffic that might result from the project, as well as about the accompanying noise and air pollution.
 ''Obviously, we'd like a much smaller project and we're going to do all that we can to protect the quality of life in our town, but we're realistic,'' Mr. Feiner said. ''And I'm optimistic that by the end of the day, we're going to come to an agreement.''
 Plans call for Ridge Hill to have 1,000 high-rise apartments, movie theaters, a convention center, a hotel and 1.3 million square feet of retail space. The retail part has been a cause of contention. Opponents in Greenburgh want to see the retail space cut by half, but the developer and the city have refused to budge, saying that doing so would doom the project's economic prospects.
 David Simpson, a spokesman for the city's mayor, Philip A. Amicone, said that ''there are always going to be issues with any development, such as increased traffic, but that's the price you pay for broadening the city's tax base.''
 Forest City Ratner, the development partner in building the new Midtown Manhattan headquarters for The New York Times Company, has agreed to contribute $3 million for a new firehouse in Yonkers and to pay an extra $10 million in property taxes to the city over the three years that it will take to build Ridge Hill. It has also pledged $10 million for a road linking the project to the Sprain Brook Parkway.
 For the past decade or so, Yonkers has relied on state aid to balance its budget, partly because of its limited success in attracting development. This year, the State Legislature earmarked $74 million for the city, helping it fill a $100 million budget gap. The city is now banking on Ridge Hill, among other plans, to stabilize its economy and spur growth.
 The 81-acre site where Ridge Hill is to be built is nearly vacant, save for an office building in its southeast corner. Forest City Ratner first proposed the project four years ago, but political infighting, legal challenges and accusations of backroom deals stalled its progress.
 ''This process had a number of flaws,'' said Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Westchester County legislator who represents Yonkers. ''Many of the parties could have been brought to the table way earlier and many of the deals could have been brokered more transparently so as to avoid a lot of the problems that came up along the way.''
 The City Council voted once before, in December, to change the zoning to allow residential and retail use on the site. But the three council members who opposed the rezoning filed a lawsuit, charging that the vote was based on an illegal change in the number of votes needed to overrule the Westchester County Planning Board's rejection of new zoning. Originally, such an overrule vote required the approval of five of its seven members, but the rule was changed to require a majority vote.
 A State Supreme Court justice agreed, and annulled the vote in May, forcing the city and the developer to start the approval process over. This time, the council voted 5 to 2 for the new zoning.

HEADLINE: Can a City Thrive With Only Rich and Poor?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Cities Shed Middle Class, and Are Richer and Poorer for It'' (Week in Review, July 23):
 Growing up in Brooklyn in the 1970's and 80's, I lived in the Glenwood Houses, home to lower-income families often headed by immigrants from Eastern Europe, the Caribbean and Latin America. 
 Surrounding us were house-proud neighborhoods, whose middle-class children we befriended in school and on playgrounds. That economic and social diversity enhanced our community's stability.
 Crime often plagues poor neighborhoods isolated from the values and habits of our waning middle class. 
 Today, wealthy New Yorkers enjoy their gilded enclaves, but the middle class is key to social stability. But our city is often stunningly oblivious to what the middle class needs. 
 For example, some policy makers embrace stereotypes about wealthy Manhattanites in rent-stabilized apartments, but the program serves many middle-class families in neighborhoods like Riverdale, Flatbush and Astoria. 
 Our mayor and other policy makers should take note.

Barry P. Moskowitz
Bronx, July 23, 2006

To the Editor:
 As if the inequities that already exist between cities' upper and working classes were not enough, the added hardship on workers of long, arduous and energy-inefficient commutes to places of employment is unsustainable and, quite simply, unjust. 
 In a nation where our resources have been spent on highway systems instead of mass transportation, our workers will bear the brunt and the cost of oil-reliant drives to and from rich urban centers.
 The police officers, firefighters, teachers, service workers and so on who make our cities thrive should be assured a place in the residential landscape regardless of fluctuations in property values. 
 Their nonworking hours and their wallets should be spared the added hardship that the American commute presents. Our nation's car dependency and energy addiction should be eased by providing affordable urban housing to the workers who make our cities great.

Eloise Paul
New York, July 24, 2006

To the Editor:
 Cities have shed their middle class because too many middle-class people have been chasing after an increasingly limited supply of available affordable housing. 
 Builders have become reluctant to construct new middle-class units because of a combination of rent control, zoning, Nimby (not in my backyard), union labor costs, community opposition and excessive government regulations and taxes. 
 Unleash the free-enterprise system to build new housing units, and you'll see a return of the middle class to the Big Apple.

Larry Penner
Great Neck, N.Y., July 23, 2006

To the Editor:
 Putting construction workers up in hotels, or having firefighters work second jobs, as W. Michael Cox, the chief economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, recommends, may negate the necessity of an urban middle class. But such policies lack a necessary empathy for other people.
 I would not want my civic government treating people in such a way, as I'm sure that Mr. Cox would not want to scramble to work two jobs to support his family. 
 This is why the decline of an urban middle class is cause for alarm. How effective and dedicated will a firefighter who is working two jobs be?

HEADLINE: Technology Bull Told to Pay $2 Million for Deceiving Investors

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
A federal judge in Manhattan has ordered Paul E. Johnson, a former technology stock analyst with Robertson Stephens, to pay nearly $2 million in penalties after a jury found him liable for deceiving investors with bullish stock research during the Internet bubble. 
 In November, a jury found that Mr. Johnson had recommended that investors buy shares in a company he was in fact selling. Mr. Johnson, who now runs a hedge fund called Nicusa Capital, also misled investors by failing to disclose personal stakes in two other companies he was urging investors to buy, the jury concluded. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Mr. Johnson in 2003, accusing him of securities fraud, but he chose to fight the commission's contention that his research had harmed investors. His was the only biased-research case that went to trial; other analysts, like Jack B. Grubman, the former telecommunications analyst at Citigroup, settled their cases with regulators without admitting or denying wrongdoing. 
 During the trial, Mr. Johnson argued that his disclosure failures were not intended to defraud and that he was simply following orders from his employer. 
 By ordering Mr. Johnson to pay $1.87 million in disgorgement and interest and $125,000 in civil penalties, Judge John F. Keenan of United States District Court in Manhattan rejected the former analyst's request to impose no penalties in the case. Still, the ruling, handed down on Monday, was less than the amount requested by the S.E.C: $4.8 million in disgorgement and civil penalties.
 Three stocks owned by Mr. Johnson played a role in the case: Corvis, a telecommunications company in which he held a $90,000 stake; Siara Systems, a private company that was acquired by Redback Networks in March 2000; and Sirocco, a private company acquired by Sycamore Networks that September. 
 Mr. Johnson's firm, Robertson Stephens, a boutique technology investment bank in San Francisco, was acquired by FleetBoston, which shut it down in 2002.
 Mr. Johnson argued for leniency, telling Judge Keenan that his conduct was ''in accordance with the industry norms at the time.'' As the judge noted in his order, ''the jury, however, was not persuaded that industry norms relieved Johnson of liability,'' and the jury found him liable for four violations of securities laws.
 Testifying last fall, Mr. Johnson said he had sold his stake in a company whose shares he was recommending not because he lacked faith in it, but because he needed the money for a costly renovation of a Manhattan apartment that he and his wife had purchased in 2000 for $6 million. 
 Mark F. Pomerantz, a lawyer at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison who represented Mr. Johnson, did not return a phone call seeking comment. 
 Donald N. Dowie, a trial lawyer at the S.E.C. who worked on the case, said: ''It's an important case; it was a hard-fought case. The jury reached the right decision.''
 In addition to the $1.99 million in disgorgement and fines, Judge Keenan issued an injunction barring Mr. Johnson from violating securities laws for five years.
 Mr. Johnson, the judge noted, had ''made no assurances against future violations nor has he stated to the court that he recognizes his wrongful conduct.''
 Another reason for the five-year bar, according to the judge, was Mr. Johnson's current occupation as a hedge fund manager, which ''makes it likely that future violations may occur.''

HEADLINE: A Wal-Mart Beachhead Close to New York City

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, July 24 

 BODY:
In the resurgent central business district here, amid new upscale construction that includes a luxury Trump condominium tower and a 123-room Ritz-Carlton Hotel, a Wal-Mart has opened it doors. 
 The store in central Westchester, 25 miles north of New York City, is one of the first of a new group of multilevel Wal-Marts that the company, the nation's largest retailer, has planned for cities in the coming months.
Until several years ago, Wal-Mart, which is known for its rock-bottom pricing strategies, has built single-story outlets in rural and suburban locations surrounded by sprawling parking lots. But for cities like White Plains that are undergoing economic revivals that can lure shoppers from a broad geographic area, Wal-Mart has expanded its signature format to include vertical shopping configurations -- especially in cities where land is scarce and development costs are high.
 Of its 39,000 outlets nationwide, including general merchandise stores, supercenters, Sam's Clubs and what it calls neighborhood markets, Wal-Mart operates roughly 20 multilevel stores. 
 Even though Wal-Mart has tried to penetrate the New York City market, it has encountered stiff resistance from local zoning boards and so far does not have a presence in the five boroughs. According to Steven Restivo, a regional director for corporate affairs, the company is continuing to pursue development in New York City, and in the meantime is opening Wal-Marts in places like White Plains, which are close enough for shoppers coming from, for example, the Bronx. 
 Last month, Wal-Mart opened a 142,566-square-foot two-floor store in a new structure in Kearny, N.J., seven miles from New York City, in an urban enterprise zone, where the sales tax has been reduced to 3 percent. Wal-Mart expects to announce the opening of more stores in the area surrounding New York City in coming months, Mr. Restivo said. 
 In White Plains, no zoning changes were required, since Wal-Mart leased a building that was previously used by a retailer. But in Queens, for example, it encountered stiff resistance from zoning board members and other officials who were worried that the giant retailer would, among other things, overwhelm smaller struggling businesses.
 The two-story 180,000-square-foot store in White Plains, which is on the first and second floors of a nine-story building occupied by Sears for 37 years, and the newly built Kearny store are introducing features that will be limited to Wal-Mart's urban outlets, Mr. Restivo said.
 For example, the new White Plains store has four side-by-side escalators for passengers and their carts; it is one of the first of the chain's stores to have this feature. While customers move between floors on the first and the fourth escalators, the two escalators in the middle move the shopping carts along rails, within view of the customers but sealed off by plexiglass dividers for safety reasons.
 Shoppers on opening day of the White Plains store last Wednesday seemed pleased with the new double-functioning escalators. Kaye Smythe, a retired bartender from Yonkers who walks with a cane, said the escalators made chasing bargains that much easier for her. ''Usually, I have to find an elevator and wait,'' Ms. Smythe said. ''Now I can get from one floor to another right in the middle of the store along with everyone else. I was a little nervous at first, but it really works.''
 None of the mishaps that sometimes occur on similar dual-functioning escalators in other large stores -- like carts going awry or slipping backward -- occurred on opening day here, according to Tina Frank, an assistant manager.
 The complex escalator system and the oversize elevators that Wal-Mart required to transport passengers from parking areas on the fifth and sixth floors to the store itself, had to be made to order. This delayed the store's opening by about 10 weeks, said Anthony DiTommaso, the chief executive of Ivy Equities, the building's landlord and manager in Montvale, N.J.
 ''The whole thing required a massive amount of cutting-edge technology in vertical transportation,'' Mr. DiTommaso explained. The new store has eight oversize elevators for passengers with carts, two freight elevators and another elevator that Mr. DiTommaso called a ''cartalator,'' which brings carts from the parking area back to the store.
 Ivy Equities and Barrow Street Capital, a pension fund adviser in New York, bought Sears's lease for the building, which includes six floors of parking, from MetLife in 2003 in a 66-year-old leasehold agreement for $13.75 million. Sears moved to a nearby mall.
 Mr. DiTommaso would not disclose how much Wal-Mart is paying for the space, although he conceded that Wal-Mart was a tough client to bargain with. ''Millions of consumers get merchandise for less at Wal-Mart,'' he said, ''but they certainly don't give anything away to their landlords.''
 As part of Wal-Mart's rollout in urban markets, the White Plains and Kearny stores have wider aisles and use wood and earth-tone flooring to delineate merchandise areas, Mr. Restivo said.
 Both are considered general merchandise stores, which are somewhat smaller than the superstores. The White Plains store has a smaller garden center and sells smaller kitchen appliances than most Wal-Mart stores, to accommodate the needs of residents living in the many condos going up in the downtown around it.
 In particular, the exterior of the White Plains store presented new architectural challenges that the chain may well encounter again as it enters other city markets and renovates older structures, said Steve Mitchael, director of design for Wal-Mart's north central division. 
 ''In architecture, it's often difficult to fit into a city's design, because such areas have evolved over the years with different architectural styles,'' Mr. Mitchael said. ''Also, over time, building materials change and so does the community leadership, and that all influences the look of a place.''
 In White Plains, that was especially true, he said, because the city has a large assortment of older structures and is going through a major transition.
 The newly renovated main entrance to the White Plains Wal-Mart incorporates Art Deco-style elements with glass blocks and light-colored bricks, and a curving sail-shaped roof line.
 ''This store represents an excellent example of how well the Wal-Mart concept can fit into an urban setting,'' Mr. Mitchael said. 
 Indeed, Paul Wood, the city's executive officer, said White Plains was happy to have Wal-Mart in the mix, even though its presence is in sharp contrast to the development of luxury buildings around it. ''It's part of our economic development strategy to have a variety in the downtown,'' Mr. Wood said.


CORRECTION-DATE: August 2, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Square Feet pages of Business Day last Wednesday about new Wal-Mart stores in urban areas misstated the number of outlets the company operates nationwide. It is 3,900, not 39,000. The article also misstated the sales tax in an urban enterprise zone in Kearny, N.J., where the chain opened a store in June. It is 3.5 percent, not 3 percent.

HEADLINE: Nearly All in Queens Have Power Now, Con Ed Says

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON; Ann Farmer, Sarah Garland and Winnie Hu contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Consolidated Edison said yesterday that it had restored electricity to all but a little over a hundred customers who endured a blackout in an eight-square-mile chunk of Queens for more than a week. Some complained that they had only partial power, however.
 On a day when the first blackout-related lawsuit was filed against the company, Con Ed seemed last night to be closing in on restoring full service. 
Con Ed has estimated that the blackout affected about 25,000 customers, but a ''customer,'' to the utility company, can be anything from a one-family house to a large apartment building. 
 The rule of thumb is to figure that there are four people for every ''customer,'' so at the height of the blackout 100,000 people were without lights, elevators and air-conditioning during one of the hottest weeks of the year. 
 Some awoke yesterday to discover that they had hot water and air-conditioning for the first time in eight days, but anger lingered over how long it had taken Con Ed to reconnect everyone.
 A Con Ed spokesman, Michael Clendenin, said the customers whose service was restored yesterday had full power, but some of them said that only some of their electrical outlets worked. They also said crews in the street had warned that electricity was being supplied at reduced voltage.
 Mark Attenburg, who lives on 39th Avenue near 49th Street in Sunnyside Gardens, said that some of his lights had come back on, but not the refrigerator. He and his wife improvised a solution.
 ''We ran an extension cord from the refrigerator into the corner of the kitchen where the one outlet was working,'' he said. ''I was going, 'Is it O.K. to do this?' That's the outlet where usually we run the coffee machine.''
 Mr. Clendenin said the reduced voltage would be a short-term problem. He said low-voltage lines in the street were knocked out when 10 feeder cables, each carrying up to 27,000 volts, failed, causing the blackout. The low-voltage lines connect to the lines running directly into homes or businesses.
 ''We've been going around restoring the customers' service lines from the street,'' he said. ''Theoretically, they are getting power. However, some of them, until you shore up everything on that block at both ends, some might see low voltage.''
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg defended Con Ed's performance during the blackout again yesterday, as he did on Monday. He stopped short of singling out the chairman and chief executive of Con Edison, Kevin M. Burke. On Monday, in a remark that made politicians from Queens shake their heads and roll their eyes, the mayor said that Mr. Burke ''deserves a thanks from the city.'' 
 Yesterday, during a visit to the headquarters of the city's School Construction Authority in Long Island City, Queens, Mr. Bloomberg said Con Edison was expected to report on the causes of the power failure by next Wednesday. The mayor said the deputy mayor for economic development, Daniel L. Doctoroff, would be involved in the utility's study of the power failure. 
 The mayor, who expressed annoyance last week when Con Ed's early statements underestimated the number of people without power, yesterday defended the utility and its workers' efforts to restore electricity. 
 ''From what I can see, what happened to Con Ed was not deliberate,'' he said. ''It is a company that has a national reputation as a very good utility that provides a very reliable service in the context of 8.1 million people in a very difficult underground environment.''
 He declined to respond directly to criticism from Queens officials and residents upset by his praise of Con Ed and Mr. Burke. ''We live in a country where you have the First Amendment,'' the mayor said yesterday. ''You have the right to say anything you want. What I've got to do is focus on what's right for this city.''
 The mayor also said that replacement feeder cables, installed above the ground as a stopgap measure during the blackout, need to be buried, a complicated process that would take more time. He said the utility would leave its emergency generators in affected neighborhoods.
 Some residents said their lives were returning to normal. Roberto Loera, a waiter who lives on 65th Street, said he took a cold shower yesterday, as he had for a week. Not until he started shaving did he turn on the hot water faucet, out of habit, only to have hot water pour out. 
 ''Everything's O.K.,'' he reported, ''but you never know.''
 One angry customer filed a lawsuit against Con Edison, charging gross negligence. That customer, Sandra Boyle, said her 2-year-old daughter, Saoirse, had come down with a virus and a fever of 102 degrees during the blackout. Emergency room doctors told Mrs. Boyle to give her cool drinks and ice cream. 
 She could not do that, since her refrigerator lacked electricity. ''In this day and age,'' she said, ''it's totally unacceptable for a power outage to continue for this long.''
 A Con Edison spokesman, Alfonso Quiroz, said the company did not comment on pending cases.
 Some customers reported losing power for the first time yesterday. Patricia Estrella, who lives at 35-58 65th Street, tried ironing while her air-conditioner was on. That blew the fuses, and when she replaced them, the power stayed off, she said.
 ''Nothing's working,'' she said. ''I'm angry to not have electricity.''

HEADLINE: Battle for Baghdad Boils Down to Grabbing a Slice at a Time 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 25 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's announcement on Tuesday that it will shift more forces to Baghdad is much more than a numbers game. It reflects a new strategy to reclaim control of the Iraqi capital and a new approach for deploying the troops.
 The plan is to concentrate on specific neighborhoods rather than distribute the forces throughout the city, control movement in and out of sectors of the capital and try to sweep them of insurgents and violent militias. 
In effect, the scheme is a version of the ''ink blot'' counterinsurgency strategy of grabbing a piece of terrain, stabilizing it and gradually expanding it. Only this time the objective is not a far-flung Iraqi city or town, but the capital, the seat of the fledgling government and home to some seven million Iraqis.
 The plan has risks. It will divert American military police from deploying to Anbar Province, where the insurgency continues to rage. And an increased presence of American troops on the ground in Baghdad, where insurgent attacks have soared, carries the potential of more American casualties.
 But Baghdad in military parlance is the ''center of gravity'' for the larger effort to secure the country. 
 Restoring security in a capital that is tormented by sectarian strife and lawless militias is such an essential task that American commanders are willing to accept a greater degree of risk elsewhere.
 Sending in additional troops is an implicit acknowledgment of what every Iraqi in Baghdad already knows: Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki's original Baghdad security plan has failed. 
 In the past two weeks, more Iraqi civilians have been killed than have died in Lebanon and Israel. 
 The additional American forces sent here will include units equipped with Stryker armored vehicles, military police and, essentially, what is left of the American military's reserve in Kuwait. 
 To demonstrate that the burden is being shared equally, half of the additional 8,000 troops that will be sent are to be American and half Iraqi.
 By securing the city a sector at a time, American and Iraqi commanders hope to allow the Iraqi government to restore essential services and build support and legitimacy among an anxious public.
 Once the areas are stabilized, the Iraqi police are to be brought in to maintain control, freeing the American and Iraqi military to extend their reach elsewhere. The Iraqi police are to be accompanied by American military police, who will act as advisers and trainers.
 The Americans and the Iraqis are likely to start with the easiest sectors, calculating that they need to demonstrate a measure of success before taking on the most contested areas. Even as they expand their control the American and Iraqi forces will maintain the ability to conduct raids in less secure areas of the city.
 The war is a contest of moves and countermoves, and the insurgents and the militias that the new American and Iraqi forces will confront can be expected to strike back.
 Some of the forces that are now to go to Baghdad, like the military police, were earmarked for volatile Anbar Province in the west. Building a new police force in the Sunni-dominated Anbar region has been a critical part of the American counterinsurgency effort there. Diverting military police to Baghdad will make that already difficult mission in Anbar even harder.
 But it is a trade-off that American commanders are prepared to accept. There are 117 police stations in the Baghdad area, which is where the American command has made its main effort.
 ''Baghdad is truly a must-win,'' said Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, the senior spokesman for the military command here. ''The prime minister has stated it. General Casey has stated it. We have to win in Baghdad. We don't have an option.''
 Mr. Maliki's original Baghdad security plan entailed the deployment of some 51,000 troops and police officers -- including 7,200 American soldiers -- and the establishment of new checkpoints.
 ''In the first 30 days of the Baghdad security plan there was a very slight downtick in the amount of violence,'' said a senior American officer, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly. ''Everybody had very high expectations. They thought it would bring it down dramatically.''
 But the violence continued unabated and is now at a high. There has been a vicious cycle in which terrorist bombings have encouraged the Shiites to expand their armed militias, which have in turn alarmed the Sunnis, some of whom have made common cause with the most fanatical insurgents. The spiral of sectarian attacks has become more worrisome to the American command than the insurgency.
 There is now a realization that the prime minister's first plan relied too much on untested Iraqi troops and the Iraqi police. Hence, the increase in American troops and the American military police.
 The Stryker units that are being sent will provide the military with a wheeled armored vehicle that can maneuver more easily through the city than a tracked vehicle like an M-1 tank or a Bradley fighting vehicle.
 For all the talk of new military deployments, however, the plan will depend mightily on parallel moves by Mr. Maliki's government to improve the lot of ordinary Iraqis. This is, in the final analysis, an approach that will require the careful synchronization of military, political and economic moves -- no small challenge for an Iraqi administration that is still struggling to develop its capacity to govern.
 The American and Iraqi forces may temporarily stabilize a neighborhood, but the ultimate loyalty of its residents, many of whom have been sitting on the fence even while they have been desperate for security, will reflect the government's ability to demonstrate that there are tangible benefits for cooperating.

HEADLINE: What's Mannerly, Rowdy and Jabs Blair? Question Time

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

DATELINE: LONDON, July 25 

 BODY:
The rules governing the ritual known as prime minister's questions, the weekly parliamentary contest between the government and the opposition, are fairly clear. 
 Ask a question; do not make a speech. Do not address other legislators as ''you'' (or ''Yo!''). Instead, call them ''the honorable gentleman'' or ''the honorable lady.'' No hand-to-hand combat or impromptu use of the Vulcan Death Grip.
But torturing the prime minister by repeatedly accusing him of being a washed-out has-been who should honor his pledge to leave office, while other legislators shout, whistle, guffaw and stamp their feet? Perfectly acceptable. 
 ''I think the prime minister needs to mug up on this area; after all, he will be moving house soon,'' the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, David Cameron, said last Wednesday, referring to government delays in a new program affecting home buyers. 
 His colleague Robert Goodwill asked in mock innocence whether Prime Minister Tony Blair had considered traveling to Scarborough for his summer vacation. ''Many people who visit Scarborough as tourists subsequently decide to make it their permanent retirement home,'' Mr. Goodwill said.
 Unlike the collegially constructed national legislatures in places like the United States, where everyone sits in a convivial semicircle, the House of Commons was built to be adversarial, with legislators glaring directly at one another across a narrow divide. Their benches -- they do not have individual seats -- are placed the length of two swords apart, which in times past was enough to prevent outbreaks of physical violence. 
 During prime minister's questions, the goal is to score points any other way you can, including witty one-liners, withering putdowns, low-blow ad hominem remarks, muttered asides and the enthusiastic verbal pummeling of anyone who falters. 
 After nine years in power, the once inviolable Mr. Blair has looked vulnerable to such attacks lately, what with so much going wrong at once.
 The health service is in financial crisis. Plans to issue national identity cards have been delayed. The Iraq war is increasingly unpopular. The government is facing charges that it rewarded its biggest donors by nominating them for membership in the House of Lords. In the Commons, Labor's once mighty majority has dwindled to a sliver. Mr. Blair's tough-guy deputy, John Prescott, has become entangled in personal and political scandals. 
 All told, this gives the ravening opposition plenty of good material, particularly when it comes to the matter of Mr. Prescott, who recently admitted to an affair with his secretary and was then spotted playing croquet when he was supposed to be filling in for Mr. Blair.
 A man who once responded to an egg-throwing incident on the campaign trail by punching the perpetrator, Mr. Prescott does not like to be teased. That is why the Conservatives took such delight in begging Mr. Blair last Wednesday to remain in Britain for his summer vacation. 
 ''One of the benefits for the rest of us, of course, is that he would not have to leave the deputy prime minister in charge,'' said John Maples, who represents Stratford-upon-Avon. 
 Like the feral schoolboys in ''Lord of the Flies,'' members of Parliament are quick to pounce on weakness. When in the heat of the moment Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once reverted to her humble roots and used the regional word ''frit'' in place of ''frightened,'' the Labor Party never let her forget it, shouting ''Frit! Frit!'' at delicate parliamentary moments for years afterward. 
 More recently, when Mr. Blair said that ''what we need is more antisocial behavior'' (he meant antisocialbehavior legislation), the Tories practically fell off their benches with laughter. 
 Although Mr. Blair is a deft politician who has outlasted four Conservative leaders since taking power, there are signs that he might finally be wilting under the strain of these attacks. It does not help that he is essentially a lame duck, having said that he plans to step down sometime before the next general election. 
 At prime minister's questions, the usual pugilistic gleam in his eye has been replaced by an aura of weariness, even defensiveness. ''You can always tell when he's on the back foot, because he gets cross and unhappy,'' said Nick Assinder, who as political correspondent for BBC News Interactive writes a regular column about prime minister's questions. 
 The crosser Mr. Blair gets, the merrier it makes Mr. Cameron, whose vow last year to put an end to ''Punch-and-Judy politics'' in Parliament lasted about five minutes. 
 Last Wednesday, in the last question session before Parliament's summer recess, a noisy recklessness prevailed. In a snide reference to the cowboy outfit Mr. Prescott recently admitted accepting from an American millionaire who hopes to build a casino in London, the Tories greeted him with snide cries of ''Howdy!'' 
 Not that Labor remained silent. After one too many insults, Mr. Prescott -- sitting next to the prime minister like Humpty Dumpty, his face screwed up in a permanent scowl -- called one of his tormenters an idiot. 
 When William Hague, the former Tory leader, told him he should resign, he responded by pointing out that for 35 years he had worked only in the House of Commons -- unlike Mr. Hague, who has a lucrative sideline in after-dinner speeches and company directorships. Other Laborites helped him out. ''Millionpound Hague!'' yelled one. 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Cameron enumerated a series of government plans that he said had been abandoned by the prime minister. After each one, he repeated the word ''dropped,'' his voice rising in a crescendo as his fellow Tories picked up the mantra like worshipers at a revival meeting. 
 Rather than answer most of Mr. Cameron's charges directly, Mr. Blair resorted to his usual defense these days: he counterattacked, listing several Tory programs that he said were particularly feeble. ''Before you criticize our policy making skills, you should acquire some of your own,'' he said. 
 Mr. Cameron pointed out that the purpose of prime minister's questions was to give the opposition the chance to question the government, not the other way around. 
 ''These sessions are about the prime minister answering questions on behalf of the government,'' he said. ''It's high time he and his deputy saddled up and rode off into the sunset.''

HEADLINE: Talking Turkey With Syria

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria 

 BODY:
One wonders what planet Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice landed from, thinking she can build an international force to take charge in south Lebanon without going to Damascus and trying to bring the Syrians on board.
 Two Syrian officials made no bones about it when I asked their reaction to deploying such a force, without Syrian backing: Do you remember what happened in 1983, each asked, when the Reagan administration tried to impose an Israeli-designed treaty on Lebanon against Syria's will?
I was there, I remember quite well: Hezbollah, no doubt backed by Syria or Iran, debuted its skills for the world by blowing up the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the U.S. Marine and French peacekeeping battalions. This is not a knitting circle here. 
 Can we get the Syrians on board? Can we split Damascus from Tehran? My conversations here suggest it would be very hard, but worth a shot. It is the most important strategic play we could make, because Syria is the bridge between Iran and Hezbollah. But it would take a high-level, rational dialogue. Dr. Rice says we can deal with Syria through normal diplomatic channels. Really?
 We've withdrawn our ambassador from Damascus, and the U.S. diplomats left here are allowed to meet only the Foreign Ministry's director of protocol, whose main job is to ask how you like your Turkish coffee. Syria's ambassador in Washington is similarly isolated. 
 Is this Syrian regime brutal and ruthless? You bet it is. If the Bush team wants to go to war with Syria, I get that. But the U.S. boycott of Syria is not intimidating Damascus. (Its economy is still growing, thanks to high oil prices.) So we're left with the worst of all worlds -- a hostile Syria that is not afraid of us.
 We need to get real on Lebanon. Hezbollah made a reckless mistake in provoking Israel. Shame on Hezbollah for bringing this disaster upon Lebanon by embedding its ''heroic'' forces amid civilians. I understand Israel's vital need to degrade Hezbollah's rocket network. But Hezbollah's militia, which represents 40 percent of Lebanon, the Shiites, can't be wiped out at a price that Israel, or America's Arab allies, can sustain -- if at all.
 You can't go into an office in the Arab world today without finding an Arab TV station featuring the daily carnage in Lebanon. It's now the Muzak of the Arab world, and it is toxic for us and our Arab friends.
 Despite Hezbollah's bravado, Israel has hurt it and its supporters badly, in a way they will never forget. Point made. It is now time to wind down this war and pull together a deal -- a cease-fire, a prisoner exchange, a resumption of the peace effort and an international force to help the Lebanese Army secure the border with Israel -- before things spin out of control. Whoever goes for a knockout blow will knock themselves out instead.
 Will Syria play? Syrians will tell you that their alliance with Tehran is ''a marriage of convenience.'' Syria is a largely secular country, with a Sunni majority. Its leadership is not comfortable with Iranian Shiite ayatollahs. The Iranians know that, which is why ''they keep sending high officials here every few weeks to check on the relationship,'' a diplomat said.
 So uncomfortable are many Syrian Sunnis with the Iran relationship that President Bashar al-Assad has had to allow a surge of Sunni religiosity; last April, a bigger public display was made of Muhammad's birthday than the Syrian Baath Party's anniversary, which had never happened before.
 Syrian officials stress that they formed their alliance with Iran because they felt they had no other option. One top Syrian official said the door with the U.S. was ''not closed from Damascus. [But] when you have only one friend, you stay with him all the time. When you have 10 friends, you stay with each one of them.''
 What do the Syrians want? They say: respect for their security interests in Lebanon and a resumption of negotiations over the Golan. Syria is also providing support for the Sunni Baathists in Iraq. Much as the Bush team wants to, it can't fight everyone at once and get where it needs to go. There will not be a peace force in south Lebanon unless it's backed by Syria. No one will send troops.
 I repeat: I don't know if Syria can be brought around, and we certainly can't do it at Lebanon's expense. But you have to try, with real sticks and real carrots. Syria is not going to calm things in Lebanon, or Iraq, just so the Bush team can then focus on regime change in Damascus. As one diplomat here put it to me, ''Turkeys don't vote for Thanksgiving.''

HEADLINE: The Spitzer-Suozzi Debate Transcript 

 BODY:
Following is the text of the debate on Tuesday night between Tom Suozzi and Eliot Spitzer, New York State Democratic gubernatorial candidates, as recorded by The New York Times.
DOMINIC CARTER, MODERATOR. Good evening and welcome to the Schimmel Theater at Pace University in Lower Manhattan. 
 Tonights debate is being broadcast on NY1, NY1 Noticias and WNYC-AM 820 radio, New York City, Capital News 9 in Albany, R News in Rochester and News 10 Now in Syracuse. 
 The hour-long debate is also being seen on News 12 on Long Island and News 12 Westchester and heard on radio stations across upstate New York. 
 Now to the journalists joining me tonight. Here is out panel: Sandra Endo of NY1 News; Brian Lehrer of WNYC radio; Juan Manuel Benitez of NY1 Noticias and Brian Taffe of Capital Tonight. 
 For the gentlemen we are all waiting to hear from tonight, the two candidates: State attorney general Eliot Spitzer and Nassau County executive Tom Suozzi. 
 The format of tonights debate is as follows: 
 Each candidate will have a one-minute opening statement. Then, starting with myself, we will directly ask one candidate a question. The candidate will have 90 seconds to respond. The other candidate will then have a 60-second rebuttal. If the person asking the question or I decide to do so, the first candidate may then have a 30-second additional response. The panelists and myself have the right to follow up our questions, which will not be taken out of the candidates allotted time. The candidates will also have two opportunities tonight to ask each other questions. And we will end this debate with a series of lightning round questions where the candidates can only answer yes or no to the questions that I will ask them. We think you will enjoy that. And that will be followed by a one-minute closing statement. I will begin things by turning to the candidates now for their opening statements and we start with the Nassau County executive, Tom Suozzi. 
 SUOZZI. Thank you, Dominic. 
 New York state government is dysfunctional. Both parties are rotten to the core. We have major problems that exist in the state. 
 You know, Eliots been in office for the past seven-and-a-half years in Albany and hes never really focused on government reform. Instead hes focused on Wall Street. Why? Its government that is hurting us. Now hes embraced by all the politicians, all the insiders and all the lobbyists who have given us this broken system. 
 Theres a real difference between Eliot Spitzer and me. Theres a real choice in this race. 
 I have a proven record as a government reformer, a record as a C.E.O. where Ive proven that government can work for the people.
 As your governor, Ill do everything I can and Ill stand up to whoever I have to to make sure that we improve our schools here in New York City. Ill make sure that we reduce our property taxes and Ill create jobs throughout our states. I can do it because Ive done it. 
 As Nassau County executive, I took the worst-run county in the nation and made it one of the most dramatic turnarounds in this country. New York needs a governor who can do its job. I can do it because Ive done it. Thank you. 
 CARTER. Thank you very much Mr. Suozzi. 
 And now for the attorney general of New York State, Mr. Eliot Spitzer. 
 SPITZER. Thank you, Dominic. Thank you to the panelists. Thank you to all the stations sponsoring this debate. And thank you, most of all, to the citizens of New York who have given me the unbelievable honor and privilege over the last seven-and-a-half years of serving as your attorney general. 
 When I took over on Jan. 1 of 1999, everything changed. An office that was moribund was transformed into an office that spoke to the ethics, the values, the moral vision that we believe in. 
 We took on pharmaceutical companies that were lying to the public, companies out of state that were polluting our air, government agencies that were defrauding us, that were wasting our tax dollars and, yes, we took on those companies on Wall Street that were violating their trust to us by squandering and lying to us and wasting away our pension dollars and our savings. 
 If I am fortunate enough to be elected governor on Jan. 1 of 2007, everything will change again. I will take those same values, those ethics, that moral vision, and transform the governors office so that we will first and foremost revive an economy by cutting property taxes, controlling spending, investing in the infrastructure that we need. We will begin to reform an educational system, a health care system, that are dysfunctional. And we will fundamentally change government so that it reflects the moral vision that we all share. 
 I hope you will join me in that effort. Thank you. 
 CARTER. Thank you, Mr. Spitzer. 
 And now, gentlemen, it is time to turn to the questions and Mr. Suozzi, you will face the first question tonight from myself. It is a two-part question: 
 Why should voters have any confidence that you have the experience or the knowledge to lead the entire state? You have shown that you are very good at upsetting the apple cart, if you will, on the campaign trail, accusing Mr. Spitzer of being the ultimate Albany insider, charging he has expressed very few specifics to tell us how he will pay for his ideas. But why should anyone think that you will be able to work well with the leaders of the state legislature next year? 
 And, Mr. Suozzi, while you have referred to Mr. Spitzer as the ultimate insider, in Nassau County are you an insider of sorts in which you have apparently taken donations from for your golf outing from companies that receive county contracts? And apparently you have used county employees to gather your petitions to get on the ballot. Do you want it both ways here? 
 SUOZZI. That sounded like an eight-part question, Dominic. But I will try and answer every single piece of it. Thats really the perfect question. I do have to convince the voters of New York State that Im the better candidate for governor of the State of New York. 
 Now the difference between Eliot and I is that hes a prosecutor. Im a chief executive. And the thing that Ive established in my experience as county executive of Nassau County, that I can take a large complex government and make it work better for the people Nassau County was rated literally the worst-run county in the United States. Its bond rating was one step above junk bond status. It had massive deficits. Now fast-forward to today, four years later. Nassau as a county is considered the most dramatic financial turnaround in the nation. Weve received more bond upgrades that any municipality in the United States. I beat the Republican machine in Nassau County. I became the first Democrat with a Democratic legislature in Nassau County since 1917. And I did it I had to stand up to my own party in the process. I had to run in a Democratic primary against the Democratic chairman. 
 So my whole race, whether its the government reforming government, making government work, battling with Albany and getting things done in Albany, or the politics of standing up to powerful political machines, my message is the same: I can do it because Ive done it. 
 Eliots been in office for seven-and-a-half years. He promised us he would go after government corruption. Yet the headlines hes received over the past seven-and-a-half years have been about Wall Street and the insurance industry and the record industry. He has not gone after government corruption. Hes not gone after the dysfunctional system that we have in Albany. Its not a matter of getting along with the legislators. Its a matter of making the reforms that are necessary so that they realize its in their political interest to make those reforms. 
 CARTER. Thank you, Mr. Suozzi. Mr. Spitzer. 
 SPITZER. Yes, sir. 
 CARTER. Your reaction to what he just said. And then I have a question for you. 
 SPITZER. Well, I think that Tom, and I give him credit for some successes in Nassau, but I think that the reality is that the financial turnaround that he has highlighted is a consequence of one thing: property tax increases. One of the things that we have not heard from Mr. Suozzi is that when he came into office, he promised that he would not raise property taxes. And yet what he has done is raise property taxes, first when he was the mayor of Glen Cove, second, when he was the county executive, third, it is built into his incoming upcoming budget, fourth, he has proposed a tax on a toll on the L.I.E., and fifth, to pay for what he now pretends will be a property tax cut that he supports, hes talking about a $1 billion sales tax increase. 
 And so I would say to Mr. Suozzi: What you have done repeatedly is raise taxes. What I have done is use the tools available to me. He makes much of the fact that Ive been a prosecutor. Indeed, thats what the role of attorney general is. I have done the job I have had. I would now like to take on another job where I will be able to do more in certain areas. But we have done a remarkable amount. In Medicaid, which I know we will talk about, up 2,000 percent in recoveries. Government authorities that nobody had been talking about, we have said over and over they must be fundamentally reformed. We have led that charge. I am enormously proud of what we have done in that regard. 
 CARTER. Mr. Spitzer, let me ask you a quick follow-up here. Sort of along the lines of the questions that I just directed toward Mr. Suozzi: Why should anyone expect real change from you when many of your supporters are the members of the current political establishment? 
 SPITZER. Dominic, the supporters whom I value, the supporters who are legion out there, are the real people of New York State whose interests Ive represented. When I go up to Lackawanna and I speak to voters in the street and they say Thank you for standing up to the polluters, the pharmaceutical companies, the corruption in government, they say thank you. I thank the cops, the firefighters, the Sierra Club, Naral. These are not partisan interests; these are real people who speak to the values and the concerns that we share. That is what I care about. 
 CARTER. Mr. Suozzi. 
 SUOZZI. Dominic, this is why we need to have multiple debates because Eliot Spitzer just said that the way I solved the problem in Nassau County was by raising property taxes and thats all I relied on. And he knows thats just false. I reduced the work force to the smallest its been in 30 years. I cut $100 million in waste, fraud and abuse. I stood up to the most powerful political interests, the P.B.A. union out in Nassau County, to get historic concessions from them. I cut borrowing in half. I raised property taxes my first time in office but my first year in office but Im the only county in all of New York State, the entire state of New York, that has not raised property taxes for the past three years in a row. I took what was the worst-run county in this country this is the difference between you and I, Eliot. You dont understand what it takes to manage a large, complex, multibillion-dollar government. It requires a whole panoply of things. 
 And we have to continue to debate these issues so the people will find out the real differences between you and I. Being a prosecutor you cant solve the problems of New York State by issuing subpoenas and filing lawsuits. Youve got to manage employees. Youve got to stand up to powerful political interests and you have to make the government work for the people. 
 For the past seven-and-a-half years 
 CARTER. O.K. 
 SUOZZI. you have not done that in office. 
 CARTER. A quick rebuttal, Mr. Spitzer. A quick rebuttal. A quick rebuttal from the attorney general. And then well move on to the panel. 
 SPITZER. Dominic, if I could be very clear, you cannot change all the problems with subpoenas and lawsuits. We have encountered many problems, solved many problems, solved many major issues. There are other problems only a governor can solve. That is why Im running for governor. That is why Im asking the publics support in that regard. 
 CARTER. O.K. Thank you, gentlemen. It is now time to go to our panel. And we start with our own Sandra Endo. 
 ENDO. Thank you so much, Dominic. Mr. Spitzer, this question is for you and were talking about lawsuits here. The states highest court ruled that same-sex marriages are not legal in New York. You said, if elected governor, you would draft legislation to legalize gay marriage. Yet as state attorney general, you argued against it on behalf of the state. 
 If you felt so strongly that same-sex marriages should be legal, why didnt you recuse yourself from the suit?
 SPITZER. Because Because the role of recusal is not one where you disagree with the outcome or the position of the state. My client over the last seven and a half years has been the State of New York. I am constitutionally obligated. It is my sworn duty to represent the state. Every attorney general over years has understood that. It is the right and only thing to do. And in fact we have done so in many cases where I disagreed with a particular outcome of the case. But that is the job. And anybody running for this office should understand it. Any lawyer should understand it.
 Now, my particular position on the issue has also been very clear. I have said with great clarity that I think that same-sex marriage should be legal. I will propose a bill to permit that to be the case here in the State of New York. And I will act on that if Im fortunate enough to be elected governor next Jan. 1.
 Q. Since were talking about specifics here in the debate, what other cases specifically did you disagree with, yet you had to argue on behalf of the state for?
 SPITZER. Sure. I will give you one where again we won, but I wish that the policy were otherwise. Cameras in the courtroom, which I think is a critically important issue in terms of media access to the judicial system. I believe we should permit cameras in the courtroom. I have said so publicly. I have supported the legislation that would permit cameras to be permitted into the courtroom. And yet the Court of Appeals, pursuant to our arguments, deemed that statute that bans them to be constitutional. So we won the case, but again I disagree with the outcome. But that is the job of being attorney general. There is a huge array of cases 
 Q. How about school funding specifically?
 SPITZER. School funding, again, I have said repeatedly I would come to a different result with respect to the C.F.E. issues, that again no doubt we will discuss this evening. But it is the constitutional obligation of the attorney general of the state to represent his or her client, that is the State of New York. And that is what I have done. The public understands it. And I think it is the right and only thing to do.
 Q. All right, Mr. Suozzi. You have a very different view on gay marriage. And you dont support same-sex marriages, yet you have said that you hope for a way for gay and lesbian couples in long-term relationships to have, quote, the same economic rights and legal protections as married couples. Why not let same-sex couples get married like anyone else?
 SUOZZI. Let me first respond to some of the points that Eliot just made in his response, with a lot of legalese and technicalities. Its shocking to me, when asked which cases he disagreed with the governor on, that he brought up cameras in the courtroom and not the campaign for fiscal equity as the first case. I mean its Now he knows Im a lawyer. He said lawyers should know this. I know as a lawyer that in every instance you could have hired outside counsel if you disagree with the governor. Your commercials say: I represent the people of New York. It doesnt say: I represent the governor.
 So the reality is every one of your predecessors, every single attorney general in the history of the State of New York has hired outside counsel when they disagreed with the governor on serious political matters.
 Now regarding same-sex marriage, I am opposed to gay marriage. Eliot supports gay marriage. I believe I believe that every single person regardless of their sexual orientation is entitled to be treated with human respect and dignity. And I believe that gay couples, same-sex couples, lesbian couples should have the opportunity to enjoy the same legal rights and economic benefits that heterosexual couples do. As county executive of Nassau County, I provided for health insurance for same-sex couples who work in our government. And I would, as governor, work to create civil unions so that legal and economic benefits could be provided for same-sex couples. But I do not agree with Eliot Spitzer and I do not support gay marriage.
 Q. However, a lot of gay rights activists argue that they just want recognition here, Mr. Suozzi. So isnt it discriminatory in name only then?
 SUOZZI. It is I think a lot to do with semantics. But for me and my religion, gay marriage or marriage, I should say, is a sacrament. And I believe that many other people feel the same way. But I think you can have the same legal and economic benefits through civil unions to provide for inheritance rights, for health insurance benefits, for opportunities to enjoy a lot of the same legal and economic benefits.
 Q. Mr. Spitzer, you have a chance to respond.
 SPITZER. If I could make two quick points. First, semantics is not what this is about. This is about equality. Equality means giving people the rights that they are entitled to and that means marriage.
 Second, and this is a very fundamental point that I think every lawyer should understand, it would have been the height of arrogance on my part to say to the governor, to the citizens, to the taxpayers: I disagree with this case, therefore, I will force you to shoulder the burden of $10-, $20-, $30-million of legal expenses because I dont want to represent the state.
 And, Tom, youre simply wrong you are simply wrong when you say other attorneys general have done that. They havent done it. Its the wrong thing to do. This is what the job requires. It is obligatory. It is my sworn oath of office. And Im proud to have done it.
 SUOZZI. Eliot, specifically Let me just say this one point. Very brief. Very brief.
 Q. Very brief.
 SUOZZI. Specifically, in the C.F.E. case, you predecessor had outside counsel to represent the state in that matter. And you brought it in-house. Now why would you do that if you disagreed with the policy?
 SPITZER. I disagreed Because it was costing First, the representation was terrible. He chose a politically connected law firm, gave it out as a contract. And it was costing the taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. It was wrong 
 SUOZZI. So you disagreed with the suit 
 SPITZER. It was wrong and improper. And that is why 
 [BOTH SPEAKING OVER ONE ANOTHER]
 SUOZZI. So you disagreed with the policy. But for the last seven and a half years youve gone along with the policy.
 Q. Gentlemen, I have to Mr. Suozzi Mr. Spitzer Gentlemen. Can we please get along, gentlemen.
 SUOZZI. Cant we just get along, Eliot?
 Q. We have to stick to the rules here. And for the audience, I would please ask you to try to keep your reaction at a minimum, simply for the fact that we want to try and get as much information from these two men that want to be governor as possible. Lets now move to the next question, and its coming tonight from Brian Lehrer.
 Q. Thank you, Dominic. Mr. Suozzi, New York State currently has no death penalty statute. If you are elected governor, would you introduce one?
 SUOZZI. No. Im opposed to the death penalty.
 Q. Is there any version of a death penalty law that the legislature could pass that you would sign?
 SUOZZI. I have always been opposed to the death penalty on principle and I will always remain opposed to the death penalty on principle.
 Q. For cop killers, for terrorists?
 SUOZZI. Im opposed to the death penalty.
 Q. Mr. Spitzer, same question. Would you introduce a death penalty statute if elected governor? And is there any version of one that the legislature could pass that you would sign?
 SPITZER. Brian, I have always been philosophically comfortable that the death penalty is appropriate in the context of cases against humanity, crimes against humanity, terrorism, intentional murder of a police officer. Yes, I believe the death penaltys an appropriate sanction. And to answer your follow-up, yes, there will be a bill that will be introduced and there will be one that I would sign in that context.
 Q. What will you introduce specifically?
 SPITZER. Well Im not going to give you the precise provisions and statutes. But those categories of crimes that I just delineated for you, I believe the death penalty is an appropriate sanction for.
 But again, let me say something else, this has not been at the top of my priority list as a matter of law enforcement as a prosecutor for many, many year. I know those measures that win that reduce the rate of crime. The DNA legislation that I pushed for very aggressively this year, that is the sort of bill that has a real impact in the street, that I will push for.
 Q. You say it hasnt been at the top of your agenda, but when you first ran for attorney general in 1994, you distinguished yourself from the other Democratic Party candidates by making a point of your support for the death penalty. That was before the revelations about DNA technology and wrongful convictions. Has your position evolved at all since 1994?
 SPITZER. My position, Brian, has always been the same, that it is an appropriate sanction for those crimes that I delineated, where we must have with enormous precision the process, the procedural rules to ensure that we do not have issues of error. And interestingly, since you go back to the 94 race, the first issue I raised in the 94 race was DNA testing long before it have become a popular issue. The issue I raised initially was DNA. Because I said this is a technology that will permit us both to convict and to exonerate. That was the very first issue I raised as a candidate for attorney general.
 Q. Mr. Suozzi, brief response.
 SUOZZI. Eliot did not make those distinctions back in 1994 and his previous campaigns. He sought the death penalty in all instance of capital crimes. So to suggest that you 
 SPITZER. Thats simply wrong, Tom.
 SUOZZI. to suggest that you limited it to terrorists back in 1994 and to cop killers in 1994 is just not accurate. In fact, you ran television commercials, did literature on it saying that this was his big issue.
 SPITZER. O.K.
 Q. Thank you, both. O.K., gentlemen. And now we turn for the next question from my NY1 colleague, Juan Manuel Benitez from NY1 Noticias.
 Q. Thank you, Dominic. And this is for Mr. Spitzer. Under a provision of the Deficit Reduction Act in effect since July 1, states are required to demand proof of citizenship to any Medicaid applicants. Would you enforce this provision if elected governor? And if not, are you considering any kind of statewide executive orders similar to New York Citys No. 41, which prohibits city employees from asking questions about a persons immigration status?
 SPITZER. Yes, I am. I would not enforce that provision. I disagree with it. I do not believe that it is the role of the state to be transformed into one big I.N.S. agent. It is antithetical to what I my views on immigration, on immigration policy. In fact, over the last number of years as attorney general Ive needed to rebuff the efforts of the current Department of Justice in Washington that has tried to force my office and other prosecutorial offices in New York State to participate and ask every witness, every crime victim, to make us I.N.S. agents. And I said no. We are a city and a state of immigrants. We believe in immigrant rights. We believe that that is not the way to resolve this issue. That is politics in its worst form coming out of Washington. We have a more sophisticated, more nuanced, more appropriate view here in New York State.
 Q. Mr. Suozzi?
 SUOZZI. Ive always been a very strong supporter of immigrant rights and continue to be so and actually agree with Eliot on this one particular provision. And we would not try and take over the role of the federal government to enforce their laws. Its inappropriate I believe for local officials, whether its police officers or Medicaid applicant recipients or anyone else in the state government to take over the job of federal officials. If a crime if committed its appropriate for law enforcement to find out if someone has citizenship or not. But otherwise its completely inappropriate. I have a long record as the mayor of the City of Glen Cove and as the county executive of Nassau County for standing up for immigrant rights. And support the McCain-Kennedy bill that was recently proposed in the United State Senate. And I also worked as mayor of the City of Glen Cove 12 years ago to create the first site for the gathering spot for newcomers from Central and South America, which has been a very heated issue. Its the first place anywhere in the United States of America on the East Cost to provide for such a provision.
 Q. Thank you. And just one quick thing to Mr. Spitzer. Would you consider any kind of executive order like No. 41 here in New York City?
 SPITZER. Yes, I would.
 Q. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you Juan Manuel. And now we turn to my colleague, Brian Taffe.
 Q. Thank you, Dominic. Thank you, gentlemen. Thanks for coming. My question is geared towards Mr. Suozzi. As Dominic mentioned at the top of the debate tonight, the breadth of our audience stretches from one end of New York State to the other. So wed be remiss if we did not bring up what has been described as an upstate-downstate divide, a relationship between the two that has been historically marked with tension, even hostility at times each side accusing the other of taking more than their fair share. That said, Mr. Suozzi, the legislature is comprised mostly of downstate residents. You, yourself, are a downstate resident. How do you at once address what has been described as that upstate-downstate divide? And, given the fact that you are a downstater, convince our upstate viewers tonight that their issues matter to you and that you intend to address them equitably? 
 SUOZZI. I think that Im the better candidate for upstate residents, for residents of western New York and throughout the state, because I grew up in a small town and I understand the problems that are being faced in many upstate communities right now. 
 As mayor of the City of Glen Cove, I came into office and our stores were closed up in the downtown. People were hanging out on the street corners. The windows were boarded up. I know what its like to be see, love your hometown and see the place falling apart. And thats the big issue thats happening throughout most of upstate right now, and western New York as well. 
 People want to move back to their hometowns and they cant. They graduate from college. They want to go find a job and they cant find a job. 
 I believe Im the best person to create jobs in upstate New York. For years weve been hearing about politicians saying theyre going to create jobs. It hasnt happened. And the only way its going to happen is not through new programs. Its going to happen because you need to change the hostile business climate that now exists in New York State. 
 Ive specifically proposed to reduce property taxes in New York State. Ive specifically proposed that we change the Wicks Law and we change the binding arbitration laws in New York State that many special interests that support Mr. Spitzer dont want us to change. 
 Ive specifically proposed that we change some of the laws that make the cost of doing business here in New York State too expensive. You know, our insurance costs are some of the highest in the nation because of the scaffolding law. Our workers compensation costs are some of the highest in the nation because of attempts by the legislature to please the trial lawyers. 
 If were going to make New York State competitive again, we need to change these laws. We need to reduce property taxes. We need to create a better environment for business to locate here. 
 Now downstate New York masks the fact that our business climate is so hostile because we have economic engines like Wall Street and the insurance industry and the entertainment industry and the real estate industry. 
 But if you cut off north of Putnam and Rockland County, it would be the poorest state in the United States of America. 
 Weve lost half the population over the past couple decades. 
 So as governor of New York, I have three priorities: Reduce property taxes; improve schools in our cities and create jobs in upstate New York. 
 CARTER. O.K. Mr. Suozzi. 
 TAFFE. O.K. Well talk, hopefully, a bit more about the business climate coming up in the debate. But, Mr. Spitzer, critics of the way the present administration has been run have suggested that the epicenter of government in New York State has moved from Albany increasingly downstate less state business getting done in Albany where it historically has always been done. That leads me to ask you if you, as governor, would move the epicenter of government back to New York back to Albany if not just with the appearance of doing business in the capital upstate? And does that include living in the governors mansion? 
 SPITZER. The answer is, I think there are three yess that follow from your question. But well let me parse it a little bit. I have traveled the state for seven-and-a-half years as attorney general. Ive been in every town, every village. I have seen the despair. I have seen the outflow of our kids 180,000 population loss over the last four years. I dont think its half of our population, Tom, but it is 180,000 over the last four years; 25 percent of our kids 20 to 34. And I have a program, I have ideas that will rejuvenate our economy. But most importantly, over the last seven-and-a-half years nobody has come up to me and said, Eliot, youre from the Bronx; you dont understand the problems in Erie County or in Watertown or wherever I happened to be. People have said to me, Thank you for taking up our cause; it is the cause of equity, decency, fairness, justice. Those are the issues people care about. And theyve said to me, you are fighting for those purposes and those causes. Thats what I will continue to do. 
 Now, specifically, when it comes to property taxes, let me be very clear: the property tax proposal that I have, a $6 billion, three-year property tax cut, is focused on the middle class, focused on those, the farmers, those who need the benefit of this tax plan, those who will benefit. 
 Toms plan, unfortunately, is focused only on 10 counties. It doesnt go to the vast number of counties, those individuals across the state who need help. The economic development program I proposed for our upstate cities investing in our universities, residential construction, special sectors that will do better those ideas will bring our kids back, bring jobs back, bring hope back. 
 TAFFE. O.K. Got to end it there. Mr. Suozzi, if you so choose, Mr. Spitzer took issue with something in particular you said. Would you like to respond? 
 SUOZZI. Id like to respond by saying, Ive talked to families throughout the state. Ive talked to employees. Ive talked to business leaders. And theyve said very specifically that if businesses are to locate in New York State, especially in the upstate area, we have to be more competitive. There has to be a less hostile business environment. The No. 1 reason that people locate in a particular town is because of their job. And if the business is not there, the jobs not there. If the jobs not there, the people arent there. Now, to create a less hostile business climate in New York State is going to require us to change some of the laws that make our business climate too expensive in New York State. Eliot Spitzers been asked specifically would he change the Wicks Law. Hes been asked specifically would he change the binding arbitration laws. Hes been asked specifically would he change workers compensation and scaffolding law. And his response is: I wont tell you. 
 TAFFE. O.K. Thank you, gentlemen. 
 CARTER. Thank you, Mr. Suozzi. 
 SPITZER. Dominic, if I might respond. 
 CARTER. Go ahead quickly, Mr. Spitzer. 
 SPITZER. Tom, let me just make sure you know, as a lawyer, I do always like to make sure that the record is clear so that you can argue the case. The answer was: of course were going to change those laws. We must change the Wicks Law; we must change binding arbitration. These are all issues that of course we have to address. All of my supporters understand it. The citizens understand it. We are unified in that perspective. The issue is getting it done. That is the issue. 
 CARTER. Quickly, Mr. Suozzi. 
 SUOZZI. The problem that exists in New York State right now is that the legislature has no incentive to make the difficult decisions that have to be made because, whether they make the right decision or wrong decision, they get re-elected anyway. Theres a 98.5 percent re-election rate. And we have to hold Mr. Spitzer, Mr. Spitzer has embraced the status quo. Well simply be replacing a Republican governor with a Democratic governor who will tinker around the edges if Mr. Spitzer is elected governor of New York State. We need complete, wholesale reform of our entire government in New York State. I can do it because Ive done it. 
 CARTER. O.K. Thank you very much, gentlemen. 
 And now it is time to give the candidates an opportunity, a chance, to ask a question of their opponent. They will be limited 
 CARTER. And now it is time to give the candidates an opportunity, a chance to ask a question of their opponent. They will be limited to 90 seconds and there will be no rebuttals. And so we begin with you, Mr. Tom Suozzi. 
 SUOZZI. Eliot, Ive said very clearly that youre not the right governor for the State of New York right now because you dont have experience as a chief executive. Ive also said that youre much too entangled in the insider culture that exists in Albany and have never used your public integrity unit to go after government corruption in New York State government. 
 Can you please tell me, Mr. Spitzer Eliot why you believe I wouldnt be a good governor for the State of New York? 
 SPITZER. Well, Tom, here is one important distinction between us. Im not going to delineate why I dont think youd be a good governor. I dont believe in that sort of politics. I will respond to some of the points you made that are, unfortunately, just flat-out false. But Im not going to say anything negative about you. And well get to that issue in a bit a bit later. I created the public integrity 
 SUOZZI. This is the negative part a bit later? 
 SPITZER. I will I will now, the things you have said about me, Tom. I created the public integrity unit. I got enormous push-back from D.A.s around the state who said, You cant do it. I invoked a statute the Tweed Law that hadnt been used for about 100 years and said we will pursue government corruption. We did it with sheriffs offices, public authorities. Alan Hevesi and I have proposed a raft of legislative bills to change the authorities. I am the one who said, five years ago, the public authorities are to state government what the off-balance-sheet partnerships were to Enron. I was called the crusader of the year by Time magazine, not because Im a voice of the status quo. I was called the best public servant in the nation by Readers Digest not because Im a voice of the status quo. I speak to reform; I speak to ethics; I speak to values; I speak to the moral vision of the great state of New York.
 CARTER. O.K. Mr. theres no rebuttal on the question. 
 SUOZZI. Specifically, Mr. Spitzer, its not me. It was The New York Times in 2004 that said very clearly you took your energies and went after Wall Street and the insurance industry and you did not bring the same vigor toward the ills of Albany and state government. We have the most dysfunctional legislature in the United States of America. More legislators in New York state government have been indicted in the past three years than have lost their elections at the polling booth. You have not you have not, during your time in office, gone after the broken, dysfunctional system that exists in New York state government despite your pledge to do so when you first ran for attorney general. 
 SPITZER. Tom, again, Tom, as as as the great Senator Pat Moynihan said, We are all entitled to our own opinions; were not entitled to our own facts. Tom, youre simply wrong. We have made the cases we have made the cases against authorities, elected officials, non-elected officials, authorities. When I took on NYRA, one of the most powerful authorities on Albany the New York Racing Authority I was told by the chairman, who called me and said we indicted 21 people He called me and he said, Eliot, you are on a witch hunt something Ive heard in every context when we rattled the cage of the system. And I said back to him: This isnt Salem; we found witches. And we convicted 20 of those 21, the 21st person, unfortunately, died before trial. We win those cases. We bring them. We uncovered the fraud and abuse in government. 
 CARTER. O.K. Mr. Suozzi, I have to step in. 
 SUOZZI. Ive got to point out, though 
 CARTER. Mr. Suozzi. 
 SUOZZI. You went after the tellers in the betting cages; you didnt go after the power brokers in Albany. 
 CARTER. Mr. Suozzi, you can address it during your response. Mr. Suozzi. Mr. Suozzi, thank you very much. Mr. Spitzer, it is time for your question. 
 SPITZER. Tom, you have said you said, when you got into this race, I have nothing against Eliot Spitzer; I wont knock him down in this campaign. He deserves the reputation that he enjoys. Hes done a great job as attorney general. And then, since then, youve given only two substantive speeches. Every day theres been another press release which has personal vitriol. Eighty percent of them have nothing but venom directed toward me, toward my family. You know, youve compared me to all sorts of things. You called me King George. You said standing up to me was like fighting tyranny. Last time I checked, Tom, we hadnt taxed any of your tea. I dont understand. What happened to the notion of an affirmative campaign so we could talk about education, housing, transportation, the issues that matter to the public?
 SUOZZI. Eliot, the Eliot, if you recall, you didnt bring up the substantive issue of property taxes until I confronted you at the Mineola train station. You have refused throughout this campaign to give specific details as to how youll pay for the very sunny promises youve made. Youve promised that youll spend over $20 billion in new transportation projects. Youve promised over a billion dollars in new scientific research. You told the environmental community that youll put more money into the environmental program. You told the state workers that youll hire more public employees. You told people after our confrontation that you would reduce peoples property taxes. Youve told us youll fully fund the schools even though you took the position you took on the C.F.E. case. But you have not given specific details as to how youll pay for these multibillion-dollar proposals that youve made. So I know that you may say that thats personal vitriol. But this is the United States of America. And I would like to debate you on substantive issues in this type of forum every time we get the opportunity. Weve been invited in nine debates and I have agreed to every single one of those debates. And if youll debate me on the issues, Ill meet you any place, any time, to talk about one debate about property taxes, one debate about housing, one debate about schools and one debate about jobs upstate New York. So we can discuss in detail our different ideas we have to solve the problems for the people of the State of New York. 
 SPITZER. Dominic, am I permitted here? 
 CARTER. Mr. Spitzer. 
 SPITZER. Dominic, if I might be permitted a quick rebuttal here. First, Tom, I didnt consider that a confrontation at the train station; that was just a warm embrace you gave me. You wouldnt let go. 
 SUOZZI. Im very nice. Yes. 
 SPITZER. Second, let me be very clear. Ive been talking about property taxes since the first day of this campaign. I have a $6 billion plan that is more specific than yours. In fact, you havent yet explained how the money will be delivered to folks, where it goes. The numbers dont add up. I have explained how we will pay for it. The controller and I Alan Hevesi the most meticulous voice for public and fiscal restraint in the state and I have an $11 billion tax excuse me, budget cut proposal that is detailed and is conservative, overwhelms the $6 billion property tax cut, leaves us 5 billion. And, Tom, again to quote Senator Moynihan, youre not entitled to your own facts. Youre simply way off base with the transportation proposals. And again you havent proposed anything about transportation except a tax on the L.I.E. Our transportation proposals are fully funded through 2009. Our housing program that Ive laid out is funded. We have paid for what we are going to do. 
 CARTER. Thank you, Mr. Spitzer. Quickly, Mr. Suozzi. 
 SUOZZI. Mr. Spitzer, as Ive said before, if your property tax plan was a Wall Street firm, you would have indicted it already. The reality is the reality is is that you propose you propose in your property tax plan 
 SPITZER. Wouldnt that be one case youd actually support against Wall Street, Tom? 
 SUOZZI. Your property tax plan in your property tax plan, youve proposed to get 500-some-odd million dollars from the bigger better bottle bill, which you dont point out the fact that the law has not been passed for the past four years and that youve previously pledged those same $500 million to the environmental community to pay for environmental programs. In addition, in your plan you rely on going after Medicaid fraud. As the attorney general of the State of New York, you have 300 employees and you have not gone after Medicaid fraud with the vigor that you should have because its the most expensive program in the state. 
 CARTER. O.K. I have to step in. In the interest of time, we have to move on. And before we go back to our panel, I would like to ask another question of both of you. A breaking story in terms of it exists as of right now, in Queens, started earlier this week 100,000 people with no power. The agency in charge, Con Ed. But this is a situation that really could affect any city in this state. Mr. Spitzer, you issued a report on Con Ed for the 1999 blackout in Washington Heights. 
 Did you do any follow-up after this report that was somewhat critical? What happened? And also, do you agree with New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg, that Con Ed C.E.O. Kevin Burke deserves praise? Or have you lost confidence in Burke should he go?
 SPITZER. Let me answer sequentially. The report we put out in 1999, which was a remarkably thorough report with respect to both Washington Heights and the Inwood blackout, said to Con Ed: here are the specific steps you have to take to address the distribution system failures, the transformers, the overheating, the potential for another blackout that exists right now. That was 1999. 
 We have followed up with Con Ed and said: What have you done? The reason I want to be governor is because the governor controls an agency called the Public Service Commission. I dont. I cant. We have argued with the P.S.C. about what they have not done to enforce our recommendations. The Public Service Commission could have and should have enforced our recommendations. Had they done so then theres a very real possibility this blackout would not have occurred. 
 We put out a report after the 2003 blackout as well, and made other recommendations. And we said to the P.S.C. then: You are failing in your duty to the public to ensure investment in the transmission system, in the grid. These are technical issues, but this is what a governor should do. And this is why I want to be governor, because there are answers but they have not been implemented.
 Now, do I share my good friend Mike Bloombergs view about the C.E.O. of Con Ed? Absolutely not. I was stunned that he said it. I was stunned that he said it.
 Now, I think we need to dig very deeply and develop the record, figure out where the breakdowns were, and make sure people are held accountable. It will happen. Its got to happen. But the failures are two-fold. Both Con Eds for failure to address these issues that were highlighted for them years ago, and the Public Service Commission, which is directly controlled by the governor of the State of New York.
 Q. So Mr. Spitzer, for the record, youre saying you disagree with Mayor Bloombergs praise? And you didnt answer the question of whether or not Mr. Burke should go.
 SPITZER. How many people should go depends upon the record that we will develop over the next few weeks and months. Many people will go and should go. We dont know who. We dont know how far down. As a prosecutor I do not believe in jumping to conclusions until we see the 
 Q. What do you mean, many people will go? I dont understand the response.
 SPITZER. Because the failure of Con Ed clearly runs very deep. In 1999 we gave them a report which said here are the specific steps you must take. Here are the measures that are important to ensure that there will not be additional blackouts. They failed to implement them. How many people, including the C.E.O., subordinate to the C.E.O., are responsible for that failure? How many people dissembled, lied, misrepresented to the public? We will have to find out. Those are decisions and issues we will dig into. Clearly, the failure was enormous. The pain and agony in Queens to thousands and thousands of individuals and businesses is enormous. And this is a tragedy.
 Q. Thank you. Mr. Suozzi?
 SUOZZI. Let me first say that my heart goes out to the families in Queens. There are a lot of news stories but they dont really tell the whole story about how people are really suffering. There are a lot of senior citizens that are in a lot of trouble. There are a lot of businesses that are going to lose their livelihood because of this. There are a lot of people that are really hurting because of this blackout.
 As the county executive of Nassau County, as the mayor of Glen Cove, Ive dealt with these situations with our local power authority, the Long Island Power Authority. And each instance when there was a major blackout like this I would actually go to the emergency operations center and keep an eye on what was actually transpiring at the utility and coordinate with them. Id provide them with help from our public works department, from our police department, from our health department. Wed put them in touch with any resource we could to try and coordinate together. 
 This is a big difference, again, between Eliot and I. Eliot talks about a report that he wrote. Well, theres an old expression that Italians use my father was born in Italy: Guarde lei mani, non ascoltare la bocca which means watch the hands, dont listen to the mouth.
 Its easy to write reports and say Im going to do this and Im going to do that. Ive addressed these type of problems throughout my career as a chief executive as the mayor of the City of Glen Cove and as the county executive of Nassau County to try and address problems like this. Im in no position whatsoever to second-guess Mayor Bloomberg, whos on the ground, whos dealing with the people at Con Ed to find out whats going on. Because I trust his judgment as a chief executive. Theres no question that people have been hurt very seriously. Theres no question that Con Ed should have done a better job. But Im not going to second-guess the mayor and say that he was wrong.
 Q. O.K. Thank you, Mr. Suozzi and Mr. Spitzer.
 SPITZER[?]. Theres no rebuttal.
 Q. O.K. Thank you. We now go to our second round of questions. We have time for two questions. Well start with Sandra Endo.
 Q. Thank you so much, Dominic. Mr. Suozzi, we all know tonight that were a few blocks from ground zero here at Pace University. And theres another road block in terms of the rebuilding at the site. Now insurance companies may not pay billions of dollars needed for the site because the Port Authority is taking over some of the development from leaseholder Larry Silverstein. What would you do to resolve this situation? And why do you think youre more qualified than Eliot Spitzer to oversee development there?
 SUOZZI. You know, there are so many people in this city, there are so many people in this state and this nation and the world that are waiting for ground zero to move forward. And its a tragedy that its taken as long as it has.
 I believe that Im more qualified to address this issue because of my experience as a C.E.O., as a manager, as a county executive, as a mayor, as a C.P.A. and a lawyer as well. Ive built buildings nothing on this scale obviously. Ive overseen development projects. Ive brought together all the varied resources and brought the people together into the room to negotiate the differences to resolve problems to make things happen. Again, I can do it because Ive done it. 
 Youre not going to be able to summon the insurance company in with a subpoena. Youre not going to be able to summon in the different players with a lawsuit. Youre going to have to bring the players together and find out what their different interests are so you can hold them accountable for what theyre responsible for. I will build the Freedom Tower. Im not going to second-guess the buildings construction. I believe that too many people in this state and in the country and in the world are relying on us to get it done. And I believe that my background and experience as a chief executive makes me better equipped to get it done than Eliot.
 Q. You said youre used to bringing people together to get resolutions done. How do you see yourself working with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver if you continue to criticize him on the campaign trail?
 SUOZZI. You know, I started my Fix Albany campaign, talking about how dysfunctional Albany was. And I said I have to defeat a Democrat in the Assembly and a Republican in the State Senate because both parties are responsible for the dysfunction that exists in Albany. And it was based upon that People said to me at the time: How are you going to get anything done in Albany if youre fighting with Shelly Silver? How are you going to get anything done if youre fighting with Joe Bruno? But it was after my victories that I achieved in those campaigns and I became the president of the New York State Accounting Executives Association where I brought together Republicans and Democrats, upstate and downstate, urban, suburban and rural, executives together to meet with Shelly Silver and Joe Bruno and the governor to get us a cap on the growth of Medicaid, which is one of the biggest factors that have stopped the growth in property taxes at counties throughout the state over the past year. So I have a proven You know, Ill fight when I have to fight.
 Q. You think hes really going to work with you?
 SUOZZI. Listen, if Im elected governor of New York State itll send the clearest message to every single politician in the state that business as usual is over. Because Suozzi got elected Because Suozzi got elected without the help of the lobbyists, without the help of the politicians, without the help of the insiders, and went directly to the people. Itll show the people that government can work. And again, I can do it because Ive done it. Everything I had in my agenda to get accomplished in Albany I got accomplished by doing the Fix Albany campaign. We have our first Empire Zone weve ever had. We got a cap on the growth of Medicaid. And we got the Sewer and Storm Water Authority done. I can do it because Ive done it.
 Q. Thank you. Mr. Spitzer, whats your solution to resolving this battle right now involving the insurers? And will you abide by all the agreements Governor Pataki has made in terms of redeveloping at that area?
 SPITZER. Well, first let me just state up front we dont know what those agreements are. And that is part of the problem. There has been absolutely no transparency 
 Q. Well are you on board with the blueprint right now and the ratio of commercial and residential 
 SPITZER. Well the blueprint itself is contingent upon lease agreements being entered into by September, which is a contingency to the Freedom Tower being constructed. Nobody knows if that will or will not happen. So the economic viability of that building is very much in doubt.
 Just today the L.M.D.C. was disbanded or plans to have it disbanded were announced. The L.M.D.C. was supposed to be the preeminent decision-making entity with respect to ground zero. 
 And my office is there. My office is one block away. I was there on that horrific day. We all lost friends, colleagues. We know what the tragedy was. And today when I look out the window of my office I see ground zero. And you know what I see? Nothing happening. If I look one block beyond that I see a construction site. A private entitys building. I see cranes, jackhammers, pile-drivers. There is a problem with the state government. And when there were press releases that were sent out a few months ago saying the governor had announced that a senior aide would now be in charge, there will be no such press release if Im elected governor. And the reason is very simple: I will personally be in charge. I will make sure we get that redevelopment done. I know how to do it. The insurance companies will pay. They will be obligated to pay. And we will get that development done.
 Q. Thank you. In the interest of time, just a quick follow-up. You said a lot of the economics are not clear right now determined on leases that have to be signed by the end of the year. Do you agree with Mayor Bloomberg and your opponent that more residential units should be placed in that area?
 SPITZER. I think right now where things stand is that, again to get technical, towers 2, 3 and 4 it is agreed should be commercial. The quantum, the quantity of retail space is very large and is agreed upon. Tower 5 will be a combination of condo-hotel-residential. And then the Freedom Tower is what is up in the air, depending upon whether the economic viability is established. And if you listen to Tony Kosha[SP?], if you listen to those at the Port Authority who are speaking about this, you will hear them say the same thing: We dont yet know whether those leases will be executed; if theyre not, then we have to reconsider that issue.
 Q. O.K. Thank you very much.
 Q. Thank you very much, Sandra. And now we turn to the final question of the night, is from my colleague, Brian Lehrer.
 Q. Thank you, Dominic. Mr. Spitzer, I believe you referred tonight to an $11-billion tax cut plan.
 SPITZER. An $11-billion budget savings.
 Q. I believe youve referred in the past to an $11-billion plan to fund the public schools in New York City, in addition, to satisfy the campaign for fiscal equity ruling. I dont think youve gotten specific about how. So you talk about $11 billion in budget reductions to fund that 
 SPITZER. Thats correct. Thats correct.
 Q. I understand that now. But can you get specific and tell us what you will cut or how you will save in order to spend that extra $11 billion on New York City.
 SPITZER. I think theres a little bit of confusion. The $11-billion budget savings is what Alan Hevesi, the comptroller, and I proposed. And it is detailed with great specificity. Some of it comes from the way we handle the states investments, which are right now to a certain extent spread among many different agencies. We can increase those returns. We will do it. Some of it has to do with how we handle non-personal expenditures everything from buying pencils to information technology. We will do it. Some of it has to do with the way we run the authorities. They have not implemented some of the very smart things the comptroller has suggested. There are hundreds of millions of dollars per year in savings in health care that we will implement. So that totals 11 billion over three years. Six billion of that 11 is dedicated to the property tax cut, that Ive explained in great detail, focused on the middle-class taxpayers who need it across the State of New York, and the renters in New York City who also pay those taxes through their rent. We will do that. That leaves $5 billion which we can use to certainly make the first of the sequence of installments on C.F.E. The C.F.E. payment, the capital piece, has been paid through the bonding that the state legislature approved last year. The operating costs we will pay both through that $5 billion and through increased revenue coming from the V.L.T.s and other revenue generators that derive from casino gambling.

 SPITZER. Thats correct.
 Q. O.K. Mr. Suozzi?
 SUOZZI. No.
 Q. O.K. We thank you very much, gentlemen, for taking part in the lightning round. And so as we close this debate tonight Im going to ask you to please try to keep your closing remarks as short as possible because we have gone over the time period. Mr. Tom Suozzi, the county executive of Nassau County.
 CARTER. Mr. Tom Suozzi, the county executive of Nassau County. 
 SUOZZI. I think tonight people have started to hear some of the real differences between Eliot and I. But theres so much more we need to explore. And I hope that Eliot will agree to debate me in some of the broadcast debates and other cable debates that have been scheduled throughout the rest of the state of New York. 
 There are real differences between he and I. 
 There is a clear choice in this race. And a one-hour debate should not determine whos going to be the governor for the next four years. 
 I have a proven record as a chief executive. Ive proven that I can make government work for people. Ive proven that I can make it more affordable. Ive proven that I can provide better services to people by managing government well. 
 We cant forget that governments are multibillion-dollar enterprise. If New York State was a government if New York state government was a business, it would be a $113 billion business with 191,000 employees and itd be on the brink of bankruptcy. 
 The management team has been more concerned about keeping their jobs than doing their jobs. If New York State was a Wall Street firm, Mr. Spitzer would have indicted them already.
 But the reality is is that in the past seven-and-a-half years, he has not taken on the state government; hes focused all of his energy outside of government, on Wall Street and the insurance industry and the record industry. 
 CARTER. Thank you, Mr. Suozzi. 
 And now, the current attorney general of New York State, Mr. Eliot Spitzer. 
 SPITZER. Dominic, thank you. Tom, thank you for participating. 
 Let me just pick up on something you said. Im not trying to indict state government; Im trying to take it over. Were trying to reform it. Were going to reform it. Were going to reform it. Were going to make it work for the people of the State of New York. That is what Ive done as attorney general. That is why Time magazine called me crusader of the year. That is what we have done in every industry whether its private, public, not for profit. We have found problems; we have rooted them out. We have reformed. 
 That is what is necessary. 
 Nobody is a more fervent reformer than I. Ive never been elected to a job other than attorney general. Ive not been a career politician. Ive been dedicated to making the peoples voices heard, restoring the ethics, the values, the moral vision of this great state to government. That is what we have done for seven-and-a-half years. That is what I would like to continue to do. 
 I have the deep-seated optimism and sense of hope that New York State can be restored to what it once was that beacon of the aspirations for all who are here and who want to come here. 
 All we need is the desire, the energy to do it. 
 I ask the voters of this state to join me in that effort. It will be a great day on Jan. 1 when we begin. 
 Thank you very much. 
 CARTER. And we thank you very much, Mr. Spitzer, as well as as Mr. Suozzi. Thank you very much, candidates, for joining us tonight. That concludes this debate. On behalf of NY1, NY1 Noticias, Capital News Nine, R News, News 10 Now and WNYC Radio as well as News 12, Id like to thank the candidates tonight for attempting to answer all of our questions. And of course we would like to thank Pace University and its president, David Caputo, for allowing us for use of their facilities here.
 Again, thank you and good night.

 BODY:

EXPECTING A BLOCKBUSTER -- A heart drug still in the testing phase at Pfizer will be offered as a stand-alone pill, rather than only in combination with Lipitor, as Pfizer had first planned. Doctors had criticized the company over the combination approach to sales. [Page C1.] 


JAUNTING BY JET -- Entrepreneurs are betting on air taxis as a way to entice business travelers who are frustrated by jam-packed planes, endless delays and long security lines. [C1.]

HONDA TAKES TO THE AIR -- Honda known for its small cars, plans to offer what could become the Honda Civic of the skies. The car maker said the HondaJet would be fuel-efficient, with twin engines and room for six passengers. [C4.]

HOUSING CATCHES ITS BREATH -- The torrid pace of the housing market is slackening as prices level off and properties stay on the market longer. Experts say the housing industry appears to be evolving into a buyer's market. [C1.]

TWO SIDES OF GOLDMAN -- A new focus at Goldman Sachs has exposed fault lines between the investment bankers who advise blue-chip corporate clients and the private-equity bankers who manage multibillion-dollar funds. [C1.]

NEW UNION FRONT -- The Service Employees International Union has undertaken a drive to unionize more than 100,000 security guards nationwide -- a group of workers that in many cities is more than 50 percent African-American. The average pay for guards, says the union, is $8.50 an hour or $17,000 a year. [A13.]

REGIONAL HANDSHAKES -- As global trade talks falter, regional deals are moving to the forefront. India, for example, is planning to sign an agreement with Japan and is talking with the European Union. The United States trade representative, Susan C. Schwab, above, said that America would also seek regional agreements and singled out Asia as a prime target. Countries like China and India, with fast-growing economies and a large middle class, are attractive markets for Western companies that manufacture goods or provide banking and insurance services. [C3.]

TROUBLESOME BLIPS -- The Federal Aviation Administration has scheduled air-traffic controllers at seven of its busiest radar offices so that at least 70 percent of the controllers on a shift are always at their radar scopes, in effort to cut costs and errors. But controllers say they are working without breaks longer than rules allow, and their union has complained. [A14.]

STRONG PHONE RESULTS -- AT&T and BellSouth, heading toward a merger, are continuing to add high-speed Internet customers, and AT&T's wireless group, Cingular, is still on top and getting stronger. Those bright spots, as well as the substantial savings they are wringing from the integration of SBC Communications and AT&T along with Cingular and AT&T Wireless, were behind the companies' better-than expected profit growth in the second quarter. [C6.]

AMAZON PROFIT DROPS -- The online retailer Amazon.com reported a steep drop in its quarterly profit, while its sales continued to rise. The results showed the effects of higher expenses as Amazon offered free shipping and lower prices in response to more competition. [C7.]

SLUMP AT NISSAN -- Nissan Motor reported a slight quarterly profit, but said operating income dropped steeply amid a slump in vehicle sales that the company called temporary. Analysts said the performance raised questions about the management of its chief executive, Carlos Ghosn. [C6.]

YUKOS LIQUIDATION APPEARS NEAR -- The Yukos company's fight for existence neared its end on Tuesday when creditors rejected its plans for recovery and recommended that Yukos, once Russia's largest and most successful oil concern, be declared bankrupt. [C6.]

JOBS SITE GETS A LIFT -- The new owner of the two major daily newspapers in Philadelphia said that it had formed an alliance with Monster Worldwide, the parent of the online jobs Web site. The resulting cobranded jobs site will be the first such venture between a big city newspaper publisher and Monster.com. [C5.]

TEEN PEOPLE TO SHUT DOWN -- Time Inc. announced that it was shutting down Teen People, the monthly magazine that was a pioneer in the teenage category when it was founded in 1998. [C5.]

HEADLINE: Growth Slowing Across the Country, Fed Regional Reports Say

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Demand for personal loans is declining near Cleveland, while more low-income families are facing foreclosures around Kansas City. And in New York, tourism has weakened slightly.
 The economic picture varies from region to region, but one trend is becoming increasingly clear: growth is slowing across the country.
The regional reports from the 12 Federal Reserve districts, many of which used words like ''solid'' and ''strong'' to describe economic activity a few months ago, are now saying growth is ''modest'' or ''mixed.'' 
 Reports from each district ''generally indicated continued economic growth during June through mid-July, with numerous individual reports pointing to evidence that the pace of growth has slowed,'' the central bank said in its monthly beige book report on the economy. 
 Weaker growth in consumer spending and housing punctuated the slowing of growth. 
 The Fed noted that consumers were spending less in stores and auto showrooms in part because of high gasoline prices. With the exception of luxury retailers, many stores reported weak or flat sales. Car dealers, the report said, had ''undesirably high'' inventories of sport utility vehicles. 
 And residential real estate activity declined ''with only scattered exceptions.'' The report confirmed what recent housing data has shown -- that homes are taking longer to find a buyer and more of them are sitting on the market unsold. 
 In the New York region, a disproportionate number of unsold homes is on the high end of the market, which includes residences priced at $500,000 and up. In Florida, the Fed said home builders were increasingly turning to incentives to sell houses. In some cases there were reports of Florida developers converting residences into rental units after they encountered difficulty finding buyers.
 The only two regions not to see a general slowdown in housing were St. Louis, which said the pace of home sales was largely unchanged, and Dallas, which reported strong demand and robust construction.
 The general exception to the real estate slowdown was the commercial sector, where demand continues to be strong. 
 The report described a noticeable but slight decline in the overall growth of consumer spending, but not as deep as the slowdown in the housing market. In the Philadelphia region, for example, retailers expect sales to be slow until the back-to-school shopping season begins, but they reported no reason to think overall sales growth would slip. In the Minneapolis district, overall consumer spending increased slightly, but growth was held down by falling auto sales. 
 Wage and price increases, meanwhile, were modest although rising gasoline prices were adding to inflationary pressure nationwide, the report said. 
 ''Scattered reports from various districts indicated an increase in manufacturers' and retailers' ability to pass such cost increases on to final prices.''
 The strong tourism activity reported by the New York region during the first half of the year is showing signs of slowing, the Fed said. Manhattan hotels reported strong business in May and June, but occupancy rates were edging down from their near-record levels of a year earlier.
 The Fed's observations are significant because they help shed light on what the central bank's policy setting committee might do when it meets next month to consider another interest rate increase. With growth in many regions beginning to cool, many economists think the Fed will soon stop raising rates.''The bottom line is that the Fed is not far away from the long-awaited pause in interest rates,'' Brian Bethune, an economist with Global Insight, wrote in a report yesterday.

HEADLINE: Riding the Circuit, Preaching Finance 

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
Michelle A. Jutila wears cowboy boots and jeans as frequently as power suits, but insists it is not a fashion statement. ''I might be stepping in cow pies,'' said Ms. Jutila, who roams southeastern Montana as a circuit-riding business adviser.
 As director of the Small Business Development Center in Colstrip, Mont., Ms. Jutila is on the road 50 percent of the time. Her 23,000-square-mile turf is some of the state's most rural and least populated.
The era of traveling salesmen may be over, and gone, too, are the days when circuit-riding preachers traveled from town to town, serving areas without enough people or funds for churches of their own. 
 But these days, circuit-riding business advisers like Ms. Jutila are traveling to rural areas across the country -- borrowing desks at local banks and chambers of commerce for a Tuesday in one town, a Wednesday in another. They even make house calls to assist budding entrepreneurs and existing small-business owners. 
 One recent morning, Ms. Jutila drove almost three hours to Baker, a town of 1,800, 158 miles from her Colstrip office, to meet with Barry and Stacy-Lynn Ellis, owners of the Baker Livestock Commission, a livestock auction market. The Ellises bought the property several years ago, but it was in worse condition than they expected, with severe water and sewer problems and extensive damage to the corrals. The purpose of the meeting, the fourth or fifth since last fall, was to assess the feasibility and financial options of making repairs or buying additional land.
 ''Her coming here really helps us out,'' said Mrs. Ellis, explaining that they would have lost a day's work if they had to travel to Colstrip. 
 ''If we were making it, we wouldn't be asking for help,'' Mr. Ellis said, but improving their business also ''helps the entire town.'' On sale day, he hires up to 36 employees, and people attending the auctions pour into Baker to eat and shop in local businesses.
 ''One job lost in eastern Montana hurts a lot of people,'' said Ms. Jutila, whose Colstrip office is one of 10 regional small-business development centers in the state.
 A handful of small-business development centers were formed in the late 1970's in a pilot program, and circuit riders appeared soon afterward. ''They've always been able to go where the action was,'' said James J. Chrisman, professor of management at Mississippi State University in Starkville, who studies the centers. 
 Today, there are more than 1,000 centers in all the states, the District of Columbia, and the territories. The Small Business Administration provides up to 50 percent of the operating costs; additional money comes from state and local sources. Though circuit riders are not required by law, Congress mandated that each state provide 100 percent geographic coverage. 
 Having circuit riders from regional centers is often less expensive than running numerous offices, said Jon Ryan, Iowa's director. Budget cuts four years ago caused a reduction in support staff and the closings of four regional centers, leaving 12 instead of 16. That created a greater need for circuit riders to reach those areas not easily served by the remaining offices. 
 No national data is kept about which states have circuit riders, but all states offer one-on-one counseling in the office or by circuit riders, at no charge. 
 Morrison Woods, who runs the center at the University of Texas at San Antonio, estimates that of the 1,000 or so clients his office serves each year in 11 counties, 30 percent to 40 percent are served by circuit riders. Six of nine counselors do circuit riding 22 to 23 days a month, he said.
 Many circuit riders report that rural clients have the same misconceptions about starting a business as the general public does: that it will be easy or that no training is necessary. 
 ''We don't want to discourage people'' Mr. Woods said, ''but instead of a dream, it can become a nightmare.'' 
 What circuit riders do is provide their expertise, offering advice in developing business plans and cash flow projections, as well as discussing the feasibility of ideas and referrals to banks and organizations that provide financing. And circuit riders can help businesses make transitions in a changing economy.
 In Texas, for example, some areas have partly shifted from agriculture to tourism; bed-and-breakfast inns and dude ranches are sprouting up or replacing working farms and ranches, Mr. Woods said. 
 Circuit riders also help reach populations with specific challenges. 
 Montana provides a counselor who exclusively oversees the entrepreneurial development needs of veterans and Native Americans. In Texas, a fair number of counselors are bilingual, to better serve the large Hispanic communities. 
 David Baenziger, a business adviser in the San Antonio center, also counsels clients in the office, as most circuit riders do. But in rural areas clients are ''a little more reticent -- they really want to get to know you, to develop relationships so you can build trust.'' 
 Being on site has some unexpected advantages. ''Sometimes we go into a client's store and be secret shoppers, to see what's what,'' he said. Recently, he visited an adult day care, pretending to be a potential client. ''The owner knew he had problems, but he needed someone'' not known by staff ''to observe.''
 John Donovan, until recently director for the Butte, Mont., center, recalls some unusual visits. One client ran a ''health mine.'' ''Our meeting was at a card table way down in a mine shaft,'' he recounted. ''I was sitting there soaking up radon.'' Another client, a vintage rifle maker, sought advice about adding machinery to improve the manufacturing process. ''I shot one of their large caliber rifles as part of a demo. It was fun, especially hitting the target at 100 yards -- with no scope,'' he said.
 Not all clients own new businesses or even small ones. 
 Sherm Anderson, president of Sun Mountain Lumber in Deer Lodge, Mont., has been in the logging business since 1976. Several years ago he planned to expand into manufacturing, taking the business from $3 million annually to more than $50 million. He considered hiring outside counsel to prepare a highly complex business plan, but went with the local Small Business Development Center in Butte, because Mr. Donovan, the center's adviser at the time, had firsthand knowledge of the economic, geographic and natural resources of the region.
 Small-business development centers nationwide, which serve more than 1.3 million clients a year, are successful, said Donna Ettenson, spokeswoman for the Association of Small Business Development Centers in Burke, Va.
 An association study shows that for each federal dollar used to aid small-business development centers, there is a return of $2.56 in federal taxes paid. And a recent economic impact statement indicates that small businesses that received in-depth assistance from development centers from 2003 to 2004 experienced 10 times the job growth of average American businesses. 
 David W. Muniz, co-owner of Glass and Home Innovations, in Libby, Mont., a client of the Kalispell center, regrets not seeking counsel 20 years ago with his first business. ''I got into business on a wing and a prayer,'' said Mr. Muniz, who was a mill laborer with no business experience. ''I went into it with the desire to not be controlled. That's the worst reason.'' 
 He ended up filing for personal bankruptcy, rather than company bankruptcy, for $500,000 in debt as he felt it was ''morally wrong'' not to repay all of the money, which took five years.
 And, in his current business, he said, ''I've learned to listen to other people.''

HEADLINE: Chicago Orders 'Big Box' Stores To Raise Wage

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM; Shia Kapos contributed reporting from Chicago for this article.

 BODY:
After months of fevered lobbying and bitter debate, the Chicago City Council passed a groundbreaking ordinance yesterday requiring ''big box'' stores, like Wal-Mart and Home Depot, to pay a minimum wage of $10 an hour by 2010, along with at least $3 an hour worth of benefits. 
 The ordinance, imposing the requirement on stores that occupy more than 90,000 square feet and are part of companies grossing more than $1 billion annually, would be the first in the country to single out large retailers for wage rules. 
A gallery packed with supporters of the bill broke into cheers as the measure passed, by a vote of 35 to 14, after four hours of intense speeches and debate. 
 ''This is a great day for the working men and women of Chicago,'' said Alderman Joseph A. Moore, the measure's chief sponsor. Mr. Moore said he had had inquiries about the ordinance from officials in several other cities.
 An Illinois retailers' group said it would challenge the measure in court, and Mayor Richard M. Daley, who opposed the measure, has not said whether he will veto it.
 Wal-Mart's response to the Council's action was swift and blunt.
 ''It's sad -- this puts politics ahead of working men and women,'' John Simley, a Wal-Mart spokesman, said in a telephone interview. ''It means that Chicago is closed to business.'' 
 Wal-Mart will still open its nearly completed branch on Chicago's West Side in September -- the company's first store in the city -- but any future plans ''will likely change,'' Mr. Simley said. 
 In arguing that Wal-Mart and other companies can easily afford to meet the new standards, proponents of the measure pointed to Costco, which says it already pays at least $10 an hour plus benefits to starting workers around the country. 
 In existing stores in the Chicago area, Wal-Mart pays entry-level wages of about $7.25 an hour but its average pay is $11 an hour, a company spokesman told The Chicago Tribune. The company has not revealed details of its benefits.
 With this ordinance, Chicago has opened a contentious front in the growing national movement, led by labor and poverty groups, to raise the incomes of bottom-rung workers through local minimum wage and ''living wage'' legislation. Some economists say such measures will stifle development and deprive consumers of access to cheap goods, but many poverty experts say that local efforts elsewhere to raise wages have not choked off growth and that the expanding, low-paying retail sector can be safely pressed to raise pay. 
 ''We're very confident that retailers want and need to be in Chicago, and the question for the city is what kinds of jobs they will bring,'' said Annette Bernhardt of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University Law School, which helped draft the Chicago bill and has done economic studies of its likely impact. 
 The Illinois Retail Merchants Association condemned the measure as likely to hamper job creation and a form of illegal discrimination, and said it would challenge it in court. 
 Mayor Daley said earlier that the ordinance could impede growth and tax revenues. He did not say yesterday whether he would veto it, but he would have to persuade two aldermen to switch their votes to avoid an override. 
 Some politicians and residents in neighborhoods where new Wal-Mart, Target or Home Depot stores are planned also spoke out against the measure, fearing a loss of jobs, and leaders of black churches dueled over the benefits and risks. 
 The bill was the object of a fierce lobbying battle over recent months, with unions and community groups flooding aldermen with petitions, post cards and telephone calls and retailers doing the same. 
 In a meeting with several black aldermen, Target officials warned that passage of the measure could cause the company to cancel or delay three stores planned for the city's South Side, the aldermen told reporters. 
 Yet the proposal had strong appeal, especially in the city's lower-income black and Hispanic wards. 
 ''The working people were overwhelmingly in favor of this law, and this was conveyed to the aldermen,'' said Madeline Talbott, chief organizer for Acorn, a community group that campaigned for the bill. 
 Alderman George Cardenas, who voted for the ordinance, said: ''We had to make a stand. This is good for people and good for the country.'' 
 The bill comes at a time when many large retailers are increasing their presence in large cities. 
 The drive to raise state and city minimum wages has grown out of frustration with Congress, which has left the federal minimum wage at $5.15 an hour since 1997. At least 22 states have enacted somewhat higher minimum wage laws. 
 San Francisco; Albuquerque; Santa Fe, N.M.; and Washington have across-the-board minimum wage ordinances for all but the smallest businesses. Those in San Francisco and Santa Fe have set levels near that in the Chicago bill without driving out retailers, Ms. Bernhardt said. 
 Ms. Bernhardt said large retailers had saturated suburban markets and had powerful incentives to move into urban areas. 
 Under the bill, minimum wages in the covered stores would rise to $9.25 in 2007 and to $10 in 2010, and be indexed to inflation after that. Benefits would have to total $1.50 an hour in 2007 and $3 in 2010.
 Smaller retailers would remain subject to the state minimum wage of $6.50 an hour. 
 A legal brief prepared recently for the Illinois Retail Merchants Association said the bill would violate equal protection guarantees in the Constitution, but a legal analysis by the Brennan Center at New York University said there was ample precedent for selective imposition of minimum wages by size of business. 
 The bill would affect 35 stores already in Chicago, including branches of Kmart, Target, Toys ''R'' Us and stores like Sears and Lowes. Support for the idea started taking off two years ago when Wal-Mart said it would open its first store in the city in 2006, in the poor Austin ward on the West Side.

HEADLINE: Ohio Supreme Court Rejects Taking of Homes for Project

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA; Christopher Maag contributed reporting from Cleveland for this article.

 BODY:
The Ohio Supreme Court ruled unanimously yesterday that a Cincinnati suburb cannot take private property by eminent domain for a $125 million redevelopment project. 
 The property rights case was the first of its kind to reach a state's highest court since the United States Supreme Court ruled last year that municipalities could seize property for private development that public officials argue would benefit the community.
 The Ohio decision rejected that view, and is part of a broader backlash. Since the ruling last year, 28 state legislatures have passed new protections against the use of eminent domain. 
 ''This is the final word in Ohio, and it says something that I think all Americans feel,'' said Dana Berliner, a lawyer with the Institute for Justice, a public-interest law firm in Arlington, Va., who argued on behalf of the homeowners before the Ohio court. ''Ownership of a home is a basic right, regardless of what the U.S. Supreme Court may have decided.'' 
 Since the Ohio case was argued based on the state's Constitution, yesterday's decision cannot be appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which decides matters involving federal law.
 The United States Supreme Court decision last year made it clear that state constitutions could set different standards for property rights.
 ''The Ohio decision takes the loophole that was left by the U.S. Supreme Court decision and drives a Mack truck right through it,'' said Richard A. Epstein, a law professor at the University of Chicago. 
 Mr. Epstein said the decision was especially surprising coming from the Ohio Supreme Court, which he said had rarely reached unanimous decisions and had often sided with developers. ''But this decision indicates that the justices were entirely distrustful of planning officials and developers working under nebulous criteria.''
 The Ohio decision involves the city of Norwood, which moved in 2002 to seize about 70 houses for a project to build offices, shops and restaurants in a neighborhood widely viewed to be deteriorating. Virtually all the property owners sold their land voluntarily, often at prices greatly above their audited value, state officials said. All but three of the houses at the site have been bulldozed. 
 ''We're just grateful that this is still a constitutional republic,'' said Joy Gamble, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the state. ''We raised our children in that home, we lived there for 35 years, and we planned to live out our retirement there.'' 
 Mrs. Gamble said that after being evicted in February 2005, she and her husband, Carl, moved in with their daughter across the Ohio River in Independence, Ky. 
 ''We were nervous because we knew that the same developer who built the mall across from us with help from the city and eminent domain was the one who wanted our land,'' said Mrs. Gamble, whose house is one of the three still standing on the contested site. ''But in the end, the city and developer took it away and the courts gave it back, which makes you feel like there is real justice.''
 In a 5-to-4 decision last year in a Connecticut case, Kelo v. City of New London, the United States Supreme Court ruled that economic development is an appropriate use of the government's power of eminent domain. That decision gave New London the authority to condemn houses in an aging neighborhood to make way for private development. 
 The legal debate over eminent domain has not been whether governments could condemn private property to build a public amenity like a park or a highway. That power was established by the Fifth Amendment, provided that property owners are given ''just compensation.'' 
 The conflict has been over government attempts to take private homes or businesses for redevelopment projects that at least partly benefit private entities. 
 Two months after the ruling in June 2005, Justice John Paul Stevens, who wrote the majority opinion, said he was bound by the law and legal precedent. But in responding to criticism, he called the outcome ''unwise,'' and said that had he been a legislator he would have opposed it.
 Ms. Berliner of the Institute for Justice said the Ohio decision was a reaction to the growing use of eminent domain by developers and local officials. Since the Kelo decision, more than 5,700 properties nationwide have been threatened with seizure or have been seized through eminent domain, a threefold increase from the numbers before that decision, she said. 
 The Ohio decision was a blow to Norwood officials, who hoped to gain $2 million a year in tax revenue through the seven-acre project. 
 ''The city is running one hell of a deficit,'' said Mayor Thomas Williams, who predicted that the city would run out of money for its operating budget in October. ''We're just trying to generate enough income to keep our doors open.''
 The developer, Jeffrey R. Anderson Real Estate, could not be reached for comment on whether the project would go forward.
 The 58-page Ohio decision said that while economic factors may be considered in determining whether governments can take private property, the economic benefit to the government and community cannot be the only justification used for seizure. 
 ''For the individual property owner, the appropriation is not simply the seizure of a house,'' Justice Maureen O'Connor wrote. ''It is the taking of a home, the place where ancestors toiled, where families were raised, where memories were made.''
 The decision said that justifying the seizure by claiming that the area is deteriorating was unconstitutional because the term is too vague.

HEADLINE: Poll Shows Growing Skepticism in U.S. Over Peace in the Middle East 

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and MEGAN C. THEE; Marina Stefan and Marjorie Connelly contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Americans are overwhelmingly pessimistic about the state of affairs in the Middle East, with majorities doubtful there will ever be peace between Israel and its neighbors, or that American troops will be able to leave Iraq anytime soon, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. 
 A majority said the war between Israel and Hezbollah will lead to a wider war. And while almost half of those polled approved of President Bush's handling of the crisis, a majority said they preferred the United States leave it to others to resolve.
Over all, the poll found a strong isolationist streak in a nation clearly rattled by more than four years of war, underscoring the challenge for Mr. Bush as he tries to maintain public support for his effort to stabilize Iraq and spread democracy through the Middle East. 
 The concerns expressed over the direction of foreign policy also highlight some of the pitfalls facing Republicans as they head toward the November elections with national security front and center. 
 A majority of respondents, 56 percent, said they supported a timetable for a reduction in United States forces in Iraq, a question the two parties have been sparring over, with the White House and most Republicans in Congress taking the position that setting a timetable would send the wrong message. More than half of that group said they supported a withdrawal even if it meant Iraq would fall into the hands of insurgents. 
 Americans support the idea of putting an international peacekeeping force on the border between Israel and Lebanon to calm tensions there, the poll found, but most do not want United States troops to be a part of it.
 By a wide margin, the poll found, Americans did not believe the United States should take the lead in solving international conflicts in general, with 59 percent saying it should not, and 31 percent saying it should. That is a significant shift from a CBS News poll in September 2002 -- one year after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- when the public was far more evenly split on the issue. 
 Yet, in the latest poll, 47 percent gave Mr. Bush good marks for handling the situation in Israel, with 27 percent disapproving and 26 percent saying they did not know. That was the highest registration of approval for the president in any of the poll's performance measures.
 Mr. Bush has experienced a slight increase in his overall job approval rating since the last New York Times/CBS News poll, in May, indicating that the steady erosion in his support over the last year has leveled off and even improved by a few percentage points. Thirty-six percent of those surveyed said they approved of the way he was doing his job, up from 31 percent in May. 
 But with 55 percent saying they disapproved of his performance, the numbers remain far below the comfort zone for a sitting president during a tough midterm election season. In what could be another warning sign for incumbents, more than twice as many people believe the country is heading in the wrong direction than believe it is heading in the right direction. Only 35 percent of respondents said they approved of Mr. Bush's handling of foreign policy in general, though that was up from the 27 percent in May, and a majority expressed doubt about whether the president had the respect of foreign leaders. 
 Support for the president's staunch backing of Israel goes only so far: 39 percent indicated they approved of it, but 40 percent said the United States should avoid saying anything at all about the conflict (Only 7 percent said the United States should criticize Israel, though many respondents cast blame for the conflict on both sides). 
 The poll was based on telephone interviews conducted July 21 through July 25 with 1,127 adults. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. The poll was taken as the war between Israel and Hezbollah raged, and during a particularly bloody period in Baghdad, events that have received heavy television news coverage.
 In a common refrain among respondents regarding the Israel-Hezbollah war, Sharon Schierloh, 62, a retired factory worker from Ottawa, Ohio, said: ''Let the Israelis take care of the problems in their area. We need to stay out of that because our troops are spread too thin.'' She spoke in a follow-up interview after participating in the poll.
 If Mr. Bush and the Republicans could not find much good news in the poll, they could at least pinpoint some signs of abatement in what had been a decidedly downward trend for them, starting with Mr. Bush's slightly improved approval ratings.
 Congressional Republicans are facing what seems to be one of the worst environments for a majority party since 1994 -- when they swept control of both chambers from the Democrats -- and, following the general rule, the president's fortunes could heavily affect theirs.
 Forty-three percent of those surveyed said they had a favorable opinion of the Republican Party, up from 37 percent in May. But when asked their view of how Congress was handling its job as a whole -- a question whose answer tends to reflect prospects for incumbents -- 28 percent said they approved, up from 23 percent in May. But 58 percent said they disapproved.
 Democrats fared better, with 52 percent of those polled saying they had a positive view of the party and 41 percent saying they had a negative one. And 45 percent of registered voters polled said they would vote for the Democrat running in their district this fall as opposed to the 35 percent who favored the Republican. 
 Democrats also seemed to have public support on several major issues. Their push for a higher minimum wage has wide public support, according to the poll. Over all, 85 percent of respondents supported a Democratic proposal raising the minimum wage over the next two years to $7.25 an hour from $5.15 an hour, including majorities of Republicans and independents. House moderates who support a raise in the minimum wage are prevailing upon more conservative House leaders -- who have been opposed to one -- to allow a vote on the issue.
 And 59 percent of those polled said they approved of medical research using embryonic stem cells. Mr. Bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency last week to reject a Congressional bill expanding federal financing for such research. Democrats received higher marks on handling the economy, while Republicans received higher marks on handling terrorism. And more respondents approve of the president's handling of terrorism than disapprove, a change from the last Times/CBS poll when opinion was split.
 But there was agreement that perceptions about war and peace could have major resonance in the fall. More than twice as many respondents -- 63 percent versus 30 percent -- said the Iraq war had not been worth the American lives and dollars lost. Only a quarter of respondents said they thought the American presence in Iraq had been a stabilizing force in the region, with 41 percent saying it had made the Middle East less stable.
 But respondents were essentially split over whether the invasion was the right thing to do.

How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News poll is based on telephone interviews conducted July 21 through July 25 with 1,127 adults throughout the United States. 
 The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country. 
 Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey. 
 The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, marital status, age and education. 
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults. For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. Shifts in results between polls also have a larger sampling error. 
 In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.
 Dr. Michael R. Kagay of Princeton, N.J., assisted The Times in its polling analysis. Complete questions and results are available at nytimes.com/polls.

HEADLINE: Shrugging Off Trade Promises 

 BODY:
It's easy to shrug off this week's collapse of global trade talks. Amid the killing in Iraq and Lebanon, a war of words over ''de minimis subsidies'' and ''amber box'' payments seems esoteric at best. But the damage to the world's poorest countries, which will now be denied their promised access to global markets and a chance to compete, will be enormous. 
 So will be -- and should be -- the resentment toward the world's richest countries. Much of that blame ought to be directed at Europe and the United States, which again decided that the political clout of their farm lobbies outweighed their leaders' repeated promises to do more to end global poverty.
This round of trade talks, started soon after the 2001 terrorist attacks, was supposed to redress decades of unfairness in the global trading system while showing that the civilized world could pull together in the face of barbarity.
 Since World War II, global agreements have dismantled barriers against trade in industrial goods and services, the areas in which the rich countries have a huge comparative advantage. But they have done little to break down barriers against agricultural goods and textiles, areas in which poor countries can compete, if given a chance.
 That was supposed to change this time around, with the Americans and Europeans promising to make deep cuts in agricultural subsidies and tariffs. Rich countries pour nearly $1 billion a day into propping up their farmers. That fuels overproduction, drives down prices, and makes it impossible for poor farmers to sell their unsubsidized products abroad or even at home. 
 The market, to which the developed world swears such fealty, isn't allowed to work.
 It's hard to say who is more to blame for the talks' failure, the United States or Europe. But with the White House nervously eyeing this fall's Congressional elections and President Jacques Chirac of France -- whose farmers are among the most cosseted in the world -- nervously watching his polls, the agricultural lobbies on both sides of the Atlantic again carried the day. Brazil and India, which claim to be champions of the poorest, didn't help by refusing to pry open their growing markets. 
 Nothing good will come of this. The developed countries won't benefit from a further liberalization of trade in services and manufactured goods. The poor countries won't get to compete with their agricultural goods. And the world economy, which grows faster as free trade expands, may falter -- especially if governments choose trade wars rather than adjudication to settle their grievances.
 As for the promises made in 2001 to do more to help the world's poor climb out of poverty, those have been shrugged off.

HEADLINE: House Approves Nuclear Deal With India

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26 

 BODY:
The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday night to approve a nuclear deal with India that would for the first time allow the United States to ship nuclear fuel and technology to a country that has refused to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
 The accord's passage, by a vote of 359 to 68, is a quick, major victory for the Bush administration, which argued that nurturing India as an ally outweighed concerns that the agreement would free more nuclear material for India to use for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. 
The Senate is expected to approve the deal later this year, but before it goes into effect both houses will have to approve the specifics of an nuclear cooperation accord with India. Similarly, India will have to reach agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the loose collection of nations that regulate the sale of nuclear-related technology.
 Until the vote on Wednesday evening, American law had prohibited nuclear cooperation with any of the three states that have refused to sign the nonproliferation treaty: India, Pakistan and Israel. 
 Eight years ago, India and Pakistan took American intelligence agencies by surprise when they conducted nuclear tests, and the Clinton administration's response was to impose economic sanctions on both countries. 
 The last of those sanctions were lifted after the Sept. 11 attacks, when the Bush administration needed Pakistan's help in rooting out Al Qaeda. 
 Critics of the agreement have argued that it is hypocritical to carve out an exception for India at a time when the United States is trying to force Iran, which is a signer of the nonproliferation treaty, to give up any production of nuclear material.
 ''What kind of signal are we sending to the world when Iran is on trial in the Security Council for its nuclear program, and we are turning a blind eye to India?'' asked Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who led the opposition to the accord. ''We will make a mockery of the nonproliferation system.''
 But he was unable to convince many members of his own party, much less the Republicans, that the accord would fuel an arms race in South Asia and eliminate the incentive for nations to abide by the treaty. 
 Several leading Democrats, including Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, argued in favor of the deal, which was supported by both the India-American lobby and the nuclear industry. If the restrictions are lifted, American companies would be free to sell reactors and other equipment and services to generate electricity in India from nuclear sources.
 India now mines a relatively small amount of uranium, which it divides between its weapons program and its fledgling nuclear power program. 
 If completed, the new accord with the United States would free up all the uranium that India mines for weapons purposes, and international inspectors will have no access to the military facilities. An amendment offered by several Democrats that would require India to agree to limit its production of nuclear weapons fuel was defeated on the floor on Wednesday evening, with supporters of the deal saying it would be rejected by the Indians.
 ''India already possesses nuclear weapons, and is very unlikely to dispose of them,'' Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Republican from Illinois who is chairman of the House International Relations Committee. ''This is the proverbial deal killer.'' 
 The supporters of the agreement offered several reasons for supporting passage, including economic benefits for the American nuclear industry and encouragement to India to promote American strategic interests. Mr. Hyde spoke of the benefits of countering ''the rising power of China,'' though administration officials insisted, in testimony earlier this year, that they did not intend for the deal to bolster India against China, a longtime rival. 
 Opponents accused the administration of playing down the potential problems, including the possible reaction of Pakistan, which has spent decades building a nuclear arsenal to counter India's. Mr. Markey pointed to recent news reports about Pakistan's efforts to increase its own production of plutonium through construction of a new reactor.

HEADLINE: Democrats Say Ads Suggest an Upstate Republican Is Vulnerable

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Representative Thomas M. Reynolds, a prominent Republican in upstate New York, unveiled the first television commercial of his campaign yesterday, and Democrats said the ad's early timing reflected the incumbent's apprehension about the difficult electoral climate Republicans are facing in the Northeast. 
 Mr. Reynolds, one of the most influential New Yorkers in Congress, began running his commercials in two major cities in his district, Buffalo and Rochester, roughly 14 weeks before Election Day, when he faces Jack Davis, a multimillionaire businessman and a Democrat.
The ads feature Mr. Reynolds meeting with constituents and discussing his prescription for the problem of job loss in the state, a plan that includes lower taxes and fewer regulations on business. The commercial is clearly meant to take the jobs issue away from Democrats, who hope to use the issue against Mr. Reynolds in an economically depressed region where his vote for the Central American Free Trade Agreement is a potential liability.
 ''We are not going to be able to have jobs for ourselves or jobs for our children if we don't find a way to make New York competitive,'' Mr. Reynolds, a four-term incumbent, says in the commercial. Mr. Reynolds is among at least a dozen Republicans whom Democrats would like to defeat in the Northeast, a heavily Democratic region. Independent analysts believe that the region could provide many of the 15 seats Democrats need to take control of the House in the fall elections.
 While Mr. Reynolds is popular and well-known in his district, Democrats contend that his close relationship with Republican leaders in Washington could make him vulnerable at a time when polls indicate that many New Yorkers are concerned about the nation's direction.
 For Democrats, defeating Mr. Reynolds would be an especially sweet prize, given that he is directing the national Republican effort to maintain control of the House. Only a few weeks ago, Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, traveled to New York to meet privately with Mr. Davis, who has vowed to spend $2 million to defeat Mr. Reynolds. 
 In an interview, Mr. Davis said that the congressman's early start on television could mean only one thing. ''This guy is running scared,'' said Mr. Davis, who took 44 percent of the vote against Mr. Reynolds two years ago, when he spent $1.2 million.
 But the Reynolds camp said that the congressman takes every election seriously, no matter who his opponent is. ''He runs every two years like he has a race,'' said L. D. Platt, a spokesman.
 Even Democrats concede that Mr. Reynolds will be difficult to topple. Not only does he enjoy the high visibility that comes with incumbency, but as the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, he has easy access to a national network of donors. Indeed, he had amassed slightly more than $3 million for his campaign, according to the most recent campaign finance disclosure statements.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Set to Vote On Hudson Tunnel Fund

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
After years of talking up the need for a second commuter-rail tunnel under the Hudson River, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is ready to make a hefty down payment on a $7.2 billion project.
 Port Authority commissioners are scheduled to vote today to authorize spending up to $2 billion on the project, which would include a two-tube tunnel connecting Manhattan and New Jersey and a terminal under 34th Street at the foot of Macy's flagship store. 
Anthony R. Coscia, the chairman of the Port Authority, has said the trans-Hudson tunnel should be the region's top transportation priority because it would increase capacity on the overcrowded commute to New York City from the fast-growing western suburbs. Until now, the Port Authority has only talked about helping to pay for it without making a firm commitment.
 The financial move is critical, the project's supporters say, because it will allow them to seek billions more from the federal government, having shown a substantial level of local support.
 Mr. Coscia said the board would vote on authorizing at least $1 billion for the tunnel, with the intention of including up to $1 billion more in the 10-year capital plan that the Port Authority will adopt later this year. The project, whose main sponsor is New Jersey Transit, the state-run commuter train and bus network, is scheduled to begin construction in 2009 and to be completed by 2016. Its cost is estimated at $7.2 billion, adjusted for inflation over the next 10 years, said George Warrington, the executive director of New Jersey Transit.
 ''This is clearly a substantial and huge down payment, which allows us to signal to the federal government that up front and well in advance of construction we have already amassed significant financial commitments,'' Mr. Warrington said. He said that it was too soon to determine what parts of the project the Port Authority would pay for.
 Jon S. Corzine, the governor of New Jersey, has already pledged $500 million for the tunnel from the state's Transportation Trust Fund. Like Mr. Coscia, Mr. Corzine has been a vocal backer of the trans-Hudson tunnel, first in Washington as a senator and now in Trenton.
 The New Jersey officials consider the tunnel a sure thing, but even with a financial commitment from the Port Authority, the project could encounter obstacles. It is one of several multibillion-dollar transportation projects on the drawing boards, including a subway line on Second Avenue, and it will eventually have to compete with some or all of them for federal money. 
 Not even all the officials of the Port Authority are in agreement that the Hudson tunnel should be first in line for the agency's money. The vice chairman, Charles Gargano, an appointee of Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, still favors a rail link between Lower Manhattan and the Long Island Rail Road and Kennedy International Airport.
 Mr. Gargano said the Hudson tunnel should be one of the Port Authority's priorities but ''not the No. 1.'' He added the caution that this was ''the beginning of a very long process'' and ''many things have to happen'' before either project can be built.
 Mr. Gargano pointed to an impending vote in Congress to authorize the conversion of $1.75 billion in tax credits for use in building the rail link to Kennedy. If the House and Senate approve that conversion soon, he said, ''That is certainly a positive for that project.''
 Nonetheless, Mr. Coscia said a big commitment to the Hudson tunnel would demonstrate a new spirit of collaboration between the competing interests on the Port Authority board. He said it was time to make decisions based on the potential benefits to the entire region rather than as a division of assets between the two states.
 ''There seems to be a willingness, clearly, at the Port Authority and among those who control it,'' he said, ''to allow the Port Authority to resume its historical role of planning major infrastructure projects and not focus on a quid pro quo between the two states of pet projects.''

HEADLINE: The Heyday of the Dead

BYLINE: By DAVID COLMAN

 BODY:
YES, it's July. The sun's shining. People are heading to the beach or just out, to catch some UV, drink some Mountain Dew and indulge in some good clean summer fun. 
 But what is that little black cloud drifting across the sun? Will it ruin our picnic, like ants or a motorcycle gang? Heaven protect us a skull? Not one, but a sea of them! Ah, but ere it comes near, it is clear: it will barely cast a pall.
If it was not clear a year or two ago, when the skull motif cropped up on battered Herman-Melville-meets-Edgar-Allan-Poe T-shirts made by Rogues Gallery, on costly cashmere sweaters by Lucien Pellat-Finet, on the perforated uppers of the wingtips made by the men's wear line Barker Black, it is now. What only recently seemed clever and stylish -- I'm wearing a skull! I'm baaaaad! -- has shifted into overdrive, if not overkill. 
 Beyond the sea of skull wear -- belts, T-shirts, ties -- there are umbrellas, sneakers, swimsuits, packing tape, party lights, even a skull-branded line of hand tools. One company has made a skull toilet brush and caddy (with a molded-plastic femur bone for a handle). This summer Damien Hirst announced that he will make a life-size skull, cast in platinum and adorned with 8,000 diamonds. 
 If it seems harmless, well, there you have it. With the full force of the American consumer marketing establishment behind it, the skull has lost virtually all of its fearsome outsider meaning. It has become the Happy Face of the 2000's. When the mid-1980's proto-Goth group the Ministry sang ''Every Day Is Halloween,'' this was not quite what they had in mind. 
 ''This is such a huge gripe of mine,'' said Voltaire, a musician in New York and the author of ''What is Goth?'' (Weiser Books, 2004), a kind of ''Preppy Handbook'' for the living dead. ''Throughout hundreds of years of history, what the skull has communicated is, 'I am dangerous.' That's where the irony is. You can buy dangerous for $11.99 at Kmart.''
 For years Voltaire was the happy owner of several skull-motif sweaters hand-knit by an eccentric Englishwoman. He recounted that a woman stopped him the other day on an East Village street to admire the one he was wearing. ''She said: 'I love your sweater. Is it Ralph Lauren?' Then I found out that Ralph Lauren has a whole store that sells skull stuff.''
 Well, not for long he doesn't. At Rugby, the chain of collegiate-style stores Mr. Lauren rolled out only last year, the shirts are embroidered not with a polo player but a skull. However, the logo is already being scaled back (though not dropped entirely), a spokesman said.
 ''It's a pity it's so commercial now,'' Mr. Pellat-Finet said. For more than five years, he has splashed oversize skull graphics -- sporting, say, Mickey Mouse ears -- on his sweaters. ''Maybe Wal-Mart will replace their smiley-face with a tete de mort,'' he added, using the French term for skull. ''It's lost its meaning.''
 Well, it still has one meaning for Mr. Pellat-Finet, whose latest skull sweaters are embellished with Afros and top hats, among other images. Asked if he will stop using the motif, he responded with a chuckle: ''No, no, no. It's my best seller!''
 Other designers appear to have similarly mixed feelings: on one hand, they are confronted with skull saturation; on the other, skulls are ringing the dinner bell louder than ever. Alexander McQueen's fall men's wear show did not play up skull imagery on the runway -- surely the critics would be bored -- but there are plenty back in the showroom, on sports coats, polo shirts and trousers. His $210 skull-print silk scarf is one of the best-selling items on the men's designer floor at Barneys New York. 
 ''We've sold 400 since May,'' said Timothy Elliott, a Barneys spokesman. ''We sell them as fast as they come in.'' 
 Many people point to the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' franchise as fuel for skullmania. But the skull's ascent to the logo throne has more to it and behind it than a Disney marketing campaign. Reminiscent of the vogue for angels a decade or more ago -- remember how the little winged creatures were everywhere? -- the skull neatly encapsulates a cultural moment in terms both precise and vague. 
 It is also the product of potent economic forces. The proliferation of skulls has paralleled the rise of the Hot Topic clothing chain. Begun 17 years ago in Southern California, Hot Topic is a 680-stores-in-50-states phenomenon based on the simple idea of selling music-related clothing and accessories -- punk studded wristbands, heavy-metal T-shirts and lately, lots and lots of skulls -- to suburban teenagers who would otherwise have to visit an urban clothing boutique for such goodies.
 ''Have we brought skulls to the mall?'' said Cindy Levitt, the vice president for marketing at Hot Topic. ''Absolutely. But skulls are a rock icon. We've always had them. We see this as more of a fashion trend.'' 
 Still, Ms. Levitt agreed that the skull is not what it used to be. ''It's no longer threatening,'' she said. ''Anyone will wear a skull now.'' 
 The inventory at Hot Topic, which caters to music fans of all stripes, points up another facet of the skull's allure, its vagueness. Cherished as an icon by several rock genres, it communicates many potential meanings without specifying any single one: the skull as style hedge. 
 ''The skull is all-purpose,'' said Sasha Frere-Jones, a music critic at The New Yorker. ''It simultaneously refers to horror movies, to the Misfits and, by extension, all punk rock, and to a generalized culture of blackness and spookiness and the larger, mall-Goth culture.'' So, he said, ''if you're really at heart a Goth, but you have friends who are into metal and punk, you can rock the skulls and be friends with all of them.''
 Or in fashionspeak: skulls -- fun, flexible, easy, breezy! 
 It is a different way of thinking of one of history's most formidable images, seen in thousands of years of art and a symbol integral to Mexican culture. Robert Rosenblum, a professor of fine arts at New York University, explained that the skull is central to the vanitas, a genre of still-life painting in which temporal pleasures are juxtaposed with a skull. ''The vanitas includes the skull as a reminder that death is everywhere,'' he said, ''as a cutting edge to too much contentment with the here and now.''
 Perhaps the Manhattan hostess who bought a $4,140 set of 12 sterling-silver skull place-card holders by the jeweler Douglas Little wanted to convey that message to her guests. (Supercute touch: the place cards are clenched between the hinged jaws.) Or maybe not; she declined to be interviewed.
 The skull as memento mori is important to Philip Crangi, a fashionable jeweler in Manhattan known for a pared-down modernized take on 19th-century morbidity. ''I use it in a Victorian or Latin sense,'' he said, ''where it meant that life is short and death is the great equalizer, so stop your whining and get on with it.'' 
 In his view skulls are not less threatening because a chic jeweler is casting them in precious metal but because, in an age when slasher films are top grossers, death itself has become less threatening. ''In the 19th century, when people died, they were laid out in the living room,'' he said. ''I think we've lost that connection to death.'' 
 For others, the skull is about youth, not death, losing its sting. Banks Violette, an artist whose fascination with heavy metal imagery won him a show at the Whitney Museum last summer, is never happy to see cherished symbols of teen angst treated blithely. 
 ''It's always an inward flinch,'' he said. ''People create this little world where they try to negotiate their own sense of alienation, then it gets pulled apart.'' He added that because such symbols are associated with youth culture, they are often viewed as superficial and treated cynically by companies that market to young people. 
 Yet as consumers young and old tire of being marketed to, the skull appears to offer a kind of antidote: the ultimate unbrand, one that belongs to no one. Curiously, then, what began as an outlaw anti-logo may as well be viewed as the death rattle of an underground aesthetic.
 ''The skull was one of the last frontiers,'' said Rick Owens, the designer known for his glamorized Goth style. ''There's no way to make yourself edgy anymore.''
 Even so, he is planning on selling skulls -- real ones -- in ''natural and black'' in his new Paris boutique. ''Skulls are kind of timeless,'' he said, deadpan as it gets. 
 Ah, well. Eat, drink and be trendy. Tomorrow we die.

HEADLINE: Failure of Global Trade Talks Is Traced to the Power of Farmers 

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN and ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Steven R. Weisman reported from Washington for this article and Alexei Barrionuevo from Chicago.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26 

 BODY:
For months, the Bush administration had tirelessly warned farmers to prepare for the possibility of a global trade deal. At the Indiana State Fair last year, Charles F. Conner, the deputy agriculture secretary, told listeners not to expect ''anything close'' to the subsidies they had been used to for decades.
 But the collapse of world trade talks this week has again proved that a small number of farmers in the United States -- as well as Europe, Japan, India and other trading partners -- have the power to resist lower agricultural tariffs and subsidies, even though a global trade deal might ultimately benefit most of them.
In Congress and among farm lobbyists, though, the breakdown of the trade talks was viewed as a dodged missile. 
 ''We are proud that the U.S. stood up and held the line,'' said Bob Stallman, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. ''No deal is better than a bad deal.''
 Trade officials now fear that in the wake of the failure this week, there will be a proliferation of nasty disputes in the World Trade Organization and that the momentum for growth of trade might slow from its period of recent growth, expanding to $9.12 trillion in 2004 from $6.45 trillion in 2000.
 At the same time, many experts say, the big multinational corporations that have gained the most from globalization did not push all that hard for a deal, apparently convinced that they would continue to prosper even if further progress toward an open trading system faltered. 
 American and European officials say the real cost of the failure will be borne by the poorest countries, in whose name the failed round of trade talks was begun in Doha, the capital of the Persian Gulf emirate of Qatar, after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
 The central idea behind the trade round was ostensibly to help poor farmers in Asia, Africa and Latin America export their products to richer countries, while also opening developing countries to more goods and services from the advanced economies.
 Last October, the United States proposed a cut of more than 60 percent in tariffs and subsidies by Europe and the United States, and something less for poor countries. American officials say that their farm tariffs are already half the levels of those in Europe and that American trade-distorting farm subsidies are $12.5 billion compared with $33 billion in Europe.
 But led by Peter Mandelson, chief negotiator for the European Union, many foreign trade officials asserted that the American offer was deceptive. The real cuts, Mr. Mandelson said, were far less.
 A senior British political figure close to Prime Minister Tony Blair, Mr. Mandelson suggested that the Bush administration was loath to make a trade deal in an election year with farmers' votes crucial to Republicans. By doing so, he angered American officials, who accused him of hypocrisy.
 ''I understand the politics of this situation,'' Mr. Mandelson said in an interview after the collapse of the talks. ''Coming from Europe, I understand agricultural politics quite well.''
 In response, Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative, and Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns asserted that Mr. Mandelson and the Europeans were themselves proposing cuts that contained loopholes and exceptions for ''sensitive'' commodities like dairy and beef because of their political role.
 ''The catch is it takes two to tango and 149 to reach a consensus,'' Ms. Schwab said. ''Unfortunately, several key developed countries and developing countries have not bellied up to the bar to play their role.'' She said she could not have gone along with further concessions, even though the United States stood to gain more than most countries, without more flexibility from Europe.
 At a time when the United States and the Europeans have come together on diplomatic issues like Iran, this trans-Atlantic rift and the charges on both sides of deliberate distortions of their proposals threaten to become increasingly bitter. 
 The seeming paradox is that in Europe, the United States and Japan, farmers now account for only 1 or 2 percent of the work force and little more of the overall economy. But they have become the pivot of global trade talks because farmers everywhere exercise power beyond their numbers.
 And among large developing nations like India, Brazil and Indonesia -- which have benefited from integration into the global economy -- farmers are such a large voting bloc that they can insist on being exempt from trade rules that benefit manufacturers and outsourcing services in their countries.
 ''Agriculture has always had enormous influence in trade talks because of a central truth,'' said Stuart E. Eizenstat, a former under secretary of state for economic affairs under President Bill Clinton. ''Constituents who feel disadvantaged by trade deals can always outmaneuver those constituents, or the general public, that benefits from them.''
 Another factor affecting the usual trade-offs on trade this year is that American manufacturers of machinery, computer parts and the like, and the banking and insurance industries that have spread throughout the world, stood back from the Doha round, many experts say.
 In the 1990's, trade deals that stirred opposition in the American textile industry and other areas hurt by imports were countered by those benefiting from trade. But since big banks, insurers and manufacturers are already enjoying the benefits of globalization, there are signs that they have become complacent.
 ''The dynamics of trade have changed,'' said Mickey Kantor, a top trade envoy under President Clinton. ''The least developed countries like India are asserting themselves like never before. Second, if industrial and service don't have as much a stake, they're not going to put the pressure on to counter agriculture or textiles.''
 Though the Europeans say that the United States had to improve on its offer of last October to keep the talks going, there was no political support for doing so.
 Indeed, last month 57 Republican and Democratic senators urged President Bush not to make further concessions in agriculture to the Europeans until they showed flexibility in return. In private meetings over the last two weeks, the message was delivered bluntly to Ms. Schwab and Mr. Johanns, trade officials say. 
 Indeed, the political situation is so fraught that some experts wonder why the Bush administration scheduled a make-or-break session on the trade talks knowing it could not make a major compromise at a time when Mr. Bush and the Republicans are fighting an uphill battle to avoid heavy losses in November's elections.
 ''This has been badly handled,'' Mr. Kantor said. ''To have a trade negotiation at this point, and try to get the Bush administration to make very difficult choices before an election doesn't make sense.''
 For all their diminished role in the economy, farmers in the pivotal battleground states of the Midwest still have a strong appeal to the American conscience. But that same appeal also works in Europe, where politicians see farmers as the backbone of their societies.
 ''Agricultural is so emotional and so cultural for many nations, including ours,'' said John Engler, president of the National Association of Manufacturers and former Republican governor of Michigan. ''We were all agrarian societies once upon a time.''
 By all accounts, the biggest supporter of farmersin Europe is France, where even the offer by Mr. Mandelson drew criticism as ''unacceptable.'' Ms. Schwab, who took office only in June, tried to orchestrate European opposition to French intransigence, and to orchestrate global opposition to the European stance on farm supports.
 Asked what happened to that strategy, an American trade official shrugged and said: ''If it's a toss-up between French farmers and the rest of the world, apparently it's French farmers who will win.''

HEADLINE: The Global Interest Rate Dance, With Bernanke Leading

BYLINE: By Hal R. Varian. 
Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California, Berkeley.

 BODY:
NOW that the World Cup and the Tour de France are behind us, the most exciting global spectator sport is watching Ben S. Bernanke: Will he raise interest rates in August or not? And what does his decision mean for world financial markets?
 When the Fed raises interest rates, global investors find dollar-denominated investments more attractive. This increased demand for American assets tends to raise the value of the dollar. 
But the higher the value of the dollar, the more expensive American goods become for foreigners and the cheaper foreign goods become for Americans, worsening the balance of trade. Eventually, a highly valued dollar can lead to a drop in production in industries that are sensitive to imports or depend on exports.
 International financial markets respond to interest rate changes almost instantaneously, while the real side of the economy -- production, employment, imports and exports -- adjusts over many months or even years.
 If the dollar continues to strengthen this summer, we could see weaker demand for exports and increased demand for imports by next spring and summer, worsening the balance of trade.
 But that's not the whole story. The demand for dollars depends not just on interest rates in the United States, but also on interest rates on assets in other currencies, and they are moving up as well. 
 On July 14, the Bank of Japan raised overnight interest to 0.25 percent, ending six years of zero interest rates. Euro interest rates are also rising, mostly in response to inflationary pressures in Europe, but they are also responding to the higher rates in the United States. These higher interest rates on euro and yen assets will tend to reduce the demand for American assets, counteracting the effects of the higher interest rates in the United States.
 The international financial system is like a 19th-century ballroom dance. The central bankers lead with an interest rate adjustment. Their partners, the global investors, watch them closely, trying to anticipate their every move. In the background, the waiters carry their trays of imports and exports slowly back and forth, taking their cues from the pace set by the dancers in the center of the ballroom.
 But how will the dance end? It looks as if the United States interest rate increases will soon stop, if not in August then in September. The euro and yen rates will probably continue to rise for several months after that. 
 Given the direction of foreign rates, it is also possible that the dollar will become relatively less attractive to foreign investors over the next several months. A weaker dollar would stimulate demand for American exports, which would partly counteract the impact of the higher interest rates here. At least that's the rosy outlook. But there are lots of things that could happen between now and then. 
 Disruption in the Middle East could push oil prices even higher, setting off a ripple effect on employment. Central bankers would probably pause or reverse their rate increases to cushion such a blow.
 Another worry is a natural or man-made disaster: a hurricane or a major terrorist attack could rattle the markets.
 China is a wild card as well. It might change its exchange rate policy, allowing the yuan to appreciate more against the dollar to cool its own economy. Or it might change its investment policy to favor euro-denominated bonds rather than investing primarily in United States Treasury bonds. Neither of these things is necessarily bad for the United States, but such changes may have a big impact on exchange rates and global markets.
 There is a palpable sense of anxiety in financial markets these days, as investors contemplate these and other possibilities. Low interest rates lulled financial markets into complacency. As rates move up, volatility in stock prices has returned with a vengeance.
 This is all taking place against the backdrop of continued deficit spending by households and the federal government. If we can't balance our private and public budgets, we will have to continue to borrow from the rest of the world to make up the difference. But will they continue to lend? 
 The current interest rate increases are an attempt to slow the economy to avoid inflation. But over the next decade, we may be forced to raise interest rates simply to attract foreign lending to finance our budget deficit.
 Such high rates would damp economic growth, putting more pressure on the Fed to return to the low-interest, easy-money policy we have seen in the past few years.
 Such a policy runs the risk of stimulating inflation. The easy-money policies in the past few years have had a surprisingly small impact on wages, in part because of the threat of jobs moving to countries with lower labor costs. But if the dollar fell far enough, foreign labor would no longer be a bargain, giving domestic workers more leverage in wage negotiations.
 In this chain of events, an inflationary spiral would become a real possibility, making the cost of a stumble on policy higher. Let us hope central bankers can keep dancing in step as they move interest rates back to normal levels.

HEADLINE: Statements Made to U.S. Are Barred From Tax Case 

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
The federal judge overseeing a big tax shelter trial ruled yesterday that two former partners at the accounting firm KPMG had been coerced into talking to prosecutors before their indictment and that their statements could not be used as evidence. 
 The ruling, by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan, was his second major challenge to the tactics used by federal prosecutors in white-collar cases. It is also the latest blow to what the government says is its largest criminal tax case ever. 
Sixteen former employees of KPMG and two outside professionals are accused of making and selling abusive tax shelters to wealthy investors that cost the Treasury billions of dollars in unpaid taxes. The 18 were indicted last fall, after KPMG reached a $456 million deferred-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department in August. Under its deal, KPMG admitted criminal wrongdoing and agreed to cooperate with the widening investigation.
 In his ruling, Judge Kaplan wrote that statements made in 2004 by two of the defendants -- Richard H. Smith Jr., KPMG's former vice chairman in charge of tax services, and Mark Watson, a former partner in charge of KPMG's Washington national tax unit, which reviews tax shelters -- had been coerced by the firm under pressure by prosecutors and thus could not be used as evidence. 
 According to a ruling by the judge last month, the coercion and pressure included KPMG's cutting off legal fees to the defendants to curry favor with prosecutors. The firm's actions violated the two men's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Judge Kaplan wrote yesterday. 
 The pressure on the defendants, the judge wrote, ''was a product of intentional government action.''
 ''The government brandished a big stick -- it threatened to indict KPMG,'' he wrote. ''And it held out a very large carrot. It offered KPMG the hope of avoiding the fate of Arthur Andersen if KPMG could deliver'' to prosecutors ''employees who would talk, notwithstanding their constitutional right to remain silent, and strip those employees of economic means of defending themselves.''
 It is not known what the KPMG defendants said in their statements to prosecutors, known as proffers, but such comments often provide ammunition to prosecutors. 
 Judge Kaplan ruled that statements made by the other 14 KPMG defendants could be used, because they had not made a strong enough case of coercion. The trial is scheduled to begin in January.
 In his ruling yesterday, Judge Kaplan cited several letters written in 2004 by prosecutors in the United States attorney's office in Manhattan and lawyers for KPMG at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom to lawyers for the defendants. The letters, the judge said, detailed how the firm, under pressure from the prosecutors, had threatened to cut off the employees' legal fees and, in the case of Mr. Smith, fire them if they did not talk to prosecutors. At the time of some of the letters, Mr. Smith and the other defendants were suspects in the investigation.
 Both the prosecution and KPMG have denied improperly pressuring the defendants. Prosecutors have also denied improperly pressuring KPMG. The accounting firm declined to comment yesterday.
 A representative for the United States attorney's office in Manhattan said, ''We are reviewing the ruling and weighing our options.''
 Federal guidelines written in 2003 and known as the Thompson memorandum lay out factors that prosecutors can weigh when deciding whether to seek the indictment of a company. One guideline urges the company under investigation to persuade employees to talk to investigators.
 In his ruling, Judge Kaplan wrote that ''the Thompson memorandum makes clear that the failure of a business organization facing possible indictment to induce its personnel to submit to interviews by the government and to disclose whatever they know may be a factor weighing in favor of indictment of the entity.''
 Last month, Judge Kaplan ruled in the shelter case that another guideline in the Thompson memorandum, one that pressures companies under investigation to cut off legal fees to employees, violated the constitutional rights of those employees. 
 Last year, as it worked to avert its own indictment, KPMG first capped legal fees at $400,000 each for employees caught up in the inquiry and then cut them off, reversing its traditional practice.

HEADLINE: Iraqi Leader Embraces Terror Fight in Speech to Congress 

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26 

 BODY:
Addressing a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq described his country as the ''front line'' in the fight against terrorism and vowed to make Iraq an ''active player'' in the security and stability of the Middle East.
 ''Iraqis are your allies in the war on terror,'' Mr. Maliki declared, prompting a standing ovation from a full chamber.
But there was also evidence of some friction between American lawmakers and Mr. Maliki over the war in Lebanon and what some Democrats said was the overly optimistic tone of his remarks on Iraq. 
 In his half-hour speech, the prime minister made little mention of the casualties in Iraq. Instead, he highlighted the doubling of the gross domestic product over the last three years and improvements in the lives of Iraqis. And he appealed for more financial aid for fledgling Iraqi companies, saying that much of the enormous American and foreign investment in his country had gone to pay for security companies.
 Democrats complained that Mr. Maliki's remarks had oversimplified the situation in Iraq by ignoring the mounting death toll on Iraqis and Americans alike, as well as the recent surge in sectarian conflict and the increasingly dangerous situation in Baghdad, where President Bush and Mr. Maliki on Tuesday said they would send additional troops.
 ''The prime minister was speaking in the style more of the president of the Baghdad Chamber of Commerce than the prime minister of Iraq,'' said Senator Jack Reed, the Rhode Island Democrat who last month was a sponsor of a resolution calling for United States troops to begin leaving Iraq by the end of the year.
 Earlier, in a breakfast with Congressional leaders, Mr. Maliki, who is a Shiite Muslim, bristled at repeated requests to denounce the militant Shiite group Hezbollah, and when pressed would say only that he condemned terrorism around the world. He also rebuffed calls from some Democrats for him to renounce his condemnation of Israel for its attacks in Lebanon.
 Some Democrats declined to attend his speech, though their leaders emphasized that there had been no organized boycott. Others responded to his upbeat assessments with gestures of boredom: as Mr. Maliki extolled wide participation in Iraqi elections, Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, leaned down in the front row to tie his shoe.
 Mr. Maliki's visit comes at a time when public opinion surveys have shown Americans to be increasingly skeptical about efforts in Iraq. Most Americans questioned in a New York Times/CBS News poll in the past week said that the war was going badly for the United States and that Iraq would probably never become a stable democracy. 
 His speech seemed aimed at reassuring Americans. He embraced the language of the Bush administration, evoking the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in declaring Americans and Iraqis united by a common struggle. ''Your loss on that day was the loss of all mankind,'' he said, ''and our loss today is the loss of all free people.''
 He was interrupted about 10 minutes into his speech by a woman wearing the trademark shade of the antiwar group Code Pink, who chanted, ''Iraqis want the troops to leave! Bring them home now!'' Speaker J. Dennis Hastert halted the speech and ordered the Capitol Police to remove her.
 At all of his stops on Wednesday, Mr. Maliki took pains to thank Americans for their sacrifices.
 ''Iraq will not forget those who stood with her and continue to stand with her in times of need,'' he told Congress. ''We have gone from mass graves and torture chambers and chemical weapons to the rule of law and human rights.''
 He promised not to let Iraq become ''a launching pad for Al Qaeda,'' and hit some of the notes members of Congress had been hoping to hear, including a pledge to rid his country of militias -- a line that got vigorous applause from Democrats. 
 Republicans were more publicly supportive than Democrats. Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, who went with Mr. Maliki to a military base after the speech, emphasized the need to support the prime minister. ''What is the alternative, if we were not to continue to support the Iraqi people in achieving their measure of democracy and freedom?'' Mr. Warner asked. ''What signal would that send?''
 Mr. Hastert praised the address as a ''very good speech'' about Iraq's ''hopes and dreams and aspirations.'' And he dismissed the calls for the prime minister to speak out against Hezbollah. ''We didn't ask him to come here to do general commentary on the Middle East,'' he said. But the Democrats also noted later that the poor economy was driving many more young unemployed Iraqis into those militias.
 ''I asked myself at the end of the speech, is he living in Iraq?'' said Representative Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, Democrat of Florida.
 Mr. Maliki warned against a repeat of what he characterized as the abandonment of his country by American troops during the first Persian Gulf war. ''Let 1991 never be repeated,'' he said, ''for history will be most unforgiving.''
 Democrats said they were disturbed by his ''stay the course'' message. ''No one's calling for cut and run, leave tomorrow,'' said Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the minority whip. ''But the message has to be delivered to the Iraqis: this is their nation, and they should be willing to fight, and if necessary, die for it.''
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said he stayed away from the speech because the prime minister refused to speak out against Hezbollah or to say that he did not support amnesty for insurgents who have attacked American troops. ''If this is what American blood and dollars are being shed for, you've got to ask yourself, what's the purpose?'' Mr. Schumer asked.
 Afterward, at a visit to Fort Belvoir, Va., with Mr. Bush, Mr. Warner and other leaders, Mr. Maliki thanked American troops and said he appreciated those who had lost their lives for Iraq.
 The White House press secretary, Tony Snow, said there had been ''conversations'' about Mr. Maliki's address within the administration. Asked whether the administration had advised the prime minister, he said: ''I think the word advise is a little strong. We have seen copies of it.''
 He said the president had not pressed the prime minister to make a statement condemning Hezbollah, as the Democrats had demanded. ''The president is not a puppeteer in this case,'' Mr. Snow said. ''He's not pulling the strings of Mr. Maliki.''

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Cancels Trip And Leans on Con Edison

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL; Sarah Garland contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Signaling how the power failure in Queens and its political fallout are consuming the administration, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday canceled a trip to Ireland tomorrow and said he had pressured Consolidated Edison into granting instant reimbursements to those affected by the crisis.
 But throughout the neighborhoods where residents and businesses continued to struggle with spotty power and related problems like spoiled food and broken air-conditioners, news of the reimbursements and other programs devised to help the area did little to soothe the mounting hostility. 
''Who does the mayor think he is?'' said Fintan Hynes, 43, who lives in a cooperative apartment in Sunnyside Gardens. Still seething over Mr. Bloomberg's remark that the city owed Kevin Burke, the chief executive of Con Edison, ''a thanks,'' Mr. Hynes dismissed the reimbursements as ineffective and continued: ''He's just an arrogant billionaire. If he held an election tomorrow, he'd know exactly how many people were affected.''
 As Mr. Bloomberg faced a cascade of criticism from Queens residents, local politicians and the city's editorial boards, he began hinting that he was perhaps less pleased with Con Edison than his earlier rosy assessments of its performance had suggested.
 At a news conference at La Guardia Community College in Queens, he said that the electrical network ''should not have failed,'' and that he had directed all of the relevant city agencies to participate in an investigation of Con Ed by the Public Service Commission, the state agency that regulates the power company. 
 His comments came the same day the utility was grappling with another power failure, as 16,000 customers on Staten Island lost electricity for several hours and city officials from several agencies flooded the area. In sharp contrast to the administration's response to the Queens blackout -- in which city officials say they did not immediately realize the extent of the crisis -- Mr. Bloomberg abruptly canceled plans to open an economic development promotion in Woodside and went to Staten Island instead. By about 10 p.m., power was fully restored, according to Con Edison.
 ''It's important that the people that do the investigation are the people that Con Ed is regulated by and who helps them get the moneys they need to invest in a network and make sure that they comply with all the regulations,'' he said.
 As part of a stepped-up city effort to help residents of Queens, city officials have persuaded Con Edison to no longer require customers to submit receipts or itemized lists of spoiled food for reimbursements of up to $350 and to extend those reimbursements to spoiled medicine. Residents will also not need to submit an official claim form, but can send letters in any language to the utility, which has promised to process them within one week of receipt.
 City officials said that although businesses seeking reimbursement up to $7,000 from the utility would still be expected to submit receipts, Con Edison had agreed to relax its requirements for them as well.
 In addition, the city, through the nonprofit lender Seedco Financial Services, is offering low-interest loans of up to $10,000 and financial workshops to small businesses affected by the blackout. That program is being paid for by the city's Economic Development Corporation, which has set aside as much as $3 million to pay for the cost.
 Finally, the administration has created a perky marketing campaign called Power Up Queens to draw people to the area's cultural and dining attractions. Those include ''the cutting-edge art scene and delicious international cuisine'' of Long Island City and Hunters Point, according to a colorful brochure the city plans to distribute through visitor information centers in Manhattan.
 ''If you haven't explored Queens yet, now is the time to get on the subway and discover all that it has to offer,'' said Mr. Bloomberg, adding that the Gray Line tour bus company was organizing a special dining promotion in Queens for tonight.
 But those efforts were mocked by some residents and business owners in Queens as too little, too late.
 Louis Langone, 48, who owns Sunshine Fruits and Vegetables on Ditmars Boulevard in Astoria, said he was closed for five days and lost $12,000 to $14,000 worth of food. He said he did not think that the marketing campaign would help him much, and that the $7,000 reimbursement was too small. Indeed, officials from Con Edison, who have been going door to door, brought a reimbursement form by the store for Mr. Langone to fill out, but he declined, saying the amount was not enough.
 ''I'm thinking maybe they're a little scared right now,'' he said of Mr. Bloomberg and the power officials.
 On another part of the boulevard, John Morana, 45, the owner of the Buon Appetit Deli Caterer, said he had lost about $10,000 worth of food and had just spent $4,000 on cold cuts that morning. Mr. Morana offered faint support for the reimbursements, saying Mr. Bloomberg had good intentions.
 ''He's trying to make up for his mistakes,'' Mr. Morana said. ''People in Queens are not happy with him.'' Still, he added, he was unsure how the marketing program would work. ''I don't understand the strategy,'' he said. ''People are still scared to come out because they think the food is old.''
 Carmen Ramirez, 67, a homeowner in Woodside, said she had lost so many things, including food and medicine, that she was unmoved by news of the city's programs. ''I'm very confused and disappointed,'' she said. ''The money doesn't help.''

HEADLINE: Suozzi's Debate Oratory: A Tree Falling in the Forest?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 26 

 BODY:
The first -- and only -- debate in the Democratic primary for governor does not appear to have produced the kind of transformational moment that Thomas R. Suozzi so eagerly sought.
 True, Mr. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, got to share the stage with his better-known opponent, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, and thrash out the issues facing the state. He got the chance to introduce himself to voters, tout his accomplishments and launch attack after attack on his rival. And he got respectable reviews in most of the post-debate commentary.
But respectable reviews are rarely enough to propel a campaign when one candidate is trailing another by more than 60 percentage points, as several recent opinion polls have shown Mr. Suozzi trailing Mr. Spitzer. 
 So while the Suozzi campaign heralded the debate as a new beginning, any good it may have done him was sharply limited by the fact that it was held seven weeks before the Sept. 12 primary, long before most voters are paying attention, and was broadcast only on some cable stations, with major swaths of the state omitted.
 Put another way: if a challenger gets a shot at closing the stature gap with his nationally known opponent and a small slice of the electorate sees it, did it really happen?
 All told, fewer than 40,000 households in New York City, Long Island and Westchester tuned in to the debate, according to Nielsen Media Research. (The ratings in Albany, Syracuse and Rochester were not immediately available.) And the debate was not televised in Buffalo, the second-biggest city in the state, angering some in western New York, who said that the dire upstate economy is being ignored.
 Even if more viewers had tuned in, it is far from clear that the debate would have helped Mr. Suozzi make up much of his lost ground, several political analysts said. Absent a clear, resounding upset, they said, the debate had to be chalked up as a victory for Mr. Spitzer, who merely had to avoid embarrassment to win. 
 ''The really important thing is Tom Suozzi needed a knockout, and he didn't even get a knockdown,'' said Steven Greenberg, a spokesman for the Siena Research Institute Poll, who was a senior campaign aide in H. Carl McCall's 2002 race for governor. ''Nothing in the debate is going to change the overall race.''
 Roger Stone, who was the chief strategist for Tom Golisano during his third-party run for governor in 2002, said that with so few viewers watching, any lasting impact would likely be shaped more by news coverage of the debate than by the debate itself. ''The real question,'' he said, ''is how did the print media cover it?''
 The press coverage was remarkably consistent, from The New York Daily News, with a headline declaring ''Suozzi fails to land KO,'' to The Buffalo News, which wrote that Mr. Suozzi ''did not appear to provide any lasting damage'' to Mr. Spitzer. 
 So it was telling that on Wednesday morning, instead of seeking to capitalize on any particular moment in the debate, the Suozzi campaign tried to score points by complaining about a backstage disagreement that took place just before the debate, when Mr. Spitzer objected to Mr. Suozzi's attempt to bring notes on stage with him, contrary to the rules of the debate. (The Suozzi campaign said it had misunderstood the rules.)
 First, Dan Gerstein, a senior campaign adviser to Mr. Suozzi, sent reporters an e-mail message on Wednesday morning titled ''The Rage Backstage'' claiming that Mr. Spitzer ''had a hissy fit'' about the notes. 
 Then Mr. Suozzi claimed that Mr. Spitzer had ''thrown a temper tantrum.'' Their effort appeared to be an attempt to remind voters about questions raised by Mr. Spitzer's opponents earlier in the campaign about whether he has a short fuse.
 The Spitzer campaign, in turn, responded with a statement titled ''Eliot Spitzer Presents Positive Vision for New York's Future'' that complained about Mr. Suozzi's angry attacks and ''slash-and-burn rhetoric.''
 ''When he didn't deliver the 'knockout punch' he needed to during the debate, Mr. Suozzi instead tried to quickly change the subject by letting people know that he had attempted to break the simple rules of the debate by bringing notes with him out on the stage,'' the Spitzer campaign said. ''Candidates for governor shouldn't need a briefing book to speak about the serious challenges facing the people of this state.'' 
 Then Mr. Suozzi sent Mr. Spitzer a letter, with a copy to every reporter covering the race. It began modestly: ''Dear Eliot, I am glad that you decided not to storm out of our debate last night. It is important for us to discuss our real differences and for voters to see that they actually have a real choice in this election. And as anyone watching last night could see, I didn't need any notes to beat you.''
 It was perhaps an odd way to spend the day after the debate. The candidates, after all, had expressed real differences on a number of real issues, from the death penalty (which Mr. Spitzer supports and Mr. Suozzi does not) to medical marijuana (which Mr. Suozzi supports and Mr. Spitzer does not) to gay marriage (which Mr. Spitzer supports and Mr. Suozzi does not). They even began, tentatively, to discuss how to address a court order calling on the state to spend billions more on New York City's schools. 
 But when the debate ended, the campaigns were back where they were before, debating about debates, with Mr. Suozzi calling on Mr. Spitzer to agree to others, an offer the Spitzer camp did not seem eager to accept.

HEADLINE: Candidates for Governor Stay the Course on Ground Zero

BYLINE: By David W. Dunlap

 BODY:
NO official has more control over the World Trade Center redevelopment than the governor of New York. So, as Gov. George E. Pataki's final term nears an end, it is natural for those concerned with ground zero to wonder whether his successor will make radical changes to the project.
 The answer seems to be no. 
Eliot Spitzer and Thomas R. Suozzi, two Democratic rivals, and John Faso, the Republican candidate, all said this month that the Freedom Tower should be built as planned, although Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Faso added that it must be financially viable.
 And, in e-mail responses to a list of questions from this reporter, they all said they would move the governor's New York City office to the tower, as Mr. Pataki has pledged, and perhaps some other state offices. 
 All three said there was a place for residential development as part of the overall trade center project, most likely on the site of the former Deutsche Bank building at 130 Liberty Street, opposite ground zero, which is to be demolished. State officials have already been inching toward this conclusion.
 The candidates all said they supported moving the headquarters of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey into Tower 4, at Greenwich and Liberty Streets, as is currently envisioned. And they said that the permanent PATH terminal and transportation hub designed by Santiago Calatrava should proceed, even with its steep $2.21 billion price tag.
 ''We cannot keep revisiting decisions that have already been made,'' Mr. Faso said, ''or nothing will ever get built.''
 But he and the others were less than certain about the future of the performing arts center planned next door to the Freedom Tower, which is bound to be expensive.
 The three candidates have been largely quiet on the subject of ground zero, apart from an occasional impromptu remark -- and brief answers to a question during a debate on Tuesday night between Mr. Spitzer, the state attorney general, and Mr. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive.
 Campaign officials said they have not wanted to disrupt an already tortuous planning process. But surely there has been some political calculation, too, since almost any position they take is bound to alienate or irritate one powerful group or another. 
 For instance, one of the most volatile issues is how the victims' names will be arranged at the trade center memorial.
 Though Governor Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced two years ago that the names would be arrayed randomly, many -- perhaps most -- of the victims' relatives favor arranging them by affiliation and location.
 ''I have not made a decision on this issue,'' Mr. Spitzer said, ''but I've always thought the families' argument for grouping names by affiliation made sense. Before making a decision, I'd want to consult with all concerned about how best to reflect our respect for those lost on 9/11.''
 Mr. Faso said he would rely on the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation, whose board members are ''well aware of the intricacies and the emotions involved,'' to make the call.
 For his part, Mr. Suozzi said, ''I will support the mayor's judgment on this difficult decision.''
 Neither Mr. Faso nor Mr. Spitzer foresaw the possibility of the state's subsidizing the memorial museum, meaning that an admission charge may be required. Given the memorial's national importance, Mr. Spitzer said, ''This is the kind of facility the National Park Service should play a role in operating.''
 ON the other hand, Mr. Suozzi said he would support state subsidies if needed. ''Money should not be required to remember this defining moment in our history,'' he said.
 The candidates said the Port Authority should comply with the city's building code in redeveloping the trade center. Mr. Faso, a former Assembly minority leader, said it should do so as a matter of law, not simply as an agreement between the authority and the city, as is now the case.
 In one of his few previous comments on ground zero, Mr. Spitzer warned in March that the Freedom Tower might become a ''white elephant.'' He repeated that concern in the debate, saying, ''The economic viability of that building is very much in doubt.'' 
 But, Mr. Spitzer said, if elected: ''I will personally be in charge. I will make sure we get that redevelopment done. I know how to do it.''
 In his earlier written response, he said, ''I believe the Freedom Tower should be built'' as long as insurance proceeds were available and leases were committed for one million square feet for substantial rents. 
 Mr. Faso said his chief concern about the tower was that the New York Police Department be ''satisfied that the building is secure.'' Given sufficient financing, he said it would be ''appropriate to move forward with the Freedom Tower construction.''
 Mr. Suozzi was more emphatic, writing that it was crucial for the project to go forward ''in its present form.'' At the debate, he said, ''I will build the Freedom Tower,'' adding, ''Too many people in this state and in the country and in the world are relying on us to get it done.''

HEADLINE: Boeing Posts Loss on Costs Of Settling Ethics Inquiry

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
The Boeing Company reported yesterday a $160 million loss in the second quarter resulting, in large part, from a $615 million settlement with the government over ethics charges. And to head off Congressional criticism, Boeing also announced that it would not take the settlement as a tax deduction. 
 The decision not to seek the tax deduction -- even though the company maintained that it could -- comes as Boeing is trying to improve its standing in Washington and as the company's chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., is to appear on Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee to face questions about the company's behavior. 
The $160 million loss, or 21 cents a share, came on revenue of $14.99 billion. In the second quarter of 2005, Boeing had earnings of $566 million, or 70 cents a share, on revenue of $14.68 billion. The quarterly loss for 2006 reflects a $1.1 billion charge for the ethics settlement as well as $496 million for delays in a military surveillance program. Boeing's shares fell by 4.6 percent, or $3.85, to close at $79.90 yesterday.
 Since becoming chief executive last year, Mr. McNerney has made ethics and integrity top priorities. Two previous chief executives resigned amid ethics scandals. 
 Boeing agreed in May to pay $615 million to end a three-year investigation and avoid criminal charges over allegations that it had improperly acquired proprietary documents from its rival, Lockheed Martin, and illegally recruited a top Air Force weapons buyer who was overseeing Boeing contracts. 
 Shortly after the government settlement was announced, it ran into sharp criticism from some prominent senators, who wrote to the Justice Department expressing concern that Boeing could use the settlement to reduce its tax bill. 
 These senators included Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee; John Warner, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee; and John McCain, an Arizona Republican and a longtime Boeing critic who is leading new investigations into weapons spending. 
 Mr. McNerney, in a conference call yesterday, said that while the decision not to deduct the $615 million would be costly in the short run, it was an important long-term move to improve Boeing's reputation and move the company in a new direction. 
 ''Without question, the short-term impact of the tax issue is significant,'' Mr. McNerney said. ''However, the long-term value of Boeing's reputation is even more significant. I feel strongly that the right thing for Boeing to do is not to seek tax deductibility for the settlement charges.'' 
 Mr. McNerney added, ''Simply speaking, my intent is to focus on the future and put this behind us.'' 
 Boeing's decision was immediately hailed by Senator Grassley, who said that ''it's good'' but who continued to criticize Justice Department lawyers who negotiated the Boeing settlement for being ''asleep at the switch.''
 ''We can't depend on having klieg lights from Congress for the right thing to happen,'' Mr. Grassley said. In a letter sent this month to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, Mr. Grassley and the other two senators wrote that allowing Boeing to claim the settlement as a tax deduction would result in ''leaving the American taxpayer to effectively subsidize its misconduct.'' 
 Loren Thompson, an industry analyst at the Lexington Institute, a research organization in Arlington, Va., that promotes free-market economics, said Boeing could afford to pass up the tax break because of a corporate turnaround that has strengthened the company's finances. 
 ''Boeing's strategy is to keep its nose to the grindstone and avoid anything that looks controversial and hope that the anger of Senator McCain will move on to other companies,'' Mr. Thompson said. 
 Besides the government settlement payment, the other charge came because of delays in a $4 billion military surveillance aircraft program for Australia and Turkey. Known as Wedgetail in Australia and Peace Eagle in Turkey, the program outfits Boeing 737-700's with advanced radar systems. 
 The $1.1 billion write-off was somewhat offset by a strong performance by Boeing's commercial aviation division, where profits rose by 51 percent, to $719 million on revenue of $7.11 billion. Boeing reported a record $142 billion backlog in orders, which represents 487 planes. 
 One big hit is the company's coming 787 Dreamliner, a midsize fuel-efficient craft. So far it, has 364 orders from 25 air carriers, and is sold out until 2011. Orders have been so strong that Mr. McNerney said the company was even considering expanding its production plants. First deliveries of the plane are expected in the fall of 2008. 
 On the military side, where Boeing is the No. 2 contractor after Lockheed Martin, revenues remained flat at $7.8 billion for the quarter, compared with the same quarter in 2005. Profits were $309 million, compared with $821 million in the second quarter of last year, as a result of the charges. 
 In response to questions about the new Airbus A350 Extra Wide Bodyplane that was introduced at the Farnborough International Air Show last week to compete with Boeing's 787 and 777, Mr. McNerney said:
 ''They seem to be trying to cover two of our planes with one plane, which is a tough putt. We don't see it has a plane that can compete with our 777, and it's a little big and a little heavy to do the mission the 787 can do. So, in summary, they've got a single plane trying to cover two of the most successful planes we have.''

HEADLINE: W.T.O. Leader Promises to Push for Talks

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 27 

 BODY:
The director general of the World Trade Organization, Pascal Lamy, promised on Thursday to keep pushing for a resumption of free-trade talks, which collapsed this week over agricultural subsidies. 
 Mr. Lamy told the W.T.O.'s executive general council that proposals made after nearly five years of negotiations were potentially worth two to three times what had been achieved in past trade rounds.
 ''You can count on me to do everything I can to keep up the pressure for the political movement, which would permit a resumption of the negotiations,'' he said.
 The latest round of negotiations was suspended on Monday after major powers failed to achieve a breakthrough in agriculture, long the most contentious area of the trade negotiations.
 The United States refused further concessions in subsidy cuts, saying the European Union and big developing countries like India were not offering enough compensation in the way of increased access to their farm markets for American goods.
 Mr. Lamy said that suspension of the negotiations meant that progress made to date in the round was delayed, but that it was important that all negotiating offers remain up for discussion when talks resume.
 In Washington, President Bush promised to try to press ahead with attempts to reach a global trade agreement.
 ''We'll continue to work on this agreement,'' he said in a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers.

HEADLINE: Exxon Rides Oil and Gas Prices to 36% Gain in Profit 

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
Exxon Mobil reported a 36 percent gain in second-quarter earnings yesterday, bolstered by robust oil and gas prices, improving refining margins and the start of production at a field in Nigerian waters.
 Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, has prospered as gasoline prices have risen sharply in reaction to mounting global tensions in several oil-rich areas and climbing consumption in the United States, China and India. The company, based in Irving, Tex., was the only one of the big three producers to increase output in the quarter and take strong advantage of the increase in oil prices, which have surpassed $70 a barrel.
Net income for the quarter rose to $10.36 billion, or $1.72 a share, from $7.64 billion, or $1.20 a share, a year earlier, the company said. The only time Exxon's quarterly profit was higher was the fourth quarter of last year. 
 Revenue climbed 12 percent, to $99 billion, despite a slowdown in production at several company refineries because of repairs. The revenue was second only to Exxon's third quarter of last year.
 Wall Street energy analysts characterized the results as little short of spectacular. But the rich harvest of profit was joined by calls from some in Congress to tax the profit windfall at large oil companies to compensate for the increasing pressure put on consumers' budgets and the risk that higher energy costs would slow the economy.
 Exxon's quarterly profit, released a day after ConocoPhillips reported similarly strong results, offers Democrats an attractive midterm election topic that assigns the blame for high prices at the pump to the perceived cozy relationship between the Bush administration and the oil giants.
 Soon after Exxon reported its earnings, Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat and a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, released a caustic statement. ''While American families get tipped upside down and have their savings shaken out of their pockets at the gas pump, the Bush-Cheney team devises even more ways to line Big Oil's pockets,'' he said.
 Henry Hubble, Exxon's vice president for investor relations and corporate secretary, acknowledged yesterday in a conference call with analysts ''the impact today's high energy prices have on consumers and family budgets'' while ''our companies do benefit from these conditions.''
 He said the answer was not more taxes on oil profit but efforts to ''bring more product to the market and ease supply pressure.''
 Investors had much to cheer about, even if they, too, were shaking their heads at the pump. 
 Profit from oil and natural gas sales rose 45 percent from a year earlier, to $7.1 billion. 
 The company reported that it repurchased $6.8 billion worth of stock during the quarter, topping its target by $800 million. It said it expected buybacks to rise to $7 billion in the third quarter.
 Shares of Exxon Mobil fell 13 cents, to $66.47, in New York Stock Exchange trading. The stock has risen about 20 percent this year.
 The quarter's results appeared to reflect well on continuing efforts at cutting costs and improving return on assets since the merger of Exxon and Mobil seven years ago. They also appeared to validate the early decisions by Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive who succeeded Lee R. Raymond at the end of last year. Mr. Tillerson has moved to raise production in Africa, Russia and the Middle East and expand exploration in Indonesia and Madagascar.
 The company's crude oil output rose more than 9 percent, to 2.7 million barrels a day, as growth in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Russia offset declines in North America and Europe. Gas output rose only slightly, largely because of expanding operations in Qatar.
 Exxon's total production gain of slightly more than 6 percent, the equivalent of four million barrels of oil a day, compared favorably with the performances of its rivals BP and Royal Dutch Shell, which have reported second-quarter production declines of 2.5 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively.
 The company said it spent $4.9 billion for the quarter on capital and exploration projects, an increase of 8 percent over the previous year.
 Though analysts said they were impressed with the results, some continue to say that the company needs to do much more with its overflowing cash of nearly $40 billion.
 ''These are record earnings that exceeded expectations,'' said Fadel Gheit, senior energy analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. ''Their earnings benefited from record oil prices as well as very high production growth. The only negative in the report -- but this is industrywide -- is rising cost inflation. Everything energy companies are using, like materials and labor, are costing them more today than anytime before.''
 Mr. Gheit added that future quarterly earnings could well continue to satisfy investors, but ''only if oil prices continue to rise.'' 
 Mr. Hubble, the Exxon vice president, said gasoline sales in the United States and elsewhere should remain strong. ''We continue to see demand growth year-on-year,'' he said. ''We're running our capacity full. We're selling everything we can make. It correlates best with G.D.P. growth. The economy is still performing well around the world.''
 Analysts noted that much of Exxon's production growth was provided by the recent start-up of the Erha project 60 miles off Nigeria in 3,900 feet of water. Exxon estimated that with the Erha North satellite project scheduled to come on stream during the new quarter, total Erha production would rise to 190,000 barrels a day by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: A Slowdown In Home Sales And Orders 

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27 

 BODY:
Housing data and a gauge of business spending in June signaled slower economic growth in the coming months, according to reports released Thursday.
 While new orders for durable goods rose 3.1 percent in June, much more than expected, it was bolstered by demand for volatile defense and transportation orders, Commerce Department data showed. 
Capital goods orders excluding aircraft and defense, a good barometer for business spending, rose 0.4 percent, compared with Wall Street expectations for an increase of 1.1 percent.
 In another Commerce Department report, new single-family home sales fell 3 percent in June, the department said, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.131 million units. Analysts had expected a 1.160 million rate.
 ''The numbers coming in certainly indicate there are weaknesses in some areas, but over all this economy still looks to be growing quite robustly,'' a former Federal Reserve governor, Lyle Gramley, said. He put the probability of Fed policy makers raising interest rates in August at 90 percent.
 In addition, the number of homes available at the current sales rate rose to a 6.1 months' supply, the highest since March. There were 566,000 new homes for sale at the end of the month, a record high.
 The drop in new home sales was the first decline since February. Compared with a year earlier, new home sales were down 11.1 percent.
 ''The steam is coming out of the housing market, rather than a big pop,'' Lindsey Piegza, a market analyst at FTN Financial, said.
 In a sign of tight labor markets, workers filing new claims for state jobless benefits fell to the lowest level in six weeks, a Labor Department report said.
 New applications for state jobless benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 298,000 last week, from 305,000 claims in the previous week. Economists polled by Reuters were expecting a rise in claims.

Broadway

* 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, special theatrical event, 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley)

'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

*'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'BULLY' William Walsh plays the quotable Theodore Roosevelt in this interesting but not completely polished one-man show (2:00). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)

'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (George Hunka)

'THE FIELD' John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diazand Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00).Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School. Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200 (1:10). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates)

* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)

* 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this old comedy from the 1930's, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)

* 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th-century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with elan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

Off Off Broadway

'ANGEL MOUNTAIN' A young soldier, his mentally slow brother and their widowed father react to the new housekeeper in John-Richard Thompson's absorbing if sometimes predictable drama, set in 1946 (1:05). The Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)

'CHEKHOV & MARIA' Jovanka Bach's final play is a touching and beautifully acted if sometimes slow-paced study of Anton Chekhov's near-final days and his relationship with his sister, who cared for him (2:00). Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)

'CLOUD TECTONICS' A solid rendition of Jose Rivera's thin fable about time, centering on a hitchhiking woman who has been pregnant for two years. Luis Vega is particularly good as the man who gives her a ride and shelter for the night (1:30). Culture Project-45 Below, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger)

'IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE AND OTHER STORY BOOKS' This children's musical, made up of 10 sketches based on 8 books, is diverse, adorable and free. Also, the adults laugh (1:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village; (212) 642-9033. (Gates)

Long-Running Shows

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' Another excavation of what seems to have become Broadway's favorite musical terrain -- call it Scamalot, where conmen are king (see ''The Producers.'') Now starring Keith Carradine and Brian D'Arcy James at the mismatched swindlers. (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'FOOD FOR FISH' Adam Szymkowicz's fabulously weird and weirdly fabulous new comedy fools around with cross-dressing, suicidal writers and Chekhovian characters who long for New Jersey (2:00). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Gates)

'FRANKENSTEIN, THE MUSICAL' More is not better in Robert Mitchell's show based on Mary Shelley's novel. The too many songs and scenes are confusing and ultimately defeat the cast, while Brian Charles Rooney as the scientist Victor Frankenstein might regain his fire if he switched roles with Timothy Warmen, who, as the lab mistake, seems more like a morose personal trainer out on a hike (2:15). The Wings Theater, 154 Christopher Street, between Washington and Greenwich Streets, West Village, (212) 627-2961; closing on Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)

'THE HOUSE IN TOWN' A wan new drama by Richard Greenberg about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, in 1929. A miscast Jessica Hecht stars as Amy Hammer, a well-to-do housewife sliding into despair as her remote husband looks on in frustration. Doug Hughes's production is pretty but desultory, as is Mr. Greenberg's typically eloquent but atypically empty writing (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'ORANGE LEMON EGG CANARY' Rinne Groff's deceptive romance about a hard-drinking magician is like a great trick with a bungled payoff (1:30). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing on Sunday. (Jason Zinoman)

'SECRETS' A clunky relationship drama about shrill, cruel middle-age couples (1:05). The Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)

'SUSAN AND GOD' The Mint Theater Company's fine revival of Rachel Crothers's 1937 comedy about religion, career and family features Leslie Hendrix of ''Law & Order,'' excellent in the role of Susan. Jonathan Bank directs (2:20). The Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, third floor, Clinton, (212) 315-0231; closing on Sunday. (Hunka)

'TREASON' The poet Ezra Pound was a repellent fellow, judging from this play by Sallie Bingham: racist, anti-Semitic, eager to exploit the affections of the women who loved him. Just why women were drawn to him is never clear, but the play is thoughtful, and the acting, especially by Philip Pleasants as Pound, is superb (2:10). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, just west of Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)

* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)

* 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis)

'BEEN RICH ALL MY LIFE' (No rating, 80 minutes) This admiring documentary portrait of the Silver Belles, an indefatigable troupe of veteran Harlem tap dancers between the ages of 84 and 96, is a valuable historical footnote and a useful how-to movie about making the most of old age. (Stephen Holden)

'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)

'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)

* 'CHANGING TIMES' (No rating, 95 minutes, in French and Arabic) Gerard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve star in Andre Techine's rich, warmhearted exploration of cultural collision in contemporary Tangier. A half-dozen skillfully interwoven subplots create a set of variations on the theme of divided sensibilities tugging one another into states of perpetual unrest and possible happiness. (Holden)

'CLERKS II' (R, 98 minutes) More than a decade later, Kevin Smith's New Jersey underachievers have moved from a convenience store to a fast-food franchise. The humor is reliably filthy and frequently hilarious, and the filmmaking is a few steps above rudimentary, but the movie's poignant sweetness is disarming. It has a dirty mind, but its heart is remarkably pure. (Scott)

'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)

* 'LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR MAN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) This enthralling documentary combines pieces of an extended interview with Mr. Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter, poet and author, now 71, with a tribute concert at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005. Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Martha Wainwright and Antony are among the featured performers. (Holden)

'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)

'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)

'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Nathan Lee)

'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES' (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis)

* 'Gabrielle' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chereau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haute bourgeoisie Parisian marriage, circa 1912. (Dargis)

'THE GROOMSMEN' (R, 93 minutes) Just when it seems that Edward Burns might have pulled off an American ''I Vitelloni,'' his X-ray vision into life in an Irish-American enclave in New York glazes over, and he resolves his characters' anxiety and despair with tearful hugs and phony reassurances. (Holden)

* 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-aged white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden)

'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden)

'KILL YOUR IDOLS' (No rating, 71 minutes) S. A. Crary's glib, unfocused music documentary examines the New York No Wave scene of the late 1970's -- an offshoot of punk, the anti-New Wave -- when the music was noisy (and genuinely noncommercial) and the clothes were black (and genuinely secondhand). (Dargis)

'LADY IN THE WATER' (PG-13, 108 minutes) In this watchable folly, Paul Giamatti plays a building manager who encounters a menagerie of otherworldy creatures, most important Bryce Dallas Howard's water nymph. The writer and director M. Night Shyamalan wants us to believe, mostly in the myth of his own genius. (Dargis)

'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott)

'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Lee)

'Mini's First Time' (R, 91 minutes) Yet another poor little rich girl tends to her festering inner wounds by becoming one of Southern California's children of the damned. Nikki Reed stars alongside the slumming likes of Alec Baldwin, Carrie-Anne Moss, Jeff Goldblum and Luke Wilson. (Dargis)

* 'MONSTER HOUSE' (PG, 86 minutes) This scary movie for kids provides more fun in 86 minutes than all the other would-be summer blockbusters combined. A trio of intrepid youngsters face down a demonic dwelling in a quiet suburb. The motion-capture animation produces an uncanny feeling of realism, while the fantastical effects are spooky, witty and spectacular. (Scott)

* 'THE OH IN OHIO' (No rating, 91 minutes) A feel-good movie about feeling good, this fresh and very funny sex comedy stars Parker Posey as a woman in search of an orgasm, Paul Rudd as her frustrated husband, and a delirious supporting cast: Danny DeVito as a swimming pool salesman, Heather Graham as a sex shop clerk and Liza Minnelli as a masturbation guru who encourages frigid women to ''liberate your labia!'' (Lee)

* 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis)

'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)

'PEACEFUL WARRIOR' (PG-13, 120 minutes) As ludicrous as the title promises, yet supremely unembarrassed, this New Age enlightenment parable has its heart in the right place, but a mind of corny mush. (Lee)

'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' (PG-13, 151 minutes) Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott)

* 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)

'THE ROAD TO GUANTANAMO' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom's powerful, slippery new film mixes documentary and fictional techniques to tell the true story of three British Muslims imprisoned by the United States government in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. (Scott)

'SHADOWBOXER' (R, 93 minutes) This garish thriller starring Helen Mirren and Cuba Gooding Jr. as contract killers and lovers is an extravagance that leaves you with your mouth hanging open -- partly in admiration of its audacity and partly in disbelief at its preposterousness. (Holden)

'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis)

'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)

'MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND' (PG-13, 110 minutes) A shaky comedy from the director Ivan Reitman, in which ''Fatal Attraction'' meets ''Wonder Woman,'' by way of Uma Thurman, Luke Wilson and some sexist she-devil cliches, some funny, others not. (Dargis)

'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)

'WAIST DEEP' (R, 97 minutes) Tyrese Gibson plays an ex-convict trying to rescue his son from ruthless criminal kidnappers in this far-from-terrible B movie, directed with style and heart by Vondie Curtis Hall. (Scott)

* 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. (Dargis)

'THE WORLD ACCORDING TO SHORTS' (No rating, 95 minutes total running time) For audiences exhausted by today's bloated extravaganzas, ''The World According to Shorts'' is an eclectic palate cleanser. Addressing topics as diverse as aging, marital sex and the fantasy lives of children, this six-film sampling of world cinema ranges from the traditional to the surreal, the latter brilliantly exemplified by the German animated western ''Ring of Fire.'' As frustrated cowboys trail beckoning women and pulsing vaginas across a Daliesque landscape, the wonderful world of Disney seems a million miles away. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)

You, Me and Dupree' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Owen Wilson stars as the dude who comes to dinner and stays way past dessert in Joe and Anthony Russo's generally unfunny comedy. A fine Matt Dillon and a decorative Kate Hudson also star, rather more wanly. (Dargis)

HISTORIC HARLEM PARKS FESTIVAL: THROUGH AFRICAN EYES AND PRIZED PIECES (Through Thursday) This fifth annual outdoor festival concludes next week with two very different features.

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

ADOLESCENTS (Sunday) After a painfully drawn-out dispute with its landlord, CBGB will close at the end of October, which means that everybody is rushing to play his last gig there. Sunday features the Adolescents, one of the architects of the early-1980's Southern California hardcore punk sound, who joined the scruffy melodicism of the Ramones with boys-will-be-boys petulance and angry social realism. With the Freeze, Street Dogs and the Vacancies. At 6:30 p.m., 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Ben Sisario)

BLOC PARTY (Tomorrow) With spiky but melodic guitars and agitated dance beats, Bloc Party revives the nervous funk of postpunk bands like Gang of Four. With Secret Machines and Mew. At 6:30 p.m., McCarren Park Pool, Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (212) 307-7171; $34. (Sisario)

BON JOVI (Tomorrow) Bon Jovi, the band that titled its 1998 album ''New Jersey,'' is back in its home state. Jon Bon Jovi's band conquered the airwaves in the 1980's and 90's by sticking together everything catchy about 1970's rock: Bruce Springsteen's earnestness, Led Zeppelin's crunch, Boston's harmonies and lyrics that paint romance as nothing less than a titanic adventure. A photogenic lead singer doesn't hurt, either. With Nickelback. At 7 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $37.50 to $125. (Jon Pareles)

* BRAND NEW (Tonight) This Long Island emo band made a quantum leap with its second album three years ago, from whiny and unchallenging breakup songs to tangles of explosive melody with brooding, sometimes horrific lyrics. What the band will come up with on its as-yet-unscheduled album No. 3 is a subject of intense speculation among fans. With Colour Revolt. At 6:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario)

EDIE BRICKELL AND NEW BOHEMIANS (Tonight) Sixteen years after her last studio album with New Bohemians, Edie Brickell has reunited with the group; their new record, ''Stranger Things'' (Fantasy/Concord), was released on Tuesday. With Sonya Kitchell, a teenage singer-songwriter whose debut CD is promoted by Starbucks. At 7, Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777, summerstage.org; free, but a donation is suggested. (Sisario)

JIM CAMPILONGO, MIKE VIOLA (Monday) Just another night at the Living Room, a plain Lower East Side cabaret that puts on one guitar-cradling singer-songwriter after another, some of them world-class. Mr. Campilongo is a well-traveled guitar whiz who plays with Norah Jones in her country band, the Little Willies; here he leads his Electric Trio. Mr. Viola, jumping from piano to guitar, sings strident power-pop with some jagged wit. Also on the bill are Grainne Ryan, Alice Bierhorst, Jim Boggia and the Jason Crigler Band. At 6 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; no cover. (Sisario)

BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133, dannysgrandseapalace.com; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Stephen Holden)

DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN (Wednesday) With harsh screams and convoluted guitar riffs that sometimes seem to have been written with the aid of advanced calculus, this New Jersey band plays a cathartic and yet impossibly complex kind of punk-jazz. With God Forbid. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $20. (Sisario)

* DIXIE CHICKS (Tuesday and Wednesday) After first backing down slightly from their criticism of President Bush in 2003, the Dixie Chicks returned this year with ''Taking the Long Way'' (Columbia), a reflective and defiant album that declares: ''I'm not ready to make nice/I'm not ready to back down.'' Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $39.59 to $89.50. Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $39.50 to $75. (Sisario)

* 'DOT DASH YEAR IV' (Tonight and tomorrow) For its minifestival each summer, Dot Dash, a little concert promoter in Brooklyn devoted to punk and garage-rock, presents some big-deal reunions. This year features Rocket From the Tombs, a storied protopunk band from Cleveland that never recorded an album but spawned two influential groups when it broke up in 1975: the arty Pere Ubu and the more conventionally bratty Dead Boys. The band first reunited in 2003 and returns tomorrow with new material on a bill with the Little Killers, DC Snipers, Angry Angles and Imaginary Icons. Tonight's show features the Cynics, the Original Sins, the Hentchmen, the Turpentine Brothers and the Alarm Clocks, a 1960's band from Ohio whose single ''No Reason to Complain'' has been covered by countless shaggy-haired bands. At 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $17 tonight, $20 tomorrow. Rocket From the Tombs also plays on Sunday at 9 p.m. at Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $15. (Sisario)

NICOLAI DUNGER (Tonight) A Swedish balladeer with serious Van Morrison envy, Mr. Dunger makes earnest entreaties for romance and existential relief (''Take away my sadness, wipe away these blues in here'') in a tremulous tenor. With Elvis Perkins and Benjy Ferree. At 7, South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789, seaportmusicfestival.com; free. (Sisario)

EDITORS (Tonight) This band from Birmingham, England, chose a fitting name: it stitches together material from other sources with taste and artistry, joining the baritone-of-gloom vocals of Joy Division (''Oh, if fortune favors the brave/I am as poor as they come'') and the early U2's shimmering sheets of guitar. With Lake Trout and the Big Sleep. At 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario)

MARY GAUTHIER (Wednesday) Ms. Gauthier, who was born in Baton Rouge, La., and worked as a restaurateur before turning to music, writes sparse observations that suggest a modest but penetrating wisdom (''Every living thing could use a little mercy now''). With Eliza Gilkyson. At 7 p.m., Madison Square Park, Madison Avenue at 24th Street, (212) 538-6667; free. (Sisario)

METERS (Thursday) Hurricane Katrina could not drown New Orleans syncopation. It lives on with the reunion of the Meters, the definitive New Orleans funk band since 1967. The group has backed others, but saved its snappiest, trickiest grooves for its own tracks. With Art Neville on keyboards, George Porter Jr. on bass, Leo Nocentelli on guitar and Zigaboo Modeliste on drums, they open up nooks and crannies of the beat to carry every hip into irresistible motion. At 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $45. (Pareles)

* NEW PORNOGRAPHERS, CALEXICO, FRAMES (Thursday) If the weather holds, this benefit for Central Park SummerStage will be a perfect night of smart, tuneful indie rock. The New Pornographers, from Vancouver, British Columbia, play sharp, elegant pop-rock with a wit that comes down from the Kinks. Calexico, a collective from Tucson, pushes desert-dry alt-country toward surf guitar, mariachi and a folk-flavored psychedelia like that of the 1960's band Love. The Frames are one of the most expressive Irish groups since U2. At 6 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777, summerstage.org; $30 in advance, $35 at the site. (Sisario)

OLLABELLE (Monday through Thursday) Celebrating a new album, ''Riverside Battle Songs'' (Verve Forecast), Ollabelle, a vocal sextet that worships country, bluegrass and gospel with crystalline voices and wide eyes, will play for four nights at Banjo Jim's, an East Village club the group has played many times. At 9 p.m., Avenue C at Ninth Street, (212) 777-0869, banjojims.com; $10. (Sisario)

OZZFEST (Tomorrow) In its 11th installment, the annual carnival of black cotton T-shirts, guttural heavy metal and nostalgic affection for Ozzy Osbourne features System of a Down, Disturbed, Avenged Sevenfold, Hatebreed, Lacuna Coil, Dragonforce and many others on a smaller stage. Ozzy fans in New York are fortunate: this concert is one of only 8 among the 27 stops on the tour that will feature Mr. Osbourne performing on the main stage. Doors open at 9 a.m., Randalls Island, near Icahn Stadium, 1 Randalls Island, (212) 307-7171, ozzfest.com; $87.50. (Sisario)

BRAD PAISLEY (Tonight) A young songwriter who knows the value of terse composition and sly wordplay, Mr. Paisley scored one of country's biggest hits last year with ''Alcohol.'' A droll defense of grog from the drink's point of view (''I've been known to cause a few breakups/And I've been known to cause a few births''), it is one of those rare novelty songs that outlives its novelty. With Eric Church, a rising country singer from North Carolina. At 8, Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, Bethel, N.Y., (845) 454-3388, bethelwoods.us; $46; $30.50 for lawn seats. (Sisario)

* 'RAMAKIEN: A RAK OPERA' (Tonight through Sunday) The Lincoln Center Festival presents an intriguing ''rock-theater piece'' based on an excerpt from the Ramakien, the Thai national epic. The show features many of Thailand's biggest and most respected rockers, including Sek Loso, who has led his band at the South by Southwest and Glastonbury festivals; the Photo Sticker Machine, an electronic group; and Rik Vachilapun, called a cross between Diamanda Galas and Patti Smith. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday night at 7, La Guardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, Amsterdam Avenue, at 65th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $40. (Sisario)

The RED KRAYOLA (Wednesday) The first album of the Red Crayola (as it was originally called) appeared in 1967, and Mayo Thompson has held on to its skewed psychedelic perspective ever since; he also spent some years as a member of Pere Ubu. He's fond of dissolving song structures, crypto-Marxist messages and woozy sounds, and when he reconvened the Red Krayola (its name was changed to avoid trademark problems) in 1994, he found fans and collaborators among progressive- and post-rock musicians. With White Magic and Miighty Flashlight. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Pareles)

* SLEATER-KINNEY (Wednesday) After a 12-year reign over indie rock, the three women of Sleater-Kinney are calling it quits: their brief summer tour will find them screaming their last shrill screams and playing their last postpunk deconstructions of thick, meaty guitar riffs. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario)

SOUL ASYLUM (Thursday) This Minneapolis band lived the story of alternative rock: from loud and scrappy beginnings in the early 1980's, it matured largely out of sight of the mainstream, then found sudden fame in the 90's. The next phase is the reunion with something to prove, and on ''The Silver Lining'' (Legacy), its first new studio album in eight years, Soul Asylum proves that it still has a strong command of burly guitar and yearning vocals. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario)

SOUND TEAM (Tonight through Monday) Recalling Spoon, another indie band from Austin, Tex., Sound Team constructs dense and psychologically rich songs in which elements of white soul hint at a spiritual nourishment denied by the anxious guitars and brooding, aloof vocals. With Cold War Kids and Midlake. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; sold out tonight, $12 tomorrow. Sunday at 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $10. Monday at 8:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $10. (Sisario)

DAR WILLIAMS (Wednesday) In bare and tuneful songs that are called folk because they are quiet but could very well be rock, Ms. Williams is sometimes reflective and sometimes topical, as in her recent ''Teen for God,'' which explores religion as a psychological terror on the young: ''Dear Lord, I plan each day/The things I will not do or say.'' She plays an acoustic set. At 7 p.m., Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org; $50, including museum admission. (Sisario)

Jazz

Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

DON BYRON QUARTET (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Byron is justifiably known for his independent-minded concept albums -- his next one will shine a spotlight on the rhythm-and-blues saxophonist Junior Walker -- but he is, first and foremost, a daring clarinetist.

PAT MARTINO QUARTET (Wednesday and Thursday) As on a recent Blue Note album, Mr. Martino pays homage to one of his guitar heroes, Wes Montgomery.

Information and reservations for both performances: (718) 750-0064 or QueensTheatre.org. (Dunning)

* NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center. Her Spanish company, founded with her husband, Martin Santangelo, concludes its two-month run at the intimate Theater 80 this weekend. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m., Sunday at 5 p.m., Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45. (Rockwell)

* PILOBOLUS (Tonight and tomorrow, and Monday through Thursday) The grandfather of the current crop of Nikolais-inspired, Cirque du Soleil-like acrobatic dance troupes with spectacular visual effects. A little mindless, but enormously popular for people of all ages. Three programs alternate for the run ending Aug. 12. Tonight, tomorrow and Monday through Thursday nights at 8, and tomorrow at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 or joyce.org, $42. (Rockwell)

URBAN BUSH WOMEN 2006 SUMMER INSTITUTE (Tomorrow) In ''Place Matters: A Look at Displacement,'' directed by Jawole Willa Jo Zollar and created by 74 dance artists participating in the institute, notions of home and displacement are examined in light of events that include Hurricane Katrina, the slaughters in Darfur and the fighting in Iraq.

 Museums

Brooklyn Museum: 'Graffiti,' through Sept. 3. Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 or brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)

* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States in a garrulous, very personal way. One particularly intense work, based on the belief that Abubakari II, ruler of Mali, crossed the Atlantic nearly 200 years before Columbus to discover the Americas, links the past with the present and Africa with the beloved Columbus of Ms. Robinson's childhood. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)

Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Dec. 31. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the ''Description de l'Egypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606 or daheshmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)

* Frick Collection : 'Jean-Etienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 or frick.org. (Holland Cotter)

SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500 or guggenheim.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)

* International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best-known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000 or icp.org. (Cotter)

* metropolitan museum of art: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. History is full of shifty characters, antique visionaries, cusp figures and half-crazy oddball innovators, later overlooked because they're hard to pigeonhole. Their independent cast of mind is the truest expression of how civilization advances. (212) 535-7710 or metmuseum.org. (Michael Kimmelman)

* Met: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 3 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. (212) 535-7710 or metmuseum.org. (Smith)

* Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710 or metmuseum.org. (Cotter)

Museum of Biblical Art: 'The Word on the Street: the photographs of Larry Racioppo,' through Aug. 20. Photographs documenting vernacular expressions of religious devotion in New York, including spray-painted murals, private shrines and tattoos. Museum of Biblical Art, 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500 or mobia.org. (Johnson)

* MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer. (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Smith)

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Kimmelman)

Museum of Modern Art: Douglas Gordon: 'Timeline,' through Sept 4. This selection of works by the artist known for appropriating and inventively manipulating Hollywood movies includes his projection of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho,'' which runs so slowly that it takes 24 hours to complete, and a large-scale video installation that studies a circus elephant performing in an empty art gallery. (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Johnson)

NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer , through Sept. 18. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. A painting of a birch forest is an archetypal Klimt mix of uncanny naturalism and geometric abstraction. Two other landscapes, of an apple tree and an unfinished jigsaw-puzzle view of houses on the shore of the Attersee, raise the question: had Klimt not died at 55 in 1918, would he have ended up a pure abstractionist like Mondrian? 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200 or neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman)

New York Botanical Garden: Chihuly at the New York Botanical Garden, through Oct. 29. Dale Chihuly, the world's most famous contemporary glass artist, has created ambitious installations of his large-scale, technically virtuosic and materially extravagant works inside the spectacular Haupt Conservatory and outside in formal reflecting pools and smaller gardens. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700 or nybg.org.(Johnson)

* New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society. 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 or nyhistory.org. (Cotter)

New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 19. Organized with the Bibliotheque Litteraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. Concentrating on books, but also including prints and drawings, it retells the tale of the French avant-garde on a relatively egalitarian playing field. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089 or nypl.org. (Smith)

NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. The museum entrance is at 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088 or noguchi.org. (Glueck)

P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Into Me/Out of Me,' through Sept. 25. Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 or ps1.org. (Johnson)

* Rubin Museum of Art : 'What is it? HimalAyan Art,' This museum is a oasis of calm in the city; you can feel your tension dissolve the minute you walk in the door. At the same time, the place jumps with activities, including lectures, films and exhibitions, many devoted to aspects of Himalayan culture. And for a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000 or rmanyc.org. (Cotter)

* The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Full House: Views of the Whitney's Collection at 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 or whitney.org. (Cotter)

Galleries: Uptown

* Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)

Galleries: 57th Street

* Rudy Burckhardt: 'New York Paintings' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Mr. Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naive immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050 or tibordenagy.com, extended through next Friday. (Johnson)

'Your Beauty's Gold is Clay' This well-selected show of ceramicists includes ruggedly sensuous, Abstract Expressionist-style sculptures by Lynda Benglis; delicate and humorously detailed vessels by Kathy Butterly; surrealistically flamboyant large vases by Nicole Cherubini; comical, demonic heads by William King; a wonderful long-haired cat by Anne Arnold; and sweet faux-juvenile sculptures by Jessica Jackson Hutchins. Alexandre Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 755-2828 or alexandregallery.com, through next Friday. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

Joe Biel With an exacting illustrator's touch, Mr. Biel draws large, dreamily perverse images of children, like the one of a girl with rabbit ears and a whip peeking out of a cardboard box, and one of a knife-wielding boy crouching atop a pile of rubble and examining a bone he found. Goff & Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, (212) 675-0461, goffandrosenthal.com, through Aug. 12. (Johnson)

* J. Bennett Fitts: 'No Lifeguard on Duty' Symbolically resonant photographs of mostly derelict motel swimming pools by a young Californian. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-2410 or saulgallery.com, through Aug. 11. (Johnson)

* 'A Four-Dimensional Being Writes Poetry on a Field with Sculptures' Organized by the sculptor Charles Ray, this beautiful, spare and mysterious exhibition presents sculptures by Alberto Giacometti, Mark di Suvero and the folk artist Edgar Tolson, and a giant photograph by Jeff Wall. Matthew Marks, 522 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-0200 or matthewmarks.com, through Aug. 11. (Johnson)

Group Show Four interesting Conceptualists: Pierre Bismuth folds a giant reproduction of a Jasper Johns flag painting into a Donald Judd-like box; Ryan Gander makes large photographs of bulletin boards bearing puzzling documents; Karl Haendel covers a wall with his large, handmade graphite copies of consumer-culture ephemera; and T. Kelly Mason constructsa walk-in, padded environment with soft, rain-related sounds and a video. Cohan and Leslie, 138 10th Avenue, near 19th Street, (212) 206-8710 or cohanandleslie.com, through Aug. 18. (Johnson)

Michael Heizer Sculptures in concrete representing prehistoric hand tools much enlarged so that they resemble Modernist sculptures by a follower of Brancusi. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 421-3292 or pacewildenstein.com, through Sept. 23. (Johnson)

'Materiality' Inventive works made of all sorts of materials in this show include a stuffed leather-and-plywood tree by Carolyn Salas; a geometric landscape with a slowing-moving, wartlike kinetic element, covered in reflective Mylar, by Charlotte Becket; a neat display of more than 200 pieces of breakfast cereal by Tom Friedman; and a sumptuous stuffed object resembling a much-enlarged amoeba by Ernesto Neto. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238 or kravetswehbygallery.com, through Aug. 25. (Johnson)

'Photography Is Not An Art!' More than 100 examples of vernacular, often anonymous photographs from fields of medicine, forensics, space exploration and advertising prove that nonart photography is often as interesting as the fine-art variety. Alan Klotz, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 741-4764 or photocollect.com, through Aug. 19. (Johnson)

Other Galleries

Zoe Leonard, Liz Deschenes and Vija Celmins This quietly gripping show of photographs and works derived from photographs includes delicate, hand-drawn images of a spider web, and the ocean's surface in prints by Ms. Celmins; grainy aerial photographs that look as if they were shot from a spy satellite by Ms. Leonard; and Minimalist photograms with silvery surfaces by Ms. Deschenes. Tracy Williams, 313 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212) 229-2757 or tracywilliamsltd.com, through next Friday. (Johnson)

Last Chance

* HANS BELLMER: ' PETITES ANATOMIES, PETITES IMAGES.' This extraordinary show of more than 70 images takes you beyond the surface obsessions of Bellmer's girl-crazed art to unveil some of his working processes as a sculptor, installation artist, photographer, editor and hand-colorist, whose preference for small scale intensifies the voyeuristic nature of his art. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444 or ubugallery.com; closes today. (Smith)

* CRG PRESENTS: KLAUS VON NICHTSSAGEND GALLERY Including works by Liz Luisada, Samuel Lopes and Thomas Ovilsen, this group show of work by 17 emerging artists definitely has its moments, but the strongest impression is made by the gallery-within-a-gallery effect resulting from the re-creation of the storefront facade and reception desk of the small Von Nichtssagend Gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. CRG Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 229-2766 or crggallery.com; closes today. (Smith)

George Herms Starting out as a beatnik in the 1950's, Mr. Herms has been creating and exhibiting his richly poetic assemblages of grungy found materials in California, his home state, for more than a half century. This show's eight works, from 1965 to 2002, variously call to mind Ernst, Duchamp, Cornell and Rauschenberg, but they have as well their own spiritually generous, heartfelt mix of hermetic imagination and Whitmanesque populism. Franklin Parrasch, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360 or franklinparrasch.com; closes today. (Johnson)

'How I Finally Accepted Fate' The memoir is the loosely defined theme of this interesting 10-person show. It includes Matt Keegan's video of cheerleaders celebrating his grandmother's 90th birthday; Angela Dufresne's vivid painting of a shirtless man called ''Me as a Communist Male in 'The Red and the White' ''; Carolee Schneemann's patchwork tale about modern love in photographs and typewritten words; and Maureen Duncan's three-and-a-half-hour monologue about her CD collection. EFA Gallery, 323 West 39th Street, (212) 563-5855; closes today. (Johnson)

* JUSTIN LOWE: HELTER SWELTER This labor-intensive trompe l'oeil installation passes through the emblematic sites of summer -- an urban bodega, a construction detour and an ice cream truck -- but its chief payoff is a womblike hippie heaven whose floor-of-many-colors is tiled in tightly wound T-shirts. Oliver Kamm/5BE Gallery, 621 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-0979 or 5begallery.com; closes today. (Smith)

'Money Changes Everything' A show of artworks made at least partly out of actual money: dollar bills, mostly, but Iraqi dinar notes, too. Schroeder Romero, 637 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 630-0722 or schroederromero.com; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)

* WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212 or salon94.com; closes today. (Smith)

HEADLINE: Town Battling Illegal Immigration Is Emptier Now

BYLINE: By JILL P. CAPUZZO

DATELINE: RIVERSIDE, N.J., July 27 

 BODY:
The downtown streets of this working-class town -- usually filled with many of the immigrants who have made this place home -- were unusually empty the day after the Township Council approved an ordinance banning employers and landlords from hiring or housing illegal immigrants.
 At a heated meeting on Wednesday night that one resident compared to ''The Jerry Springer Show,'' Riverside's five-member Council unanimously approved the Illegal Immigration Relief Act, citing overcrowded apartments, jammed parking lots, and a strain on the town's schools and social services, as reasons for passing the measure. 
''They're jealous of the Brazilians because they're hard workers and they live well,'' said Celeste Martiniano, a Portuguese-American who owns the Pavilion Barbecue restaurant here.
 Efforts to reach Mayor Charles Hilton and members of the Township Council were unsuccessful.
 The new law is similar to a measure passed in Hazleton, Pa., earlier this month and others being discussed by municipalities around the country. In Congress, the explosive illegal immigration issue has been bogged down over guest worker passes and the level of border enforcement. 
 Fines start at $1,000 for violations of the Riverside ordinance, which makes it illegal to hire people who cannot prove they are legally in the United States, or to rent or lease them property. A violator also could lose his or her business permit for five years.
 Before Brazilian immigrants began moving here in the last five years or so, Ms. Martiniano said, the downtown business district, once a bustling shopping area, had been in decline. But the new ordinance, she said, ''this is going to kill the town.''
 For the last 25 years, Ms. Martiniano has lived in this Burlington County town of 8,000 residents, where as many as 2,000 to 3,000 immigrants live today. Business has been good since the opening of her restaurant two years ago, largely because of the growing Brazilian population. But on this day, there were no takers for the chicken legs spinning on spits over open flames.
 Ms. Martiniano said that immigrants here were scared in the aftermath of the vote, and that those who have been most vocal against immigrants ''are not working and have nothing better to do.''
 Ingrid Reinhold said that the new ordinance smacked of discrimination. She and her husband, Gustav, own three businesses along Scott Street: a music store that features mostly Latin music, a Brazilian cafe that is undergoing renovations, and a bustling Western Union office, where many of the immigrants can stay in contact with relatives back home. Down the block is another Brazilian restaurant and a Brazilian nail salon. The yellow and green Brazilian flag is pasted to many shop windows.
 ''Three years ago this was a dead town,'' said Ms. Reinhold, who was born in Ecuador. ''Now you see all the stores are open, the people are out. If they do this, it's going to be like it was before.''
 Standing in front of his recording studio next door, Ed Robins talked about the Wednesday Council meeting. Describing the meeting's adversarial atmosphere among members in the audience, Mr. Robins said ''it reminded me of being on Jerry Springer.''
 Although his business depends very little on the town's growing immigrant population, Mr. Robins also worried about the ordinance's impact on the business district and real estate values, which he said have increased with the influx of Brazilians.
 ''As a community, we should have drawn everybody together, including the illegals and approached it intelligently, rather than taking this small town and ripping it apart,'' Mr. Robins said.
 Certainly, the Brazilians are not the only immigrant population to call Riverside home. This town on the Delaware River was originally settled by Germans in 1851, followed by Poles, Italians and Irish in the early 20th century. Once a thriving industrial town, the immigrants provided much of the workforce for the textile mills of Riverside, once the country's leading manufacturer of men's hosiery, and the Philadelphia Watchcase Company, headquartered here until it closed its doors in 1956.
 After the factories closed, the movie theater burned down and many shoppers migrated to nearby malls. Its new distinction, recognized at one point by the Guinness Book of World Records, was having the most bars and liquor licenses in a mile-square town. 
 Many of those bars remain, and in some of them there is talk about what needs to be done to slow the tide of immigration.
 At Big Daddy's Pub on Scott Street, Dave Dalhman Jr., described the town's growing immigrant population as ''a swarm of bees.'' Having lived here for the first 40 years of his life, Mr. Dalhman said he was forced to move to a neighboring town two years ago.
 ''I'm a minority here now,'' said Mr. Dalhman. ''I love this town. I was born and raised here, and I'd love to come back here, but that's not going to happen.''

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: $2 Billion For Hudson Tunnel 

BYLINE: AP; Compiled by Emily Vasquez

 BODY:
The board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey yesterday authorized the spending of $2 billion toward a proposed $6 billion commuter train tunnel under the Hudson River. The financing approval is a significant step for the proposed two-track tunnel, a project that would double commuter rail capacity between the two states in a decade. Construction could begin as soon as 2009 and be complete by 2016. Adjusting for inflation over the next decade, the project is expected to cost $7.2 billion at completion, said George D. Warrington, executive director of New Jersey Transit, the project's sponsor.

HEADLINE: What About Us?

 BODY:
At a time when global warming has become an overriding issue, NASA has been delaying or canceling programs that could shed light on how the climate changes. The shortsighted cutbacks appear to result from sharply limiting NASA's budget while giving it hugely expensive tasks like repairing the stricken shuttle fleet, finishing construction of the space station, and preparing to explore the Moon and Mars. Something had to give, and NASA's choices included research into how the planet's climate is responding to greenhouse gas emissions. 
 The agency's shifting priorities may have been signaled by subtle changes in its mission statement this year, as described by Andrew Revkin in The Times. Although the agency had previously led off its goals with ''to understand and protect our home planet,'' a new mission statement reads simply, ''To pioneer the future in space exploration, scientific discovery and aeronautics research.''
Agency officials note that sub-goal 3A still proposes to ''study earth from space to advance scientific understanding and meet societal needs.'' But earth studies seem to be in trouble.
 The agency has canceled a deep space observatory to monitor solar radiation, water vapor, clouds, aerosols and other things important to climate change. It has delayed a mission with Japan to measure global precipitation, decided not to pay for a mission to measure soil moisture around the world, and reduced the money available to analyze data. Under Congressional pressure, the agency has reinstated a mission to study aerosols and solar radiation from orbit. But it has little money to do much else in coming years. A National Academy of Sciences panel warned that the nation's system of environmental satellites was ''at risk of collapse.''
 The problems in earth sciences are part of a broader slowdown in science missions as NASA tries to do too much with too little. NASA officials sometimes say that they are slowing the rate of growth in science budgets. But Congressional analysts say the agency cut its science spending in 2006 to cover unexpectedly expensive shuttle repairs. It now plans small increases that won't keep up with inflation or bring spending back to previous levels for many years. One analyst likened NASA to a mugger who takes $100 from a victim and then returns $20 a year, telling the recipient to be thankful. 
 A Senate committee has approved $1 billion in emergency funds to reimburse programs that were cut to pay for the shuttle repairs. If that doesn't fly, count home-planet studies and other science programs as a casualty of the administration's insistence on completing the space station.

HEADLINE: Mainstay S.U.V.'s And Trucks Lose Their Primacy To Smaller Cars

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Four years ago, when Detroit's designers and engineers were working on new vehicles for the middle of the decade, they had only to look out their windows to see what was selling: sport utility vehicles and big pickup trucks.
 And little wonder, given gasoline prices of $1.36 a gallon on average. It seemed an easy choice for Detroit to stick with these vehicles -- which, with their big profit margins, had become its economic underpinning.
But in Japan, where engineers and designers were pulling up to gas stations that sometimes charged four times as much for fuel, the answer was to focus on fuel-efficient vehicles.
 Now, those choices are playing out in the automakers' lineups and on their bottom lines. With the United States experiencing its own high gasoline prices, consumers are starting to react like their counterparts elsewhere, choosing fuel-efficient cars as the sales of S.U.V.'s and other big vehicles lag. And General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, which still produce far more of these light trucks than they do automobiles, are now seeing the repercussions. 
 ''The cost is not only in lost sales, but more broadly, in reputation,'' said John Paul MacDuffie, a co-director of the International Motor Vehicle Program, a research group studying the auto industry, and a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
 The second quarter made that abundantly clear. With gasoline selling for $3 and more across the country, all three Detroit companies reported losses or sharp declines in their profits in North America. At the same time, consumers' interest in fuel economy was nearly three times as great as it was in 2002, when the decisions about the vehicles Detroit would sell this year were essentially made. 
 Back then, only 22 percent of likely car buyers said they were ''extremely interested'' in fuel economy, according to a survey by CNW Marketing Research of Bandon, Ore. Now, 60 percent of buyers say it is a priority, and that is showing up in the marketplace. 
 Car sales are up 2.5 percent this year, while light truck sales have fallen 6.3 percent. S.U.V. sales alone are down 12 percent. 
 The shift from big vehicles toward cars is a particular problem for Chrysler, where almost 75 percent of its sales are light trucks (essentially the same percentage as in 2002). That is the highest among the Detroit companies, according to the industry statistics firm Autodata.
 On Thursday, Chrysler said it earned just $65 million in the second quarter and warned that it might lose more than $600 million next quarter. ''The increase in fuel prices has had a significant impact,'' said Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive at Chrysler's parent, DaimlerChrysler.
 By contrast, Japanese companies are rolling up billion-dollar profits for the quarter, buoyed by their gains in the United States. 
 To be sure, Japanese companies added plenty of S.U.V.'s and pickups to their lineups this decade, but they still sell far more cars than light trucks, as they have since their vehicles went on sale in the United States three and four decades ago .
 ''We're a global company that has a large amount of our sales volume coming out of Asia as well as Europe,'' both of which are dominated by cars, said James Lentz, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales, the company's American marketing arm. Toyota's sales are up nearly 10 percent this year from 2005. ''In our case, we basically build what consumer demand is.'' 
 To follow suit, the solution for Detroit's automakers may be simple: cut back on S.U.V.'s and pickups and put their resources into developing the cars that American drivers increasingly want.
 Indeed, Detroit companies are emphasizing their car lineups in advertisements and news briefings, promising that many more fuel-efficient models are on the way. They are pledging, for instance, to sell far more flexible-fuel vehicles, which can operate on gasoline or a gasoline-ethanol mixture.
 But just as significant, Detroit companies are not abandoning big vehicles. For one thing, they simply cannot afford to. 
 While profits are down from the glory days of the big vehicles, Detroit companies still had a gross profit of $12,250 on each big S.U.V. and $11,449 on each big pickup truck they sold in the first half of the year, according to an estimate by CNW Research. The figure does not include incentives or other payments to dealers.
 By contrast, the companies made only $1,100 on every compact car they sold and $800 on every subcompact, CNW's estimates showed.
 Given that it takes 10 compact cars to provide the profits of a single pickup truck, ''that's the reason why no one is giving up on the full-sized S.U.V. market,'' said Art Spinella, CNW's president.
 It also explains why it seems that the American auto companies were caught short when gasoline prices rose. 
 William Clay Ford Jr., the chief executive at Ford, who is known for his environmental bent, said his company, whose sales are down 4 percent this year, recognized what was happening with gas prices last summer. It is developing more-fuel efficient vehicles, like a crossover vehicle called the Edge, which is due late this year.
 ''But as you know, our product plans take several years to unfold,'' Mr. Ford said in a conference call with reporters and analysts last week. ''Do I wish we had them all out this year in response'' to high gas prices? he asked rhetorically. '' Heck yes, I do.'' Still, he said, the company's future product plan now takes $3 gas into account.
 In the meantime, Ford must sell a lineup of vehicles developed when prices were lower. While it offers family cars like the Ford Fusion, Ford will soon begin selling new versions of its big Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator S.U.V.'s, which officials must be hoping will not experience the fate of the most recent version of the Ford Explorer.
 Introduced last fall just after Hurricane Katrina sent gasoline prices soaring, that Explorer never caught on. Sales plummeted 36 percent in June, even as sales of the Toyota Corolla rose 38.7 percent.
 Detroit's mixed message can only hurt it, Mr. MacDuffie said. ''If there's not a show of responsiveness that really is persuasive and picks up some of the higher demand for smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, I think they're in trouble,'' he said.
 For their part, Detroit executives argue that their new S.U.V.'s and pickups are more fuel-efficient than earlier versions, and that they will be smart choices for drivers made wary by high gas prices.
 G.M., whose sales are down 12 percent this year, is already using that argument as it prepares to introduce new versions of its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups in Detroit next week.
 ''We'll launch a great product and see what happens,'' the chief financial officer, Frederick Henderson, said.
 But even Mr. Zetsche, DaimlerChrysler's chief, is wary about what lies ahead at Chrysler. Its second-half volley of new vehicles includes several more Jeep models -- which probably seemed like a great idea in 2002, when Chrysler faced criticism because it was not selling enough different varieties of Jeeps. 
 Now, however, lots full of unsold Jeeps have become as common a sight in metropolitan Detroit this summer as the construction cones dotting its highways.
 As Mr. Zetsche remarked, ''There's no doubt that we are living in a volatile environment.''

HEADLINE: Missed Estimates Lead a Market Retreat

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks fell for a second day after Aetna and Dow Chemical said cost increases would hurt this year's earnings and after Microsoft caused concern about a possible delay in its new Windows Vista software.
 ''The market is punishing stocks that miss estimates,'' said John A. Carey, who manages about $11 billion at Pioneer Investment Management in Boston.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 5.20 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1263.20. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 2.08 points to 11,100.43. The Nasdaq composite index, which gets 41 percent of its value from computer-related shares, declined 15.99, or 0.8 percent, to 2054.47. 
 Equities had rallied earlier in the day as profit at Exxon Mobil surpassed estimates. Exxon, which had climbed as much as 1.6 percent during the trading session, ended up declining 13 cents to $66.47 at day's end.
 Stocks also suffered after Kevin Johnson, a Microsoft co-president, said the company would ship Vista, postponed in March, when it was ready, leaving investors to speculate about delays. Microsoft's shares lost 43 cents, or 2 percent, to $23.94, and helped pushed a gauge of S.& P. 500 technology shares down 0.5 percent.
 Aetna fell $6.71, or 17 percent, to $33.25. The company said profit fell 1 percent as the costs of treating insured patients increased, and the company warned expenses would continue to rise. It also cut its forecast for medical membership gains for 2006.
 Dow Chemical declined $3.78, or 10 percent, to $33.50, after its second-quarter profit fell 19 percent as costs for oil-derived raw materials outpaced price gains. Net income was $1.05 a share, less than the $1.13 a share expected by analysts.
 About nine stocks fell for every four that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.82 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 5.3 percent more than the three-month daily average.
 Americans bought fewer homes than expected in June, according to a Commerce Department report. Purchases dropped to an annual pace of 1.13 million in June, less than the 1.15 million pace economists expected, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. That pushed a gauge of home builders in S.& P. indexes down 1.8 percent. 
 Pulte Homes fell 89 cents, to $29.16, after its second-quarter earnings declined 20 percent and the company cut its profit forecast for the rest of the year as higher mortgage rates sap demand.
 Harrah's Entertainment, the casino company, slipped $3.49 to $60.36 after it said second-quarter profit excluding some costs was 95 cents a share, less than the $1.02 analyst estimate.
 Comcast shares added $1.50, or 4.6 percent, to $34.02 for its largest gain since August 2004. The company reported second-quarter profit that exceeded analysts' estimates and raised its 2006 forecasts for sales and operating cash flow growth after signing up more telephone customers.
 Some technology shares bucked the general trend and posted increases. Symantec, the maker of antivirus software, added $1.45, or 9.1 percent, to $17.25 after it said first-quarter profit excluding some items was 24 cents a share, exceeding estimates.
 Akamai Technologies, a maker of systems that accelerate Web page loading, jumped $6.75, to $36.75, after it said second-quarter profit excluding some costs was 20 cents a share, more than the 18-cent estimate of analysts.
 Treasury prices were slightly lower yesterday. By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note fell 1/32 to 100 21/32, and the yield was unchanged.
 Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of five-year notes: 



 (000 omitted in dollar figures)	 	Price	99.474	High Yield	4.995	Low Yield	4.920	Median Yield	4.966	Total applied for	$34,807,463	Accepted	$16,829,863	Noncompetitive	$212,652	Interest set at	4 7/8	


The five-year notes mature July 31, 2011.

HEADLINE: On the Eve Of Madness

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: Damascus, Syria 

 BODY:
Over Turkish coffee the other morning, I picked up a copy of The Syria Times, the local English-language paper, and my eye immediately went to a small box at the top of the front page. It said, ''The Middle East on the Eve of Modernity P. 5.''
 I thought: What a perfect way to describe the Middle East today -- going back to some pre-modern era. Alas, The Syria Times was not trying to be ironic. It turned out the headline was the title of a book about Aleppo in the 18th century. But had it been a news headline it would have been apt. 
Condoleezza Rice must have been severely jet-lagged when she said that what's going on in Lebanon and Iraq today were the ''birth pangs of a new Middle East.'' Oh, I wish it were so. What we are actually seeing are the rebirth pangs of the old Middle East, only fueled now by oil and more destructive weaponry.
 Some of the most primordial, tribal passions, which always lurk beneath the surface here -- Sunnis versus Shiites, Jews versus Muslims, Lebanese versus Syrians -- but are usually held in check by modern states or bonds of civilization, are exploding to the top. 
 There is nothing that you can't do to someone in the Middle East today, and there is no leader or movement -- no Nelson Mandela and no million-mom march -- coming out of this region, or into this region, to put a stop to the madness.
 And I mean madness. We've seen Sunni Muslims in Iraq suicide-bomb a Shiite mosque on Ramadan; we've seen Shiite militiamen torture Sunnis in Iraq by drilling holes in their heads with power tools; we've seen Jordanian Islamist parliamentarians mourning the terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, even though he once blew up a Jordanian wedding; we've seen hundreds of Palestinian suicide bombings of Israeli cafes and buses; and we've seen Israel retaliating by, at times, leveling whole buildings, with the guilty and the innocent inside.
 Now we've seen the Hezbollah leader, Hasan Nasrallah, take all of Lebanon into a devastating, unprovoked war with Israel, just to improve his political standing and take pressure off Iran. 
 America should be galvanizing the forces of order -- Europe, Russia, China and India -- into a coalition against these trends. But we can't. Why? In part, it's because our president and secretary of state, although they speak with great moral clarity, have no moral authority. That's been shattered by their performance in Iraq.
 The world hates George Bush more than any U.S. president in my lifetime. He is radioactive -- and so caught up in his own ideological bubble that he is incapable of imagining or forging alternative strategies. 
 In part, it is also because China, Europe and Russia have become freeloaders off U.S. power. They reap enormous profits from the post-cold-war order that America has shaped, but rather than become real stakeholders in that order, helping to draw and defend redlines, they duck, mumble, waffle or cut their own deals. 
 This does not bode well for global stability. A religious militia that calls itself ''the party of God'' takes over a state and drags it into war, using high-tech rockets -- mullahs with drones -- and the world is paralyzed. Those who ignore this madness will one day see it come to a theater near them.
 In part, though, this madness is home-grown. I sat at a swank rooftop restaurant the other night with some young Syrian writers and listened to a discussion between a young woman dressed in trendy clothes, talking about how she would prefer to see Israel disappear, another writer who argued that Nasrallah was an Arab disaster, and an Arab journalist who described the ''pride'' and ''dignity'' every Arab felt at seeing Hezbollah fight Israel to a standstill.
 When will the Arab-Muslim world stop getting its ''pride'' from fighting Israel and start getting it from constructing a society that others would envy, an economy others would respect, and inventions and medical breakthroughs from which others would benefit? 
 There will be no new Middle East -- not as long as the New Middle Easterners, like Rafik Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister, get gunned down; not as long as Old Middle Easterners, like Nasrallah, use all their wits and resources to start a new Arab-Israeli war rather than build a new Arab university; and not as long as Arab media and intellectuals refuse to speak out clearly against those who encourage their youth to embrace martyrdom with religious zeal rather than meld modernity with Arab culture. 
 Without that, we are wasting our time and the Arab world is wasting its future. It will forever be ''on the eve of modernity.''

HEADLINE: Masters of Statecraft Turn World Inside Out 

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, July 27 

 BODY:
It began with a head-butt and ended with Asian domination of the world -- and in between Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice played the piano.
 The annual gala dinner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations lived up to its reputation as the wacky highlight of regional diplomacy on Thursday night. 
In keeping with tradition, foreign ministers from seven countries, including Ms. Rice, performed away from the cameras for the amusement of their Asean hosts, revealing both hidden talents and, in a few cases, talents that are best hidden.
 The Japanese foreign minister, Taro Aso, did a Humphrey Bogart impersonation, New Zealand's Winston Peters sang like Johnny Cash, China's Li Zhaoxing led a choir and South Korea's Ban Ki-moon strutted the stage in green sequins.
 Canada's Peter MacKay, dressed in a black referee's uniform, opened the night with a mock Asean-Canada football match that ended with a Zinedine Zidane head-butt and a red card.
 Then Mr. Aso's troupe of Foreign Ministry officials took the stage and the night sped from mildly amusing to plain bizarre.
 Seemingly inspired by comic books and ''Casablanca,'' the plot of the Japanese skit revolved around a futuristic, global pandemic of giant furry frogs.
 As Mr. Aso, wearing trench coat and hat, dragged Bogart-like on a cigarette, his officials hopped on stage in frog outfits or dressed as a fish, Power Rangers or mutant lobsters. A creature called Aso's Assistant Robot also made an appearance.
 China's Mr. Li followed.
 His suited officials did not try to compete with Japan for costumes but were easily the best singers. The patriotic lyrics written by Mr. Li serenaded a China ''radiating with charm.''
 The South Koreans danced to Abba's ''Mamma Mia,'' though their foreign minister only appeared at the end, dressed in green-sequined jacket, to share the curtain call.
 Unfortunately, there was no curtain.
 If there had been, it surely would have come down on the New Zealanders who whispered their way through ''Oh Islands in the Sun.'' Only Mr. Peters's gravelly voice could be heard.
 Then Ms. Rice, wearing a red dress and pearls, made a serious musical contribution. 
 An accomplished musician who studied the piano in college, she stole the show in a duet with a Malaysian violinist. She called the piece -- a Brahms sonata -- a ''prayer for peace.''
 Russia's Sergey V. Lavrov closed the show by lampooning his host with a skit set in a future when Asean, not the United States, was the sole superpower. Playing himself, he pretended to be briefed by a Kremlin official on the new hegemony.
 The rest of the world, he was told, was being forced to sell goods free to Asean to stay in its favor.
 Mr. Lavrov asked, ''What have our U.S. friends offered?''
 An official replied: ''They are very, very smart. They have sent Rice.''

PERSON: Michael N. Gianaris 

HEADLINE: After Cold Showers in the Dark, a Politician's Blood Boils 

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
MAYBE it was the solid week of taking ice cold showers, a novelty on that sizzling first day of the Queens blackout, but a nasty ritual by the time his seventh morning ablution without amenities rolled around, that left Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris more than a little steamed. 
 Or maybe it was the fact that when all-things-electric faded to black at his home in Astoria on the night of July 17, he was in video heaven, in the midst of pitching a Tom Glavine shutout on his Major League Baseball 2K6 video baseball game: brutal timing for any Mets lover. He says it gets worse: When he dialed Consolidated Edison to ask why his neighborhood's power, along with his baseball mojo, had vanished, he was connected with a generic recording that assured him Con Ed was on the case. Then it hung up on him. Politicians hate not getting the last word in. 
Talk about having multiple motives for seeking vengeance against his very, very local utility company; the big blue power plants that supply 60 percent of the city's electricity loom just around the corner from his home and his office. He used to think of Con Ed as a pretty useful neighbor; not anymore. 
 Mr. Gianaris, a clean-shaven 36 with or without hot water, was the guy caught smirking behind Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg at the July 24 news conference at which the mayor gave Con Ed's chief executive, Kevin Burke, a figurative pat on the head for the company's efforts to end the power failure that marooned 100,000 residents of western Queens in utilities limbo.
 A smirk may be worth a thousand words, but Mr. Gianaris, accompanied by his fellow Democrats Councilmen Eric N. Gioia and Peter F. Vallone Jr., also piped up to let it be known that they, unlike the mayor, were demanding Mr. Burke's head on a proverbial platter. Or a manhole cover. Whichever was hotter. They still are. 
 ''We have called for Kevin Burke's resignation, but so far he has failed to take our advice,'' says Mr. Gianaris, smirking again. ''He has failed about as badly as a head of a corporation can fail. We are in uniform agreement about one thing, that the Con Ed workers on the street deserve our thanks,'' he adds, noting that he glad-hands them every chance he gets. ''It's the management of Con Ed that seems to be a disaster.'' 
 He can't understand why the mayor would stand by Mr. Burke: ''I believe Con Ed low-balled the number of customers affected by the blackout purposefully to disguise the severity of the problem. It seems like they were hoping they could figure out how to fix it before anybody noticed. No one can be that inept. You can't go overnight from having 400 customers with no power to 25,000 customers in the dark without a light bulb going off in your head, no pun intended.'' 
 ALTHOUGH power is restored on the home front, where he lives with his fiancee, Clare Cusack, a Manhattan lawyer, and their cat, Murphy, and at his district office, where the decor runs to statues of Greek gods, goddesses and wise guys like Socrates, Mr. Gianaris, in shirt-sleeves at his tidy desk, remains livid.
 Outside his window, a pair of Con Ed repair trucks, shiny new models bearing the image of a work-gloved hand giving a thumbs-up, are parked at the corner of Ditmars Boulevard and 31st Street. The hum of sidewalk generators wafts through the summer simmer. Not quite business as usual: according to him, the nine-day blackout has cost Queens merchants tens of millions of dollars in spoiled food and lost revenues.
 ''This was more than an inconvenience; it was a health risk,'' says Mr. Gianaris, also peeved with the mayor for not asking Gov. George E. Pataki to declare a state of emergency in western Queens. 
 The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, is investigating Con Ed's performance during the blackout; charges of reckless endangerment are a distinct possibility, says Mr. Gianaris, himself a graduate of Harvard Law School and a former counsel to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. So are civil suits. The City Council, the Assembly and the State Public Service Commission are also conducting inquiries. Con Ed has no explanation yet for why 10 major feeder cables failed, and attributed its inaccurate initial estimate of people without power to the difficulty of pinpointing customers served by the underground system. 
 Certainly the issue has brought out the hothead in Mr. Gianaris, an ambitious yet low-key type who voluntarily dropped out of the attorney general race despite raising $2 million over two years to explore his candidacy. Why withdraw? Because it seemed a losing, and divisive, proposition to challenge the son of his political mentor, Mario M. Cuomo, in a primary. ''Politics is where preparedness meets circumstance, and even though I felt prepared to make a difference, the circumstances weren't right.''
 In the meantime, the circumstantial evidence against Con Ed looks relatively damning from where Mr. Gianaris, who was first elected in 2000, sits and stews. ''The truth will come out,'' he says. ''You know what they say: It's always the cover-up that's worse than the underlying cause.''
 A lifelong resident of Astoria, Mr. Gianaris, the son of Greek immigrants, graduated from Fordham University, where his father has taught economics for 40 years. Besides politics, he loves crossword puzzles and softball. Elected officials in Queens play a charity game against Con Ed each August. This year's should be a barnburner.

HEADLINE: Trial Date Set for Investor Jailed Since 2000 

BYLINE: By The Bloomberg News

 BODY:
A global investment manager, Martin A. Armstrong, who has languished in a New York jail for more than six years on contempt charges, will go to trial this fall on a 1999 indictment accusing him of swindling Japanese investors of $700 million. 
 Mr. Armstrong, the money manager, antiquities collector and founder of Princeton Economics International, recently had his criminal case assigned to a new judge, who immediately set a trial date for Oct. 24.
 ''I have never had a case this old,'' Judge John F. Keenan of United States District Court in Manhattan, said at a hearing last week. ''You have a firm trial date -- nonnegotiable, nonadjournable, non-nothing.''
 Mr. Armstrong was jailed in 2000 by a different judge overseeing a civil suit by the Securities and Exchange Commission, after failing to surrender $14.9 million in assets including gold and rare coins. Mr. Armstrong claimed he did not have them. An appeal, his fourth, is pending.
 For six and a half years, he has been held at a 12-story federal detention center in Lower Manhattan, along with accused gang members, drug dealers, mobsters and terrorists awaiting trial. 
 If Mr. Armstrong is convicted at his criminal trial, it is unclear whether he would get credit for the time he has served for contempt. That decision will be made by Judge Keenan. 
 Mr. Armstrong built a reputation on his theory that economic cycles recur over centuries. Operating from an office overlooking the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, his New Jersey-based firm grew to manage as much as $3 billion for Japanese investors. The firm no longer operates.
 The United States authorities said Mr. Armstrong had hid huge trading losses by using funds from new investors to pay off old ones. On Sept. 13, 1999, the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Princeton Economics and Mr. Armstrong, and prosecutors filed criminal fraud charges. The criminal charges are still pending.
 The civil suit is also still pending. On Jan. 14, 2000, Federal District Judge Richard Owen, who is overseeing that case, jailed Mr. Armstrong for failing to turn over the remaining assets of his companies.
 Mr. Armstrong told Judge Owen that he did not have them, and the judge did not believe him.
 David Cooper, Mr. Armstrong's lawyer, said he and his client would be ready for trial.
 ''I think the term was, 'Ready or not,' '' he said of Judge Keenan's order.

HEADLINE: Chevron, Like Its Rivals, Reports Higher Profit Amid Global Concerns 

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
Chevron reported yesterday that its second-quarter earnings climbed by 18 percent, marking the company's highest profit for any three-month period. But the results paled next to the earnings announced this week by other large oil companies, and Chevron's stock price dropped substantially on a day when American markets otherwise soared.
 Like Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP and ConocoPhillips, who have all reported a banquet of riches in recent days, Chevron said that it had been profiting from the rising price of oil, which is now more than $70 a barrel, and strong refining margins. 
In all cases, however, the reports of profits were full of caveats. The companies reported higher labor and equipment costs, enduring expenses from last year's Gulf Coast hurricanes, drying wells in long-established fields and mounting taxes demanded by foreign governments.
 Chevron and the other companies noted in their earnings reports that they were increasingly reliant on giant projects that take years to develop in countries like Nigeria, Angola, Venezuela and Kazakhstan, places where changes of government can lead to torn-up contracts and possible expropriation.
 Chevron, based in San Ramon, Calif., said it earned $4.35 billion, or $1.97 a share, up from $3.68 billion, or $1.76 a share, for the same quarter last year. Revenues rose $5 billion, to $52 billion, from the same period in 2005 because of higher prices for crude oil and refined products and the added sales from Unocal operations acquired last August.
 The company's profits would have been larger had it not been for a $300 million charge for uninsured costs for damages to equipment caused by last year's hurricanes. 
 Shares of Chevron fell 2.5 percent, to $66.03, in New York Stock Exchange trading. Analysts said that investors were disappointed that Chevron did not meet their expectations for even higher profits and were concerned over company warnings that its production would decrease in Venezuela because of greater control over oil fields exercised by the government of President Hugo Chavez. In a conference call, Chevron executives told analysts yesterday that the conversion of their Venezuelan subcontracting agreements to joint ventures with the Pdvsa state oil company would reduce company production by 90,000 barrels of oil a day in the second half of the year.
 ''The financial impact of that is immaterial to Chevron,'' Chevron chairman and chief executive officer, David J. O'Reilly, said, ''because we're going to a higher margin but lower volume amount of crude there.'' Mr. O'Reilly added that the company was shifting its international operations to more stable areas, like Asia, the Caribbean and the West Coast of the United States. 
 Nevertheless, the loss of Venezuelan production will contribute to a slight decrease in forecasted total company production to 2.6 million barrels of oil a day in the second half.
 Market jitters over Chevron's results reflected a troubling trend shared by virtually all the major international oil companies: increasing exposure in politically unstable countries, where nationalistic governments like Venezuela's are tightening terms of contracts, and guerrilla attacks on oil facilities are mounting in places like Nigeria.
 ''Their dependency on unstable areas is increasing,'' said Antoine Halff, an oil analyst at Fimat USA, a brokerage firm, speaking about Chevron but also other companies. ''The share of their production that used to come from stable economies like the U.S. or the North Sea is declining because those areas are mature and face production decline.''
 The week of big oil profits reached a crescendo Thursday when both Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell reported a 36 percent gain in second-quarter earnings.
 But Shell reported that its oil and gas production actually fell by 8 percent for the quarter, due largely to the loss of 177,000 barrels a day in Nigeria because of political unrest and production contracts under which output is obliged to drop as oil prices rise.
 Exxon, which reported a stunning $10.36 billion net income for the quarter, was the only one of the big three producers to increase output in the quarter. Much of that growth was produced by the recent start-up of the Erha project 60 miles off the Nigerian shore.
 ConocoPhillips reported a 65 percent increase in profit on Wednesday for the second quarter. But there were soft spots in its performance. Production in its Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, field was off by 20,000 barrels a day, and repairs cut output in the North Sea.
 Those shortcomings were more than compensated for by its large investments in Libya, the Timor Sea and Russia's Lukoil. Net income from the company's noncontrolling stake in the Russian oil company soared 55 percent to $387 million in the quarter.
 Analysts have warned that ConocoPhillips made a risky move by purchasing the stake in Lukoil in 2004, but the bet significantly increased the company's reserves at a bargain price.

HEADLINE: A Defense Of Short-Termism

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
ONCE upon a time, in a bygone era, a new creature began stalking Wall Street. He was called a ''corporate raider,'' and he made strange utterances that executives had not heard before. 
 He growled that executives cared more about building empires than building shareholder value. He bought big stakes in bloated, inefficient companies and began demanding -- demanding! -- that chief executives cut loose money-losing units to become more competitive. He insisted that management be paid with stock and options so that they would start caring about the stock price, and would be rewarded as their shareholders were rewarded.
And how did executives respond to this alien threat? They resisted mightily, of course.
 Among the major arguments they raised was that these new creatures didn't really care about the companies they were stalking. All they cared about was a short-term fix that would lift the stock price, even if that so-called fix ultimately hurt the company. The raiders, executives said, didn't just want to pare back unprofitable divisions; they wanted to slice into valuable research and development. They wanted to throw out the baby with the bath water. Why, executives asked, should they sacrifice the long-term health of the corporations they were running just because some rich financier wanted to get a little richer? 
 Yes, well, that was then.
 AND this is now. The former Securities and Exchange commissioner William H. Donaldson is standing at a podium in a Manhattan hotel. It is this past Tuesday -- smack dab in the middle of ''quarterly earnings season''-- and about 40 people, including a handful of reporters, have gathered to listen to Mr. Donaldson decry the rise of ''short-termism'' in American business. 
 Two groups -- the Business Roundtable's Institute for Corporate Ethics, and the CFA Institute's Centre for Financial Market Integrity -- have produced a report about the corrosive effect of short-term thinking in American business. Mr. Donaldson is helping them unveil the report at the luncheon. 
 In addition to laying out the problem of short-termism -- which the report describes as ''the excessive focus of some corporate leaders, investors, and analysts on short-term quarterly earnings and a lack of attention to the strategy, fundamentals and conventional approaches to long-term value creation'' -- it also proposes a handful of solutions. These include eliminating ''earnings guidance,'' pegging executive compensation to ''long-term strategic and value-creation goals'' instead of short-term stock market goals, and communicating to Wall Street more frequently about long-term strategy and fundamentals.
 ''It's a beginning,'' says Mr. Donaldson, who then cedes the floor to people from the two organizations that produced the report. 
 ''Seventy-six percent of our members say they don't want earnings guidance,'' says Jeffrey J. Diermeier, the president of the CFA Institute, which represents thousands of Wall Street analysts and professional investors. Kurt N. Schacht, the institute's managing director, adds that it is critically important that Wall Street and corporations ''get off the quarterly earnings treadmill.'' In this room, at least, there are no dissenters.
 And why would there be? Who, after all, can possibly be in favor of short-term thinking? In the space of 25 years, quarterly earnings have gone from being a requirement to an obsession that has seemingly warped the way American executives think and act. The Enron scandal, for one, was directly related to this obsession. But even putting scandal aside, it is pretty clear that too often, companies worry more about creating short-term financial results than long-term strategic results. Remember how Coca-Cola, under the late Roberto C. Goizueta, used to make its quarterly number, usually by a penny a share, like clockwork? Then, in 1997, Mr. Goizueta died, and eventually the truth came out: the company had played some financial games to smooth its earnings and achieve those results. I don't think it's a stretch to say that the company is still paying the price for some of the things it did back then. 
 ''There's a tyrant terrorizing nearly every public company in the United States,'' wrote the Harvard Business Review in 2001. ''It's called the quarterly earnings report. It dominates and distorts the decisions of executives, analysts, investors, and auditors. Yet it says almost nothing about a business's health.'' 
 It wasn't hard for me to find people to echo that line this week. ''Stop worrying about the quarter,'' said Robert Olstein, who runs the Olstein Financial Alert Fund. ''It's irrelevant.''
 Peter L. Bernstein, the well-known economic historian, said, ''There is evidence that companies will pass up profitable opportunities'' if such an investment will have a short-term effect on coming earnings.
 Peter M. Gilbert, chief investment officer for the Pennsylvania State Employees' Retirement System, said, ''Short-term focus takes the eye off creating long-term value for corporations and ultimately for the investor.''
 And Candace Browning, Merrill Lynch's global head of research, said, ''It became a game.''
 Ms. Browning was speaking in particular about earnings guidance, which companies began doling out in the 1990's. That's the now-common practice of a company estimating, within a small range, what its earnings-per-share are likely to be both quarterly and annually. Practically speaking, it means that companies get to set the bar -- and then jump over it. 
 To Mr. Olstein, this is a classic example of ''the tail wagging the dog instead of the dog wagging the tail.'' It's also a prime example of short-termism -- companies that were really focused on long-term strategy wouldn't bother trying to do the analysts' job for them, nor would they be particularly worried about the short-term hit the stock might take if it ''missed'' the consensus earnings number ginned up by the analyst community. 
 In any case, companies that are managed well for the long-term will likely see their stock price rise accordingly -- even if it is more volatile over the short term. Google doesn't give guidance, and it hasn't exactly hurt the company.
 The most shocking thing I heard this week about the bad effects of short-term thinking came from a 2005 study conducted by three economists for the National Bureau of Economic Research. They asked a series of questions about the importance of quarterly earnings to more than 400 executives and discovered that almost 80 percent of them said they ''would decrease discretionary spending'' in such critical areas as research and development, advertising and maintenance if they needed to do so to make the quarterly numbers.
 Campbell R. Harvey, a Duke University economist and one of the authors of the study, still sounded a little stunned by the results when I spoke to him. ''You would think they wouldn't want to admit this,'' he said. As he saw it, in the wake of the accounting scandals, companies were less willing to use ''accounting shenanigans,'' as he called it, to meet earnings projections. So instead, ''they are doing things that effect the real operations of the company, like postponing R.& D. This is the stuff that creates real value in the long term.''
 So why, even after hearing the horror stories, is there still a part of me that says, ''Not so fast?'' Partly it's because for all the anecdotal evidence of short-termism and its effects, there is not a lot of empirical data to back it up. Corporations, for instance, stilldo a great deal of research and development -- $250 billion worth each year, according to Baruch Lev, the well-known accounting professor at New York University.
 Mr. Lev scoffs at the notion that short-termism is even a problem. ''It would be ludicrous to tell managers, 'we're going to leave you alone for five years and then come back and monitor your performance,' '' he said. ''Even if you are long-term oriented, you are going to look at how they are doing every quarter.''
 The second reason, though, is that as I listened to Mr. Donaldson and the others, I couldn't help thinking back to the early 1980's, when the executives themselves made the exact same arguments Mr. Donaldson was making from the podium.
 Let's be honest here: for many of the executives back then, the argument that they were managing for the long-term was bogus. There was too much lethargy in too many companies, and a desire by too many executives to avoid making tough decisions -- cutting loose unprofitable divisions, for example. Having sailed through the post-war era without much in the way of global competition, there were plenty of American industries that desperately needed to be shaken up in a tougher, more competitive era. Whatever their flaws, the raiders helped spur that process -- in no small part by forcing executives to pay more attention to the stock price.
 Ms. Browning of Merrill Lynch told me that she thought ''the pendulum has swung too far in terms of focusing on the quarter.'' I agree with her. That's what often happens on Wall Street -- and, indeed, in business. We swing from one extreme to the other.
 So yes, by all means: let's get rid of earnings guidance, and start paying executives for achieving important long-term strategic goals that will help the company grow and prosper into infinity. Those are worthy suggestions. But let's not swing the pendulum back too far.
 Surely we've learned by now that long-termism can be just as much a problem as short-termism.

HEADLINE: Trade Talks Collapse, War Rages. Us, Worry?

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
SPREADING conflict in the Middle East and the collapse of global trade talks damped good news about corporate profits and giddiness in the mergers-and-acquisitions market, which is awash in private-equity capital.

DEFINE 'FREE' -- The latest round of global free-trade talks collapsed when Europe and the United States could not come to terms over how to reduce agriculture tariffs that protect farmers from overseas competition and subsidies that help them undercut competitors on exports.
To re-energize the talks, which began five years ago, President Bush had proposed a sweeping set of cuts in tariffs and subsidies last October. The European Union, which had cut its farm aid earlier, followed with more cuts, but the United States said they were not enough. 
 The failure makes it almost impossible for President Bush to reach an agreement and get it fully ratified before he leaves office.

BIG DEAL -- HCA, the nation's largest for-profit hospital operator, agreed to be acquired by private investors in what would be the largest leveraged buyout in history. Including about $11.7 billion of HCA's debt, the deal would be worth about $33 billion.
 The investors' group was led by the family of Senator Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader. His father, Thomas Frist Sr., and brother, Thomas F. Frist Jr., founded HCA. Other investors are Bain Capital, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the private equity arm of Merrill Lynch.
 The buyers said the aging baby boom generation should increase the demand for hospital beds, but skeptics said cost-cutting by insurers would impair hospital profitability in the future.
 More such deals are likely because private equity firms have raised large pools of capital. The Blackstone Group recently said it had $15.6 billion in commitments for its latest buyout fund.

OPENING UP -- The Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a sweeping set of rules to make it easier to see how much companies were paying their top executives and to discourage the manipulation of stock-option grants. It is the biggest overhaul of the rules governing the disclosure of executive pay in almost 15 years.
 The rules, which will go into effect in mid-December, call for companies to give more information on all parts of executive compensation, including new information on the lump-sum cost of management pensions and stock-option grants.
 The commission also agreed to revisit the issue of whether to require the disclosure of compensation to other highly paid employees, a requirement known as the Katie Couric clause.

INTEL IN SIGHT -- In a transaction that could reshape the semiconductor industry, Advanced Micro Devices said it would pay $5.4 billion in cash and stock for ATI Technologies, a maker of graphics chips for video games and movie animation.
 The acquisition will help A.M.D., perennially the No. 2 chip maker, close the gap with the industry leader, Intel, analysts said. ATI is developing several technologies that can grow as the electronics industry shifts from PC's to new forms of television, set-top boxes and handheld video players. The acquisition also gives A.M.D. greater strength in the market for wireless devices.
 Philips Electronics plans to field final bids worth more than $10 billion for its semiconductor division from three consortiums of private equity investors, people involved in that auction said.

GUSHER, REDUX -- Drivers may be grumbling about $3.25-a-gallon gasoline, but the prices have again supercharged the earnings of big energy corporations.
 Exxon Mobil, the largest publicly traded oil company, said it earned $10.36 billion in the quarter ended June 30, or 36 percent more than a year ago. It was the second-largest quarterly profit ever posted by any publicly traded company, topped only by Exxon's $10.71 billion quarter ended Dec. 31.
 Others were equally big. Chevron, the second-largest oil company, said it earned $4.35 billion for the three months ended in June, an 18 percent increase from the quarter last year. It was the most profitable quarter in the company's 127-year history. ConocoPhillips, the No. 3 American oil company, said its profit leapt by nearly two-thirds, to $5.19 billion, in the second quarter.
 Profits may increase next quarter, analysts said, because crude oil prices are rising, from just under $70 a barrel on average last quarter to $75 yesterday.

GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS -- General Motors and Ford Motor both posted large losses in the second quarter, dragged down by their North American operations.
 G.M. said it lost $3.1 billion in the period, compared with an adjusted loss of $235 million in the second quarter last year. Excluding charges related to factory closings and job cuts, however, G.M. said it had a $1.1 billion operating profit, which exceeded analysts' forecasts. Revenue increased 12 percent.
 Ford lost $123 million in the quarter; it had posted a profit of $946 million in the period last year.
 Globally, G.M. fell to 13.8 percent of the market from 15.1 percent in the second quarter of 2005.
 Toyota, which some analysts think may soon pass G.M. as the world's leading automaker, is set to report its quarterly results on Aug. 3. 

CHEERIER, FOR NOW -- Consumers were more confident this month than last, according to a Conference Board survey, as many people saw improvement in the job market. Still, expectations of future conditions slipped amid higher energy prices, lower housing prices and increasingly fierce fighting in Israel, Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan.
 The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes slowed for a third straight month in June, to 6.6 million on a seasonally adjusted annual basis from the 7.3 million pace last June. The national median price rose less than 1 percent from June 2005, the smallest year-over-year increase in more than 11 years.
 As home sales slow, the rental market is likely to recover, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Many Homes Are on The Market And Sales Numbers Are Declining

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
WHEN the American economy fell into recession five years ago, it was the strength of the housing market that kept the downturn short and mild. Home sales kept rising throughout the downturn, and then took off when the recession began.
 But now home sales are falling and the number of unsold homes is at the highest level ever. Housing starts are starting to fall, but remain at a high level by historical standards. If sales do not pick up this summer, when sales are usually seasonally strong, it could be a sign that prices are going to come under pressure and lead to a much larger decline in housing starts. 
The accompanying charts show year-over-year changes in sales of existing single-family homes and apartments, using six-month moving averages to smooth out monthly fluctuations. The latest figures show sales of single-family homes down 4.4 percent, the largest dip since 1995, and apartment sales off 6.6 percent. Statistics on apartment sales are only available back to 1999, but that is the worst showing in that period.
 Meanwhile, the number of existing single-family homes on the market is up 33 percent year-over-year, measured the same way. Figures from the National Association of Realtors, going back to 1983, show no comparable increase in homes for sale. The number of condominiums and cooperative apartments for sale is up 61 percent.
 The picture is consistent with demand for homes suddenly drying up, while sellers are reluctant to cut prices. Such a standoff could end with buyers returning, but it could also end with prices starting to slip, or with a lot of homes being pulled off the market.
 New homes make up a much smaller part of the market, and are not shown in the charts. But those figures show even more rapid increases in inventory and larger declines in sales.
 The sales outlook appears to be falling most rapidly in the Western states, where sales of existing single-family homes are running at 13 percent below levels a year ago. A couple of years ago, the West was showing the most rapid gains in sales.
 The Realtors do not break down inventory by region, so it is not clear from their data where the unsold homes and apartments are located. But sales of existing apartments are weakest in the South and West, which could be an indication of growing inventories in the largest states in the two regions, Florida and California.
 To be sure, over the 12 months through June more than 6 million single-family existing homes and 1.2 million new homes were sold. Only a few years ago, both of those figures would have been records, and the declines are coming from high levels. It is conceivable that the market will stabilize at levels that look weak only when compared to last year's extraordinary numbers.
 But with sales weakening and the number of available homes rising, those who warned of a housing bubble must be wondering if their fears are finally becoming reality.

HEADLINE: As Elections Near, House Passes Pension Plan and Takes Up Minimum Wage and Estate Tax

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Mary Williams Walsh contributed reporting from New York for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28 

 BODY:
The House approved a measure on Friday intended to bolster the nation's pension system, as lawmakers clashed over minimum wage legislation in a prelude to a summer of campaigning in the battle for control of Congress.
 Hoping to notch a few policy victories before heading into a five-week recess, House Republican leaders linked a $2.10 rise in the minimum wage sought by Democrats and Republican moderates to a proposal to reduce the estate tax permanently, a change sought by conservatives.
The maneuver left some Republicans uneasy and Democrats fuming. Opponents of the bill said the estate tax change and other tax breaks included in the bill that are estimated to cost about $310 billion could kill it. They accused Republicans of a cynical ploy to make it look as though they were pushing a increase in the minimum wage when their real intent was to block it. 
 ''It's a political stunt designed to give vulnerable Republicans in tough elections the opportunity to say they voted to raise the minimum wage, even though they know this bill is going nowhere in the Senate,'' said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House.
 And Senate Democratic leaders, who have repeatedly thwarted the push to cut the estate tax, said they would do so again even if the proposal included the first increase in the minimum wage since 1997.
 ''The Senate has rejected fiscally irresponsible estate tax giveaways before and will reject them again,'' said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, who added that the Republican approach amounted to legislative blackmail. 
 ''If the Republicans were serious about raising the minimum wage for the first time in nearly 10 years and extending tax relief for working Americans,'' Mr. Reid said, ''they would not hold them hostage in their effort to give the wealthiest Americans hundreds of billions more in additional tax giveaways.''
 Senior Republican lawmakers in the House and the Senate said they believed that the plan could thread its way through the Senate, however, and they packed the measure with tax breaks to attract House and Senate support. They said the estate tax plan, which would set the individual estate tax exemption at $5 million in 2015, would offset the economic cost to small businesses of paying higher minimum wages.
 ''Unlike some of my colleagues, I see this tax relief and minimum wage bill as complementary,'' said Representative Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, one of the Republicans who has joined Democrats in pressing for a wage increase. ''The sustaining of small businesses by keeping their vital assets will allow those making the minimum wage to continue working. This is a jobs bill.''
 Representative Zach Wamp, Republican of Tennessee, said Democrats were upset with the legislation because Republicans had found a clever way to link the two. ''You have seen us outfox you on this issue tonight,'' Mr. Wamp told Democrats in the floor debate.
 Under the minimum wage proposal, the current $5.15 rate would rise by $2.10 over three years in three increments, reaching $5.85 in January 2007, $6.55 on June 1, 2008, and $7.25 on June 1, 2009. The change would also allow tips to be counted toward minimum wage increases in states where that is not now allowed.
 The fate of the pension overhaul, approved on a 279 to 131 vote, was also unclear. Contentious negotiations over a final House-Senate bill broke down late Thursday in an angry exchange among Republicans over whether the pension measure should contain the new tax breaks for business and education costs.
 As a result, House and Senate leaders decided to move ahead with a pension bill that included the major elements agreed upon in the talks. But that measure, unlike a bill that would have come out of the negotiations, is open to amendment in the Senate, and any changes there could force a new round of negotiations and hold up final approval of the measure.
 The frantic legislative brinkmanship, occurring mainly behind closed doors as Republicans sought to round up votes, reflected the leadership's desire to put some accomplishments on the board before lawmakers head home for what was looming as five weeks of intense campaigning. Each party is urging lawmakers to push the competing party's messages in hundreds of events during the next five weeks.
 Legislators have been trying to amend the 32-year-old pension law for several years, spurred by a string of huge pension fund collapses. The biggest failures have been mainly in the airline and steel sectors.
 The federal government guarantees pensions, much as it guarantees bank deposits, and the failures have threatened to swamp the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation if allowed to continue. Many analysts have pointed to troubling similarities between the pension agency and the agency that once guaranteed savings and loan deposits, which collapsed in 1989 and required a $200 billion taxpayer bailout. The desire to prevent another such bailout was a force driving the pension bill forward.
 The bill, if enacted, would require companies with pension funds to close any shortfalls within seven years. It also has tests that companies would have to use to determine whether their pension plans posed a risk to the federal insurance system. Companies with such risky plans would then have to calculate how much it would cost if all qualifying employees were to take early retirement immediately, and then put that amount into their pension funds. 
 The bill was also intended to close loopholes that made it easy for companies to avoid paying their full premiums to the pension insurance system. As it inched through the House and the Senate this year, legislators added other provisions that were only loosely connected with the goal of strengthening the pension system: guidelines for companies that provide investment advice to workers, a safe harbor for pension plans vulnerable to age-discrimination lawsuits, and extensions to some tax breaks that were due to expire.

HEADLINE: U.N. Moves Toward Vote on Iran's Atom Program

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 28 

 BODY:
The five permanent members of the Security Council reached agreement Friday on a resolution demanding that Iran suspend nuclear enrichment and reprocessing work by the end of August or face the possibility of sanctions. 
 The resolution, which is expected to go to a vote in the 15-member Council next week, requests ''full and sustained suspension'' of nuclear activities by Aug. 31 and calls on all countries to prevent the shipment to Iran of any materials that could be used in its enrichment-related activities or ballistic missile programs.
 The resolution was weaker than earlier draft versions, which made the imposition of sanctions a more direct consequence of noncompliance by Tehran. The final text, worked out after objections from Russia and China, cites an article of the United Nations Charter that calls for ''further decisions'' before any punishment. The sanctions would be economic and diplomatic measures, not military force.
 The conclusion left the proposed resolution open to differing interpretations that satisfied the objectives of rival members of the Security Council.
 Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador, said the text meant that no sanctions were called for in the resolution.
 But John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, said the text made it clear that ''if Iran chooses not to comply with this mandatory resolution, chooses to continue to pursue the Iranian enrichment activities that the resolution addresses, that the next step will be the consideration of sanctions in the Security Council.''
 He added, ''It would be our intention to move forcefully to get those sanctions adopted.''
 Mr. Bolton also noted that the resolution was ''mandatory and fully binding on Iran.''
 Iran has claimed that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the United States and its European allies suspect that it is for bomb-making.
 The resolution was formally circulated to the 10 other members of the Council on Friday afternoon to allow them to send it to their capitals. If no objection is registered by Saturday afternoon, it will automatically be ready for a vote. Jean-Marc de La Sabliere of France, the president of the Council, said he hoped that could occur Monday.
 The momentum for a resolution increased on July 12, after Iran declined to respond to a package of development incentives offered a month earlier by Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States. Iran said it would not respond until Aug. 22.
 ''What we've not seen is a serious effort by Iran to engage,'' said Emyr Jones Parry, the British ambassador. '' Iran has had so many opportunities, it really is the right moment for it to respond.''
 Mr. Bolton said, ''I think this resolution will put the ball back in Iran's court.''

HEADLINE: Immigrants and the Minimum Wage

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Raise Wages, Not Walls,'' by Michael S. Dukakis and Daniel J. B. Mitchell (Op-Ed, July 25):
Finally, a sensible word about the issue that is at the core of both immigration and our own working poor: the unwillingness of Congress to risk a few votes in the name of a fair working wage.
 I live in a town that, despite its famous wealth, has a large population of Central American workers. Early every morning, the men gather outside at pickup points to be chosen for various landscaping and construction jobs. Their wives walk, tired and stooped, to their housecleaning gigs. 
 I value their presence here, but it is obvious that they are employed in this underground economy because they work more cheaply and often harder than Americans at the same level of the work force. 
 They do so only because they are earning so much more, even at these sub-minimum wages, than they would in their home countries. Americans would commit themselves, with dignity and dedication, to these jobs if the employers did the same. 
 A founding principle in our history is respect for the intrinsic value of one's labor and time. Raising the minimum wage would restore that value in the workplace and possibly solve the immigration issue at the same time.

Bob Diefendorf
Princeton, N.J., July 25, 2006

To the Editor:
 Congress does need a new approach to illegal immigration, but raising the minimum wage is not the answer. 
 Michael S. Dukakis and Daniel J. B. Mitchell write, ''Before we had mass illegal immigration in this country, hotel beds were made, dishes washed, office floors were cleaned, restaurant dishes were washed and crops picked -- by Americans.'' 
 True. But now, many of those same Americans have gone on to do bigger and better things. The same class of citizens who used to do the ''dirty jobs'' in this country now do things like earn college degrees or own their own businesses. 
 This country as a whole has gotten wealthier over the years. As lifestyles improve, the supply of workers to do the ''dirty jobs'' decreases.
 Illegal immigrants have been more than willing to step in and fill these low-paying jobs. If they were not there to fill in, this country's overall wealth would not be what it is now.

Bob Bilokonsky
Auburn Hills, Mich., July 25, 2006

To the Editor:
 Raising the minimum wage would make more jobs attractive to American workers. The history of past increases belies opponents' arguments that an increase would destroy low-wage jobs.
 But to the extent that a higher minimum wage might squeeze low-wage employers, it would squeeze them to be more efficient, which would be a boon to the American economy. 
 A higher minimum wage would cause employers to improve the productivity of their higher-paid workers, in an effort to extract the same value out of the wages they pay. 
 A higher minimum wage would not decrease the amount of work that needs to be done. Because a vast majority of minimum wage jobs are service or agricultural jobs, they simply cannot be exported. Ultimately, a fair minimum wage would benefit everyone.

Anthony Bolzan
Beverly, Mass., July 26, 2006

The writer was a strategic and legal adviser to one of the co-sponsors of a 2005 minimum wage bill in New Hampshire.

To the Editor:
 Michael S. Dukakis and Daniel J. B. Mitchell say that increasing the minimum wage and then strictly enforcing the labor laws would boost the employment of Americans and discourage illegal immigration. 
 But if we're willing to enforce laws, let's simply enforce the ones we already have against employing illegal immigrants. This would automatically drive wages higher for the jobs still worth doing that are now done primarily by illegal immigrants.

Paul Nachman
Bozeman, Mont., July 26, 2006

To the Editor:
 Illegal immigrants typically take low-paying jobs, often ''off the books'' and at less than the minimum wage. So Michael S. Dukakis and Daniel J. B. Mitchell propose raising the minimum wage to deal with this problem? 
 Raising the minimum wage would make it more likely that employers would use illegal immigrants for their labor needs, because the price of employing legal citizens and residents would be increased. Instead of decreasing the demand for illegal immigrants, a higher minimum wage would increase it. 
 Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Mitchell are right that increasing the minimum wage could lead to the destruction of some low-paying jobs. Their proposal should not be considered as the answer to anything other than how best to damage the opportunities of young, inexperienced and unskilled workers looking for their first job.

Sean Parnell
Vice President
The Heartland Institute
Chicago, July 25, 2006

To the Editor:
 Michael S. Dukakis and Daniel J. B. Mitchell have finally said what no one else seems willing to say: that a living wage and decent working conditions and benefits would fill tough jobs with American workers and reduce America's magnetic attraction for illegal immigrants. 
 Low wages pose a very real problem for Americans that is not faced by many illegal immigrants. An illegal immigrant with no family here, who is able to work two or three jobs and share sleeping quarters with others, can get by on wages that someone whose family is in this country can't get by on. 
 A further step in the right direction would be a well-advertised anonymous hot line where Americans and illegal immigrants could report employer infractions. Rather than having to inspect every employer, enforcement officers could investigate only those accused of exploiting people. The possibility of being reported would keep employers honest. 

Joanna Fancy
Santa Monica, Calif., July 25, 2006

To the Editor:
 Michael S. Dukakis and Daniel J. B. Mitchell concede that ''millions of illegal immigrants work for minimum and even sub-minimum wages.''
 Wouldn't raising the minimum wage create an even bigger divide between naturalized Americans and immigrants, and thus exacerbate the immigration issue rather than resolve it?

Almost immediately, on a busy street near the Baghdad zoo, the drivers spotted an oncoming Iraqi Army convoy, led by a shiny new Humvee. They followed standard procedure and pulled over.
 But the convoy stopped, and an officer politely ordered the surprised drivers and guards to lay down their guns while his men searched the vans for bombs.
Within minutes all eight drivers and guards had been handcuffed and locked in the back of one of the vans on a suffocating 120-degree day, the cash had been stolen by the men in the convoy -- whoever they were -- and the Iraqi banking system marked another day of its slow slide into oblivion. 
 The only thing atypical about Thursday's robbery, which was described by bank and Interior Ministry officials, is that most private banks try to avoid using armored vans, because they draw too much attention, and instead toss sacks of cash into ordinary cars for furtive dashes through the streets of Baghdad. 
 However the cash goes out, it risks being lost in the wash of robbery, kidnapping and intrigue that now plagues the system.
 Praised by the United States as a success story as recently as a few months ago, that system has quickly become a wild landscape of clandestine cash runs, huge hauls by robbers dressed as police officers and soldiers, kidnappings of bank executives with ransoms as high as $6 million, American allegations of tie-ins with insurgent financiers, and legitimate customers turned away when they go to pick up their savings and flee the country.
 ''It is a crisis,'' said Wisam K. Jamil, managing director of Iraq's oldest private bank, the Bank of Baghdad, which lost $1.5 million in a literal case of highway robbery by men wearing police uniforms last December.
 Because of that robbery, the bank lost much of its insurance coverage. Even more galling for Mr. Jamil, the insurance policy had a standard disclaimer saying that losses due to acts of war or terrorism were not covered, and as the Warka holdup on Thursday illustrated, no one can say if a theft in Iraq is committed by insurgents, bandits or genuine members of the security forces. So the insurance company has not paid Mr. Jamil's claim. 
 The difficulty in moving cash has pushed Iraqi banks into business practices seen in few other places. 
 On a recent day in the basement of the Iraqi Middle East Investment Bank, Rahim al-Abadie, a bent, gnomelike man who has worked in banking for 54 years, shuffled into the cage next to his little desk and checked 100-pound sacks of cash to be loaded in an unmarked car and sped to its destination, which he declined to disclose. Just one of the bigger sacks held 1 billion dinars (about $650,000) in bank notes, Mr. Abadie explained, chuckling darkly. 
 Hussein al-Uzri, president and chairman of the Trade Bank of Iraq, a state-owned bank, said the risks of such deliveries had to be measured in relative terms. ''Anywhere else in the world, throwing a few million dollars in the back of a Mazda and driving from the Central Bank is crazy,'' he said. ''But many people will say that living in Baghdad is crazy.''
 Until the early 1990's, when Saddam Hussein allowed private banks to open under tight restrictions, all of the country's finances were handled by state-owned banks. 
 The popularity of the private banks soared after the 2003 invasion, as depositors fled the cumbersome and often distrusted state system in ''a kind of exodus,'' said Nafie Alais Aboo, managing director of the privately owned North Bank. But both have suffered major robberies, cash shortfalls and other problems, banking and government officials say.
 Such problems have helped ignite an old-fashioned run on some banks, and several have had to turn depositors away, at least temporarily, telling them to come back another day for their money.
 ''People are withdrawing or transferring enormous amounts of money from the bank,'' said Ahmed Younis Zeki, the assistant manager of the Iraqi Private Bank, which he said lost 1 billion dinars in a brazen holdup at what appeared to be a police checkpoint in central Baghdad on April 25.
 Some bank executives say their problems have been compounded as well-to-do Iraqis and the companies they control flee the mayhem engulfing so much of the country. That flight has accelerated since sectarian tensions were heightened by the February bombing of a golden-domed mosque in Samarra, one of Shiite Islam's holiest shrines.
 ''If we count from the Samarra bombing, it's been worse by the day,'' said Mohammed F. al-Alossi, managing director of the Iraqi Middle East Investment Bank, adding that 3 billion of roughly 50 billion dinars in deposits at his bank had been withdrawn in the last two months alone.
 The banks' troubles have had a ripple effect. Iraqi companies, already struggling in a devastated economy, cannot get enough cash to meet their payrolls, said Hashim T. Atrikchi, acting manager of the Iraqi Federation of Industries and chairman of the Arab Federation of Plastic Manufacturers.
 ''Hard currency is often not available in the banks,'' he said. ''It may take two, three or even five days.'' 
 The run of hard luck for private banks stretches at least back to May 2005, when American and Iraqi troops raided the home of Saad al-Bunnia, chairman of the Iraqi Bank Association and chairman of the bank that was robbed Thursday. During the raid, the Americans seized $6 million in cash, apparently on suspicion that the money was being used to finance the insurgency.
 The bank certified that it had asked Mr. Bunnia to keep the money in his safe as a hedge against bank robberies, said Sheik Hathal Yonis Y. Aga, vice chairman of the bank. But more than a year later, the money remains frozen, he said.
 ''The problem is, these funds belong to our clients,'' Mr. Aga said. ''This has affected some of our business transactions.''
 A few months later, robbers stole $600,000 in cash being shuttled between Warka's main bank and one of its branches, Mr. Aga said. And in December, men in police uniforms stopped and robbed a car carrying $1.5 million, or roughly 2.3 billion dinars, belonging to the Bank of Baghdad on the highway to the southern city of Hilla.
 Remarkably at that stage of deteriorating security in Iraq, much of the shipment was covered by Al Ameen Insurance Company, said its managing director, Munem al-Khafaji. Even more surprisingly, the policy was underwritten by European, Saudi and Kuwaiti reinsurance firms, Mr. Khafaji said.
 But the foreign involvement came at a price. Like similar policies the world over, this one covered burglary and damage but not acts of war or terrorism. Mr. Khafaji said any payment was in limbo while an investigation rattled back and forth between law enforcement agencies and the notoriously slow Justice Ministry.
 ''They toss this ball to each other,'' Mr. Khafaji said, unable to suppress a slight smile. ''Very long time,'' he added.
 After the Bank of Baghdad theft, the foreign reinsurers refused to cover robberies in Iraq anymore, Mr. Khafaji said. The bank's managing director, Mr. Jamil, said the impact on his business was devastating: while last year he moved an average of 100 billion dinars a month around the city, by this spring the number had dropped to 15 billion dinars because the risk of robberies was so high.
 That means more and more people who come looking for their money must be asked to wait, Mr. Jamil said. ''We use diplomacy to deal with the situation,'' he said quietly during an interview in his office.
 Bank officials estimate that there has been an average of about one major robbery a month this year. Some banks seem to be particularly unlucky: only a week before Thursday's holdup, robbers tried to steal a shipment of $500,000 from the Warka Bank, though in that case the police foiled the attempt, bank officials said.
 But robbery is not the only type of crime the banks must cope with. In February, gunmen dressed in Iraqi Army uniforms kidnapped Ghalib Kubba, the chairman of the Basra International Bank, and his son Hassan, the bank's executive manager.
 The ransom: $6 million, a colossal amount here that was undoubtedly chosen because the kidnappers knew the Kubbas were bankers. The family, not the bank, paid the ransom, Hassan Kubba said, but afterward his father and the bank's entire board of directors fled to Syria, where they now run the business in absentia. 
 Despite all those problems, no one knows of a bank that has given up and closed for good, and there are still a hardy few who express optimism that this bedrock institution of a functioning democracy will survive and one day flourish. Bankers, after all, rise and fall on their ability to project confidence under the direst of conditions.
 But it is not easy. As Mr. Abadie oversees the white sacks of cash shuttling in and out of the basement of the Middle East Investment Bank, the managing director, Mr. Alossi, glances again and again toward the right corner of his desk, where a television cycles through images gathered by the bank's surveillance cameras.
 Nothing but the regular closing time would make his bank shut its doors, Mr. Alossi vowed.
 ''If the worst happens and everyone comes to withdraw his money,'' he said, ''we are ready to pay, to the last depositor.''

HEADLINE: HOUSING SLOWS, TAKING BIG TOLL ON THE ECONOMY

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and DAVID LEONHARDT; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The housing industry -- which largely carried the American economy through the tribulations of the 2000 stock-market crash, a recession and climbing oil prices -- has lost its vigor in recent months and now has begun to bog down the broader economy, which slowed to a modest 2.5 percent growth rate this spring. 
 That was a sharp comedown from the 5.6 percent growth rate of the first quarter, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, caused in part by the third consecutive quarterly decline in spending on houses and apartment buildings, after several years of rapid growth. [Page C1.]
''It hasn't slowed down a little bit -- it has slowed down a lot,'' said Doug McCraw, a developer who has scrapped his plans for a 205-unit condominium tower in a neighborhood just north of downtown Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ''Anybody who did not have a shovel in the dirt has chosen to wait till the market settles.'' 
 The housing slowdown is perhaps the clearest effect of the Federal Reserve's two-year campaign of raising interest rates in a bid to tap the brakes on the economy and reduce inflation. That campaign has been largely successful, with the decline happening gradually while other parts of the economy, mainly the corporate sector, pick up much of the slack.
 ''Housing is going from being far and away the most important contributor to growth to being a measurable drag, and it's happening gracefully so far,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Economy.com, a research company. ''But there's now a growing and measurable risk that things don't go according to plan.''
 The biggest risk, economists say, is that the optimism that fed the real-estate boom will reverse dramatically. The number of homes for sale has surged in recent months, particularly in once-hot markets, like the Northeast, Florida, California and parts of the Southwest. As builders delay land acquisition and construction it could reduce employment and spending in the coming months.
 More broadly, just as rising housing prices during the boom added to Americans' sense of wealth and well-being -- encouraging them to spend more on a variety of goods and services -- the reverse could dampen sentiment and lead consumers to pull back on their purchases. 
 While the fate of housing prices has received far more attention recently than real estate's role as an engine of job growth, the sector has also become one of the country's most important industries. Residential construction and all the activity that swirls around it -- mortgage lending, renovations and the like -- account for roughly 16 percent of the economy, making it the largest single sector, slightly bigger than health care. 
 For much of the last five years, housing -- along with health care -- was also one of the only reliable generators of jobs. From the start of 2001, when the Fed began cutting its benchmark rate to steady a faltering economy, until early last year, the housing sector added 1.1 million jobs. 
 The rest of economy lost 1.2 million jobs over the same period, according to an analysis by Moody's Economy.com.
 Housing continued its rapid growth last year, and other industries began hiring in far greater numbers than they had been, creating the healthiest national job market since 2000. In the last few months, though, three pillars of the housing sector -- homebuilders, mortgage lenders and real-estate agencies -- have stopped adding to their payrolls, and overall job growth in housing has begun to slow.
 In South Florida and Las Vegas, where contractors until recently complained that they could not find enough workers to begin work on many projects, developers are scrubbing plans for new condominiums because they cannot sell enough units to get construction financing.
 Mr. McCraw, the developer in Fort Lauderdale, said slowing condo sales and a 35 percent jump in the cost of construction materials like steel, copper and concrete convinced him to shelve his project. He is now considering building office space, where demand remains strong, or simply waiting for two years.
 In Las Vegas, cranes are still busily at work on new casino projects but dozens of gleaming condominium towers that were slated to sprout up a few miles from the Strip are not likely to be joining the city's neon-bedecked skyline soon. John Restrepo, a real estate consultant in the city, estimates that only about 7 percent of the 60,000 condominium units that were announced and under construction as of the first quarter of the year are actually being built today. 
 Among the high-profile projects that were scrapped is Las Ramblas, an 11-building, $3 billion condominium and hotel complex being developed by the Related Companies and Centra Properties and had investors like the actor George Clooney.
 ''The period of irrational exuberance we saw in '04 and '05 and the gold rush fever has gone away,'' Mr. Restrepo said.
 The Commerce Department said yesterday that housing investment fell at an annual rate of 6.3 percent last quarter, after dropping less than 1 percent in each of the two previous quarters. It grew at roughly 9 percent a year during the previous three years.
 Still, building activity for single-family homes, condos, hotels and casinos in Las Vegas is vibrant enough that construction workers are not struggling to find work, said George Vaughn, a business manager for a local of the Laborer's International Union of North America, which represents almost 5,000 workers in Las Vegas. ''The boom is still on,'' he said.
 The situation is somewhat different elsewhere. An official at the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers said housing work was more difficult to find, but most of its members had been able to find work on commercial building sites.
 ''If something were to happen with both markets, that would affect us -- and everybody for that matter,'' said Robert A. Fozio, director of the union's Northern Ohio district.
 On average, real-estate jobs pay somewhat less -- about 7 percent less a year on average -- than those in other parts of the economy. But real estate has also been one of the only industries creating good jobs for workers without college degrees in recent years, especially in construction and contracting work.
 At Hovnanian Enterprises, one of the nation's largest homebuilders, executives are renegotiating the company's options to purchase land for future developments, in an effort to delay some transactions and reduce the purchase price on other parcels of land. In April, it forfeited $5.6 million in deposits on property near West Palm Beach, Fla., and Minneapolis, because it was not ready to build in the area.
 ''It doesn't make sense to own the land and have it sit there,'' said J. Larry Sorsby, the company's chief financial officer and an executive vice president.
 Orders for Hovnanian's homes fell by 18 percent in the three months ended April 30 and cancellation of existing orders by homebuyers rose to 32 percent from 21 percent a year ago. The company, whose earnings jumped 34 percent to a record last year, is expecting a mere 3.4 percent profit increase this fiscal year.
 Mr. Sorsby said the company had not resorted to layoffs, but it had been asking sub-contractors to lower labor costs -- with some success.
 Going forward, many economists say, the biggest question is whether the orderly real-estate slowdown the Fed has engineered thus far will continue. ''Outside the threat of surging energy prices,'' Mr. Zandi said, ''the most significant threat to the expansion is that the housing correction turns into a housing crash.'' 
 The fact that mortgage rates remain low by historical standards offers one reason to doubt that a crash will happen. The average rate on a 30-year conventional mortgage was 6.8 percent last week, up from 5.7 percent a year earlier, according to the Fed.
 On the other hand, the boom of recent years has pushed housing prices out of reach for many families along the coasts. Already, some homeowners have resorted to creative loans, like interest-only mortgages, to afford a house, and even modest increases in mortgage rates have the potential to cause a significant drop in demand for new houses.
 In either case, housing seems unlikely to continue being the economic powerhouse it was over the last five years.
 ''Housing is just not going to be what it has been,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Oak Associates, a money management firm. ''It could go back to being a significant but relatively small contributor to economic growth.''

HEADLINE: Casualties of War: Lebanon's Trees, Air and Sea

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH; Nada Bakri contributed reporting from Beirut for this article.

DATELINE: JIYEH, Lebanon, July 28 

 BODY:
As Israel continues the bombing campaign that has turned parts of Lebanon into rubble, environmentalists are warning of widespread and lasting damage. 
 Spilled and burning oil, along with forest fires, toxic waste flows and growing garbage heaps have gone from nuisances to threats to people and wildlife, they say, marring a country traditionally known for its clean air and scenic greenery. Many of Lebanon's once pristine beaches and much of its coastline have been coated with a thick sludge that threatens marine life.
As smoke billowed overhead on Friday, turning day into dusk, Ali Saeed, a resident, recounted how war has changed this small industrial town about 15 miles south of Beirut. 
 Most people have left, he said. It is virtually impossible to drive on the roads, and almost everyone hides behind sealed windows.
 ''There's nowhere to run,'' Mr. Saeed said, showing off the black speckles on his skin that have turned everything white here into gray. ''It's dripping fuel from the sky.''
 A large oil spill and fire caused by Israeli bombing have sent an oil slick traveling up the coast of Lebanon to Syria, threatening to become the worst environmental disaster in the country's history and engulfing this town in smoke. 
 ''The escalating Israeli attacks on Lebanon did not only kill its civilians and destroy its infrastructure, but they are also annihilating its environment,'' warned Green Line, a Lebanese environmental group, in a statement issued Thursday. ''This is one of the worst environmental crises in Lebanese history.'' 
 The most significant damage has come from airstrikes on an oil storage depot at the edge of Jiyeh on July 13 and 15. Oil spewed into the Mediterranean Sea and a fire erupted that has been burning ever since. 
 Four of the plant's six oil storage containers have burned completely, spilling at least 10,000 tons of thick fuel oil into the sea initially, and possibly up to 15,000 more in the weeks since. A fifth tank burst into flames on Thursday, residents said, adding to a smoke cloud that has spewed soot and debris miles away. The fire is so hot that it has melted rail cars into blobs and turned the sand below into glass.
 Engineers are concerned that a sixth tank still untouched by the fire could soon explode, making the situation even graver.
 The prevailing winds and currents have swept the oil northward up the coast of Lebanon, and on Friday it reached the coast of Syria, Environment Ministry officials said. 
 ''You can't swim in the water anymore, it's all black,'' Mr. Saeed said. ''This is like the Exxon Valdez spill in America,'' he said, speaking of the environmental damage caused when a tanker ran aground and spilled about 40,000 tons of oil into Prince William Sound in Alaska in 1989.
 Lebanon's coast is an important nesting ground for the green sea turtle, an endangered species, as well as a spawning ground for some Mediterranean fish. Turtle eggs begin hatching in July, but with the oil slick coating most of the area, baby turtles will have a far smaller chance of making it to deeper waters and surviving, environmentalists say. The oil slick is also threatening bluefin tuna that migrate to the eastern Mediterranean this time of year. 
 The Environment Ministry sent crews to various parts of the country this week to assess the damage and begin the cleanup, a spokeswoman said. But the oil slick has quickly proven beyond the government's limited capacity to deal with the problem.
 The ministry estimates cleanup alone will cost upwards of $200 million, a major sum in a country with a gross domestic product of around $21 billion, but experts warn the bill could run even higher. 
 Jordan has offered to send experts to provide technical assistance, and Kuwait has pledged to send material and equipment to help clean up the spill. 
 Brush fires in many parts of the country have been an equally pressing concern as they rage unabated. Firefighters and forestry workers cannot move around for fear of being targets, and resources are being used to help refugees. 
 ''In Israel there are planes taking care of forest fires, but in Lebanon these fires are not being extinguished or even noticed because our priorities have shifted from the environment to relief and humanitarian work,'' said Mounir Abou Ghanem, director general of the Association for Forest Development and Conservation in Beirut. 
 Much of the budget for environmental protection and development has been sacrificed for relief work, he said. The oil spills, he said, will eventually be cleaned up and solid waste will be collected and disposed of when the war is over, but the forests are irreplaceable.
 ''In the end, who cares if a forest is on fire when there are people dying, others are being displaced and their houses or factories are on fire?'' he said. 
 Water pollution has become an issue, too, said Karim el-Jisr, senior associate at Ecodit, a nongovernmental environmental association. Wastewater and freshwater canals are very close together and the many bombs that have hit roads and other infrastructure have damaged them. As a result, Mr. Jisr said, wastewater is contaminating the freshwater supply, especially in rural areas, causing further environmental degradation. 
 But experts warn that the real environmental impact of the war will not be clear until the fighting ends.
 ''This war will affect the soil and the air,'' said Hala Ashour, the director of Green Line, the environmental group. ''But it's still too early to assess the actual damage because we have to analyze samples and that can't be done before the war is over.''
 In Jiyeh, Mr. Saeed and the few other remaining residents have begun learning to live with the pollution. Within the first few days of the oil fire, Mr. Saeed said, they wore masks to breathe; now, he said, they are used to it.
 Maher Ali, 24, a fisherman, said: ''When the winds blow north, it's bearable, but when it blows east, it's deadly. The soot lands on the food and furniture and makes everything dirty. You just can't leave a glass of water sitting around. It's no wonder most families have given up and left.''

HEADLINE: Slowdown Spurs a Rally in Treasuries

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks and Treasury bonds rallied yesterday as an abrupt slowdown in second-quarter growth in the United States gross domestic product bolstered views that the Federal Reserve might stop raising interest rates as early as August.
 But expectations that monetary policy tightening, which started two years ago, was probably close to ending drove the dollar down against major currencies and helped push gold up to a one-week high near $650 an ounce.
Oil fell more than a dollar a barrel in New York on profit-taking amid speculation of a possible cease-fire in the 17-day conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon. Oil prices were also depressed by the gross domestic product report showing a sharp slowdown in economic growth. 
 The price of oil stayed near $73 a barrel as President Bush said that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice would head back to the Middle East today for talks on a United Nations resolution to end the war.
 On Wall Street, the excitement centered on the Fed's next move.
 ''The irresistible conclusion is that they are going to pause in August,'' said Michael Woolfolk, currency strategist at the Bank of New York. ''That's good for the stock market, good for the bond market, but not too good for the dollar.'' 
 Fed fund futures were last pricing in a roughly 24 percent chance that the Fed would raise its benchmark funds rate by 25 basis points, to 5.5 percent, at its next meeting on Aug. 8, compared with 46 percent before the G.D.P. report.
 Stocks surged, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index posting its best weekly gain since November 2004. The Dow Jones industrial average's weekly rise was its best since May 2005.
 Shares of rate-sensitive financial services companies like Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America were among stocks giving the biggest lift to the S.& P. 500. Citigroup also led the Dow higher, along with American Express.
 ''There are still signs of inflation out there,'' said Marc Pado, market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in San Francisco, but the G.D.P. data ''was weak enough to convince people that the Fed will have to pause. That's what opened the door for the broad-based advance.''
 The Dow jumped 119.27 points, or 1.07 percent, to end at 11,219.70. The S.& P. 500 climbed 15.35 points, or 1.22 percent, to finish at 1,278.55. The Nasdaq gained 39.67 points, or 1.93 percent, to close at 2,094.14.
 For the week, the Dow rose 3.2 percent, the S.& P. 500 gained 3.1 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 3.7 percent. It was the best weekly percentage increase for the Nasdaq since early January.
 The data ignited a rally in the bond market, with the yields on the 2-year and the 10-year Treasury notes falling below 5 percent for the first time since mid-June.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note's yield fell to 4.99 percent, compared with 5.03 percent on Thursday. The 10-year note's price, which moves in the opposite direction of its yield, rose 11/32, to 101.
 The dollar slid on the increasing perception that the Fed may pause its credit-tightening campaign, which would reduce the currency's high-yield appeal to investors.
 The dollar fell against the yen, to 114.70 yen from 115.75 yen late Thursday. The euro rose to $1.2753 from $1.2694 the previous day in New York.
 ''I'd expect the dollar's weakness to continue next week, although nobody seems to expect any big breakout from the recent ranges for now, at least not until people have had a look at the jobs data,'' said Hugh Walsh, a currency trader at Fortis Financial Markets in New York.
 Benchmark gold for December delivery ended up $2.30 at $647.80 an ounce, after hitting $649.90, a one-week high.
 Crude for September delivery fell $1.30, or 1.7 percent, to settle at $73.24 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell as low as $72.80, the cheapest since July 20. Prices have fallen from a record of $78.40 hit on July 14.

HEADLINE: Shiite Leader Criticizes Plan for Stronger U.S. Role in Iraq's Security

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 28 

 BODY:
One of Iraq's most powerful Shiite leaders criticized the current security strategy on Friday and said that Iraq's forces, rather than those of the United States, should be in charge of stabilizing the country. 
 During a rally in the southern Shiite holy city of Najaf, Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, leader of the largest Shiite bloc, said that the worsening security situation was caused by ''carelessness'' and ''wrong policies.''
He called for ''handing over the security dossier to the Iraqi apparatus and stopping the interference in its work.'' 
 Mr. Hakim, who leads the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, has said that Iraqi forces should have more responsibility for the country's security. But his criticisms on Friday were particularly acute because they came only three days after President Bush and Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki announced an agreement to significantly strengthen the American military presence in the capital.
 Mr. Hakim's remarks also seemed intended to put pressure on Mr. Maliki, a fellow Shiite but a fierce political rival. 
 American and Iraqi leaders have struggled to break the cycle of sectarian bloodshed that has steadily worsened in recent months, particularly in Baghdad. Mr. Bush's announcement on Tuesday was a tacit acknowledgment that a new security strategy for Baghdad, initiated by Mr. Maliki last month, had failed.
 American officials have tried to shift much of Baghdad's policing to Iraqi forces. But while publicly praising the maturation of the Iraqi military and police, American officials have privately acknowledged that progress has been much slower than anticipated. 
 Much of the recent violence has been driven by sectarian death squads, some operating within Shiite-controlled security forces and Shiite militias tied to political parties. Mr. Maliki has pledged to disband the militias and clean the ranks of the police and the military of militia influence.
 Mr. Hakim has said in the past that he wanted established militias, including his own Iranian-trained Badr Organization, to have more authority in securing the country. But on Friday he appeared to back away from that stance, saying he supported Mr. Maliki's vow to disband them.
 The American military command, seemingly eager to demonstrate success in its fight against insurgents, issued an unusually long statement on Friday describing what it called a ''daylong battle'' last Sunday in a town south of Baghdad. The statement said American and Iraqi forces killed 33 ''terrorists'' in the firefight.
 According to the statement, the clash began when gunmen attacked an Iraqi police post in Musayyib and seized police vehicles and weapons. American troops responded and came under fire from around a small mosque, including by rocket-propelled grenades fired from inside the mosque, the statement said. 
 An American AH-64 Apache helicopter blew up a fuel truck that American officers believed was carrying explosives, the statement said, and an Abrams tank destroyed a building being used as a bunker by at least six gunmen. American and Iraqi troops traded small-arms fire with the insurgents for several hours, the military reported.
 Lt. Col. Patrick Donahoe, commander of the First Battalion, 67th Armor, described the insurgent attack as ''coordinated, sustained and complex.'' 
 In scattered violence on Friday, a mortar shell exploded near a Sunni Arab mosque on the southern outskirts of Baghdad, killing at least four people and wounding six, government officials said. The attack occurred despite a four-hour driving ban intended to curb violence in the city. Mortar crews often use vehicles for easy escape. 
 The attack was among several that concentrated on civilians and security forces, though violence appeared to be sharply lower than on most other days this month. 
 Four marines were killed in Anbar Province on Thursday in two separate attacks, according to the American military command. One of the marines was assigned to Regimental Combat Team 5, and the other three were with the First Brigade, First Armored Division.
 The bodies of three Sunni Arab men who disappeared several days ago were found in a boat on Friday, each with a bullet in the head, according to a police official in Baquba, north of Baghdad. 
 The bodies of five men kidnapped Thursday in Baquba were found Friday on a farm in that city, according to the police official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for attribution. 
 The United Nations and the Iraqi government formally began a campaign on Friday to attract more countries and international organizations to help rebuild Iraq. 
 The campaign, the International Compact With Iraq, aims to draw a coalition of countries to help develop economic, political and security reforms that will, in five years, establish Iraq as a ''united, federal and democratic country'' that is ''well on its way to sustainable economic self-sufficiency and prosperity,'' according to a statement issued by the Iraqi government and the United Nations.

HEADLINE: Corzine Offers His Ideas About Fixing New Jersey 

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 28 

 BODY:
Stating bluntly that ''if we were a business, we'd be bankrupt,'' Gov. Jon S. Corzine on Friday offered New Jersey legislators a blueprint of changes intended to improve the state's fiscal habits, and challenged them to come up with a permanent solution to reduce property taxes.
 In an unusual summer session of the entire State Legislature, Mr. Corzine urged lawmakers to encourage local governments to share services more often and to cap annual increases in property taxes, which have averaged 6.5 percent for the last 20 years, at 4 percent annually.
And he encouraged the 120 legislators to revamp the public employee pension system, perhaps by raising the current retirement age of 55 for new workers. He also suggested requiring employees to pay for part of their health insurance, as most private businesses do. 
 Mr. Corzine, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, also suggested that selling or leasing some of the state's assets -- like the New Jersey Turnpike or the lottery -- could help raise billions of dollars and reduce the state's $33.1 billion debt.
 ''Everything must be on the table -- sacred cows, third rails, 800-pound gorillas -- all the issues that government for too long has been unwilling to address,'' he said.
 The 30-minute speech, which got high marks from Democrats and Republicans alike, was interrupted by applause nine times. That was nine more times than a speech he gave on July 4 during the bitter government shutdown because of an impasse over the state budget.
 Lawmakers needed no reminder of why they were gathered in the State House on the last Friday in July. New Jersey has the highest property taxes in the nation, with an average annual bill of $5,826 per property, or double the national figure. So it was with much anticipation that Mr. Corzine, at the request of the state's top two lawmakers, Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr. and Senate President Richard J. Codey, offered his own diagnosis and recommendations.
 With its emphasis on taxes, spending and state's overall fiscal well-being, the address had the tone and urgency of a budget address. By invoking such business terms as economies of scale, metrics and monetization, Mr. Corzine came across rather like a management consultant telling a company about the need to downsize and streamline operations to become profitable.
 Laying down a challenge to the Democratic-controlled Legislature, Mr. Corzine, also a Democrat, gave them a Jan. 1 deadline to ''achieve sustainable relief and reform.'' If that deadline is not met, he vowed to support a ballot measure for a constitutional convention allowing New Jersey voters to come up with their own reforms in November 2007 -- the same year that all the seats in the Legislature are up for grabs.
 But in a news conference shortly after Mr. Corzine's address, Mr. Roberts praised the governor -- with whom he had battled over the recent budget -- for delivering a ''very powerful'' and ''ambitious'' speech. 
 He also said that he would work with the Assembly minority leader, Alex DeCroce, and announce on Monday the members of four committees -- made up of four Democrats and two Republicans each -- to tackle school financing, pensions, consolidating government services and constitutional changes.
 In a contrast to the cold reception that some legislators gave Mr. Corzine when he proposed raising the sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent in his budget address in March, most legislators said the speech was comprehensive and did not shy away from thorny topics.
 ''He didn't sugarcoat the situation,'' Mr. Codey said. ''There will be turf battles, and some feathers will be ruffled. But it's incumbent upon us to put these differences aside in the end to put the public first.''
 Some Republicans offered similar kudos, but cautioned that a good start did not necessarily presage a good finish.
 ''The verb was good,'' said Assemblyman Guy R. Gregg from Sussex County. ''We got to get to the object.''
 Other Republicans said that Mr. Corzine had borrowed liberally from Republican ideas. Assemblyman Joseph R. Malone, from Burlington County, even pulled out a faxed copy of his ''15 Point Plan for State Renewal'' that he said was ''scarily close'' to Mr. Corzine's proposal.
 ''I am impressed,'' Mr. Malone said. ''I think he fundamentally wants to shake up government from the foundation up.''
 Senator Leonard Lance, a Republican from Hunterdon County and the minority leader, said that Mr. Corzine had echoed earlier Republican calls for a new formula for financing schools. He also said he was pleased that Mr. Corzine had apparently abandoned an idea that had circulated in recent days: using $600 million in new revenues from the increase in the sales tax to borrow $7 billion. 
 About the only interest group that seemed generally unhappy with Mr. Corzine's message was one of his strongest allies: labor.
 Dudley Burdge, legislative political coordinator for Communications Workers of America Local 1032, which represents some state workers, questioned some of Mr. Corzine's claims about the state's bleak fiscal picture. In particular, he said that Mr. Corzine's contention that the cost of health care benefits for state employees would increase by more than 70 percent over the next four years was inflated, and that the figure was closer to 30 percent.
 As for the prospect of leasing or selling the New Jersey Turnpike or other state assets, Mr. Burdge said, ''I think it's troubling.'' 
 And while Mr. Corzine said in his speech that collective bargaining with state unions would begin in September, Mr. Burdge said: ''It takes two to tango. I didn't hear any great incentives to rush into negotiations. You go to the boss to ask for a raise, not for a benefit cut.''
 In his speech, Mr. Corzine acknowledged that previous governors have tried, with little success, to reduce property taxes. But he urged legislators: ''Let me tell you -- action, action, action -- now, before the end of the year. Our citizens demand it, they deserve it and we need to produce action.''
 One lesson that Mr. Corzine learned after the bruising budget battle was to reach out earlier to legislators. On Friday, he did just that, inviting all of them to the governor's mansion for a reception after the speech.
 As Republicans said, he also tried to be as nonpartisan as possible, and was successful in explaining why New Jersey had gotten to this crucial stage. At one point, he noted that while property taxes provide 46 percent of all tax revenue in the state, it provides only 30 percent nationally.
 ''Frankly,'' he said in one of several lines that elicited laughter, ''I've never in my life wanted so much to be average.''


GRAPHIC: Chart: ''The Proposals''Gov. Jon S. Corzine's proposals for changing New Jersey's property tax system:TAX CREDITS -- Appropriate $350 million from the sales tax increase adopted this year for a $1.6 billion property tax credit program aimed primarily at residents 65 or older and middle-income families.CONSOLIDATING GOVERNMENT -- Put aside $250 million from the sales tax increase to offer local governments incentives to consolidate and share services.PENSION REFORM -- Revamp the public employee pension system by raising the current retirement age of 55 for new workers, requiring employee co-payments for health insurance and creating a new benefits system.PRIVATIZATION OF ASSETS -- Sell or lease assets like the New Jersey Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Lottery and sell naming, development and air rights.CAPS ON TAX INCREASES -- Cap annual increases in property tax bills at 4 percent.SCHOOL FINANCING -- Recalculate the state's school financing formula to smooth out disparities between urban, suburban and rural districts.

HEADLINE: Follow Your Bliss, Yes, but Maybe Not Into a Stock Fund

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
IF you want a broad stock portfolio in a single mutual fund, you might buy a plain-vanilla Standard & Poor's 500 index fund. But if you'd like something quirkier, with more horsepower and much more torque, you might prefer the StockCar Stocks Index fund. 
 It is the perfect portfolio for Nascar race fans, said Robert T. Carter, the fund's manager. ''That would be the logical target market,'' he said. ''Many Nascar fans have significant assets. This may be a complement to their existing asset management philosophy.''
What's more, he said, ''it could also work for a lot of individuals as their only investment.'' That might be a stretch if you don't hear music in the roar of a car engine, but the fund is broader than its name suggests. 
 Its core holdings include the two publicly traded car race track owners, Speedway Motorsports, which is based in Concord, N.C., and International Speedway, based in Daytona Beach, Fla. But two stocks wouldn't be enough to constitute an entire mutual fund, not even an eccentric one. 
 So Mr. Carter rounds out the portfolio with official Nascar sponsors and suppliers. General Electric -- the conglomerate based in Fairfield, Conn. -- qualifies because it owns NBC, which broadcasts Nascar races. Home Depot, the home improvement chain based in Atlanta, and Kellogg, the cereal maker based in Battle Creek, Mich., are in the fund because they are Nascar sponsors.
 No one can say precisely how many more cornflakes are served in American kitchens each morning because there's a picture of a race car on the box. But the Nascar connection constitutes the entire strategy of this mutual fund. Mr. Carter said he did not evaluate the stocks but acted like the passive manager of an index fund, strictly eliminating companies that end their race-car sponsorships and adding companies that take them on. 
 The fund, which has less than $6 million in assets, has had average annual returns of 4.3 percent over the five years through Thursday, about 1.6 percentage points higher than the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. It has lagged the S.& P. by 1.7 percentage points this year.
 Roy Weitz, the publisher of FundAlarm.com, said he was not surprised that it had outperformed the S.& P. index over long stretches. ''The idea that these stocks should be arranged in a portfolio because they support Nascar is sort of an absurd concept, but it appears to be working,'' he said. ''But that doesn't validate the idea of the gimmick or niche funds.
 ''There's always going to be some outliers that outperform the market, and that's what keeps them going. That's why people keep going to Vegas. In the end, the house always wins, but once in a while someone hits big.''
 Nascar fans have certainly been loyal -- both to their sport and to their fund, which Mr. Carter has managed since its inception in 1998. A themed fund aimed at golfing enthusiasts folded in less than a year. The short-lived Golf Associated fund returned about 3 percent from January to December of 1999. It held Callaway Golf, a golf club and golf ball maker based in Carlsbad, Calif. But the manager had to search past the 18th hole for investments. According to a fund report from 1999, 70 percent of the portfolio consisted of golfing-related stocks, and the rest of other stocks.
 Mutual funds like these are similar to affinity credit cards, said Russel Kinnel, Morningstar's head of mutual fund research. But even if the first three letters of the word ''fund'' spell ''fun,'' Mr. Kinnel said he did not think it made sense to invest that way.
 Rather than purchasing shares of the golf fund, Mr. Kinnel suggested investors might have been happier buying a good diversified fund and putting the money saved on expenses into a new set of golf clubs, or a round of golf at Pebble Beach. 
 ''I think you'll enjoy that a lot more than getting an annual investor report with a picture of a golf club,'' he said. The fund industry has had a trendy element practically from the start. There was at least one television stock fund in the 1950's, and an oceanographic fund in the 1960's. While there's no denying television's influence, the premise behind the Steadman Oceanographic fund was a bit more obscure. 
 ''I think the idea was that we were going to live in the sea, and farm under the sea,'' Mr. Kinnel said.
 Often these novelty funds were inspired by current events. For example, Kinetics Mutual Funds -- which started the first Internet fund in 1996 -- created the Middle East Growth fund in 2000. The idea was to cash in on the economic boom that would result from peace in the Middle East.
 Kinetics liquidated that fund in December 2001, after slightly less than two years. Anyone who had invested from the start would have lost more than 38 percent.
 But even when the fund industry has been right about a trend, the narrowly sliced funds that it has inspired have not always been sure bets. The dizzy rollout of Internet funds in 1999 is a case in point. The Amerindo B2B fund was liquidated in 2003, after less than three years. Investors who were in from the start would have lost 65 percent. The Westcott Technology Nothing but Net fund was liquidated in 2002. After less than three years, the fund had lost more than 85 percent. 
 Meanwhile, stocks of Internet giants like Google and Yahoo are now part of basic stock index funds. The fund industry is giving investors a chance to place bets on other trends -- on nanotech, genomics and water. On Dec. 6, for example, PowerShares Capital Management, an exchange-traded fund company based in Wheaton, Ill., started the PowerShares Water Resources Portfolio. 
 ''We had recently filed or introduced E.T.F.'s along many of the different natural resources categories, including oil and gas, and we began to look at water as one of these natural resources that investors didn't have good access to,'' said Bruce Bond, president of PowerShares.
 Of course, barrels of water are not traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, so the fund holds a basket of stocks, mostly of American water utilities. 
 Mr. Bond called water ''a vital commodity,'' which undoubtedly it is. ''Historically, water hasn't been as volatile as oil,'' Mr. Bond said, but he predicted that in the future, ''water has the potential to be a very good investment for people.''
 APPARENTLY many investors agree. Since it began trading, the exchange-traded fund has garnered $1 billion in assets. The shares closed at $16.23 on Friday, not very far from their first-day opening price of $15.24. But it has been a wild ride. The fund is down about 16 percent from its peak in early May.
 The fund is not the only one ever to focus on water. Pictet & Compagnie, a Swiss financial services company, liquidated the Pictet Global Water fund in 2003. Any investors who had purchased shares when the fund began trading less than two years earlier would have lost 10.6 percent.
 PowerShares does not limit itself to commodities. Other additions to its lineup last year included the PowerShares Dynamic Biotechnology & Genome Portfolio and the Lux Nanotech Portfolio.
 Investors already had another option if they were convinced that genomics would outperform broader health sector funds. The Genomics Fund was created in 2000, during the first burst of enthusiasm after scientists finished sequencing the human genome. 
 Money rolled into the fund that year, with assets peaking at more than $35 million after just six months. Its assets have steadily dwindled ever since, and now hover around $5 million, according to AMG Data Services.
 The Genomics Fund, which closed at $2.97 on Thursday, has lost more than 8 percent a year on average over the last five years; although it has risen about 70 percent since Satuit Capital Management, which is based in Richmond, Va., started managing it in January 2003. 
 The fund has an annual expense ratio of 1.9 percent, while the average expense ratio for actively managed domestic stock funds is 1.5 percent.
 Robert J. Sullivan of Satuit said that when he took over the portfolio he was ''resolved to look at more than just this straight science stuff. It's more than Genentech.'' He said there were many ways to play genomics -- including investments in companies that make lab coats and test tubes -- while still keeping the fund's genomics flavor.
 In other words, in the future, this fund could look a lot more like a health sector fund.

CONSERVATIVES WITHOUT CONSCIENCE
 By John W. Dean.
 246 pp. Viking. $25.95.
Enroute to getting shellacked by historic proportions in the 1964 presidential race, the Republican challenger, Senator Barry Goldwater, suffered through a smear job every bit as oversize and ugly as Lyndon B. Johnson's gallbladder scar. Not the infamous ''daisy ad'' circulated by the Johnson campaign, in which a young girl innocently pulled the petals from a flower until a mushroom cloud filled the frame. While setting a new standard for negative campaigning, that TV commercial was at least rooted in Goldwater's loose talk about using ''low yield'' atomic bombs in the escalating Vietnam War.
 The truly low blow came in the pages of Fact magazine, which claimed to have asked some 12,000 psychiatrists whether Goldwater was ''psychologically fit to serve as president of the United States.'' Among the more than 1,800 replies were long-distance diagnoses pronouncing the challenger a ''dangerous lunatic'' and a ''compensated schizophrenic'' similar to Hitler and Stalin. The year after the election, Goldwater sued in federal court for defamation of character and won $75,000 in punitive damages. 
 The ghost of Barry Goldwater hovers over ''Conservatives Without Conscience,'' the new study of ''authoritarian'' Republicans by the Watergate-era White House counsel John W. Dean. The book, whose title is a play on the senator's 1960 polemic, ''The Conscience of a Conservative,'' was conceived as a collaboration between Goldwater and the Nixon administration's most famous heretic. Dean shared the senator's dislike of the ''so-called social conservatives'' who have risen to prominence within Republican ranks over the past several decades, and the pair planned a book for which they would talk ''with people like Chuck Colson, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell'' and ''attempt to understand their strident and intolerant politics.''
 The project was cut short by Goldwater's death in 1998, but Dean remained dedicated to unmasking what he sees as the new and dangerous breed of ''tough, coldblooded, ruthless authoritarians'' who have ''co-opted'' conservatism. For Dean, who sounded similar notes in ''Worse Than Watergate: The Secret Presidency of George W. Bush'' (2004), the president, Vice President Dick Cheney, the disgraced former House majority leader Tom DeLay, the cashiered speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, the felonious lobbyist Jack Abramoff and many others are not simply misguided or repugnant ideologues, relentlessly pushing an agenda at odds with Dean's own (he variously describes himself as a centrist, a registered independent and ''a 'Goldwater conservative' on many issues''); they are also rainmakers uniquely deranged by their lust for power, their limited ability ''to see the world from any point of view other than their own'' and their willingness to submit to authority.
 The book draws heavily on the work of the social psychologist Bob Altemeyer, the creator of a scale for measuring ''right-wing authoritarian'' (R.W.A.) tendencies. Dean writes that Altemeyer is ''not given to hyperbole in his scholarly work,'' yet quotes him as saying that many ''High R.W.A.'s'' would ''attack France, Massachusetts or the moon if the president said it was necessary 'for freedom.' '' Altemeyer says it's ''a scientifically established fact'' that political, religious and economic conservatives are High R.W.A.'s, and Dean concludes that our government ''is run by an array of authoritarian personalities'' who are ''dominating, opposed to equality, desirous of personal power, amoral, intimidating . . . vengeful, pitiless, exploitive, manipulative, dishonest, cheaters, prejudiced, meanspirited, militant, nationalistic and two-faced.'' The estimated 20 to 25 percent of High R.W.A.'s among us, he warns, ''will take American democracy where no freedom-loving person would want it to go.''
 With Ahab-like monomania, Dean discovers that every objectionable conservative Republican action -- from ''taking America to war in Iraq on false pretenses'' to Dick Cheney's obscene outburst at Senator Patrick Leahy to harsh right-wing criticism of the nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court -- reflects triumphant authoritarianism. For those of us with little or nothing good to say about the Bush administration, the Republican Party or conservatives in general, Dean's book is ideological comfort food, providing not only tasty anecdotes about abuse of power but a rationale for dismissing political opponents out of hand. Did you know, for instance, that Senator Bill Frist has confessed to dishonestly procuring cats for experiments during his medical school days, writing in his autobiography, ''I was totally schizoid about the entire matter''?
 But ''Conservatives Without Conscience'' does little to advance a true understanding of contemporary politics, conservative or otherwise. Dean's schema doesn't go far in explaining, for example, the huge increases in non-defense discretionary and entitlement spending under President Bush and a conservative Congress. Alas, even the distortions and exaggerations used to build the case for war in Iraq are hardly unprecedented. (Remember the Maine? And the Gulf of Tonkin?) What Dean sees as dark new developments read far more like politics -- and politicians -- as usual.
 Just as important, Dean's book calls to mind nothing so much as the scurrilous treatment of Barry Goldwater back in the 1964 campaign. Yeah, yeah, politics ain't beanbag and all that. But our political discourse is rancorous enough without attempting to psychologize our adversaries out of decent debate. When Ronald Reagan nominated Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court, the Rev. Jerry Falwell said every good Christian should oppose her selection. Goldwater, rising to the defense of a fellow Arizonan, responded that ''every good Christian ought to kick Falwell's ass.'' If the politician nicknamed Mr. Conservative -- to whom Dean's book is dedicated -- were to revisit today's political scene, he might find another target at which to swing his leg.

THE BOURGEOIS VIRTUES
 Ethics for an Age of Commerce.
 By Deirdre N. McCloskey. 
 616 pp. University of Chicago Press. $32.50.
The heft, the air and the title of this book all promise a big thesis. But what the devil could that thesis be? At no point during my reading of the 500-plus pages -- an experience by turns piquant, maddening, edifying and wearying -- was I altogether sure. Sometimes the author appeared to be arguing that capitalism makes us virtuous. Sometimes she seemed to be saying that virtue is the most important ethical idea we have. And sometimes she more or less announced that Love Is Bigger Than Economics. Each of these is a potentially interesting claim. But where, amid the luxurious orgy of quotations, epigrams, pop-cultural and poetic allusions, charts, lists, etymologies, asseverations, innuendoes, zingers and brickbats, was the meticulous reasoning that might establish their truth? 
 Perhaps, though, such a complaint misses the point. Deirdre McCloskey is a maverick, and in more ways than one. A classically trained economist -- Harvard Ph.D., junior appointment to the star-studded University of Chicago economics department, resume packed with rigorous quantitative research -- McCloskey broke ranks in 1985 with ''The Rhetoric of Economics,'' which mocked the pretensions of economists to scientific objectivity. What the profession needed was less highfalutin mathematics and more emphasis on persuasion, stories, rhetoric: so she argued. Or he, I should say. For, at the time, Deirdre was still a man named Donald. In 1995 McCloskey broke ranks again by choosing to undergo a sex-change operation, the central event in her memoir, ''Crossing'' (1999). Currently a distinguished professor of economics, history, English and communication at the University of Illinois, Chicago, McCloskey is that rarest of things, a transexual, new-Christian, postmodern, minimal-government conservative. She is also, by her own avowal, ''a tough urban girl who can take it as well as dish it out.'' 
 And dish it out she does. Foremost among the many, many recipients of McCloskey's abuse are those who (she thinks) misunderstand the nature of morality. How do we determine what is right and wrong? Modern moral philosophers have offered two sorts of answer. One focuses on consequences: according to the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham, for instance, the right action is the one that results in the greatest happiness for the greatest number. The other focuses on the acts themselves: for Immanuel Kant, the right action is the one that conforms to a certain idea of duty, regardless of consequences. (Thus, by Kant's lights, it is always wrong to kill an innocent person on purpose, even to save the world.) McCloskey will have neither of these; each, she thinks, wants to reduce ethics to ''a quick little formula, the pocket-sized card.''
 In the last few decades, however, an alternative to utilitarian and Kantian ethics has emerged, one that harks back to the ancient philosophers. It centers neither on acts nor on their consequences, but on character. According to ''virtue ethics,'' morality cannot be captured in a universal code; the right thing to do in a particular situation is what a virtuous person would do. And how do we identify a virtuous person? Aristotle defined virtue as a quality of character that makes for a life well lived. Then he characterized the good life as a life lived in accordance with virtue. Circular? Today's virtue ethicists obviously don't think so, but they have nevertheless struggled to come up with an account of human nature that would give some definite content to the idea of virtue.
 McCloskey likes virtue ethics for two reasons. First, it elevates stories over abstract rules. The guide to action becomes ''What would X do?'' where X is to be filled in by one's moral exemplar of choice, who might be drawn from the Bible, say, or from a Jane Austen novel. Second, virtue ethics lends a womanly touch to moral theory, which has long been a ''guy thing,'' with masculine notions like justice and autonomy shutting out feminine notions like caring and love. Many of the movers behind virtue ethics, she notes with satisfaction, have been women, like Elizabeth Anscombe, Iris Murdoch and Martha Nussbaum. (On the other hand, some pretty important male philosophers -- Alasdair MacIntyre, Bernard Williams, John McDowell -- have also played a role. One man that McCloskey decidedly does not want on her team is William J. Bennett, who, she observes with some severity, pumped his royalties from ''The Book of Virtues'' into slot machines.)
 In taking the question ''What sort of person ought I to be?'' as fundamental, virtue ethics entails a richer moral psychology than its rivals. Yet it is not very useful in resolving ethical dilemmas. Should I betray my friend or my country? Utilitarianism at least yields an answer (friend). Virtue ethics tells me to do what a virtuous person would do in the circumstances -- scant guidance for anyone who lacks the virtuous person's built-in ethical know-how. And the egoistic emphasis on cultivating one's virtue can easily lead to a preening moral vanity, not to say self-infatuation. How much more likable the Kantian ideal of doing the irksome thing simply because it's your duty, damn it.
 McCloskey does not trouble to rebut such criticisms. Instead, she submerges them in a flood-tide of contrary quotations from other thinkers. (She has read the library, and won't let you forget it.) Her real interest is in applying virtue ethics to capitalism, and to capitalism's distinctive product, the bourgeoisie. In ''The Rhetoric of Economics,'' McCloskey mocked bourgeois man as a ludicrous character, ''at once master and servant, inclined therefore to hypocrisy and doubletalk, 'umble and yet pompous.'' But she appears to have had a change of heart. McCloskey now sees the bourgeoisie as a noble class, the chief repository of the virtues instilled by commercial life.
 And what are these ''bourgeois virtues''? Thrift? Punctuality? Respectability? Cleanliness? McCloskey has nothing so dismal in mind. Rather, she is talking about the four classical pagan virtues -- courage, justice, temperance and prudence -- plus the three Christian virtues of faith, hope and love. Especially love. Here is something her fellow economists are incapable of capturing in their arid quotations. ''Modern capitalist life is love-saturated,'' she declares, as ''markets and even the much maligned corporations encourage friendships wider and deeper than the atomism of a full-blown socialist regime or the claustrophobic, murderous atmosphere of a 'traditional' village.'' We already knew that markets make us rich. But McCloskey wants to convince us that markets are also good for the soul.
 Here is where things ought to get interesting. Even fans of capitalism concede that it can have a corrosive effect on morals and community ties. Critics have argued that it fosters consumerism, greed, narcissism, Gesellschaft over Gemeinschaft, anomie, Enron. . . . The bourgeois is a beastly little creature -- so say the German Romantics, D. H. Lawrence and, in a rather drier way, Francis Fukuyama. How might these people be proved wrong? The pro-bourgeois case would start with the historical observation that liberal values like tolerance and freedom have been a product of commercial life. It would proceed with the careful marshaling of evidence that capitalism can be ethically beneficient -- that, for example, markets generate trust. And who better to construct such a case than a polymath econometric virtuosa like McCloskey?
 But instead we get rhetoric. There is polemical hand-waving (''Who says?''; ''I think not''; and, most logically decisive, ''Point, schmoit''). There is sophomoric sarcasm: Stephen Weinberg, a Nobel laureate in physics, is mocked for his reasoned stand against religion, and the French philosopher Andre Comte-Sponville is dismissed with stale jokes about Gauloises and Jerry Lewis. Anecdotes masquerade as data: the evidence against the Marxist thesis that work is alienating under capitalism is the author's perception that Chicago garbagemen seem to enjoy emptying trash bins. McCloskey is contemptuous of scientists like Steven Pinker for trying to explain the origins of virtue along Darwinian lines; yet her dogmatic counterclaim -- ''Every human is born in sin, and must seek redemption'' -- doesn't greatly advance the argument.
 And how strong, really, is the correlation between bourgeois virtue and laissez-faire capitalism? Like her friend Milton Friedman, McCloskey would like to see the role of the state much reduced. She says she dreams of ''literally one-third to one-fifth of the government we now have.'' Yet a social democracy like Sweden, where the state plays a far greater role in society, would seem to be the very soul of bourgeois virtue by many objective standards, with less violence and more solidarity and trust than the United States.
 McCloskey probably won't sway many readers who do not already share her convictions, but for all the book's flaws one can't help being impressed by her verve, erudition and fitful brilliance. When she argues that Vincent van Gogh was actually a good bourgeois, or that Jesus, notwithstanding the Sermon on the Mount, was pro-commerce, the rhetorical moves are as deft as the claims are surprising. And who would have imagined that the film ''Groundhog Day,'' in which the annoyingly smug Bill Murray character comes to see the point of humility and love, epitomizes the process by which virtue is inculcated? But it is a little dispiriting to hear McCloskey announce that this book is merely the first of four (!) projected volumes by her on the subject of virtue and capitalism. Somewhere within this loose, baggy monster there has to be a slim, cogently argued treatise struggling to get out.

HEADLINE: Atomic Balm?

I was impressed with Jon Gertner's article (July 16). I recently retired from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. During my 25 years there, I worked as a nuclear-power-plant inspector at many sites in the United States, including two years as a resident inspector at the now defunct Shoreham nuclear-power plant. At Shoreham, I witnessed firsthand how political considerations and public opposition by a vocal minority led to the decision to abandon an otherwise technically sound and safe source of electrical power. So it was a refreshing change to see a comprehensive, well-balanced and technically accurate discussion of the issues associated with nuclear power.

Charles D. Petrone 
 Rockville Centre, N.Y.

If nuclear power ''makes economic sense,'' so did coal and oil -- until we began to face the catastrophic cost of global warming. Nuclear power may make economic sense to economists, who don't count the cost of accident, waste and weapons proliferation. If so, why not repeal the recently renewed Price-Anderson Act, which shields the nuclear industry from full liability?

 BODY:
I.
 When Hamas and then Hezbollah kidnapped Israeli soldiers a few weeks ago, the Israeli government could have held its fire and avoided a major confrontation in which dozens of Israelis -- and many more Palestinians and Lebanese -- have died. There might have been a strategic rationale for such a policy, since starving kidnappers of attention may be the best way to deter them. But Israel's leaders could not consider this option: they are responsible to an electorate that will tolerate war deaths but will not tolerate the neglect of kidnapped soldiers.
In the past, Israel was the only democracy in the region, and its enemies, whether autocratic states or free-floating terrorist groups, were not similarly accountable to a voting public. This time, however, things are different. With the Iraq war, the United States introduced to the Middle East a bold new policy of democratization by destabilization. That policy encouraged elections in Lebanon and Palestine, opening the door to entities like Hezbollah and Hamas that are now experimenting with a potent cocktail of electoral politics, radical Islamist ideology and violence. Destabilizing the old order really has changed the rules of the game. We are now witnessing the most serious regional test so far to the wisdom of starting down this uncertain path. 
 The most important new feature of the present situation is the strange hybrid character shared by Hamas and Hezbollah: both are simultaneously militias and democratically elected political parties participating in government. In the case of Hamas, which won the Palestinian elections in January, the political wing may not be able to control the military wing, yet the party maintains a basic unity of purpose. Hezbollah, for its part, does not hold a majority in the Lebanese Parliament, but its elected leaders participate in the Lebanese government, whose democratic credentials have been cited by the Bush administration as a sign of progress in that troubled country.
 The dual political and military structures of Hamas and Hezbollah are not unique. In Iraq, both the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (Sciri) and Moktada al-Sadr's movement play major roles in the elected government while maintaining counterpart militias that they have been unwilling to disband. The model of Islamist organizations that combine electoral politics with paramilitary tactics is fast becoming the calling card of the new wave of Arab democratization.
 The fact that Hamas and Hezbollah pursue democratic legitimacy within the state while also employing violence on their own marks a watershed in Middle Eastern politics. For one thing, the boundary between state and nonstate violence has essentially been erased. Has the Palestinian government demanded an exchange of prisoners with Israel, or has the Hamas militia? Israel has been acting as if it were at war with Lebanon -- its targets have included a Lebanese Air Force base and Beirut's international airport -- but Hezbollah began the hostilities, not the Lebanese government.
 More important still, the fact that Hamas and Hezbollah owe much of their present standing to elections calls into question the viability of Middle Eastern democracy as a peaceful practice. In choosing these Islamists, Palestinians and Lebanese Shiites were in effect endorsing not only their political aims but also their commitment to violence, which was never hidden during their campaigns. (The same is true, to a lesser degree, of voters in Iraq who opted for the Shiite alliance.) It was possible that once in power, the politicians at the helm of Hamas and Hezbollah would distance themselves from violence or at least refrain from initiating it. That would have been a reasonable strategy if they wanted to persuade the voters that they could actually govern and use the resources of the state to improve their constituents' lives. We now know definitively that the leaders have rejected this path. 

II.
 How will the constituencies that support Hamas and Hezbollah react, over time, to kidnappings and rocket attacks that were calculated, it would seem, to provoke Israeli military reprisals? The elected Islamists are gambling that popular anger at Israel, apparent in the streets of Gaza and southern Lebanon in the first weeks of battle, will translate into redoubled enthusiasm for Islamist intransigence and rejectionism. This has sometimes worked for both Hamas and Hezbollah in the past. Both groups came to power in part because they were perceived as the only local actors willing to fight Israel head-on.
 For its part, Israel is gambling that the right strategy is to make the people who elected Hamas and a government that includes Hezbollah reckon the costs of their representatives' recklessness. That is why Israel has targeted not only Hezbollah leaders and strongholds but has also bombed infrastructure that sustains daily life for everybody in Lebanon. From Israel's standpoint, this is no longer a fight with nonstate terrorists who are holding their fellow citizens hostage to their tactics. It is, rather, war between Israel and countries that are pursuing (or tolerating) violent policies endorsed (or at least accepted) by their electorates.
 Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000 and from Gaza last year on the theory that disengagement would lead to fewer attacks on it, not more. Right-wing Israelis argued that withdrawal rewarded Islamist violence and that rockets would soon be fired into Israel from the very areas being vacated. Now those critics claim to have been vindicated. The reply of the centrist Israeli government -- elected on the promise that it would unilaterally withdraw from the West Bank too -- is to insist that in the long run Hamas and Hezbollah can be deterred like Israel's other Arab enemies. The route to deterrence, claims the government, is to degrade the capabilities of Hamas and Hezbollah and in the process inflict on Gaza and Lebanon the punishment of defeat in war -- the same approach that eventually led the major Arab powers to stop attacking Israel a generation ago.
 The catch for Israel is that, taken too far, the strategy of making all Palestinians and all Lebanese pay for the actions of Hamas and Hezbollah may well backfire. Destroying the economic prosperity that had begun to return to Lebanon is likely to generate fresh hatred of Israel, and Palestinians under the gun have in recent years tended to become more radicalized, not less. Provided that democratic institutions in Palestine and Lebanon remain intact, the long-term success of Israel's campaign will probably depend on how the Palestinian and Lebanese electorates evaluate all that has happened. They will be doing so against the backdrop of deeply conflicted feelings: Hamas and Hezbollah may have sparked this round of fighting, but the bombs raining down on their cities and the soldiers in their bases still come from Israel, and no one likes to be bombed.
 Democracy means that you cannot blame someone else for troubles caused by your own government. That is a comparatively new lesson in the region, and whether it is learned or not will determine the prospects for democracy itself there. But dodging missiles and running from tanks is not the ideal circumstance for rational reflection on the nature of self-rule. As in Iraq, what is especially risky and worrisome about democratization through destabilization is that it comes accompanied not by peace but by the sword. In this dangerous environment, the costs of democracy -- the weakness of government, the uncertainty, theviolence -- can be felt everywhere. The benefits of democracy, though, are barely palpable.

III.
 Although elections in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories owe much to America's democracy agenda, the Bush administration has, from the start, generally taken a hands-off approach to the region once known as the Levant. This is in part a function of limited capacity. Officials who have been focused since 9/11 on Afghanistan, and then on Iraq, cannot spare the time or attention to supervise the ins and outs of Israel's dealings with the Palestinians or with Lebanon. It also reflects the fact that the Bush administration -- mindful of President Clinton's ultimate failure at Camp David -- is wary of squandering its credibility on an ever-elusive peace deal. But it results, too, from a shift in perspective created by the Iraq-driven nature of the democratization policy itself. This has led the administration to see developments outside the Persian Gulf as democratic aftershocks of Saddam Hussein's removal -- and to believe it best to stand aside and let destabilization and the democratic spirit do their slow work.
 Lebanon, in particular, has been treated by the Bush administration as a success of democratization. In a sense it has been one. Mass demonstrations, largely free of violence (including several organized by Hezbollah), set the tone for domestic Lebanese politics in the wake of last year's assassination of Rafiq Hariri, the former prime minister. These protests would have been hard to imagine without the American commitment to democratization in Iraq. For once acting with European allies, the Bush administration was able to respond by pressuring Syria to reduce its involvement in the country. The only difficulty was that once elections were held, Hezbollah took on a substantial role in the governance of the country while retaining its close ties to Syria and Iran. Until this latest crisis, the American attitude toward this problem was to leave it alone.
 In Israel and the Palestinian territories, a hands-off strategy appeared to be working. Successful elections following the death of Yasir Arafat, coupled with the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, made it seem that the permissive approach was the right one. Until Hamas's election victory this January, it even seemed conceivable that democratization might eventually create a Palestinian government capable of saying yes to Israeli peace overtures and delivering Palestinian popular support for an eventual deal.
 The sudden explosion of Israel's fronts with Gaza and Lebanon represents a major challenge to the Bush administration's detachment. Leaders and political observers in the region instinctively expect the Bush administration to respond to the crisis the way earlier administrations dealt with previous crises -- namely, by becoming deeply involved and trying not merely to halt the violence temporarily but also to guide the parties toward a comprehensive solution. Among some in the region, you can almost sense a nostalgic yearning to become once again the center of attention for American foreign policy.
 How the United States responds to this latest crisis will therefore set an important historical precedent: has Iraq once and for all displaced Israel and its neighbors as the focal point of American interest and attention in the broader Middle East? Should the Bush administration limit its involvement to stanching the bloodshed in the short term and then disengage from serious negotiations, it would be a sign that we really have shifted the focus of our regional policy away from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- a shift that may last a quarter-century. (It could take at least that long for the United States to come to terms with its involvement in Iraq -- win, lose or draw.)
 Letting relations between Israel and its neighbors develop on their own, without our stage management, would suggest that the Bush administration is taking seriously its own argument that democratization is a messy, long-term business that must run its course, unimpeded. According to this claim, the regional destabilization that followed the Iraq invasion is just the cost of democracy. The new wave of violence is one storm center in that destabilized atmospheric system. If the strategy of democratization remains in place, other storms will form -- and they, too, will have to be weathered.

IV.
 Of course, even if President Bush did take on the task of negotiating something more than a stopgap to the bombing, American diplomats would face a more difficult challenge than their predecessors ever did. In the past, crises involving Israel were addressed by dealing with the regional Arab powers, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, all of which exerted influence of different kinds on the actors. Today, however, Iran has become the predominant external influence on Hezbollah, and perhaps even on Hamas. And American leverage over Iran, never very significant since the Iranian revolution, is today at its lowest ebb in years in the wake of the U.S. involvement in Iraq and the election of the populist anti-American Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
 The point is not that Iran necessarily gave a direct order to either Hamas or Hezbollah to initiate a new round of hostilities by kidnapping Israeli soldiers. No direct evidence of any such order has been made public, and the complex internal workings of Hamas -- which moved first -- are not particularly susceptible to such a chain of command. Rather, Iran clearly gains by the mess that has emerged, and both Hamas and Hezbollah know that serving Iranian interests is sure to result in continued, active support from Tehran.
 The main issue for Iran is, of course, the threat of American intervention against its growing nuclear capacity. Iran's primary foreign-policy goal is therefore to deter the United States through the threat of repercussions. One potential arena is Iraq, where U.S. troops can barely handle the Sunni-led insurgency and would face the danger of being overwhelmed if there were serious attacks on them from either Shiite militias financed by Iran or Iranian irregulars. But Iran has more tricks up its sleeve. The attacks on Israel not only harm America's closest regional ally, but, by generating an expanding circle of violence, also substantially destabilize the region. It is as if the Iranians were saying to the United States, ''You have your strategy of creative destabilization, and we have ours.''
 Iran's support for Hamas and Hezbollah is already being cited as evidence by those who want the United States to intervene directly against Iran. If their argument prevails, then Israel's little wars with Hamas and Hezbollah will turn out to have been a pair of proxy wars leading to the big one right around the corner. In Lebanon in the 1980's, Israel and Syria fought such a proxy war on behalf of the United States and the Soviet Union respectively. That it remained a proxy war is something for which we can be grateful.
 But the cold-war days of balanced powers are behind us now. Faced with the threat of terror, the remaining superpower chose to unleash at once the forces of freedom and instability. From Baghdad to Beirut, Gaza City, Haifa and beyond, the consequences are beginning to be realized. We are in the world of asymmetry, of democratically legitimated militias and armed bands that fight wars with powerful states. Democracy can no longer be seen as an end in itself, and the fate of peoples lies in their own hands.

THE FOREIGNER'S GIFT
 The Americans, the Arabs, 
 and the Iraqis in Iraq.
 By Fouad Ajami.
 378 pp. Free Press. $26.

THE END OF IRAQ
 How American Incompetence 
 Created a War Without End.
 By Peter W. Galbraith.
 260 pp. Simon & Schuster. $26.
Critics of American policy in Iraq since 2003 have sometimes charged that the United States created the sectarian divisions in the country by treating Iraqis as Shiites, Sunnis or Kurds, rather than simply as Iraqis. But the opposite has in fact been the case. Under the influence of exiles like Ahmad Chalabi, administration officials anachronistically insisted that Iraq was cosmopolitan and postethnic. The most serious intellectual deficit that has plagued the American presence in Iraq -- and a crucial reason for our repeated failure to predict Iraqis' behavior -- has been insufficient awareness of the conflicting perspectives of Iraqis from different backgrounds and communities. 
 Two new books set out to improve our understanding, each providing a window into particular aspects of the current situation in Iraq. Both authors are fascinating, indeed idiosyncratic figures, and each has played a role in the events of the last three years: Fouad Ajami, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, has been a regular White House visitor as an unofficial adviser to the Bush administration. Peter W. Galbraith, a former Senate staff member and ambassador to Croatia, has been a constitutional adviser and political counselor to the Kurdish leadership in Iraq. 
 Few other Americans have Ajami's distinctive qualifications for reflecting on the Iraq war. Born to a Shiite family in Lebanon, he has written several important books about Middle Eastern political culture, including a recognized classic on the Lebanese Shiites, ''The Vanished Imam.'' He supported the removal of Saddam Hussein, and his extraordinary level of access in Washington is reflected in ''The Foreigner's Gift,'' which recounts many conversations he had in Iraq while shadowing American officials or traveling with close American allies like Chalabi. Respected by politicians who disdain most academics, and excoriated by antiwar academics who detest the present government, Ajami richly deserves the attention of both camps. 
 His core argument is that the trouble we are seeing in Iraq results from the profound unwillingness of Sunni Arabs in Iraq and elsewhere to accept the rise to power of Shiites in what is, after all, their own country. Shiite Arabs have long been second-class citizens, repressed and kept from political power even where, as in Iraq, they are a numerical majority. ''For us -- rule; and for you -- wailing,'' runs the adage Ajami cites to capture Sunni attitudes to Shiites. Though he does not say so, the second clause has at least two meanings. The Shiites are meant to bemoan their subservient state; at the same time, they are being stereotyped on the basis of the annual rites of mourning and self-flagellation Shiites practice in memory of the 7th-century martyrdom of Imam Hussein.
 For Ajami, the foreigner's gift is, in the first instance, the removal of dictatorial rule and the opportunity for self-government. But Iraqi Sunnis have refused to accept their transformation from rulers of the country to a minority within a democracy. The local insurgency was born of this denial, and has been augmented and transformed by an infusion of support from elsewhere in the Sunni world. This support, according to Ajami, comes not just from the jihadis crossing borders but from the mainstream (Sunni) Arab news media, which have depicted the United States as an Israel-like occupier rather than as a force liberating Shiites from Sunni oppression and all Iraqis from Saddam Hussein's tyranny. 
 Meanwhile, Ajami suggests, Shiite leaders have begun fitfully to come to terms with what it means to exercise secular political power in the name of a group that is, after all, a religious denomination. He describes a meeting with Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani -- one of the first such accounts to appear in English -- and is impressed by the leader's light touch when it comes to politics. Ajami is sophisticated enough to realize he is present by virtue of Shiite birth, not American citizenship (in fact Sistani regularly refused to see non-Shiite Americans). In one of the most self-revealing passages of the book, he confides his discomfort at the possibility that he will be asked to perform prayers whose rituals he does not know. It is easy to feel sympathy for the cosmopolitan immigrant-expatriate in this moment, especially one whose very name, Ajami, means ''foreigner.'' Viewed as a credentialed native Arab informant by the Bush administration and as an American traitor by the Arab press, he is a proud Shiite. Yet face to face with the most beloved Shiite religious leader alive, he senses his own alienation from the very tradition that has gotten him in the door.
 Ajami's American sensibilities come through most powerfully in his discussions of the American soldiers he meets in Iraq, from generals like David Petraeus to anonymous enlisted men. Ajami honors and respects their dedication, their optimism and their genuine desire to improve Iraq, and he quotes whole pages from their e-mail messages. But his world-weary take on Sunni irredentism ultimately makes the Americans seem naive and out of place. As the violence increases and Iraqi deaths mount, the foreigner's gift assumes the terrible ironic meaning of destabilization and terror. Ajami maintains that it is too soon to know whether the war will be considered heroic or tragic, and so, formally at least, he does not despair of a positive outcome. But one is left wondering how someone so cynical about the dysfunctionality of Arab political patterns could have been so optimistic about the ''Baghdad spring'' in the first place.
 If Ajami is the self-made outsider from the Lebanese hinterland who has reached the corridors of power, Galbraith is an aristocrat of American foreign policy who has thrown in his lot with the stateless Kurdish people. A son of the economist John Kenneth Galbraith, presidential adviser and United States ambassador to India, he first encountered the Kurds during his long tenure as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff. Although his book is titled ''The End of Iraq: How American Incompetence Created a War Without End,'' nearly a third of it is devoted to the story of Hussein's oppression of the Kurds and Galbraith's efforts on their behalf before and during the Kurdish uprising that followed Operation Desert Storm. When President Clinton sent him to Croatia in 1993, he not only turned his attention away from Kurdistan but also became a second-generation ambassador.
 When that other hereditary member of the governing elite, George W. Bush, assumed the presidency, Galbraith, who had once disguised himself as a Kurd to avoid capture in 1991, reassumed the mantle of the Kurds' chief guide to the folkways of Washington. This time, though, he was a professor at the National War College. In Galbraith's telling, the Kurdish leadership made a tactical determination not to cross the American government on Iraq policy, but at the same time, maintained -- and still maintains -- a profound desire for total independence. The Kurds have been willing to participate at high levels in the Iraqi government, and even to ratify a constitution giving them de facto autonomy under the rubric of federalism. But to Galbraith, this position is temporary, convenient and a sham. ''Every Kurd I know,'' he says, ''wants an independent Kurdistan.''
 This perspective on Kurdish politics is extremely valuable, and in certain ways borne out by, for example, an unofficial referendum in which more than 90 percent of those casting ballots in Kurdistan expressed the desire for independence. (Galbraith claims credit for suggesting that the referendum be held on election day outside the official polls.) Galbraith is undoubtedly correct that most Kurds would prefer to be on their own, particularly in light of their history of being oppressed and killed by Iraqi (and other) governments. But it is much less clear that the Kurdish leadership is engaged in an elaborate subterfuge when its members participate in the government of federal Iraq. They have much to gain from a serious role in the national government, and their bargaining position is only strengthened by polls or votes showing that their constituents crave independence.
 By his own account, Galbraith's purpose in his book is to advocate a policy of American withdrawal from Iraq. That policy is simple: break the country into parts, beginning with an independent Kurdistan, possibly followed by the further breakup of the Arab parts of Iraq into Shiite and Sunni regions. This opinion needs to be taken very seriously, because through Galbraith's writings and foreign policy connections, it has entered the rhetoric of some in the Democratic Party, including the ranking minority member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Joseph R. Biden.
 The chief problem with the ''break Iraq in two'' option is that creating an independent Kurdistan does absolutely nothing to address the present violence in the country. It might be nice for the Kurds, especially if the United States gave them the Kirkuk oil field and then permanently stationed large numbers of troops in Kurdistan to protect it. But Kurdistan is mostly peaceful, and at present Kurds are not fighting Arabs in Iraq, except to some small degree around disputed Kirkuk itself. The violence in Iraq is predominantly Sunni-Shiite; and the United States desperately needs the stabilizing third force of the Kurds in the national leadership and the armed forces to have any hope at all of damping it down. To the contrary, breaking off Kurdistan would create a new violent front, because a Sunni ministate could never survive without a share of Kirkuk's oil, and so Sunni insurgents would have to turn their attentions to the Kurds. This is to say nothing of the continuing concerns of Turkey about an independent Kurdistan, or the possibility of Turkish encroachment having to be confronted by American forces. 
 AS for breaking up the rest of the country, Galbraith frankly concedes there is no good solution for Baghdad, with its mix of Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds, which includes perhaps a quarter of the whole population of the country. ''No good solution'' is code for massacres of the kind that have accompanied breakups from India-Pakistan in 1947 to Yugoslavia in the 1990's.
 So it is a bit mystifying to hear Galbraith say that he is promoting American interests in calling for an independent Kurdistan and a partitioned Iraq. There is a long tradition, stretching from Byron's love of Greece to T. E. Lawrence's Arab nationalism and Orde Wingate's Zionism, of foreigners bringing their considerable talents to advancing the independence of faraway peoples. Often such identified advocates take a harder nationalist line than the local leaders themselves, and often, like Lawrence and Wingate, they believe they are advancing the interests of their home country. But it is another matter for prominent Democrats to buy into Galbraith's claim that breaking up Iraq will make us or the Iraqis safer. The Kurds have as strong a claim to self-determination as anyone, but for now it should be up to their leaders, not someone else, to call for something more than the de facto autonomy they currently enjoy.

HEADLINE: No Buyers Here? Try the Riviera

BYLINE: By KEVIN BRASS; International Herald Tribune

 BODY:
WITH sales of luxury homes slowing around the country, real estate agents in the United States are traveling the world for buyers -- and finding them, too. 
 ''I love Monaco,'' said Eugenia Foxworth, an agent at Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy in New York, who calls the French Riviera a great place to network for sales. Her recent travels also included Thailand and Greece, where she marketed a 33-acre estate in northern New Jersey with tennis courts that convert to a skating rink. It is listed at $7.5 million.
 ''I've had more sales with Europeans in the past year than Americans,'' Ms. Foxworth said. 
 Wooing international buyers has become a priority for some agents who handle luxury properties. Real estate analysts say rising interest rates, a glut of fancy designer estates and inflated prices are shrinking the number of American shoppers interested in high-end properties, although the observation is based on consumer attitudes rather than actual sales. 
 Meanwhile, the number of overseas buyers is soaring. A study conducted last year by the Florida Association of Realtors and the National Association of Realtors found that 15 percent of the homes sold by almost 1,000 Florida agents in the last 12 months had been bought by foreigners. 
 Nearly 60 percent of those buyers were Europeans taking advantage of the euro's strength against the dollar. (The euro is now trading at around $1.27, about 27 percent more than the rate in July 2002.) Buyers from Asia, Latin America and other regions also are looking to the United States, which is viewed as a relatively stable market. 
 As a result, more luxury home sellers are marketing properties overseas. The number of agents certified as international specialists by the National Association of Realtors has grown to more than 2,000, nearly a third more than three years ago. 
 ''Owners of very expensive homes are looking to where the wealth is,'' said Laurie Moore-Moore, the president of the Dallas-based Institute for Luxury Home Marketing, which works with agents. 
 Susan Greenfield, vice president of Brown Harris Stevens in New York, who travels around the world marketing properties, was in Cannes, France, recently promoting a three-bedroom, 1,850-square-foot condominium priced at $2.599 million. ''You can't do this over the Internet,'' Ms. Greenfield said. ''You can't do this over the telephone.'' 
 Once a rarity, Americans are now a common sight at trade shows around the world, like Sima, or Salon Immobiliario de Madrid, one of Europe's largest annual real estate exhibitions. This year's event drew 25 exhibitors from the United States, a new record for that show, according to a show spokesman. 
 Magazines and Web sites also are benefiting from the new international marketing push. For example, Unique Homes Magazine, a twice-monthly publication distributed in 80 countries, has grown from 240 pages to 320 pages in the last year. 
 Brokers say they have increased their advertising budgets in vehicles that reach wealthy people beyond American borders. ''My business model has completely changed,'' said Luke Romero, an agent in Houston with Cameron & Tate Properties, which focuses almost exclusively on international buyers. 
 Mr. Romero travels extensively in Latin America, particularly Panama and Mexico, and is active in the International Real Estate Federation, commonly known by its French acronym, Fiabci, an organization focused on facilitating relationships among real estate professionals. 
 ''A lot of it is back to old-fashioned networking,'' Mr. Romero said. ''It's pressing the flesh and getting to know people.'' 
 Increased communication and cooperation between real estate associations has helped streamline the industry part of the process for non-American residents. 
 In 2001, the National Association of Realtors and 23 of its counterparts from around the world formed the International Consortium of Real Estate Associations. Consortium members agree to follow certain ethical and business guidelines, including adhering to a payment structure for referrals. Agents in the United States now routinely pay overseas agents anywhere from 5 percent to 40 percent of the sales commission for a successful referral. 
 ''In the past you never knew if you were going to get paid,'' said Ruth Krinke, an agent based in Steamboat Springs, Colo., who is chairwoman of the Realtors' international operations committee. 
 The consortium also organized a Web site, Worldproperties.com, to help market members' properties. 
 ''The Internet has been the key,'' said Ms. Krinke, who has developed a loyal clientele of Australians. ''You can be sitting in Timbuktu shopping for properties here in Steamboat.'' 
 It is not only agents in resorts and cosmopolitan centers like New York and Miami who are developing an international customer base. In April, more than 200 local real estate agents gathered in Oklahoma City to learn about selling homes to buyers from around the world. Discussions covered everything from contract law to proper etiquette at Japanese dinner parties. 
 ''The market has changed,'' said Sharon Young, chief executive officer of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Association of Realtors, which organized the event. ''We can no longer look at just the United States.''

HEADLINE: For Rent: The Hottest Form of Housing 

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
IN the eternal dance of developers responding to the rhythms of change, the belle of the ball is always changing. 
 While a single-family home still defines the American dream for most homebuyers -- and developers still strive to satisfy that yen wherever they can find a place to subdivide in densely developed northern New Jersey -- their efforts have been curtailed in recent years by antisprawl laws.
Instead many turned to building multifamily housing, with condominiums appearing to emerge as builders' darlings. Just within the last five years, dozens of towers and town house developments have sprung up along the Hudson River waterfront, whole new condo neighborhoods have arisen beside the Jersey Shore, and old factory buildings and former apartment structures have been converted to condos in communities around the state. 
 ''Condominium construction and conversion, particularly on the Gold Coast, has been running sort of rampant,'' said Jeffrey Dunne, a vice chairman of the tristate investment team of the large property-services firm CB Richard Ellis. ''Coincidentally,'' he pointed out, ''there is a diminished supply of rental buildings.''
 Meanwhile, added Jeffrey Wiener, president of Kislak, a Clifton-based broker of rental properties, demand for apartments remains high, because there is always a large group of North Jersey residents who are ''renters by choice.'' And as interest rates have begun to climb, pricing more people out of the homebuying market, the number of renters inevitably increases, he said.
 Now, it seems, rental apartment buildings are emerging from wallflower status and may be headed for a stint as prom queen.
 At the moment, Mr. Wiener said, rental buildings are ''hotter than hot'' properties for real estate investors, with bidders trying to elbow one another aside even when the projected return on capital is less than 6 percent. He and other market experts noted that vacancy rates for rental buildings are rapidly shrinking, making them solid investments. Andrew Abramson, president of the Value Group, which builds and manages apartment buildings, said there were only a handful of vacancies among the 2,000 units it controls in northern New Jersey. 
 Signs of the change abound.
 In affluent Saddle Brook, in Bergen County, the Value Group is building nearly 200 rental units in the downtown area, where rentals have been virtually unknown.
 In Englewood, 188 apartments with nine-foot ceilings, granite countertops and other condo-esque accouterments, have just opened, three miles west of the George Washington Bridge. They are priced from $1,800 to $5,000 a month. 
 In East Rutherford, the first upscale rental building to be built in nearly 40 years opened earlier this month. The 108-unit complex, Orchard Square, built by Millennium Homes is across the street from the Rutherford train station. It features one- and two-bedroom apartments, concierge service, a fitness center and a hotel-style lobby. The Sovereign, a 260-unit, two-tower riverfront apartment complex that opened three months ago in Hoboken, amidst the condo towers of the Shipyard development, is already 65 percent leased, at monthly rents like $2,035 for studios, $2,550 for one-bedroom units, $3,410 for two-bedrooms, and $5,395 for three-bedroom designs -- all very high by New Jersey standards.
 Investors' purchases of existing rental buildings are ''frenzied,'' according to several market experts, including Mr. Wiener, who said he had never seen them this intense in his 32 years in the business. ''We're actually seeing bidding wars for buildings, and sometimes for surprisingly low capitalization rates,'' he said. 
 Mr. Wiener cited a sale his company recently brokered for a package of 92 apartments in several older midrise buildings in Jersey City. There were about 10 bidders, and the buildings sold for more than $9 million, he said, or about $100,000 per apartment. Another investor recently bought 49 apartments in Irvington for about $75,000 per apartment.
 Last March the 436-unit Carlton Club apartment building in Piscataway, which is more than 30 years old, was sold after intense bidding and will yield an ''aggressively low'' capitalization rate of less than 6 percent, Mr. Wiener said, referring to the rate of return an investor earns after rent is collected and expenses and mortgage interest are paid. 
 Mr. Abramson of the Value Group says there is clearly an increase in the number of people seeking to rent apartments in Bergen County right now, although the rental market there never slackens significantly because the area is a prime spot for corporate relocations.
 Mr. Abramson's father and a partner built the first apartment building in Saddle Brook 45 years ago, Mr. Abramson said. That apartment house is the only large rental building in town, he said, and it is fully rented.
 The Value Group acquired two small parcels totaling 1.5 acres on Sampson Street in Saddle Brook, and a little less than five acres on Mayhill Street. It is opening 38 units in midrise buildings at the first site this week, with work beginning now on 158 units at the second site.
 ''We are finding a strong market among empty-nesters who want to simplify but don't want to leave town,'' said Mr. Abramson. He said he was confident that the rental market would remain strong for many years.
 The rental rates at the building opening Tuesday, which has no pool or fitness club, but features ''condo-quality'' finishes and appliances, according to Mr. Abramson, range from $1,625 to $2,025 a month for one- and two-bedroom apartments.

HEADLINE: P What? PZEV's Are Unsung Heroes in the Push to Clean Up the Air 

BYLINE: By JIM MOTAVALLI

 BODY:
IF you think you can help the environment by parking your car and walking, you may be dismayed to learn this: that parked car -- even if it is a recent model officially designated as a low-emission vehicle, according to the California Air Resources Board -- gives off more pollutants even when shut off than some new models do while driving down the road. 
 The clean-running cars in question are those certified to a standard set by California regulators that is known as PZEV -- bureaucratic shorthand for a partial zero emission vehicle. They are also available, or soon will be, in a handful of states on the West Coast and in the Northeast that have adopted California's emissions rules.
According to the air quality agency, some 500,000 PZEV's are already on California roads, though their drivers may not even be aware of the contribution they are making to air quality. These are not the sort of vehicles that young enthusiasts spot from blocks away and point at excitedly. 
 PZEV's hide in plain sight as specially equipped versions of cars as familiar as the Chevrolet Cobalt, the Ford Fusion, the Honda Accord and the Volvo V70, usually with four- or six-cylinder engines. They use an improved pollution-control system to meet California's toughest tailpipe standard for cars with combustion engines. The system carries a factory emissions warranty stretched to 15 years or 150,000 miles, from 10 years and 120,000 miles. 
 Because a PZEV complies with tailpipe standards for a SULEV, or super ultra low emission vehicle, the exhaust can be as clean as that of many hybrids -- yet the cars do not incur the hybrid's price premium of several thousand dollars. PZEV's generally cost consumers no more than identical models that do not have the squeaky-clean certification, which are built for states that have not adopted California's rules, though they are estimated to cost automakers between $200 and $500 extra to produce. That money buys special parts like a steel gas tank, a catalytic converter with more precious metals inside, a larger trap for evaporative fumes and in some cases, an air injection system. 
 One might think that green-leaning drivers would be lining up for this relative bargain, especially in light of some hybrid models' commanding a price well above the window sticker. But hybrids still enjoy a perception of phenomenal fuel economy in the public's eye while a PZEV's fuel economy rating is the same as its non-PZEV counterpart. And there is a powerful draw to the hybrid's earth-friendly reputation. 
 To be sure, a hybrid still comes out ahead in overall environmental impact, because while it is driving on its electric motor alone it produces no pollutants and uses no gasoline (so it produces no carbon dioxide). 
 An important part of the PZEV's advantage is its elimination of evaporative emissions, the gasoline fumes that escape during refueling or, especially on hot days, from the fuel tank and supply lines. Even a car that is not running can emit a significant amount of evaporative pollution -- perhaps 25 percent of the vehicle's total emissions, the air resources board says -- so the special fuel system makes a real difference in air quality. 
 Few buyers know about these below-the-radar green machines. Automakers have not promoted them heavily, as they have done with hybrids, and an informal survey of salespeople at dealerships turned up more confusion than useful information.
 Jim Kliesch, a research associate at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, an environmental nonprofit group, and the author of the council's annual Green Book guide to cars and trucks, admits that California's alphabet soup of emission levels is ''pretty confusing stuff. They haven't made the nomenclature very easy.'' 
 PZEV's might be better known if the process that created them had not been so convoluted. The effort began in 1990 when California established its Zero Emission Vehicle program to reduce smog. The original goal called for 2 percent of new cars and trucks sold in California in 1998 to produce no emissions at all, with the percentage increasing in steps to 10 percent in 2003. 
 The plan, which essentially mandated battery-powered vehicles, came under attack by automakers and oil companies as unachievable, and has been considerably modified over the years. But the 2 percent rule for zero-emission cars is still in place, said Jerry Martin, a spokesman. The difference is that a compromise was struck to allow automakers to earn credits against the obligation to ''produce, deliver for sale and put in service'' zero-emission vehicles by selling hybrids or PZEV's. 
 The phase-in began in 2005 and the percentages are scheduled to increase in coming years. Credits may be sold, traded or banked for the future, and some carmakers are meeting the mandate with credits earned in past years. The rules stipulate penalties for failure to meet the goals.
 Although manufacturers get just a fraction of the credit for a PZEV car that they would get from a fuel-cell or a battery-electric vehicle, the PZEV's are produced in such large numbers that the credits accumulate and keep the manufacturers within the bounds of the state mandate. In the worst case, noncompliance could result in a manufacturer losing the right to sell cars and trucks in California. 
 All new cars sold in the United States must meet at least federal emissions standards. With the worst air quality in the nation, California won the right to set tougher limits, and some states have adopted California's laws in place of the federal rules set by the Environmental Protection Agency. The states that have passed or are phasing in California rules are New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington (and Pennsylvania has begun the process as well); together, the California-compliant states account for about a third of all cars sold in this country.
 Theoretically, then, the PZEV's that are made by manufacturers in 2006 are, or soon will be, available at dealers in those states. But with nearly no advertising for PZEV's, the vehicles have a low profile. 
 Automakers say they are not trying to hide their PZEV's. One challenge, according to Chris Naughton, a Honda spokesman, is that companies do not want to promise what they cannot deliver in a market that is a patchwork of California and non-California states. ''If we run ads, we run the risk of having them bleed over into states where PZEV's are not available,'' he said.
 How much cleaner are PZEV tailpipes? In terms of one common pollutant, oxides of nitrogen, today's federal standard for an average car, known as Tier 2 Bin 5, is 0.07 grams per mile. But PZEV's have to meet the California SULEV II standard, which allows only .02 grams per mile. 
 ''They're 70 percent cleaner than cars that are pretty darn clean to begin with,'' said David Hermance, executive engineer for advanced technology vehicles at Toyota. 
 Ethanol additives to gasoline in some states pose a challenge to PZEV evaporative emission performance. Steve Mazure, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman, said that solving the problem may require new engine parts to deal with ethanol. DaimlerChrysler, which sold 20,000 Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Sebring PZEV's in the 2004 and 2005 model years but is not currently offering any, publicized its PZEV's through corporate environmental reports, dealer training and vehicle press kits.
 Ford has sold 185,000 Focus PZEV's since 2003, and according to Alan Hall, a spokesman, it hopes to raise the awareness of its clean cars with an exterior badge that incorporates the company's environmental logo -- a green-leaf and highway symbol -- and lettering that spells out its status as a partial zero emission vehicle. 
 In California, where an estimated 90 percent of all PZEV's have been sold so far, the visibility of these cars is increasing. The air resources group and its cheering section in the environmental community hope that the number of participating states will soon reach the point that it become cost-effective for carmakers to simply build one version -- the PZEV -- for the whole country. 
 By 2012 California could have as many as three million PZEV's on the road, the agency says. ''We expect this to be the dominant technology,'' Mr. Martin said. ''And it won't matter if people can say what the acronym stands for, because everyone they know will be driving one.''

HEADLINE: In Mexico, Loans Without Borders 

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
FIRST it was interest-only mortgages, then A.R.M.'s. The next big product for home buyers in this country could be the ''hipoteca de tasa fija a 20 anos,'' as 20-year fixed-rate mortgages are known in Mexico. 
 Buoyed by gains in domestic real estate, Americans have jumped into the worldwide housing market in recent years, buying second homes in far-flung destinations. 
Although such purchases are often financed with cash or second mortgages taken out on primary residences, a growing number of citizens are finding help from mortgage cooperatives set up jointly by American and foreign institutions. The deals are slightly more complex than those found in the United States; interest rates and down payments are higher, too. But mortgage executives say these products offer better terms than conventional second mortgages.
 Mexico is the most recent example, because it has become a booming market for people looking for beachfront homes. The United States Embassy in Mexico City said neither Mexican nor American government agencies track the number of Americans living in Mexico from year to year. But a spokeswoman said the number had grown since the last Mexican census, in 2000, when 340,000 Americans were counted. 
 Prices in Mexico are still much lower than in comparable American beach areas, and sites like Los Cabos and Cancun have drawn thousands of American buyers. 
 Brian Murphy, the president of ConfiCasa Riviera Maya, a brokerage affiliated with ConfiCasa International, based in Houston, said that lenders began offering cross-border loans to Americans about two years ago. ''The loans are happening,'' he said. ''They're just not the same loans you'll get in the states.''
 For instance, the loans usually require down payments of 30 percent, and most amortize over 20 years and have fixed rates. One exception is a 30-year adjustable mortgage, starting at 7.9 percent (plus a 2 percent origination fee). Buyers can also find 20-year fixed-rate loans at 7.75 percent, if they borrow at least $300,000. 
 The loan process is similar to its stateside cousin, with appraisals and credit checks. But buyers must register with the Foreign Investment Ministry and will most likely be required to set up a trust, called a fideicomiso, to protect the state's property rights. Although title insurance is not required, Mr. Murphy recommends it, because laws in different Mexican regions can cloud ownership rights. 
 Buyers should prepare for longer waits than they are typically subjected to in the United States. ''You're usually looking at a 90-day close,'' Mr. Murphy said.
 Many people credit General Electric with helping bolster the cross-border mortgage market through a partnership that G.E. Mexico, which finances loans, formed with its WMC Mortgage unit, which underwrites them. (Home buyers looking for brokers authorized to make such loans can check MexicanDreamMortgage.com., a site set up by G.E.) 
 Given the brisk demand for these loans, it is not surprising that other lenders are poised to join in. Mark Zaltzman, chief financial officer of Hipotecaria Su Casita, one of Mexico's biggest mortgage lenders, said that it would probably begin lending to Americans for purchases in Mexico by year's end. 
 Cultural issues sometimes make such loans difficult for lenders to set up, Mr. Zaltzman said. For instance, the United States and Mexico differ widely in their billing and collection processes for mortgages. In Mexico, collectors travel from house to house to pick up payments.
 ''How do I service the loan to Mr. Smith in New York when all my collectors are in Mexico?'' Mr. Zaltzman said. ''We're still exploring how to do that. But the average mortgage I do is about $30,000, and for Mr. Smith it's probably $300,000. So of course I'd like to look at his mortgage.''

HEADLINE: Starting a Retirement Business While Still on Someone's Payroll

BYLINE: By COELI CARR

 BODY:
In 2001, Charlie Ferguson, an electrical engineer, then 50, was still six years away from the possibility of retiring with a full pension from Allison Transmission in Indianapolis. At Allison, a General Motors division, he worked, and continues to work, as an electrician. 
 But after carefully considering his passion for chili peppers -- and the accolades and encouragement from friends to market his homemade salsa -- he and his wife, Glenda, decided to start their postretirement careers sooner rather than later. Ms. Ferguson also owns her own home business, WordQue, which provides captioning and transcription services.
By 2002, with Charlie as the C & G Salsa Company's chief executive and Glenda as the president, the Fergusons were selling their Crazy Charlie's Salsa locally, offering three different heat intensities. The next year, Kroger introduced the salsas in 150 Indiana and Illinois stores. In 2004, C & G added two chili sauces to its product line and picked up 110 more Kroger stores. This year the two entrepreneurs, with four jobs between them counting the two with C & G, project that the company's revenue will reach $600,000, not bad for a side business. 
 Although baby boomers are being deluged with advice on how to plan for satisfying and productive second acts, the time frame for setting up a business that, ideally, provides an income stream during one's golden years -- or at least makes it possible to say goodbye to the old job -- is hardly clear.
 ''Going into this, you've got to have a financial base,'' said Mr. Ferguson, who says he may not retire from G.M. next year, even though he's eligible. 
 His wife, who says she ''doesn't want to quit her other job too soon,'' echoes his caution. ''I recommend people start planning before they retire,'' Ms. Ferguson said, ''especially in today's world, where pensions are no longer a guaranteed thing, when companies are taking them away right and left.'' 
 For some experts, this uncertainty makes the Fergusons' way of doing things -- hanging on to their old jobs and self-financing C & G -- a wise strategy.
 Most people do not succeed with their small businesses because they do not have enough capital or they have too much debt, said Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economics and director of the Higgins Labor Research Center at the University of Notre Dame and editor of ''What You Need to Know About the Economics of Growing Old (but Were Afraid to Ask)'' (University of Notre Dame Press, 2004). ''It's better to have other sources of income, have your medical insurance taken care of, have no debt and accumulate a pension.'' 
 Referring to Mr. Ferguson's situation, she said: ''He has a good pension and security. That makes a lot of sense. He's beating the odds.''
 Herb Greenberg, founder, president and chief executive of Caliper, an international human resources consulting firm based in Princeton, N.J., calls the Fergusons' strategy brilliant. ''They're not dependent on their enterprise for money, so they are able to build at their pace and still have substantial income,'' said Mr. Greenberg, who was a co-author of ''Succeed on Your Own Terms: Lessons From Top Achievers Around the World on Developing Your Unique Potential'' (McGraw-Hill, 2006). 
 The ability to ''try out options,'' while other work provides a secure financial situation, is important, he said, because if the new project does not work out, there is still time to pursue other avenues. Starting a business after one has officially retired provides less flexibility. ''The downside of doing it sequentially is the loss of years,'' he said. 
 How do middle-aged people find the stamina to keep both their secure jobs and their entrepreneurial ventures afloat? 
 Lisa Haneberg, a management and leadership consultant who also coaches people in the process of becoming business owners, says the answer is focus, which she defines as ''the coming together of all parts of my life for a common goal.'' 
 The greatest liability in setting up one's own company is the unwillingness to work at it every day, said Ms. Haneberg, whose new book is titled ''Focus Like a Laser Beam: 10 Ways to Do What Matters Most'' (Jossey-Bass, 2006). ''A lot of people think they can do it for an hour on a Saturday,'' she said. ''They don't add a new habit into their habitual life.'' 
 A person is most focused when ''you're willing to play with what gives you energy and passion,'' Ms. Haneberg said. ''Disciplined resoluteness is fed from passion; it doesn't happen by magic.''
 But for many baby boomers, what's even scarier than having to dig deep within themselves to arrive at a suitable postretirement career is the prospect of juggling the new venture, sometimes stealthily, while still working at their primary jobs. 
 ''While you need to be responsible, it's well worth the risk to create something special,'' said Daniel J. Kadlec, a financial writer and co-author of ''The Power Years: A User's Guide to the Rest of Your Life'' (Wiley, 2005), who points to the ''deterioration of safety nets -- such as pensions and Social Security benefits, which people are coming to realize may not be there for them down the line -- as a reason to create a bridge to full retirement.''
 ''Employer loyalty isn't what it used to be,'' he said. ''They're taking care of the C.E.O., but certainly not the line worker anymore. You've got to take care of you.'' 
 Many agree, however, that treading lightly is advisable. As Rick Miners, a consultant and the co-author of ''Don't Retire, Rewire!'' (Alpha/Penguin Putnam, 2002), said, ''There's delicacy here.'' 
 The worker may be overly tired or spending too much time away from work, and ''if your primary employer feels they're being taken advantage of, it may create a problem,'' he said.
 And, he added, while working on the new company with one's spouse provides predictability, not everyone has the inclination to do so. With work stressful enough as it is, he said, the absence of emotional downtime just adds pressure.
 Mr. Ferguson, however, has always seen C & G Salsa as a win-win situation for him and his employer. ''It doesn't have to be negative,'' he said, adding that a number of people where he works have developed entrepreneurial interests. He says he believes that his outside business benefits his employer. ''Here you've got someone learning new things,'' he said. ''You're getting a better employee.''

 BODY:
THE aspiring artist, a 38-year old with stark blue eyes, thinning reddish-orange hair and a matching soul patch, took his seat in a corner of Haven Arts, an upstart gallery in a converted apartment building on Rider Avenue and 141st Street in Mott Haven.
 The artist, J. C. Rice, was nervous. Two years earlier, he had left a teaching job in Anchorage to live with his girlfriend, Jackie Davis, a ponytailed graduate student in social work at Hunter College, and to try his hand at being an artist. But his anxiety this evening involved something more specific than the task of adjusting to a new city. Back at his apartment, he had already drunk two glasses of Scotch to calm his nerves, because, as he put it, ''I'm not totally over just looking at a naked stranger.''
The model slipped off her sweats and began her poses for a weekly drawing class that is held at the gallery, as Mr. Rice, wearing paint-stained jeans, settled into his headphones and picked up a piece of charcoal. 
 ''Music's good,'' he said as he worked. ''I didn't have music last time.'' 
 After class, Mr. Rice headed south to unwind at the Bruckner Bar and Grill, which sits under the Third Avenue Bridge. Then he made his way to the loft apartment that he and Ms. Davis shared in the Clock Tower, a renovated piano factory around the corner at Lincoln Avenue near Bruckner Boulevard.
 Taisha Pearson, a 27-year-old with dark skin, short hair and long bangs, lives six blocks north of the Clock Tower, on Beekman Avenue. Her home is a cramped, subsidized three-bedroom apartment that she shares with her partner, Jose Cintron, the father of four of her five children, and her mother, Angela.
 On an overcast day last October, Ms. Pearson could be found in Room 625 of Bronx Supreme Court, awaiting a pretrial proceeding for Rene Bonilla, the man accused of killing her 10-year-old daughter, Naiesha. 
 The killing occurred the evening of Sept. 5 at Saw Mill Playground, on 139th Street between Willis and Brook Avenues, where Ms. Pearson had gone for a barbecue with some friends and relatives.
 She was feeding a bottle to Tamia, her 4-month-old daughter, while Naiesha -- NaNa to everyone who knew her -- stood nearby watching as Leonardo Deaza, a family friend, fixed the seat of a bike she had won in a church raffle. According to one witness, Mr. Deaza had had an altercation with Mr. Bonilla earlier in the day. 
 Whatever the circumstances, the bullets found not only Mr. Deaza, who was seriously injured, but also Naiesha. The moment Ms. Pearson heard the shots, still clutching her baby, she ran to Naiesha, arriving just as the girl slumped into her arms. That was when Ms. Pearson saw the blood. 
 Naiesha was rushed to the operating room of Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center. Two hours later, the surgeon emerged to deliver the news: The bullet in the girl's chest had been removed, but her heart had stopped. 
 It was several weeks later that Ms. Pearson was waiting in the Bronx courtroom for Mr. Bonilla, who was charged with the second-degree murder of Naiesha and the attempted murder of Mr. Deaza. She was wearing a white T-shirt bearing a photo imprint of her daughter's face. The next pretrial hearing in the case is scheduled for Sept. 12. 

Ballyhoo, Bullets
 J. C. Rice and Taisha Pearson represent the opposite faces of SoBro, as the energetically gentrifying South Bronx communities of Mott Haven, Port Morris and Melrose have been rechristened. 
 Hipsters and artists have flocked to the three neighborhoods, which make up Community District 1, just across the Harlem River from Manhattan, to open fashionable businesses and find cheaper rents. There has been ballyhoo about the area's changing face. But for Mr. Rice, the artist, and Ms. Pearson, the welfare mother who saw her child fatally shot, living in a community like Mott Haven couldn't be more different.
 In the eyes of many longtime residents, the area's dreary past continues to shadow its present. The area started failing in the 1970's as drugs, violent crime and poverty overwhelmed it. Controlled rents combined with rising maintenance costs and an increasingly troubled population to produce waves of arson and looting. The Bronx burned, and the words ''South Bronx'' became synonymous with the arson, drugs and gangs that pummeled what was fast becoming one of the nation's poorest areas. 
 Although the borough started to revive in the 1980's, reported felonies in Community District 1 increased, topping out at nearly 9,000 in 1990, and murders reached a peak of 84 in 1991, which ranked among the five highest totals in the city that year. The Bronx was no longer burning, it was bleeding. 
 Then, unexpectedly, crime began to drop sharply across the city, leading to the redevelopment of formerly blighted neighborhoods with apartments designed to appeal to higher-income residents. 
 Bruckner Boulevard, once a symbol of the area's violence and blight, is perhaps the starkest example of change. Antique shops dot the street, and studio apartments at the Clock Tower rent for $1,500 a month. The Bruckner Bar and Grill serves arugula salad and chicken clubs with avocado. 
 The city has encouraged that sort of development. In 1997, the City Planning Commission established a special mixed-use zoning district in Port Morris that allowed the conversion of several industrial buildings within a five-block area into businesses and apartments. Last year, the City Council approved rezoning of an additional 11 blocks to permit redevelopment of other vacant and underused buildings. 
 ''It just ain't the old South Bronx here,'' said Neil Pariser, senior vice president of the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit group whose mission is to keep businesses and jobs from fleeing the area. SoBro, a shorthand name for Mr. Pariser's group, has spawned a moniker for the area and has become a catchy real estate label.
 But trouble persists. Residents of Mott Haven are 20 percent more likely to die of chronic lung disease than are other New Yorkers, according to the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Community District 1 is home to some of the city's most overcrowded and worst-performing schools. Add to that a concentration of guns and illegal drugs -- last fall the police arrested 28 members of a gang accused of selling cocaine and heroin near public housing projects -- and a neighborhood nickname that echoes SoHo strikes many as decidedly premature. 
 In addition, the borough's southernmost tip still provides relatively steady fodder for headlines about violence. Last year, 10 murders were reported in the 40th Police Precinct, which covers Melrose, Mott Haven and Port Morris. In October, a man delivering Chinese food was robbed and fatally shot in a vestibule in a Mott Haven apartment complex. And in a Halloween prank, a group of kids threw eggs at a man's car and, when he protested, shot him to death. 
 The killings seem to be rising. As of July 9, there had already been 9 murders in 2006. In February, police found a body under the Third Avenue Bridge, with a gunshot wound to the leg. In June a man was shot and killed at Club Naybar, a nightclub on Third Avenue in Mott Haven. 
 After a steady decline, reports of shootings in the 40th Precinct have also risen, to 46 in 2005, from 31 the year before. But Sgt. Chris Murphy, who compiles crime statistics at the precinct, says that a better question than why shootings were up last year is ''Why were they down for so long?''
 A few blocks north of where most of the newly arrived artists live, longtime residents refer to their neighborhood as the ghetto. Even Mr. Rice says the area can be shady at night. And Ms. Pearson says of the frequency of shootings in her neighborhood: ''All the time. Even in broad daylight.''
 The recent influx of higher-income residents has not yet transformed the community. Capt. John J. Nicholson, commander of the 40th Precinct, says the community has made ''real and positive'' strides, but he cautions against downplaying the level of local crime. Drug dealing and gang violence are ''entrenched,'' he says, and the progress the police make is ''incremental.'' 
 Ms. Pearson put it another way. ''Every time you look on the news,'' she said, ''somebody's dying.'' 

Duct Tape and 'Disrespect'
 At Christmastime, Naiesha smiled out from a color photograph on the front door of Ms. Pearson's apartment, but today the door, bare of decoration, looks like any other in the building. Inside the apartment, a narrow hallway leads to a trio of cluttered bedrooms. Two duct-taped black vinyl couches furnish a modest living area, where one recent afternoon a television set with poor reception was playing reruns of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' Appliances are crowded together in a back corner, and in Naiesha's old bedroom, the family keeps a pit bull locked up.
 Ms. Pearson and Mr. Cintron, who met when they were children, are not married. For the most part they get along well, although both acknowledge that the relationship has its bumps, generally involving Mr. Cintron's activities. A heavyset six-footer with a large Afro, Mr. Cintron, 30, has a benevolent demeanor that belies a troubled past; he has spent the last nine years in and out of jail for selling, as he puts it, ''crack, dope and sometimes weed.'' 
 In the wake of his daughter's death, he has vowed never to return to prison. But he has no job. He is trying to obtain disability insurance in connection with a broken leg he suffered playing football as a child and back injuries sustained in a car accident; those injuries, he says, have left him unable to do physical labor. 
 For now, the family collects about $1,000 a month in welfare and food stamps, said Ms. Pearson, who is expecting a baby in late summer. She has looked for jobs at sneaker and clothing stores, she added, but never seems to get called back after the first interview. 
 Mr. Cintron, meanwhile, realizes he could be a far more responsible member of the household. ''I have a lot of respect for her,'' Mr. Cintron said of his partner as his body sagged in one of the old couches. ''You going to disrespect someone, disrespect me. I'm the bad one, not her.''

Guitars and Granite Counters
 A few nights before his art class, Mr. Rice stood on the roof of the Clock Tower, throwing a ball to his Boston terrier while waiting for Ms. Davis to return from classes in Manhattan. He could see both the Empire State Building and the George Washington Bridge glowing in the distance.
 The couple's loft was a 1,000-square-foot space with hardwood floors. Shelves lining the ceiling held speakers, boxes and a guitar case. In one corner stood a modern stove and refrigerator flanked by granite kitchen counters.
 The Carnegie Corporation had converted the old Estes Piano Factory into the Clock Tower after the 1997 rezoning, and Mr. Rice and Ms. Davis, who had lived briefly in Westchester with her parents, were attracted by the cheap rent. They settled on the Clock Tower in November 2004 and paid a starting rent of about $1,420; earlier this summer, they moved to a bigger and cheaper apartment around the corner.
 A few blocks north, people are buying historic town houses on Alexander Avenue for less than $500,000; some tenants rent apartments in them for $1,200 a month. The Corcoran Group, the Manhattan real estate firm, has started showing clients housing in the area. 
 The Bruckner Bar and Grill, the only place nearby, Mr. Rice says, that ''feels like Lower Manhattan,'' is where many of the newcomers end up. The room is dark, lighted only by small candles on tables and a lamp above the bar. A baby grand sits in the corner. In a back room is a pool table surrounded by leather booths.
 Ms. Davis, who is 29, acknowledges that some local artists feel guilty about igniting a gentrification wave that could hurt longtime residents if it hasn't hurt them already. Still, she and Mr. Rice plan to remain in the South Bronx for at least one more year. He has sold some paintings and splits time between administrative work at Haven Arts and a local community center, where he prepares ex-cons for high school equivalency exams. 
 ''I will be really interested to see what this place is like in 20 years,'' Ms. Davis said while Mr. Rice stepped outside the bar to smoke a cigarette. But she worries that the current trend may not serve the community's best interests. ''It doesn't need revitalization in the sense of new people,'' she said. ''It needs money.'' 

Rosary, Roses
 Ms. Pearson held her head low as she walked up the long asphalt path to St. Raymond's Cemetery in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx. It was a blustery Sunday morning, and the journey to her daughter's plot had already been a trek. Most members of the family had driven there in a friend's car, but because the car was small and there was not enough room for everyone, Ms. Pearson had to take the No. 6 subway and then the Bronx 42 bus. 
 The section of the cemetery she was headed for was marked by a large white marble cross bearing the message ''Those who put their faith in the Lord will live forever.'' In the distance, Ms. Pearson saw Mr. Cintron and the rest of the family, who had arrived moments earlier for what had become a new weekly tradition: the Sunday visit to Naiesha's grave.
 Everyone, even baby Tamia, who was wrapped in a blanket, gathered around the small granite headstone that bore the words ''Beloved Daughter and Sister. Naiesha M. Cintron. 3-28-1995 -- 9-5-2005.'' The plot was dotted with stuffed animals, paper hearts and bundles of roses. 
 Mr. Cintron hung a bright yellow rosary around the gravestone, then left with the children for the car. 
 Ms. Pearson remained and stared at the stone for several minutes. Except for the hum of traffic from the Cross Bronx Expressway, there was no sound. 
 She marveled at the pile of mementos surrounding her daughter's grave. ''Her stone looks nice,'' she said.
 After blessing herself twice, she blew kisses toward the stone, then headed back to the path. ''Is she all right?'' Ms. Pearson wondered aloud as she walked away. ''How's she doing? Does she know we come over here?''
 She has vowed that she will visit the grave every Sunday for as long as she can. Though the trip makes her sad and angry because it reminds her of her daughter's violent and random death, she will return, she said, ''just to make sure she's all right.'' 
 Where is her daughter now? ''Heaven, probably playing,'' Ms. Pearson said. ''Playing around.''

HEADLINE: Expand 'Demand Response' 

BYLINE: By Mike Gordon. 
Mike Gordon is the president of ConsumerPowerline, a strategic energy asset management firm.

 BODY:
THE power failure in Queens provided a stark reminder of our vulnerability to breakdowns and the need to deal with flaws in the system. Fortunately, there is a proverbial light at the end of the grid -- an approach called ''demand response'' that can help prevent future blackouts. 
 Demand response programs, offered in New York and most other states, provide financial incentives to large energy consumers for curtailing electricity use in peak periods.
Twice in recent weeks, as soaring temperatures pushed the grid to its limit, demand response participants, including my firm's clients Macy's, Starwood Hotels and the N.Y.U. Medical Center, contributed sorely needed power to more than 100,000 homes, preventing what could have become a citywide blackout. 
 Demand response empowers large energy consumers to create an electricity ''supply valve,'' which could eliminate the need for dozens of new power plants, reduce our dependence on foreign oil and put us on more sound footing economically and environmentally.
 But to realize this potential, we need to increase the participation rate of city energy consumers in the demand response program above the current 8 percent. Demand response should be a key component of our regional and national energy policy. Empowering consumers to become part of the energy solution is in the best tradition of our democracy.

HEADLINE: Physics Trumps Economics

BYLINE: By George C. Loehr. 
George C. Loehr, a consultant on electric power systems and reliability, worked for Con Edison in the 1960's.

DATELINE: Albuquerque 

 BODY:
THE one positive thing about the power failure in Queens is that no other areas of the interconnected electric grid were affected by it. Still, it's the grid's reliability that's in most danger today. Whatever improvements are needed at the distribution level, the reliability of the grid is deteriorating, and a blackout like the one in August 2003 will surely be replicated. 
 The reasons are many, but all come back to a mismanaged attempt to deregulate electric power supply.
Federal agencies and industry groups, whose mantra is ''the market,'' have taken control. Policy decisions promote commercial interests, not customer reliability. There's even a major push to lower reliability standards to allow greater commercial use of the grid. 
 The Energy Policy Act that Congress passed last year in an effort to expand energy production will do nothing for reliability. Its touted requirement for mandatory standards for reliability is meaningless; standards have been mandatory in most parts of North America (including New York) for years. 
 When the laws of economics and the laws of physics collide, physics always wins.

HEADLINE: A New Enemy Gains On The U.S.

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
POUND for pound and pounding for pounding, the Israeli military is one of the world's finest. But Hezbollah, with the discipline and ferocity of its fighters and ability to field advanced weaponry, has taken Israel by surprise. 
 Now that surprise has rocketed back to Washington and across the American military.
United States officials worry that they're not prepared, either, for Hezbollah's style of warfare -- a kind that pits finders against hiders and favors the hiders. 
 Certain that other terrorists are learning from Hezbollah's successes, the United States is studying the conflict closely for lessons to apply to its own wars. Military planners suggest that the Pentagon take a page out of Hezbollah's book about small-unit, agile operations as it battles insurgents and cells in Iraq and Afghanistan and plans for countering more cells and their state sponsors across the Middle East and in Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America. 
 The United States and Israel have each fought conventional armies of nation-states and shadowy terror organizations. But Hezbollah, with the sophistication of a national army (it almost sank an Israeli warship with a cruise missile) and the lethal invisibility of a guerrilla army, is a hybrid. Old labels, and old planning, do not apply. Certainly its style of 21st-century combat is known -- on paper. The style even has its own labels, including network warfare, or net war, and fourth-generation warfare, although many in the military don't care for such titles. But the battlefields of south Lebanon prove that it is here, and sooner than expected. And the American national security establishment is struggling to adapt.
 ''We are now into the first great war between nations and networks,'' said John Arquilla, a professor of defense analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School, and a leading analyst of net warfare. ''This proves the growing strength of networks as a threat to American national security.''
 In a talk that Mr. Arquilla calls Net Warfare 101, he describes how traditional militaries are organized in a strict hierarchy, from generals down to privates. In contrast, networks flatten the command structure. They are distributed, dispersed, agile, mobile, improvisational. This makes them effective, and hard to track and target.
 A net war differs from all previous wars, which were about brute confrontation of forces, mass on mass -- what Matthew Arnold called bloody contests of ''ignorant armies'' meeting on the ''darkling plain.''
 Net war is the battle of the many, organized in small units, against conventional militaries that organize their many into large units. These network forces are not ignorant. They are computer literate, propaganda and Internet savvy, and capable of firing complicated weapons to great effect.
 ''The pooling of information is certainly a characteristic of these kinds of insurgencies,'' said Daniel Benjamin, who served on the National Security Council under President Bill Clinton before joining the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''In Iraq, for example, the lessons on how to build and place I.E.D.'s have spread and been assimilated in record time. There is certain to be the insurgent equivalent of a PowerPoint presentation on Hezbollah's successes that will make the rounds of the insurgent and terrorist Web sites.''
 Hezbollah spent the last six years dispersing about 12,000 rockets across southern Lebanon in a vast web of hidden caches, all divided into local zones with independent command. 
 ''They dug tunnels. They dug bunkers, they established communications systems -- cellphones, radios, even runners to carry messages that aren't susceptible to eavesdropping,'' said one military officer with experience in the Middle East. ''They divided southern Lebanon into military zones with many small units that operate independently, without the need for central control.''
 To attack Israel, Hezbollah dispersed its fighters with no distinguishing markings or uniforms or vehicles. Fighters access the weapons only at the moment of attack, and then disappear. This makes preventing the attack all but impossible. It is a significant modernization of classic guerrilla hit-and-run tactics. Israel has been unable to significantly degrade the numbers of rockets because of this approach. Hezbollah fired more than 100 a day at the start of this conflict; they are still firing more than 100 a day, despite Israeli bombardment.
 Hezbollah still possesses the most dangerous aspects of a shadowy terror network. It abides by no laws of war as it attacks civilians indiscriminately. Attacks on its positions carry a high risk of killing innocents. At the same time, it has attained military capabilities and other significant attributes of a nation-state. It holds territory and seats in the Lebanese government. It fields high-tech weapons and possesses the firepower to threaten the entire population of a regional superpower, or at least those in the northern half of Israel. 
 While Hezbollah has emerged as a new kind of threat, it cannot be forgotten that the network is a creation of Iran, with the support of Syria, and both countries know they cannot attack Israel -- or American interests -- directly. The Bush administration is debating internally whether the best course of action against Iran and Syria is to negotiate with them, isolate them, or do something stronger.
 Hezbollah's success in surviving Israeli bombardment poses an immediate implication for American military planning as the United States figures out what to do about Iran, either as part of an effort to halt its nuclear ambitions or a broader offensive with political goals, like regime change.
 Pentagon planners who focus on the region predict that the American military would face a conflict far less conventional than that of the armored columns that rushed to Baghdad and toppled Saddam Hussein. Iran trained Hezbollah, and it can fight like Hezbollah.
 Military planners say they are closely studying groups like the Basij paramilitary force -- organized, trained and equipped by Iran's Revolutionary Guards to provide a ready-made Iranian network of 90,000 full-time forces, 300,000 reservists and a mobilization base of up to a million men that would dwarf the insurgency bedeviling American efforts in Iraq.
 Also of great interest in the military threat of these networks is that some of the most significant technologies once held in near-monopoly control by the American military are now available at L.L. Bean, Eddie Bauer and Sharper Image, among them high-quality night-vision goggles and global positioning devices.
 ''We are in a world today where we have a non-state actor using all the tools of weaponry,'' from drone aircraft to rockets to computer hacking, said P.W. Singer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in the impact of new technologies on national security. ''That's what this new 21st-century warfare is going to look like. We have now entered an era where non-states or quasi-states do a lot better militarily than states do.'' He added, ''I don't think we have answers yet for what to do.''
 The United States also has to take into account Hezbollah's global reach -- it is blamed for the attacks on Jewish and Israeli targets in Argentina in the 1990's, and its cells operate in Latin America, across the Middle East and in Southeast Asia, and it could attack American interests in any of those places.
 Critical to the American response, military officers and academic experts say, is that the United States acknowledge that its takes anetwork to fight a network. American intelligence agencies and the military proved it can fight this kind of war, as it did in Afghanistan to rout Al Qaeda, when intelligence officers and small groups of Army Special Forces worked with local fighters to call in devastating air strikes and drive the Taliban from power.
 Within the Bush adminstration and across the military, a clearer view is emerging out of the chaos in southern Lebanon. It is that nation-states know they cannot directly take on superpowers -- either regional or global -- without getting their clocks cleaned, and so they use proxies they train and support to take the fight to those superpowers. The fight against groups like Hezbollah requires a strategy for dealing with their sponsors. These networks, Hezbollah included, don't float around in the ether like free electrons bumping into each other. They alight. They attach themselves to territory. In Afghanistan it was with the full support of the Taliban. In Pakistan, it's an ungoverned space. In Lebanon, it's a state within a state. Cut off state support, or eliminate the ability of the networks to survive in ungoverned areas, and they collapse on themselves.
 No solution has been written. But it would include military force along with diplomacy, economic assistance, intelligence and information campaigns.
 ''Most critically, we have to get better at -- it's such a cliche -- winning hearts and minds,'' said a military officer working on counterinsurgency issues. ''That is influencing neutral populations toward supporting us and not supporting our terrorist and insurgent enemies.''

HEADLINE: Case Won On Appeal (To Public)

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
IN some ways, it was a modest decision. A year ago, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a city in Connecticut could use the power of eminent domain to make room for private development. The decision simply applied existing law and deferred to the judgments of local officials. 
 But the outcome was a revolt. 
The decision provoked outrage from Democrats and Republicans, liberals and libertarians, and everyone betwixt and between. Dozens of state legislatures considered bills to protect private property from government seizure, and many passed new legislation; Justice John Paul Stevens, the author of the decision, issued something like an apology; a campaign was started to use eminent domain to seize the home of another justice, David H. Souter; and, on Wednesday, a ruling from the Ohio Supreme Court adopted the analysis of the dissenters in last year's decision to reject an effort to oust the residents of a Cincinnati suburb.
 Sometimes, Supreme Court cases have a way of highlighting issues that had been absent from the national agenda, and the cases can provoke reactions that have a far greater impact than the ruling itself.
 ''I always tell my students,'' said Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Texas, ''that one of the best things you can do is lose a case in the Supreme Court.''
 Dana Berliner, a lawyer with the Institute for Justice, the libertarian legal group that represented the homeowners in both the Connecticut and Ohio cases, said the United States Supreme Court decision, Kelo v. New London, gave rise to ''a tidal wave of outrage.''
 ''The decision brought to light this incredible rift between what lawyers and cities thought was the law and what the American people thought was the law,'' Ms. Berliner said. ''This is certainly the situation of losing the battle and winning the war.'' 
 In many ways, then, the decision by the Supreme Court to hear a case can be as important as the ultimate ruling. ''The role of the courts in shaping public opinion is their ability to elevate issues on the public agenda,'' said Nathaniel Persily, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. 
 Issues like school prayer, flag burning, school desegregation, gay rights and abortion rights all gained prominence on the political landscape because of court decisions. The cases that tend to provoke the biggest popular reaction are those in which justices seem to be out of touch with ordinary people, said Michael J. Klarman, a law professor at the University of Virginia. 
 ''Almost all of the instances of backlash,'' Professor Klarman said, ''are conservative, populist reactions to decisions that seem elitist.''
 Kelo, which concerned, after all, the sanctity of the home, was a prime example. ''You got a very strong, visceral response,'' said Richard Epstein, a law professor at the University of Chicago, ''because this is something on which everyone is a constitutional expert.''
 Yet Kelo was in one sense a modest, rather than activist, decision; the majority did little more that say it hesitated to second-guess urban planning decisions. It did not endorse New London's actions but merely ruled that the Constitution did not forbid them, and it invited state courts and legislatures to fashion different rules. 
 ''It seems almost meek,'' Professor Klarman said. ''People who are critical of Kelo are people who want judicial activism. They are the same people who criticize judicial activism in abortion or same-sex marriage cases.''
 Some argue that the Kelo decision has provoked an overreaction. They point, for instance, to a California ballot initiative called the ''Protect Our Homes Act.'' Promoted as a reaction to Kelo, it would bar not only the condemnation of property for economic development but also require compensation for some regulations that affect property values.
 ''There is no doubt that Kelo has inspired a level of reaction that denies power that a rational community would like a city council to have,'' said Douglas W. Kmiec, a law professor at Pepperdine University who opposes Kelo but expresses doubts about the initiative.
 In most unpopular decisions, the Supreme Court typically has the last word, barring a constitutional amendment. But that was not true in Kelo, or in a few other cases. In 1986, for instance, the court held that the Air Force could bar officers from wearing skullcaps. The next year, Congress passed a law allowing members of the armed services to wear ''items of religious apparel'' so long as they are ''neat and conservative.''
 Similarly, in 1972, the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment did not protect reporters from grand jury subpoenas seeking their confidential sources. Partly as a result, legislatures and courts created shield laws in almost every state, though there remains little protection in most federal cases.
 Ms. Berliner, of the Institute for Justice, sounded practically giddy on Friday as she reflected on the year since Kelo. ''They won that particular case,'' she said of her adversaries, ''and they lost the entire country.''

HEADLINE: Grocer's Gone, Saying Rent's the Spoiler 

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, a letter was posted in the aisles of the Gristedes supermarket on 74th Street and Broadway. Written by John Catsimatidis, the chief executive of the Gristedes chain, the letter announced that after three years in business, the store would be closing. 
 High rent -- $2 million a year -- and rising energy costs had made it, Mr. Catsimatidis wrote, ''unfeasible to continue to operate a supermarket at this location.''
Before Gristedes, another supermarket, Food Emporium, had operated at the same location with similar results, leaving after only two years. ''We thought we were smarter,'' Mr. Catsimatidis said by phone. ''But the rent in this location was 20 percent of sales. The average rent in the rest of our stores is 6 or 7 percent of sales. I guess we got the three-year itch.'' 
 The Gristedes at 74th Street and Broadway, which was closing on Friday, was not a neighborhood institution in the style of Fairway Market or Zabar's. It was not even the only chain supermarket on the grocery-rich Upper West Side: a Food Emporium stands at 68th Street and Broadway, for example, and Gristedes still has a branch at 86th Street. It was your average New York supermarket, the kind that stocks six-packs of Coca-Cola, Kellogg's Corn Flakes, and cheap pots and pans.
 But Mr. Catsimatidis said this Gristedes was typical in another, worrisome way: its vulnerability to specialty grocers, rising rents and the seeming takeover of the city's prime commercial leases by banks and drugstores. 
 A Gristedes that stood for 40 years at the corner of 62nd Street and Second Avenue recently lost its lease to Chase Manhattan Bank. Other chains, too, have announced closings in Manhattan, like Western Beef, which is shuttering its branch on West 14th Street. 
 Jim Rogers of the Food Industry Alliance of New York State, a trade association, said banks could afford to pay higher rent than supermarkets and were viewed by landlords as cleaner businesses. 
 Mr. Catsimatidis, who contends that within the next decade half of the city's 60 or so supermarkets will be gone, said, ''The retail biz is so sensitive in New York.'' He suggested that the New York Economic Development Corporation offer incentives and tax rebates to supermarkets. Several phone calls to the agency seeking a comment on that suggestion were not immediately returned.
 Last week, at the 74th Street Gristedes, a worker disassembled the cash registers while groceries were packed into crates. The store was nearly empty of shoppers. 
 One shopper, Rosa Helfgot, said she stopped by to say goodbye to some of the workers. But she seemed as dejected about the lack of a going-out-of-business sale as she did about the closing; because Gristedes has 40 other branches in the city, the store's contents would simply be relocated. ''They're not reducing any prices at all,'' she said. STEVEN KURUTZ

HEADLINE: Another Small Step For Earth

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore. 

 BODY:
The best argument for ignoring global warming has been that there are better ways to spend money: instead of devoting billions to curb carbon emissions and reduce the impact on sea levels in 2050, we could spend the resources developing a vaccine for AIDS or providing universal health care to all Americans.
 In essence, the dangers of climate change appeared distant and uncertain, while the costs of curbing greenhouse gases were immediate and appeared substantial. 
But all across the country, states and local governments have chipped away at those arguments for delay -- actually, pretty much demolished them -- by showing that there are myriad small steps we can take that significantly curb carbon emissions and that are easily affordable. 
 A leader of that effort has been Portland, earnestly green even when it is wintry gray. In 1993, the city adopted a plan to curb greenhouse gases, and it is bearing remarkable fruit: local greenhouse gas emissions are back down to 1990 levels, while nationally they are up 16 percent. And instead of damaging its economy, Portland has boomed.
 This month Portland took an important additional step, by adopting a renewable-fuel standard. Beginning July 1, 2007, all diesel sold for vehicles in the city will have to be at least a 5 percent biodiesel blend. And all gasoline will have to contain at least 10 percent ethanol. This measure is not a magic bullet, but it has a negligible cost and is one more example of the creative thinking at local levels that is curbing greenhouse gases without breaking the bank.
 Portland joins several states -- Minnesota, Washington, Hawaii, Montana, Iowa, Louisiana and Missouri -- that have passed similar laws. 
 ''We aren't confused into thinking that we can change the world,'' said Randy Leonard, the city commissioner who sponsored the ordinance, which passed unanimously. ''We're just hoping that we can establish a template to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and promote economic development and reduce greenhouse gases. Then we can send a message.
 ''We get that we're an asterisk to the larger issue of oil dependence and global warming,'' he added. ''But we also think that there isn't an energy policy in the state or nation that makes sense, and here there is something we can do that does make sense.''
 The 5 percent biodiesel works in all diesel vehicles, without any loss of acceleration. The bio- component sometimes comes from discarded restaurant grease; vehicles using it smell faintly of French fries. 
 The benefit of the 10 percent ethanol requirement is less clear because U.S. ethanol sometimes takes nearly as much petroleum to make (in fuel to run tractors to harvest corn, for example) as it saves. But increasingly we'll probably be making ethanol from switch grass or sugar cane in ways that are more likely to save petroleum.
 Portland customers may end up paying slightly more for gas and diesel because of the new regulation, but city planners say that any increase will be minimal -- perhaps a penny or two per gallon. 
 ''This will reduce total emissions by 1 percent,'' said Michael Armstrong, a city environmental expert. ''It sounds tiny, but if you think that the Kyoto standard is a 7 percent reduction [below 1990 levels], and this one simple move would be 1 percent, then it seems more doable.''
 The city is also seeking to ensure that all city government units use power from wind or solar sources by 2010. Portland has changed streetlamps to use low-power bulbs, built bicycle trails to encourage commuting on bike or on foot, and greatly expanded mass transit.
 It's true that the risks of climate change are uncertain, but when encountering other kinds of dangers -- like Iran apparently trying to develop nuclear weapons -- we don't shrug and say there's no point in doing anything because of the uncertainties. The risks of warming are potentially enormous -- imagine much of the east coast under water -- and our obligation to protect our planet is not just technical but also moral.
 So it's time to abandon the old self-defeating notion that curbing greenhouse gases is too costly to be effective. Portland and other localities are showing that there's plenty we can do inexpensively, at least in the early phases -- if we don't mind rush-hour traffic smelling of French fries.
 I almost didn't write this column, because with the Middle East in flames it's obvious that climate change is not the most important topic of the day. But it could be the most important issue of this century.

HEADLINE: For Some Gays, a Right They Can Forsake

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
WHEN Bill Dobbs sees the heartwarming photographs of gay couples cuddling, grinning and holding dogs and children, accompanied by pious remarks about how many years they have been a couple -- ''five years,'' ''eight years,'' ''24 years!'' -- in news releases and newspaper and television reports about the fight for gay marriage, it turns his stomach. 
 Mr. Dobbs's reaction is, he admits, probably not that different from the one he imagines that the anti-gay forces feel. But Mr. Dobbs is gay, part of an intense strain of gay activists who have fought against the idea of gay marriage from the beginning and who think that the escalating pursuit of it is a mistake, especially in light of legal setbacks like the decision on Wednesday by the Washington Supreme Court that lawmakers may restrict marriage to a man and a woman. 
To these activists, the fight for gay marriage is the mirror image of the right-wing conservative Christian lobby for family values and feeds into the same drive for a homogeneous, orthodox American culture. The Stonewall confrontation and early gay rights movement, after all, was about the right to live an unconventional life, and to Mr. Dobbs and others like him, marriage is the epitome of convention. He said that he does, however, support civil unions for all as a replacement for civil marriage.
 ''For those of us who are single, there is this constant drumbeat,'' said Mr. Dobbs, who went to college during the last years of the Vietnam War and became a crusader for gay and antiwar causes. ''You must be coupled to be really fulfilled, for us to treat you as a full person.'' 
 For better or for worse, to be unattached and gay is not what it used to be. Gone are the guilt-free days of free love in the clubs, of hooking up at bathhouses and reveling in promiscuity, which Mr. Dobbs prefers to call ''sexual generosity.'' In are elaborate weddings, shared property, pets and children. 
 Mr. Dobbs said that even on Fire Island, where cohabitating with 12 other men was once a time-honored tradition, a friend who is an utterly bourgeois gay homeowner complains that he gets the gimlet eye from gay and lesbian parents because he is not in a relationship. Another friend scolded Mr. Dobbs that if he had never wanted to marry, there must be something wrong with him.
 But as the fight for same-sex marriage rages across the country -- this month being defeated in the highest court in New York State as well as Washington -- the anti-marriage gay men and lesbians say they are feeling emboldened to speak out against what they view as the hijacking of gay civil rights by a distressingly conservative, politically correct part of the gay establishment. They say the gay marriage movement, backed by major well-funded organizations like Lambda Legal, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, has drained resources and psychic energy from other causes like AIDS research, universal health insurance and poverty among gay people.
 The dissenters have been around since the early 1990's, when the idea of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage was introduced in Hawaii, especially among gays and lesbians who came out of the activist tradition of the 1960's, and in academic settings. But they say they have muffled their voices by censoring themselves.
 ''I think the discussion was foreclosed because nobody wanted to speak up against our brothers and sisters,'' who wanted marriage, said Jim Eigo, editor of two gay sex magazines, Playguy and Inches. ''These are people they've worked with, people they knew they would hurt.''
 But he and others in the opposition say they increasingly feel that they have nothing to lose given that ''there has been political defeat after political defeat'' for the gay marriage lobby, while Massachusetts remains the only state that has legalized same-sex marriage and voters in dozens of other states have passed ''defense of marriage'' acts.
 They question whether monogamy is normal. They wonder why gay men and lesbians are buying into an institution that they see as rooted in oppression. They worry that adapting to conventional ''family values'' will destroy the cohesion that has made gay men and lesbians a force to be reckoned with, politically and culturally. 
 In the 70's, many gay people saw themselves as ''an army of lovers,'' to borrow the title of a German documentary of the time, Mr. Eigo said. ''I still hold the candle for a gay community like that, in which every man is linked to every other by at least the potential of being his lover.'' 
 Opposition among gay people to same-sex marriage enrages and frustrates its defenders, like Evan Wolfson, a lawyer who was co-counsel in the Hawaii marriage case and is now the executive director of Freedom to Marry. 
 ''My organization is called 'Freedom to Marry' not 'Mandatory Marriage,' '' Mr. Wolfson said. ''Gay people in America can't really say they've rejected marriage in favor of something else, because for most of us it hasn't been offered.''
 He says that states like Vermont and California would not have adopted civil unions or domestic partnership rights if the pressure of marriage litigation had not raised awareness of the need for social validation of committed gay relationships.
 Yet dissenters like Sarah Schulman, a playwright, novelist and English professor at the City University of New York, College of Staten Island, see a more subtle form of regression coming out of the movement, a return to the values of the 1950's. As a teacher, she said, she sees a lot of younger gay people, especially women adopting the heterosexual fantasy that even Barbie has distanced herself from -- ''that someday they will meet the right person and they will get married and they will have children.'' She fears that lesbian mothers are embracing a ''poverty model'' and taking themselves out of the running to be the next George Sand or Emma Goldman.
 Some gay activists who are critical of the marriage movement also see it as part of the fallout from the AIDS epidemic, which quashed the sexually liberated lifestyle of gay men as they tried to fight the perception that they were promiscuous carriers of a plague by becoming more like everybody else. 
 And some see the insistence on defining homosexuality as strictly a matter of biology -- rather than a matter of choice and sensibility as well as biology -- as part of the same conformist impulse.
 Rob Klengler, a businessman in Marblemount, Wash., is troubled by the focus on what is normal in sex or domestic life. ''I don't know if I would use the term 'normal' or not,'' he said. ''To me, it's a simple choice. To me it's a choice like whether I eat red meat. I like chocolate versus vanilla ice cream. It's just a choice.'' 
 Other groups, while supporting gay marriage, are using the issue to push for legal recognition of other nontraditional relationships, like unmarried couples of all kinds. 
 Minutes after the Washington state court ruled on Wednesday, some 250 academics, celebrities, writers and others, including Gloria Steinem, Barbara Ehrenreich, Rabbi Michael Lerner of Tikkun magazine, Armistead Maupin, Terrence McNally, Holly Near and Cornel West, signed a manifesto called ''Beyond Same-Sex Marriage, A New Strategic Vision for All Our Families and Relationships.'' It calls for the legal rights and privileges of marriage to be extended to arrangements like extended families living under one roof, and close friends in long-term caregiving relationships.
 ''We hope to move beyondthe narrow confines of marriage politics as they exist in the United States today,'' reads the document, which was organized and written by academics and activists including Joseph DeFilippis, executive director of Queers for Economic Justice. 
 Then there are those gay men who find themselves embracing marriage in spite of their iconoclastic temperament. Florent Morellet, the French-born owner of Restaurant Florent in the once-raunchy meatpacking district of Manhattan, had a commitment ceremony in 1988 with his partner, Daniel Platten. Mr. Platten died in 1994 and Mr. Morellet says he is at a stage in his life when he is looking for a monogamous relationship.
 Yet, influenced by French attitudes toward erotic life, he does not subscribe to the American ideal of marriage as a narrowing of sexual opportunity. ''In France, which is nominally a Catholic country, adultery is actually an equal opportunity,'' he says. ''Women have almost as much adultery relationships as men.''

HEADLINE: Heroes of the Hudson Valley

BYLINE: By John Thorn. 
John Thorn, the editor of ''Total Baseball,'' writes often about the Hudson Valley for The Woodstock Times.

DATELINE: Kingston, N.Y. 

 BODY:
WHO today knows much about Washington Irving beyond ''Rip Van Winkle'' and ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow?'' Or Samuel Morse, besides that dot-dash thing? Or anything at all about Andrew Jackson Downing, Calvert Vaux, Thomas Cole and Frederic Church, who opened our eyes to the beauty of the American wilderness and pioneered the preservation movement? Here in the Hudson Valley, the cradle of our national culture with its storied past, ghosts are everyday neighbors, yet they swirl about unseen, unmarked, unemployed and homeless. 
 What they, and we, need is a Hudson River Hall of Fame. Such an institution would make the past come alive for young people who think history happened somewhere else and for adults, many of them transplants to the region, who have not yet attained a sense of place and belonging. Why lament that today's junior-high students (and their parents) can't find Uzbekistan on a map? How about Lyndhurst or Locust Grove? 
I can hear you sighing already. Don't we have enough provincial museums, of little interest even to their directors and docents? Undoubtedly; but in an age dominated by celebrities, a hall of fame forms a more effective educational and inspirational destination than a museum, focusing as it does on individuals rather than chronological periods, movements or events. 
 And don't we have enough halls of fame, what with shrines for baseball, basketball and football, not to mention those for policemen, businessmen and clowns? The best of the modern halls have done the public a service in following baseball's model, effectively honoring its past, highlighting its heroes, displaying its artifacts and stimulating research. But in the frenzy to honor subsets ever more narrowly occupational or recreational, laurels have descended from the heroic to the merely accomplished or, well, nice. 
 The nation's first pantheon was not the baseball institution in Cooperstown, which opened its doors in 1939, but the Hall of Fame for Great Americans, dedicated in 1901 in the Bronx and still limping along today. In its early years this brainchild of Henry Mitchell MacCracken, New York University's chancellor, was a sensation, engaging the public and the press in spirited debate about who merited inclusion. Its mission was clear: to honor the very best from a variety of fields -- from authors and educators to inventors and explorers -- and by their example to inspire the rest of us. 
 A Hudson River Hall of Fame would aim to provide the best of both models: the specificity and educational thrust of the Baseball Hall of Fame with the sweeping vision of the Hall of Fame for Great Americans. Artists and architects, military and political figures, founders and rebels -- individuals who won renown on a national scale in substantial measure through their regional accomplishments -- would be honored. 
 Who would get in? Oh, let's throw out a few names: besides Church, Cole, Downing, Irving, Morse and Vaux, there's also George Clinton, Alexander Jackson Davis, Robert Fulton, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, Pete Seeger, Sojourner Truth, John Vanderlyn and George Washington. The annual nomination and election process is bound to get the public's attention. 
 The organization could create its own initially skeletal management team, but its directors would be wise to tap into the ready audience of the public schools and the knowledge base of local historical societies. The hall would bring regional and national attention to a host city and county, and it would extend the educational and community development efforts of the Hudson Valley's existing museums, libraries and historical societies.
 The hall of fame would offer memorials; permanent, rotating, and circulating exhibits; interactive kiosks that would link with local and national libraries and museums; and an educational Web site. 
 The Hudson River Hall of Fame would obviously have to be in one of the 10 counties defined as the Hudson River National Heritage Area. The community that wants to play host to the hall must be able to demonstrate its enthusiasm with contributions in cash or in kind. 
 My personal nominee for siting would be Springside, the former Matthew Vassar estate in Poughkeepsie now characterized by crumbling ruins amid a romantic landscape designed by Downing and Vaux. Yes, I know it is a National Historic Landmark and there are obstacles, but aren't there always? And a Hudson River Hall of Fame that pays tribute to the remarkable people who have played an important role in our national story as well as in this region is, in my mind, worth every effort.

HEADLINE: Portraits in the Grand Style, Just a Little Skewed 

BYLINE: By BEN GENOCCHIO

 BODY:
Old LymeIt is a very strange painting. An innocent-looking little boy with manly features wears a night slip and shoes and stands in an abbreviated landscape, holding a bird on a string. Late afternoon light bathes the surrounding hillside, which is strangely low and wildly out of scale -- the young boy towers over trees and dwarfs distant mountains. He looks like a giant. 
 John Brewster Jr. (1766-1854) painted ''Francis O. Watts With Bird'' in Kennebunk, Me., for a wealthy couple in 1805. It is typical of the portraits he was commissioned to paint across New England in the closing decade of the 18th century and early years of the 19th. 
Almost 40 of those portraits are featured in ''A Deaf Artist in Early America: The Worlds of John Brewster Jr.,'' a new exhibition at the Florence Griswold Museum.
 Traveling from the Fenimore Art Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y., the exhibition fascinates and confounds. Brewster was one of America's most prolific early professional portrait painters, and, seen together, his works add up to a revealing -- if not always flattering -- assessment of his abilities. 
 Brewster was born deaf into a prominent family in rural Hampton, Conn., where a kindly minister taught him to paint. By the late 1790's, he was working as an itinerant portrait painter, often benefiting from his family connections as he traveled throughout New England in search of commissions among the wealthy merchant class that arose after the Revolutionary War.
 The exhibition is arranged more or less chronologically, starting with some early, somewhat stiff portraits of prominent New England businessmen, their wives and children -- usually shown in full-length poses. 
 In keeping with portrait conventions of the time, the figures were often surrounded by symbols of prosperity and refinement, like books, writing implements or even cultivated land.
 Brewster's early, large-format portraits are influenced by the work of the Connecticut artist Ralph Earl (1751-1801), another itinerant painter. In the exhibition catalog, Paul D'Ambrosio, the show's curator, notes correspondences in the scale, costumes, composition and setting of Brewster's early works and the portraits by Earl, who was in turn influenced by the English ''Grand Manner'' style of painting.
 Broadly speaking, the term ''Grand Manner'' refers to a bombastic, highly rhetorical style of English portrait painting in the 18th century characterized by regal poses, opulent decoration and the use of visual metaphors. Think of paintings by Sir Thomas Gainsborough or Sir Joshua Reynolds. Earl, and through him Brewster, were among the first Americans to refashion this lofty style of painting for more casual American sitters and humble New World subject matter.
 One of the more touching and polished of Brewster's full-length portraits depicts the artist's parents, Dr. John Brewster and Ruth Avery Brewster. They are shown at home in conventional poses -- she sits behind her husband, reading while he is writing. She stares directly at the viewer, though softly, even submissively, while her husband stares off into the distance as if locked in some deep thought. Their dress is refined but not opulent, their house modestly furnished.
 Everything about the painting accurately reflects the propriety, learning and status of the sitters. In the exhibition catalog, we learn that Dr. Brewster, the artist's father, was one of New England's elite. He was descended from William Brewster, the puritan leader, and was active in the local church. He was educated as a doctor and was also a deputy to the General Assembly of Connecticut.
 In the early 1800's, Brewster developed a format of half-length portraits, which took less work, were probably more economical for his patrons and were better suited to his limited abilities.
 In his paintings, Brewster always struggled with the illusion of a realistic relationship between figures and background, and the half-length portraits allowed him to avoid this problem and focus on the sitter's face.
 More than a dozen of these half-length portraits fill the second room of the exhibition, covering a period from around 1805 to 1817. They are competent but largely generic, the artist often reusing poses, costumes and settings from one picture to the next. Some of the paintings are almost identical (even the clothes and furniture are the same), with only different heads on the figures to set them apart.
 It was also around 1805 that the artist developed a signature style of painting full-length portraits of children, often dressed in night clothes or skimpy garments and with soft downlike hair and big dreamy eyes. They are sweetly appealing. They are also often quite strange, for the artist's old problems with perspective resurface, resulting in pictures in which the figures are oddly out of scale. 
 In addition to ''Francis O. Watts With Bird,'' other such images here include ''One Shoe Off'' (1807), ''Betsey Avery Brewster'' (1800), ''Sophia Brewster'' (circa 1800), ''William Temple Cutts'' (1807) and ''Elizabeth Abigail Wallingsford'' (1808). These paintings are the exhibition's highlight, for in them we can discern a powerful sense of rapport with the subjects that is often lacking in his portraits of adults. Perhaps being deaf and mute, Brewster felt more comfortable around children.
 From 1817 to 1820, Brewster gave up professional painting to attend the Connecticut Asylum in Hartford, the nation's first school for the deaf. There he learned the newly developed sign language brought to America from France, where Abbe Sicard was advocating its use for teaching the deaf. Brewster was 51 years old, making him by far the oldest pupil in the school. When he returned to his itinerant painting life, he appears to have taken more care when painting the faces of his subjects, resulting in portraits that show an increased sensitivity to the character of his sitters. 
 The exhibition includes paintings up to the early 1830's; after that, little of Brewster's work is known. He basically disappeared from recorded history, according to his biographer, Harlan Lane -- leaving behind a fascinating visual record of New England's elite and emerging merchant class.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 6, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An art review last Sunday of ''A Deaf Artist in Early America: The Worlds of John Brewster Jr.,'' incorrectly referred to the subjects in one of the paintings. They are the artist's father and stepmother, not his father and mother.
