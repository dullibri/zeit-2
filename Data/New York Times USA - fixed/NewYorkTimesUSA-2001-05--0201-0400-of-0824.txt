HEADLINE: Race by the Numbers 

BYLINE:  By Orlando Patterson; Orlando Patterson is a professor of sociology at Harvard and the author of "Rituals of Blood," the second volume of a trilogy on race relations.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
In recent weeks, reporting and commentary that misinterpret early census results have been persistently misinforming the nation about its ethnic and racial composition. The misinformation is dangerous, since it fuels fears of decline and displacement among some whites, anxieties that are not only divisive but groundless. The Center for Immigration Studies, for example, a think tank in Washington, recently warned that by the middle of the century non-Hispanic whites will cease to be a majority and that "each group in the new minority-majority country has longstanding grievances against whites."
 Many articles have echoed the view that whites are fast becoming a minority in many areas of the country, largely because of the growth of the Hispanic population. The New York Times reported that 71 of the top 100 cities had lost white residents and made clear only in the third paragraph of the article that it is really "non-Hispanic whites" who are now a minority in these cities. Similarly, The Miami Herald reported that 20 cities and unincorporated communities in Miami-Dade county "went from majority to minority white, non-Hispanic." Left without commentary was the fact that the total white population -- including Hispanic whites -- of Miami, for example, is actually a shade under 70 percent. 
 These articles and too many others have failed to take account of the fact that nearly half of the Hispanic population is white in every social sense of this term; 48 percent of so-called Hispanics classified themselves as solely white, giving only one race to the census taker. Although all reports routinely note that "Hispanics can be of any race," they almost always go on to neglect this critical fact, treating Hispanics as if they were, in fact, a sociological race comparable to "whites" and "blacks."
In any case, the suggestion that the white population of America is fast on the way to becoming a minority is a gross distortion. Even if we view only the non-Hispanic white population, whites remain a robust 69.1 percent of the total population of the nation. If we include Hispanic whites, as we should, whites constitute 75.14 percent of the total population, down by only 5 percent from the 1990 census. And this does not take account of the 6.8 million people who identified in the census with "two or more races," 80 percent of whom listed white as one of these races.
Even with the most liberal of assumptions, there is no possibility that whites will become a minority in this nation in this century. The most recent census projections indicate that whites will constitute 74.8 percent of the total population in 2050, and that non-Hispanic whites will still be 52.8 percent of the total. And when we make certain realistic sociological assumptions about which groups the future progeny of Hispanic whites, mixed couples and descendants of people now acknowledging two or more races are likely to identify with, there is every reason to believe that the non-Hispanic white population will remain a substantial majority -- and possibly even grow as a portion of the population. 
Recent studies indicate that second-generation Hispanic whites are intermarrying and assimilating mainstream language and cultural patterns at a faster rate than second generation European migrants of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 
The misleading reports of white proportional decline are likely not only to sustain the racist fears of white supremacist groups but also to affect the views of ordinary white, nonextremist Americans. A false assumption that whites are becoming a minority in the nation their ancestors conquered and developed may be adding to the deep resentment of poor or struggling whites toward affirmative action and other policies aimed at righting the wrongs of discrimination. 
How do we account for this persistent pattern of misinformation? Apart from the intellectually lazy journalistic tendency to overemphasize race, two influences are playing into the discussion.
One is the policy of the Census Bureau itself. Though on the one hand, the census has taken the progressive step of allowing citizens to classify themselves in as many racial ways as they wish, breaking up the traditional notion of races as immutable categories, on the other hand it is up to its age-old mischief of making and unmaking racial groups. As it makes a new social category out of the sociologically meaningless collection of peoples from Latin America and Spain, it is quietly abetting the process of demoting and removing white Hispanics from the "true" white race -- native-born non-Hispanic whites.
There is a long history of such reclassification by federal agencies. In the early decades of the 20th century, the Irish, Italians and Jews were classified as separate races by the federal immigration office, and the practice was discontinued only after long and vehement protests from Jewish leaders. In 1930 Mexicans were classified as a separate race by the Census Bureau -- which reclassified them as white in 1940, after protests. Between then and the 1960's, people from Latin America were routinely classified as whites; then, when vast numbers of poor immigrants began coming from Latin America, the Hispanic category emerged.
The first stage of racial classification, now nearly successfully completed for Hispanics, is naming and nailing them all together while disingenuously admitting that they can be "of any race." Next, the repeated naming and sociological classification of different groups under a single category inevitably leads to the gradual perception and reconstruction of the group as another race. Much the same process of racialization is taking place with that other enormous sociological non-group, Asian-Americans.
The other influence on perceptions of who is "white" originates among the so-called Hispanics. For political and economic reasons, including the benefits of affirmative action programs, the leadership of many Hispanic groups pursues a liberal, coalition-based agenda with African-Americans and presses hard for a separate, unified Latino classification. This strategy is highly influential even though nearly half of Hispanics consider themselves white.
For African-Americans, the nation's major disadvantaged minority, these tendencies are problematic, although African-American leaders are too shortsighted to notice. Latino coalition strategies, by vastly increasing the number of people entitled to affirmative action, have been a major factor in the loss of political support for it. And any fear of a "white" group that it might lose status tends to reinforce stigmatization of those Americans who will never be "white."
In this volatile transitional situation, where the best and worst are equally possible in our racial relations and attitudes, the very worst thing that journalists, analysts and commentators can do is to misinform the white majority that it is losing its majority status -- something that recent surveys indicate it is already all too inclined to believe. We should stop obsessing on race in interpreting the census results. But if we must compulsively racialize the data, let's at least keep the facts straight and the interpretations honest.

Treasuries Edge Up on Rate Talk

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasuries edged higher yesterday as traders followed through on buying that began last week after a drop in payrolls and a rise in unemployment reinforced hopes for a half-point Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week.
 Two Treasury auctions this week -- $13 billion in new five-year notes today and $9 billion in 10-year notes tomorrow -- were expected to keep any gains subdued in those maturities as dealers prepared to absorb the new debt. 
 In trading yesterday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 2/32 , to 98 18/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.19 percent from 5.20 percent. The 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/32 , to 95 25/32 . Its yield was unchanged at 5.67 percent. 
Late last week, shorter-dated Treasury debt outperformed longer-dated issues, partly on the view that Fed rate cuts would help the economy recover by the end of the year.
While Treasuries were likely to benefit from further signs of weakness in the economy, traders said the market was unlikely to vault higher as it did in April when stocks fell sharply and investor confidence soured.
"The mood in the markets is clearly much more cheerful now than in mid-April," said Ian Shepherdson, economist at High Frequency Economics, in a research note to clients. "We think there is still plenty of weak data to come; there will likely be another big drop in employment in May, and we still think the economy could shrink in the second quarter. But investors already seem willing, if not positively keen, to look to the far horizon instead."

Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Bump in Hanoi's Capitalist Road: Jockeying in U.S. Congress 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam 

 BODY:
It looked like a done deal. A quarter of a century after the war, Vietnam and the United States were on the verge of an agreement that would close the circle -- a wide-ranging trade pact that would put them side by side on a path toward open and equal relations.
 Signed last July after four years of hard lobbying and gentle persuasion by Washington, the highly detailed agreement amounts to confirmation of Vietnam as a member of the global world that it had feared and resisted in the years after the war ended in 1975. 
 "It is the most important thing to happen since the end of the war, and it's really the basis for building a new relationship between the United States and Vietnam," said Virginia B. Foote, who heads the United States-Vietnam Trade Council, a Washington lobbying group. 
But now, just at the moment when it was to be approved by Congress, the agreement has stalled in Washington, apparently a victim of Vietnam's receding importance for the United States.
The agreement is still broadly supported in Congress and is far from dead. 
But its passage is imperiled by plans to include it in an omnibus trade package being prepared by the new administration that could take months or years to approve.
American officials who had made it the centerpiece of their policy here are mortified. Vietnamese are asking vexing questions about the reliability of Washington as a partner and the value of its promises.
"I'm being bombarded with their concerns," said Ambassador Pete Peterson, who came to Vietnam after diplomatic relations were restored in 1995, the first United States envoy here since the war.
The concerns are shared by American business executives in Vietnam who have been marking time, waiting for the gates to trade and investment to be opened fully.
"None of us ever in our wildest dreams imagined that we would be in this place at this time, that the United States side would be slowing down the agreement that everyone worked so hard to accomplish," said Greig Craft, an American consultant and entrepreneur who has ridden the ups and downs of business relations here during the last decade. "Vietnam has faithfully fulfilled its commitments to us but critics have kept raising the bar. The fact of the matter is that Vietnam went ahead and hung in there and did everything we asked them to do."
Once again, the bar seems to have risen higher.
The broad trade package being put together by the United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, would bundle the Vietnam agreement with several more difficult trade measures.
That would open the way to debate and opposition from lawmakers who want to include environmental and labor issues in any such deals, and from interest groups concerned about religious freedom.
The Vietnam agreement is signed, sealed and packaged, ready for quick passage. If, as part of an omnibus, it is opened for amendment, it would have to be renegotiated with Hanoi, a significant delay in putting it into operation.
More talks would set back not just economic ties but also the development of postwar relations between Vietnam and the United States, Mr. Peterson said in an interview. 
"It's an agreement on trade, certainly, but it is, for this country and ours, much more than that," he said. "It is a normalization agreement. It is the completion of the circle of the process, of which economics is the missing link. A great deal has been placed in the hands of that document relative to whether our two countries are going to hold hands or hold each other at arm's length. It is a very important document in stating that our two nations want to have relations, not only on trade."
The agreement is an unusually detailed blueprint for opening Vietnam's economy, in return for the unfettered access to the United States economy that is enjoyed by most other nations.
"It is the most comprehensive trade agreement ever negotiated," said Ms. Foote, of the trade council, "including chapters on investment, on intellectual property rights, on trade and services, banking, accounting, insurance, legal -- you name it. It is basically a road map for economic reform for Vietnam, touching on pretty much every aspect of their economy."
Tom Vallely, an expert on the Vietnamese economy at Harvard, said he believes that Congress understands how important it is and will in the end vote separately to pass the bill.
"Vietnam must find a way to integrate itself into the world economy," he said, "and the trade agreement is essential to support the reforms that are now taking place in Vietnam. We would be abandoning what we've been trying to do for a decade of engagement with Vietnam, and I don't think the administration wants to do that."
If the package is not passed soon, he said, Vietnam would look elsewhere -- to Japan, to Europe, even to a resurgent China -- for its trading partners. But these would not substitute for the United States, the world's largest market.
Economic reforms would be set back by slowing development of the private enterprise that is essential if Vietnam is to phase out the unproductive state-owned enterprises that sap its economy, he added. 
"If it can't get a trade agreement, Vietnam can't use the investment potential it has to join the world economy," Mr. Vallely said. "It could drive Vietnam closer to China."
In official statements, the Vietnamese have begun to voice their exasperation, with the minister of trade, Vu Khoan, warning that Vietnam might revoke special privileges that had been extended to American businesses pending ratification of the agreement.
Responding to religious and human rights organizations in Washington that have begun lobbying against the agreement, the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan said, "This is a ridiculous and unwarranted action, which can only upset relations between Vietnam and the United States."
Americans who work in Vietnam sound almost as aggrieved.
"The point here," said Fred Burke, an American lawyer who has been in Vietnam for a decade, "is that having built up all this trust, we risk losing it all by saying, 'O.K., Vietnam is giving us all we asked for, but we are still not going to do what we told them we were going to do because there are other issues we want to resolve first.' "

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Financial Shares Decline, Leading the Market Lower

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, led by financial shares, after an analyst for Prudential Securities recommended selling J. P. Morgan Chase because the slowing economy might increase bad loans and cut profits.
 Citigroup, American Express, Siebel Systems and Veritas Software also declined as investors unloaded stocks that had gained in the last month. 
 "We're seeing a selloff in the groups that have done well" since stocks' year-to-date low April 4, said Andy Damm, manager of the $1.2 billion BlackRock Large Cap Growth Equity fund in Wilmington, Del. "From time to time you give up a little of what you've got." 
The Nasdaq composite index lost 17.96 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,173.57. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.10 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,263.51. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 16.07 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,935.17.
Stocks bounced between gains and losses through most of the session as some investors tried to extend Friday's rally. The major indexes turned lower for good in the final 30 minutes of trading.
Some investors said they were waiting to see what Cisco Systems says about profits in coming quarters when it reports fiscal third-quarter results tomorrow after exchanges close. "We're not trading anything today," said Jon Brorson, who helps manage $350 billion at the Northern Trust Corporation in Chicago. "You've got the big kahuna tomorrow with Cisco. They're going to meet the dismal expectations they've set, but we want to know what they're going to say."
Cisco lost 39 cents, to $19.25.
J. P. Morgan Chase fell $1.40, to $49.20, after the Prudential analyst, Michael Mayo, who gained recognition in 1999 for correctly taking a bearish stance on bank stocks when others remained bullish, cut his rating to "sell" from "hold."
The company is likely to earn less than current estimates as a slower economy causes problem loans to grow, Mr. Mayo said in a note to clients. It may also take longer than expected to see the benefits of combining J. P. Morgan and Chase Manhattan.
Citigroup declined 13 cents, to $50.65; American Express fell 62 cents, to $43.23; FleetBoston Financial lost 48 cents, to $39.92; and KeyCorp declined 41 cents, to $23.69.
Siebel Systems, which had doubled from April 4 to Friday, dropped $3.80, to $44.10. Veritas, which had surged 82 percent, fell $4.68 to $67.31. 
Nova rose $5.53, to $29.05, after the credit card payment processor agreed to be acquired by U.S. Bancorp, the No. 8 bank, for $2.1 billion. U.S. Bancorp fell $1.44, to $21.24.
BancWest gained $9.33, to $34.31, after BNP Paribas, France's biggest bank, said it would buy the 55 percent of BancWest it did not already own for $2.45 billion in cash to further develop its retail banking business. The transaction values the company at $35 a share, a 40 percent premium to BancWest's close on Friday.
Ultramar Diamond Shamrock rose $7.79, to $50.50. Valero Energy, the second-largest United States refiner that does not also explore for oil, agreed to buy the company for $6 billion in cash, stock and assumed debt. Valero declined $2.77, to $42.70.
Barrett Resources climbed $2.85, to $70.15, after the Williams Companies agreed to buy the natural gas producer for $2.8 billion in cash, stock and assumed debt. That values Barrett at $73 a share, topping Royal Dutch/Shell Group's sweetened cash bid of $60 a share, which Barrett had rejected as inadequate. Williams fell $2.39, to $39.28.
Guidant rose $3.25, to $36.25, after the Food and Drug Administration said earlier statements by the agency that the company might have violated the law were improper.
Guidant, a maker of medical devices, fell 13 percent Friday after an F.D.A. spokeswoman said its claims in a press release detailing clinical study results of a new implantable heart defibrillator might have been too expansive.
FedEx declined $1, to $40.28. The overnight-delivery company said profit in the fiscal fourth and first quarters would disappoint investors because customers were shipping fewer packages.

PERSON: Aage B. Sorensen 

HEADLINE: Aage Sorensen, 59, Inequality Theorist at Harvard 

BYLINE:  By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Aage B. Sorensen, a Danish-born Harvard sociologist who played an important role in developing new sociological theories of inequality, died on April 18 in Boston He was 59. 
 He had been in bad health since falling on the ice near his home in Cambridge, Mass., in February last year, his family said. 
 Dr. Sorensen's main contribution involved theories of how social and economic inequality reflects the unequal distribution of opportunities and social resources. His work offered a sociological alternative to some economic theories that see inequality as a result of differences in training and education. 
Instead, he argued that the benefits of education and training depended on whether jobs were available on a freely competitive basis or whether access to them was restricted in various ways. Persistent inequalities, he argued, occur when individuals and groups are able to limit access to jobs, education and other opportunities.
Dr. Sorensen thought that changes in society also helped explain its inequalities, with managers and owners of businesses capturing income at the expense of workers. Declining union power was part of the explanation, in his view, as was the growing pressure from shareholders for better returns on their investments.
But Dr. Sorensen also believed that the ample supply of skilled and unskilled labor, the rigid structure of some labor markets and changing social norms helped explain wage differences between different classes of workers, with those at the bottom faring the worst. "People are treated like sacks of potatoes now," he sometimes said.
Born May 13, 1941, in Silkeborg, Denmark, Dr. Sorensen earned a master's degree in sociology at the University of Copenhagen and a doctorate from Johns Hopkins University. He headed the sociology department at the University of Wisconsin from 1979 to 1982. In 1984, he moved to Harvard, where he led the sociology department until 1992.
Dr. Sorensen, the author of more than 100 journal articles, leaves a wife, Annemette, and a son, Jesper.

HEADLINE: FedEx Warns a Second Time on This Quarter's Profit 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Citing the slowing economy, the FedEx Corporation said yesterday that the volume of its overnight deliveries had decreased more sharply than it had expected and that its quarterly income would decline significantly.
 It was the company's second warning of lower-than-expected earnings for the quarter, and some analysts expressed surprise at the severity of the discrepancy between the previous prediction and the new one. But far more cautious statements by FedEx's rivals and an abundance of indications that the economy has been slowing provided some warning that the company's goals were unrealistic, some analysts said. Shares of FedEx fell $1, or 2.5 percent, to $40.28 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 The daily volume of packages sent by the company's FedEx Express service fell 9 percent in April, about twice the rate of decline the company reported for March, after initially predicting a decline of 1 percent to 2 percent during the current quarter.
Analysts generally agreed with the company's assessment that the slowing economy had frozen the shipping industry, but some suggested that FedEx had relied too heavily on a corporate need for immediacy, which has receded with the economic boom.
"Deteriorating economic conditions and the rapid decline in the high-tech and other durable goods industries have increasingly affected FedEx Express volumes," Alan B. Graf Jr., the chief financial officer, said in a statement.
FedEx projected its earnings for the quarter ending May 31, its fourth, would fall to 50 to 60 cents a share, compared with 85 cents a share in the quarter a year earlier. The already lowered estimate of analysts was an average of 69 cents a share in the latest quarter, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
The company said it also expected a weakened performance in its next fiscal year, which begins on June 1. Earnings for its first fiscal quarter will fall significantly below the 58 cents a share that FedEx reported in the period a year earlier, the company said.
On March 21, when FedEx reported third-quarter earnings of $109 million, or 37 cents a share, on revenue of $4.8 billion, the company said it would be able to offset the decline it expected in overnight deliveries with growth in its ground package service. The next day, United Parcel Service, the company's chief competitor, warned that its own earnings would be down slightly for its first quarter, which ended March 31, and either flat or down as much as 8.3 percent for its second quarter.
FedEx seemed more confident than U.P.S. even though its main business, rush jobs, is more sensitive to fluctuations in the economy.
Helane Becker, an analyst for Buckingham Research Group, said she reduced her earnings estimate for FedEx's fourth quarter to 50 cents a share a month ago, when company officials said the slowdown in shipping resembled a trend they had last seen in the 1991 recession.
"There are a lot of people out there who think that the economy's going to pick up in the second half of the year," Ms. Becker said. "I'm not convinced."
But she said that because of its efforts to cut costs, FedEx seemed poised for growth whenever the economy does improve. Both FedEx and U.P.S. are siphoning market share from Airborne Express, a unit of Airborne Inc., she said. And FedEx and U.P.S. each announced that price increases would be enacted this year; FedEx's were somewhat sharper.
To some extent, the express companies are constricted from making up the declines in volume by raising prices because much of their business comes from long-term corporate contracts. Instead, they have added fuel surcharges.
FedEx has repeatedly told analysts that its customers ship all sorts of things in its white, purple and orange envelopes on its purple and white airplanes. "I really can't imagine how many semiconductors are really being FedExed around," said Peter V. Coleman, analyst for Banc of America Securities.
Whether it was mostly just documents or also computer chips, teddy bears and toothbrushes that companies have been shuttling to one another overnight during the economy's boom, the demand for shipping, especially the most rapid shipping, has slowed.
"The freight markets, in general, have been saying the economy's weak for a while," said Robert E. Schulz, a debt analyst at Standard & Poor's. The drop in volume could hurt FedEx's ability to raise cash, which is important for its expansion through acquisitions into other shipping businesses, he said.
"They have to figure out a way to jump-start the Express or figure out how to diversify away from that," Mr. Coleman said. "They may have waited too long to fully diversify themselves."

HEADLINE: Home Builder Misses Quarterly Estimates 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: ELKHART, Ind., May 7 

 BODY:
Coachmen Industries, a manufacturer of recreational vehicles and the nation's largest builder of modular homes, reported a first-quarter loss today that was larger than expected, but said it expected improvement in the economy to bolster results for the rest of 2001.
 Coachmen reported a loss for the three months ended March 31 of $4.9 million, or 31 cents a share. 
In the period a year earlier, the company posted a profit of $4 million, or 26 cents a share. 
 First-quarter sales fell to $154.8 million from $202.5 million last year. Analysts expected Coachmen to lose 23 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
The company warned in early March that it would report a loss, citing an expected 17.9 percent decline in industry shipments of motor homes and a 9.4 percent fall in industry shipments of towable recreational vehicles.
Coachmen said its recreational vehicle business was hurt by the slowing economy, while its modular housing operations were hurt by unusually hard winter weather.
Results for the balance of the year are expected to benefit from cost-cutting, including job cuts, and lower interest rates, the company said.
Shares of Coachmen lost 4 cents, to $10.81.

HEADLINE: Decrease in Chronic Illness Bodes Well for Medicare Costs 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
The chances that elderly Americans will be devastated by chronic disabilities like stroke and dementia have declined sharply, the National Academy of Sciences said yesterday. If the trend continues, researchers said, spending on Medicare could actually stop increasing.
 The number of older people who become severely disabled has been declining gradually for more than a decade, but the decline became much sharper at the end of the 1990's, according to the new study, which looked at a sample 19,000 Americans, age 65 and older. 
 Scientists at the National Institute on Aging, which sponsored the study, said the decline probably resulted from a variety of factors, including more widespread knowledge of the benefits of diet and exercise, fewer people smoking, new drugs for heart problems and other illnesses, and advances in eye surgery. Advances in prescription drugs and medical technology have also contributed to the the decline. 
Some economists questioned whether the trends would continue in the long run and whether the high cost of dying would simply be postponed, but not reduced.
The study's principal author, Kenneth G. Manton, director of the Center for Demographic Studies at Duke University, said recent research showed that costs in the final two years of life were lower for people who lived longer. "The older you are when you die, the less expensive the last two years are," he said. 
Dr. Manton and XiLiang Gu of Duke reported their findings in the May 8 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
The implications for Medicare planning will be explored on Thursday at a Senate Labor Committee hearing on the economics of medical advances. 
"The new study emphasizes the importance of focusing on improving the health of the elderly rather than enacting destructive cuts in the Medicare program," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the committee.
"Healthier senior citizens need less medical services and that's good for the elderly and good for Medicare," Mr. Kennedy added. 
The health improvements among the elderly are also reflected in nursing home statistics, the Duke researchers said. Over the past decade, the number of nursing home residents declined by 200,000, indicating a savings of billions of dollars in payments to nursing homes, even though the number of so-called old-old people, those 85 and older, was rising rapidly.
Savings on medical costs would also benefit those private employers that pay for part of the health care of retirees. It is not clear how many healthy retirees are doing part-time work or volunteering.
The Duke researchers have looked at the records of 19,000 elderly Medicare beneficiaries each year since 1982, a total of 43,000 people as some died and were replaced in the study. Until 1994, the number who were struck by a chronic disability was declining by 1.6 percent each year. The decline was steeper, reaching 2.6 percent in the latest five years in the study, from 1994 to 1999. 
Dr. Manton said that even if the lower, 1.6 percent rate of decrease in disability continued, "the demand for Medicare services would be fairly static" despite the surging numbers of aging baby boomers.
"The government's projections of Medicare costs are too high because there is no adequate adjustment for changes in the statistical distribution of health status and disability," he said. 
The rate of decline accelerated even faster for black Americans, although they had a higher proportion of disabilities to start with. Their disability rates were increasing in the 1980's. That changed to a decline of 4.7 percent from 1989 to 1994 and a drop exceeding 5 percent from 1994 to 1999.
In 1982, 7.1 million, or about 26 percent, of the 26.9 million elderly were disabled as measured by being unable to perform such daily activities as eating, bathing and getting dressed. By 1994, the number was 7.5 million, even as the elderly population increased to 33.1 million. But by 1999, the total had dropped to seven million, or 19.7 percent, despite the overall growth to 35.3 million of the population over age 65.
"The numbers are really astounding," said Dr. Richard Suzman, an associate director of the National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health.
If the prevalence of chronic disabilities had not changed, the number of elderly people affected would have been 2.2 million higher, he said.
"The lesson is that we have increasing control over how we age, replacing the fatalism of 15 years ago when there was no vision of cures or even prevention" of chronic geriatric illnesses, Dr. Suzman said. 
Robert W. Fogel, a Nobel prize winner in economics at the University of Chicago, said the proportion of people "who ever get chronic diseases is becoming smaller, and for those who do, the severity is not as great as it used to be." 
For example, the proportion of the elderly population with severe forms of Alzheimer's disease or other dementia who were unable to take simple tests declined, Dr. Manton said. The survey did not measure the total number of Alzheimer's and dementia patients. 
"This is good news for the individuals and good news for the Medicare trust fund and other sources of support for long-term care and health care," said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is president of the Urban Institute, a research center in Washington.
But Mr. Reischauer insisted it was "unlikely to represent a major contribution to solving the long-run financial problems faced by Medicare and Medicaid." 
It was unclear whether improvements in the health status of the elderly would lead to a permanent slowdown in health care costs or whether the slowdown would be only temporary, Dr. Reischauer said. He added that it was not known whether "the people who don't have chronic disabilities at 75 will be alive and at age 85 will have the disabilities at that point, or maybe a different set of problems that will be equally, or more, expensive to treat."
Dr. Fogel said the cost issues needed more study. 
The new study raises questions that will set the agenda for the next round of research, he said.

HEADLINE: Officer Charged in Killing That Roiled Cincinnati 

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: CINCINNATI, May 7 

 BODY:
Two misdemeanor charges were filed today against a white police officer who shot an unarmed black man to death last month, a killing that sparked four days of protest and street violence in this racially tense city.
 The policeman, Officer Stephen Roach, was charged with negligent homicide and obstructing official business in the death of 19-year-old Timothy Thomas, the Hamilton County prosecutor, Mike Allen, announced this evening. 
 Mr. Allen held a 6 p.m. news conference to broadcast the widely awaited results of the grand jury investigation and to give city officials advance notice to prepare for any renewal of last month's violence. 
Some black residents had urged felony homicide charges against the officer. But the grand jury, described as racially balanced, returned the misdemeanor charges after concluding that Officer Roach's behavior in shooting Mr. Thomas after a long police chase showed some negligence in the act as well as the official obstruction of investigators after the shooting. 
Mr. Allen said the latter charge apparently was based on the differing versions of the shooting that the officer offered investigators, a clash that grand jurors decided had "hampered" the investigation. Negligent homicide, which Mr. Allen said would involve a "substantial lapse of due care," carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail, while obstructing official business carries a maximum penalty of 90 days in jail. 
"I know emotions are running high over the tragic death," Mr. Allen said as city officials put the police on alert and vowed to restore last month's all-night curfew if street disturbances were renewed.
Four nights of street protests and violence followed the April 7 shooting, with dozens of stores vandalized. Black leaders said it was the latest of 15 fatalities at the hands of the police in the last six years, with all those slain being black.
The police have replied that officers' lives were directly at stake in most of those cases. 
"Please withhold your judgment until you know all of the facts," Mr. Allen pleaded after a month of speculation and demands in black and white communities about how the shooting should best be handled to ease the tension. "The proper place for judgment is in a trial."
Black leaders said that in the last week there had been speculation about a possible misdemeanor charge and that there was no immediate sign that there might be renewed protest or violence. Black church leaders urged calm tonight. Some shop owners, mindful of last month's vandalism and arson, boarded up their show windows.
"All we can do is trust the grand jury process, trust the law and hopefully have calm tonight," Mayor Charlie Luken declared. He reiterated promises to address the issues of economic opportunity and racial profiling most often cited by black leaders "or else the people will lose trust." But he added, "Tonight the message is respect the process, respect the law."
A crowd of 75 people awaited the grand jury's finding outside the courthouse and a few instances of rock throwing and trash-bin vandalism were reported. 
As the decision was announced, police officers streamed into Over-the-Rhine, the black neighborhood where most of the vandalism took place. But a score of patrol cars and dozens of officers gradually withdrew. Rainstorms arrived with the announcement, a coincidence that cheered city officials facing a night-long alert. 
There was no immediate reaction from the Fraternal Order of Police, the police union whose leaders had earlier expressed concern that Officer Roach's civil rights would be sacrificed to the city's need to pacify protesters and maintain order.
The incident last month began at 2 in the morning after Mr. Thomas was recognized as having 14 outstanding warrants, most of them for traffic infractions but two for previously fleeing from police officers. 
Officer Roach has maintained his innocence, reportedly telling associates that he thought Mr. Thomas might have been reaching for a gun in his waistband. Mr. Allen, the prosecutor, said investigators noted that Mr. Thomas, who had been fleeing pursuers, had been wearing baggy pants, and witnesses said he seemed to be holding them up as he fled. 
In March, a coalition of black civil rights groups and the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio filed suit in federal court in Cleveland accusing Cincinnati of a "30-year pattern of racial profiling." The suit contends that blacks are routinely singled out by police officers for minor offenses far more than whites are and that officers "tend to use excessive and deadly force against African-Americans more readily than against whites." 
In reacting to complaints, the city today initiated a new police procedure in which officers who stop people on the basis of suspicion of a possible crime must list the race of the person on official forms so any pattern might be studied.
Attorney General John Ashcroft announced today that the Justice Department's civil rights division would investigate the Cincinnati Police Department.
Mr. Ashcroft, who was traveling in the Southwest, issued a statement saying the inquiry would attempt to determine whether there was "a pattern or practice" of constitutional rights violations in the city's police department.
The inquiry will examine the use of excessive force, deadly force policies and the department's overall approach to dealing with suspects in potentially confrontational settings.

HEADLINE: Many Health Clinics Need Repairs, Trade Group Finds 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
More than half of New York State's community health clinics are in serious disrepair and do not have the money to improve conditions, according to a study by a trade group and a corporation that helps build clinics.
 The study, which stemmed from a survey of 40 community health centers across the state, found that 65 percent of the nonprofit clinics operated out of buildings that needed extensive renovations, modernizing or other capital improvements. Many are in buildings that have not been renovated for 25 years or more and that are not wheelchair accessible. Others have aging equipment, crumbling facades and no space left for things like patient records. 
 Community health clinics, the main source of health care for many poor patients, have been facing financial troubles in recent years as reimbursements from government and managed care insurance plans have fallen. 
Given the poor economics of clinics, hospitals have had little incentive to invest in creating more clinics. And the traditional capital markets that finance most small businesses, turned off by the catch-as-catch-can payment system from insurance companies, are loath to lend money to them. Many clinics across the state lose money or barely break even.
"The general message of this study is that we have very important primary care centers serving really important groups with enormous capital need," said Ronda Kotelchuck, the executive director of the Primary Care Development Corporation, one of the study's authors. "These centers serve the working poor and the uninsured and do not have the financial margins to take on the debt that would be needed to do the renovations."
According to the study, the clinics with the biggest problems are the large sites, which average 44,600 patients a year. Among those, 85 percent reported operating in buildings that were in an unacceptable or barely acceptable condition.
In one clinic, for instance, the waiting area for patients is full of old lockers and storage bins. In several others, there are no fire sprinkler systems. Many are heaving under the volume of patients but do not have the money to expand their spaces and free more for examination rooms, which contributes to longer waits for patients.
The Lyndon B. Johnson Health Complex in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, operates out of a 34-year-old building that has never been renovated. There is no elevator, making the second floor inaccessible to many patients, so no exam room has been built there. The electrical system is aged, and the air-conditioning and heating systems frequently do not work.
"We run a break-even operation here with no reserves," said Audrey Lee Jacobs, president of the center. As such, she said, banks will not lend her the money needed to make the $2.5 million in needed improvements.
On a $150 bill for a visit, Medicaid pays $84, an amount that has decreased steadily in recent years. Managed care companies pay $67 for the same visit in two installments, and uninsured patients pay an average of $30.
The study was conducted by Primary Care Development, which provides financial and technical assistance to clinics in New York City, and the Community Health Care Association of New York, an industry trade group. Their study concludes that health centers statewide need $90 million to make needed renovations, and calls for the state to provide grants that centers would match with loans, local grants or philanthropy to help pay for renovations.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
A Prayer for Tech Stocks

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: GREENDALE, Wis. 

 BODY:
The Rev. Douglas W. Schroeder still believes in technology stocks. His father, the Rev. Paul R. Schroeder, has lost his faith.
 On Palm Sunday, they debated over lunch at the New China Buffet here, in the suburbs of Milwaukee, where they had gathered with family members after presiding over two services and a Creationism class. 
 A couple of weeks earlier, Paul Schroeder, 67, sold his technology stocks. All of them. He had absorbed steep losses in the likes of EMC, the data storage company, and Cisco Systems, the networking titan, and used his credit card to pay off loans from his broker that he had used to multiply his bets. He had flourished in a bull market, but had struggled in a bear market. 
"How many times do you have to be hit in the head?" he asked.
Doug Schroeder, 38, has also taken his hits. His Ameritrade account is invested entirely in technology stocks. He lost about half his initial investment, and his account has fallen much further from its peak. He has an equally besieged retirement account, larded with technology sector funds. 
"Diversify?" the younger man mulled the question. "No, I'm going to still stay all tech."
After more than a year of market hemorrhaging two types of individual investors are emerging from the wreckage. Some, like the elder Pastor Schroeder, wilt under the assault, fleeing into shelters ignored during the bull market, like bonds and money market funds. He shuffled all his technology investments into old-economy stocks, like Cooper Tire and Rubber and Kmart. For a while, at least. 
Others, like his son, never contemplated capitulation, and their numbers are surprising.
The movement out of stock mutual funds has been relatively slim compared with previous market droughts. And at the first sign of a rally in April, investors piled back into growth funds, and technology stocks surged despite continually gloomy earnings reports. The forgiving mood of investors gives Wall Street money managers pause, because it indicates there is still a disconnect between investor behavior and reality.
So what keeps the fire burning bright?
For answers, we turned to two men who spend their lives preaching about faith, but who also embraced the great American pastime of the last decade, the stock market. Doug and Paul Schroeder share the pulpit of Our Shepherd Lutheran Church in Greendale, a community developed during Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency to blend park space with affordable housing. Today, it is a typical outpost of strip malls, with some Wisconsin touches: Green Bay Packers warm-up jackets and ample supplies of frozen custard.
The pastors, in some ways, are peas in a pod. Father and son both drive Chrysler sedans, agree that the church's money should be mostly in bonds, contribute amply to their church and brim with enough self-confidence to lead their flock of 540.
In some ways, though, they are a latter-day Abbott and Costello, with their investing styles the least of their differences. There is Doug Schroeder, the tall and lanky exercise enthusiast, and his father, the older curmudgeon, who resembles the jowly comedian Jonathan Winters with a salt-and-pepper goatee.
The elder Schroeder is a devoted pack rat, collecting everything from dinosaur fossils, rocks, coins, knives, Beanie Babies, Hummels, marbles and old Victrolas. Doug Schroeder, a minimalist, refers to the home of his parents, Paul and Sylvia, as "the museum."
"We think radically differently," said the father. 
"Who," his son smiled, "us?"
His father explained his investing philosophy. He was the son of an Iowa preacher in the days when preachers made enough to live, but no more, and he mended his shoes with cardboard. His first stock pick was Brunswick, a bowling equipment maker, in 1958. He has dabbled in real estate, options and commodities, forays that twice pushed him near bankruptcy. 
He intends to die in the pulpit -- he is already past the typical retirement age -- and trades as if he is trying to make a bit more before he folds up the tent. His stack of trading records from last year is about two inches high.
He changes his mind with some frequency. In mid-March, he proclaimed he was holding on to Cisco, Tellabs and his other technology holdings. And, he was still using the maximum amount of leverage, or borrowed money, from Fidelity, his broker. 
"I have an extremely high risk level," he said. "I've been extremely close to death six times." (This includes nearly being gored by a buck who hit his car, nearly rolling off an African cliff in a car wreck, and being smashed up by a feed truck in another accident.) 
But by the end of March, he said he had been chilled by yet another steep one-day market drop and by a CNBC report on Cisco.
"The thing that's so disturbing to me is that I was so dumb to ride it down so low," Paul Schroeder said that day. He was going to sit on the sidelines and keep his money in cash for a while, he said. And he did. 
For a week.
Then he bought Cooper Tire; Allete, a Minnesota utility; and Christopher & Banks, a clothing retailer. 
"I don't find it difficult to risk a lot," he said. "I believe everything belongs to God. What He gives you, we are stewards of that."
He related the parable of the talents, told with slight variations in Matthew and Luke. Jesus, the elder Pastor Schroeder explained, described a nobleman who entrusted some of his wealth to three servants during his travels. When the nobleman returned, two of the servants had multiplied the money several fold by investing and were rewarded for their industry. But the third servant simply held onto the money, afraid of taking any chances, and was berated for the failure.
"That would be poor stewardship," Pastor Paul said.
His son smiled. His father is a far cry from the third servant.
"You don't keep it under the mattress," Doug Schroeder told his father. "You leverage it." 
The older man grimaced.
"Now is not the time to stop leveraging," he said. "You've doubled your losses on the way down. You've got to double your gains on the way up."
The next day, Monday, April 9, the pastors prepared for the holy week ahead in their offices.
Their church is a modernistic outpost of redwood, glass and concrete, flanked by a 60-foot-high, 45-ton cross. "Isn't it massive?" Pastor Doug beamed. He is Our Shepherd's third-millennium preacher, having, among other things, introduced the electric guitar to the church band. 
The day started out bullish on Wall Street. The Nasdaq was up and the anthem "Jesus Freak" by the rock band DC Talk -- a Christian version of Nirvana -- blasted from two flat-panel speakers in the younger Pastor Schroeder's office. He trades less than his father, and when he does, it is in increments. He rejects the principle of diversification. He believes, as do many Americans, that an investor his age will profit in the long run by holding on.
"I pretty much am hard core into tech," he said. "I have a feeling tech isn't going to go away."
Today, he is pointing to the ticker symbol J-D-S-U, an entry in a bookkeeping program on his Macintosh computer. Pastor Doug has lost 85 percent of his investment in the company, JDS Uniphase. He scans the damaged goods in his Ameritrade account: LSI Logic, Flextronics, Qualcomm. From its peak, he has lost about half of his investment.
Still, he believes.
"I saw something recently that said people of faith are more willing to take risks than people who are not," he said. 
"They are willing to let the future unfold in the hands of the Lord."
His father, the new convert to skepticism, came into the office. The son, scanning Yahoo for news items, began to needle him.
"The news on Pepsi this morning isn't good," Doug Schroeder said. He, of course, would never buy an old-fashioned stock like Pepsi, but he knew his father held a large stake in a retirement account. 
"Rite Aid is going to carry Coke as well as Pepsi," he said, grinning as his father absorbed the joke. 
"Maybe you should sell?" Pastor Doug said. Pastor Paul's thick eyebrows were knit into tight angles.
"Pepsi," he said, "is a good company."
Paul Schroeder's office is bracketed by some 3,000 books, including the 13-volume "20 Centuries of Great Preaching." Like his son, he owns a Macintosh. Does he use it? Regarding the darkened screen for a moment, he shrugged. He keeps track of the church's membership on it, he said, but does not do the Internet.
Unlike his son, Pastor Paul interacts with the market the old-fashioned way: Barron's, Worth, Business Week. He is on a first-name basis with many of CNBC's personalities. He calls Joe Kernen, a CNBC stock analyst, "gutsy," but laments that the Kernen picks have already risen by a quarter-point by the time he calls his broker.
Using the telephone does not come as cheap as his son's Web account. His trades, which he estimates between 100 and 150 a year, are $25 each, compared with Ameritrade's $8 trading cost. Most financial advisers would cite the accumulated costs of trading as the chief reason to buy and hold stocks instead. 
Still, it is hard to keep the bulls of Greendale down. 
"Maybe that's my excitement in life, I suppose," the older man said of his frenetic trading. 
The next week, in mid-April, the younger Pastor Schroeder's tech stocks were rising again and his father could resist his trading urge no longer. He dumped all his old-economy stocks. He sold Allete. He sold Christopher & Banks. He sold Cooper Tire. He sold Kmart.
Back to the new economy. He piled into Nasdaq 100 Shares, the popular tracking stock of the technology-heavy index. 
"When I saw the Dow holding over 10,000, I thought if it held, we could go further," he said, referring to the market's broad early April rally. At worst, the market was near its bottom, he assumed, though mounting layoff tallies around the country concerned him. And what about corporate America's stream of earnings warnings?
"I don't know if there's any pure logic to it," he said of his strategy.
"I'm not really convinced," he added, "but once you're convinced, you're too late."

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL; 
Yankees Bulk Up On Plankton

BYLINE:  By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
With the season in its sixth week, the Yankees have yet to lose to a team with a losing record. No other major league team can make that claim. Syllogistically, the Yankees could be viewed this way: good teams beat up on bad teams, the Yankees beat up on bad teams, therefore the Yankees are a good team.
 So what else is new? The Yankees' ability to beat up on bad teams has been a hallmark of the team's success going back to the 1920's. In 1927, for example, the Yankees won 21 of 22 games with the St. Louis Browns, tying the major league record and establishing an American League record for most victories against one team. The Yankees won their division championship last season thanks to their record against losing teams, 45-31, compared with a 42-43 record against teams that finished the season with winning records. 
 This season the Yankees have already swept the season series from the Kansas City Royals (6-0), swept a series from Oakland in New York (3-0) and swept a series in Baltimore (4-0) for a 13-0 record against losing teams. Playing teams with winning records, on the other hand, the Yankees have a 6-13 record and have lost five of six series, two to Toronto and one each to Boston, Seattle and Minnesota. 
The payroll-disparity people would cite the Yankees' early season dominance over the losing teams as an example of the growing problem facing Major League Baseball. They would cite the early season problems of the Athletics and the Chicago White Sox, two of the three defending A.L. division champions, as another example, an example of the difficulty of teams on the lower half of the salary scale to maintain excellence from year to year.
Unlike the Yankees, of course, who spend lavishly to ensure their continued dominance.
But long ago, well before anyone paid attention to salaries, payrolls and economic differences, the Yankees were generally dominating bad teams. When the Yankees beat up those awful Browns in 1927, no one attributed the results to payroll disparity. That's a 21st century term invoked not just as an explanation for the Yankees' dominance but as a warning about the future stability of the major leagues.
Talk is growing about the elimination of teams, two, three, four, name the number. Montreal, Minnesota, Florida, Tampa Bay, Oakland. Prosper or perish.
Funny, but no one ever advocated the demise of the Browns or the Senators or the Athletics, a threesome of A.L. teams that played for decades without a faint hope of contending, let alone winning. Sure, all three teams moved, the Athletics twice, but two National League teams, the Chicago Cubs and the Philadelphia Phillies, continue to do business where they were hatched despite decades of inept efforts and putrid performances.
In a 20-season span, 1947 through '66, the Cubs finished as high as fifth only three times, last or next to last 12 times. The Phillies played from 1918 through '73, 56 seasons, and emerged from the lower half of the standing, the second division it used to be called, only 11 times. They finished last 23 times, next to last 10 times.
No matter where they played, the Athletics earned a second-division standing 33 times in 35 years, 1934-68, finishing last 16 times, next to last 8 seasons. The Senators finished in the lower half of the standing 23 times in 27 seasons, 1934-60, nearly half of them (13) in last or next to last. The second division was also the familiar home of the Browns.
In an eight-season span, in fact, 1932 through '39, the Browns finished more than 43 games behind six times, including a still-standing league record 64 1/2 games in 1939. In an eight-year period, too, 1936 through '43, the Athletics finished 46 games or more behind six times, including 51 1/2 the same year the Browns were an even-more distant 64 1/2. The two teams combined for 98 victories that season; the Yankees won 106 games.
The Yankees won the pennant most of those seasons, finishing first seven times in eight years. Six years later, beginning in 1949, they won 14 pennants in 16 years.
But those times, the 30's, the 40's, the 50's, even the 60's, were different, the payroll-disparity people say. It wasn't about the money then. The Yankees were regularly able to beat the Browns and the Athletics and the Senators 16, 17, 18, 19 times in 22 games, they say, because, well, just because they were a better team. 
They don't talk about money matters that did exist at the time. Clark Griffith, the Senators owner, sold his son-in-law, the all-star shortstop Joe Cronin, to the Boston Red Sox for $250,000, in 1934. A year earlier, Connie Mack received a total of $245,000 in deals that shed from the Athletics pitchers Lefty Grove and George Earnshaw and catcher Mickey Cochrane. Two years after that flurry, Mack sold 28-year-old Jimmie Foxx, who in the previous four seasons hit 186 home runs and drove in 577 runs, to the Red Sox for $150,000.
Yet the Senators and the Athletics survived to play another day. They weren't jettisoned because they couldn't win or because they felt compelled to sell off their best players to wealthier teams. Instead, they became fodder for the Yankees. The Yankees just have different fodder now.

HEADLINE: As Jobs Are Lost, Consumers Slow Increase in Borrowing 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
Consumers added to their debt far more gingerly in March as they curbed spending on autos and other big-ticket items.
 The pullback by consumers, who spent and borrowed heavily earlier in the year, came after a sharp increase in corporate layoffs and could suggest that the economic downturn might deepen. 
 "What the consumer does is the No. 1 issue for the economic outlook," said Edward McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. "It's hard to hinge that much on one number," Mr. McKelvey said, but "it could mean that we will get more of a cyclical correction than people are banking on." 
Total consumer debt outstanding grew in March by $6 billion, an increase of nearly 5 percent on an annual basis from February, and well below a rise of $8 billion to $10 billion that had been forecast by economists. In February, debt grew more than 10 percent, or $13.4 billion. The figures do not include loans backed by real estate, like mortgages.
The slowdown was most evident not in credit card borrowing but in what is called nonrevolving credit, or financing for automobiles, boats, mobile homes and education, among other things -- where borrowing declined 0.6 percent in total. By contrast, credit card and other revolving debt, which do not have fixed repayment periods, rose nearly 12 percent, though still slower than the 19.6 percent increase the month before. 
The borrowing slowdown follows weak first-quarter reports from retailers like Sears, Roebuck and Wal-Mart. Over all, retail sales rose just 0.7 percent in March, according to a Goldman, Sachs composite index, down from 1.6 percent the previous month. Sales at department stores and specialty apparel and off-price stores fell, by 2.7 and 4.1 percent, respectively.
Credit card spending continued to grow as retail sales slumped, probably because of higher energy bills, economists said. "People were confronted with Visa and MasterCard on the one hand, and Con Ed on the other, and decided to pay Con Ed," said Neal Soss, chief economist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
Some economists regarded the slowdown in consumer borrowing with a sense of relief, given the surge in recent quarters. "This comes on the heels of some large increases," said James Glassman, senior economist at J. P. Morgan Chase, "so these figures are actually a bit comforting."
Consumers' debt burden has grown so sharply, some speculate, that Americans might be close to reaching their tolerance for borrowing.
In fact, more consumers have fallen behind on their credit card bills in recent months. The charge-off rate, which refers to debts at least 180 days past due as a percentage of total loans, was 5.8 percent in February -- the most recent data available -- up from 5.67 percent a year earlier, said William A. Black, senior credit card analyst at Moody's Investors Service. The delinquency rate, or debt 30 days or more past due, was 5.26 percent, compared with 4.83 percent a year earlier.
The Fed data on consumer credit is now more than a month old. More recent economic reports have not been encouraging. In April, automobile sales fell, and more jobs were lost than in any other month in the last 10 years.
Consumers who have been laid off would be expected to reduce spending, especially if was taking a while to find a new job. And a hot summer would presumably mean another surge in air-conditioning bills, Mr. Soss said.
Still, he and other economists saw reason for optimism. "A tax cut is even more predictable than the weather," Mr. Soss maintained.
Furthermore, the effect of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve will kick in soon, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Bank One, adding: "We've had the most aggressive Fed stimulus in history. I think we could see spending pick up in the second half of the year."
Another positive sign is that bankruptcy filings by individuals seem to be slowing, said Moshe Orenbuch, a credit card analyst at Credit Suisse. Filings for the week ended April 20 were down 15 percent from the four- week period immediately before then, he said. Filings jumped earlier as some people rushed to take advantage of existing bankruptcy law in anticipation of new, more restrictive legislation expected to take effect later this year.

MAYTAG VOWS TO INCREASE ITS SPENDING ON RESEARCH

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 The Maytag Corporation said yesterday that it planned to spend more on research and development and advertising, despite the weak economy and slower sales in the major appliance industry. "We're putting money into the organization to build key areas of our businesses," its chief executive, Leonard Hadley, said at a conference of financial analysts in Florida. The company, based in Newton, Iowa, makes Jenn-Air, Magic Chef, Maytag and Admiral appliances.

It Takes a Satellite

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: ACCRA, Ghana 

 BODY:
If you're wondering why I came to Ghana, I can now reveal the truth: I came to check my health insurance. 
 No, really. You see, I'm enrolled with Aetna health insurance. And Aetna, as well as Keystone Mercy health care, has moved a large chunk of its data processing to a modern high-rise in downtown Accra. There 400 young Ghanaian techies -- working in three eight-hour shifts and connected to the U.S. by satellite -- punch the raw claims data sent to them by the U.S. health-care giants onto computerized forms and then zip it back by satellite to the U.S. for final processing. Since I had recently filed a claim with Aetna, I kept looking over the shoulder of the Ghanaian techies to see if, by chance, they were processing my forms! 
 The Ghana office of the U.S.-based ACS Inc., where this data processing is going on, is a good answer to a question one hears often these days: Is Africa hopeless? To be sure, one tele-computing office does not an economy, or a future, make. The evening before I visited the ACS operation, I was at a dinner where a debate broke out between a leader of Ghana's Trades Union Congress and the country's deputy minister of finance over how much to raise the minimum wage. They were arguing over an increase of 10 cents a day. It was sad. Ghana's minimum wage is about 80 cents a day -- a rich country made poor by decades of misrule. 
 But hopeless? Well, a country or continent can be hopeless only if the best and the brightest, particularly the young, have given up all hope. And I did not find that in Ghana, and certainly not at the ACS office. You have to imagine this scene: You step off the steamy streets of Accra, go up three floors, and all you see in every direction is a sea of young Ghanaians doing data processing on computers, in air-conditioned rooms with a radio playing "Don't Worry, Be Happy."
 "Ghana is the first country in Africa to get into this sort of tele-computing," said Bossman Dowuona-Hammond, the Ghana manager for ACS. "We now have 400 people on this floor, but we plan to expand to 1,000 later this year. We're expecting UPS and American Express to move some of their data processing here too. The way it works is claim forms are sent from the U.S. by photo image, through a satellite, they come up on the screen of each data processor, and they key in the data on computerized forms and then send it back to the States.
 "It helps to have computer skills," he added, "but basically you just have to know English and be able to type 60 words per minute at 95 percent accuracy. We train you for the rest. . . . These young people have to adapt to U.S. standards, so imagine the skills and work ethic they take when they go to other jobs in Ghana ." 
 In a country where the average income is about $380 a year, the best ACS data processors make $300 a month. They also get free transport to work (there are no public buses here), plus meals and free health care. In February 14 other data processing firms came over to scout Ghana for their back-office computing work. India, the Philippines, Hong Kong all started with this sort of simple data processing and then moved up to more complex code-writing and software design.
 "In Africa, government is the biggest employer," says Mr. Dowuona-Hammond. "If all these people were to be employed by government their incomes would be so low it would have no impact on their lives. In Africa, if you give decent employment to one person, you are feeding 15 in the urban areas and 30 to 35 in rural areas. Also, 90 percent of my employees are female, and this sort of job makes them self-dependent." One reason AIDS has spread so quickly in Africa is that young girls without work have to sell their bodies for food.
 "I studied computers at the polytechnic," said Ruth Anane-Darko, 24, a top processor. "If this weren't here I would have been a secretary for a lot less pay. Most of my friends are trying to get a job here." 
 Calling Africa hopeless today is morally offensive, because it condemns millions of people to no future, and analytically wrong. There are multiple trends here, and not all bad. Yes, Ghana has fallen way behind. But the information revolution offers young Ghanaians a real chance to leap forward in ways they never could have dreamt of just a decade ago. As long as they have hope -- and they do -- we should too.

HEADLINE: U.S. Bancorp Buys Processor of Credit Card Debt 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, May 7 

 BODY:
U.S. Bancorp, the eighth-largest United States bank, agreed to buy the Nova Corporation, a credit card payment-processing company, for $2.1 billion to expand in a business that is growing faster than lending.
 Shareholders of Nova, which is based in Atlanta, will have the option of receiving either 1.407 shares of U.S. Bancorp stock -- worth $31.91 at U.S. Bancorp's closing price on Friday -- or $31 in cash for each Nova share. The cash portion represents a 32 percent premium over Nova's share price of $23.52 on Friday. 
 Buying Nova would make U.S. Bancorp the No. 3 processor of payments for merchants, handling everything from approving credit card purchases to settling transactions. It will also bolster an operation where revenue grew 14 percent, to $249.7 million in the first quarter, compared with 4.1 percent growth in its lending business.
"If you've traditionally been in a business where you're subject to the ups and downs of interest rates, this is a good diversification away from that," said Scott Edgar, who helps manage $750 million of assets at Sife Trust Fund, which owns U.S. Bancorp shares.
U.S. Bancorp shares fell $1.44, closing at $21.24. Nova jumped $5.53, a 24 percent gain, to $29.05.
U.S. Bancorp processes credit card and other electronic payments for 90,000 large merchants, including some airlines. Nova has 560,000 smaller clients. Together, the companies will process more than $100 billion of payments in 2001, U.S. Bancorp said.
The purchase adds a business that had $1.58 billion of revenue last year, 8 percent more than the year before. It will increase U.S. Bancorp's cash earnings once it is completed in the third quarter, and cut $27 million out of the companies' costs by 2003. The one-time expense of completing the purchase is expected to total $100 million before taxes.
"Payment processing is a higher-growth, higher-return business than traditional banking," said Jennifer Thompson, an analyst at Putnam Lovell Securities. 
"This combination creates the economies of scale that are critical to being a long-term survivor in this desirable segment of the payment services industry," Jerry Grundhofer, U.S. Bancorp's chief executive, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: High Demand For Energy Spurs Mergers 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Two mergers announced yesterday in disparate parts of the energy industry may not seem to have much in common, but they point to an effort by some companies to capitalize on growing demand for gasoline and electricity and lagging supplies.
 The Williams Companies, which builds power plants, transports natural gas and trades electricity, confirmed that it would buy the Barrett Resources Corporation in Denver for $2.5 billion in cash and stock, topping a hostile bid made by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. At the same time, the Valero Energy Corporation, one of the nation's largest refining companies, said it planned to acquire a competitor, the Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corporation, for about $4 billion in cash and stock. 
 A couple of years ago, few companies would have placed their bets on businesses like natural gas exploration or oil refining, which have historically made little money. Natural gas prices were depressed for years before a sharp upswing began last spring. Profit margins in refining had been extremely narrow, with oil companies generally making their money on the difference between pumping the oil from the ground for a few dollars and selling it on the commodities markets for much more. 
But the booming economy of the last few years stoked consumption of natural gas and petroleum products, especially gasoline and heating oil. And so far, the slowdown has had almost no effect on how much electricity Americans use or how much they drive. Demand for gasoline is expected to be 1.4 percent higher this summer than last year, according to the Energy Information Administration, the analysis unit of the Energy Department.
"Over the last decade, neither natural gas nor refining has been a high-profit segment of the industry," said Kate Warne, senior energy analyst with Edward Jones, a brokerage firm based in St. Louis. "But those parts of the industry that are usually ignored are hot now. People are looking for assets and to operate them more efficiently."
The bidding war that broke out for Barrett was indicative of the renewed interest from big companies like Shell in natural gas producers in North America. "This should be a sign to the industry that North American natural gas is a long-term investment opportunity," said Wayne Andrews, energy analyst with the investment firm Raymond James & Associates. "If the industry recognizes that, you could see future takeouts."
Three months ago, the Phillips Petroleum Company announced that it would buy the Tosco Corporation, the nation's largest independent refiner, for about $7 billion in stock and at a significant premium over Tosco's share price at the time. In mid-April, the power generation company Calpine Corporation completed its acquisition of Encal Energy, a Canadian oil and gas producer. 
The market greeted the Phillips deal with skepticism, echoing years of doubt about the refining business. Most major oil and gas companies like BP Amoco have been gradually divesting themselves of much of their marginally profitable refining business to focus on the big money in crude oil production. But increasingly, analysts and companies are asking whether the recent healthy margins in petroleum refining are as ephemeral as many had predicted. Valero's deal, for example, has been greeted more favorably by the market, analysts said, despite the decline in its share price yesterday.
Valero would exchange 1.228 shares of its common stock for about half the outstanding shares of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock common stock and would pay $55 a share in cash for the remaining shares. That would represent a 29 percent premium over Ultramar's closing price of $42.71 a share on Friday. Valero would also assume $2 billion in debt. Shares of Valero fell $2.77 yesterday, to $42.70, while Ultramar Diamond rose $7.79, to $50.50.
Gasoline inventories going into the peak summer driving season are below last year's historical lows. As a result, prices are climbing. President Bush is "very concerned" about prices, a White House spokesman said yesterday. The Energy Information Administration revised an earlier forecast for the average price of gasoline this summer, raising it 11 cents, to $1.60 a gallon, a record in nominal terms. Adjusted for inflation, however, it is still below average summer prices in the mid-1980's. 
Prices have been buoyed by the narrowing gap between consumer demand and gasoline supply. More people are driving farther from home to work, more vehicles are on the road and more of them are gasoline-greedy sport utility vehicles. Despite high fuel prices last year, driving behavior changed only slightly. With the Bush administration eschewing conservation, consumption is unlikely to fall drastically over the coming years. 
While demand has soared, the amount of oil that can be refined in the United States has fallen. Because of environmental regulations and low returns, no new refineries have been built in the country since the 1970's. With its acquisition of Ultramar, Valero will become the second- biggest refiner in the country, trailing only Exxon Mobil.
"You have a situation that has evolved over a long period of time," said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "You eventually get into a bottleneck, and you can't get out of it overnight. That's why refining looks like an investment."
There are, of course, potential hazards to such a big refining position. High gasoline prices may eventually push people to conserve once more. A deep recession could dampen demand, too.
But both Valero and Williams may benefit from the increasing Balkanization of the country's energy market. Each company, for example, is well positioned to cash in on California's energy woes. Refining margins in the state are even higher than they are nationwide because of a special brand of clean-burning gasoline used there that cannot be imported in large amounts. If its acquisition is approved by the Federal Trade Commission, Valero will have three refineries in the lucrative California market. 
Williams's deal would enable it to lock in natural gas to supply power plants it is building nationwide. Williams will buy half the shares of Barrett for cash and the rest with stock. The company will pay $73 in cash, or 1.767 of its shares, for each Barrett share. Williams will also assume $300 million in debt. Shares of Williams fell $2.39, to $39.28, while Barrett rose $2.85, to $70.15.
Because Barrett's fields are in the Rocky Mountains, the supply of natural gas that Williams is acquiring will be particularly crucial to serving California, the Southwest and Texas, where power demand is booming. Calpine and Williams have both entered long-term deals with California to supply power and buying gas fields reduces their exposure to the volatility of gas prices on the commodities markets.
"When you build power plants, you have to cover the other end of that: your fuel," Mr. Andrews said. "There are two ways to do it: you can enter into long-term contracts and pay very high prices on the futures markets or buy natural gas producers. Williams benefits whether it burns the natural gas or sells it." 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 9, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about two acquisitions in the energy industry, which point to an effort by some companies to capitalize on the growing demand for gasoline and electricity, referred incorrectly to the nation's capacity for refining oil. Although the gap between supply and demand has tightened, capacity has risen since 1994, not fallen.

HEADLINE: Bush Declares Freer Trade A Moral Issue; Chides Critics 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7 

 BODY:
President Bush took on critics of his free trade agenda today, arguing that his administration's effort to break down tariffs was "a moral imperative" that would help clean up the environment and promote workers' rights.
 Mr. Bush, who will send his trade proposals to Congress this week in preparation for a vote in the fall, used a speech at the State Department to urge lawmakers to give him the authority to negotiate trade treaties the world over that would not be subject to amendments by the Senate. 
 "One tool I must have is renewed U.S. trade promotion authority," Mr. Bush said at a meeting of the Council of the Americas, an organization that promotes trade in the Western Hemisphere. "I urge the Congress: restore our nation's authority to negotiate trade agreements, and I will use that authority to build freedom in the world, progress in our hemisphere and enduring prosperity in the United States." 
The White House knows it is in for a battle. Labor unions and their backers on Capitol Hill have vowed to fight against giving the president such a free hand in trade negotiations. Even as the president spoke, 61 senators sent him a letter warning that they would oppose any new trade agreement that did not allow the United States to protect its companies against unfair trade practices by foreign governments.
Mr. Bush will face the same political crosscurrents that his predecessor encountered. Every president since Gerald Ford has had the ability to negotiate trade deals that had to be voted up or down by lawmakers without changes. But the authority lapsed during the Clinton administration, and the White House was unable to win Congressional support to restore the negotiating power, which is known as fast track.
"When President Clinton tried to get fast track authority and started counting heads, he dropped it," said Representative Jack Quinn of Buffalo, who heads a group of Republicans who support unions. "The votes weren't there then, and I haven't seen much change."
The White House is well aware of that. "Will it be easy?" Nicholas E. Calio, Mr. Bush's legislative director, said in an interview. "No. This issue is always a difficult one. It takes a lot of work and a lot of education. We're talking to all sorts of different people. There are some whom it's not worth talking to, because they'll never in a million years be with you. But if anybody is at all open, even a little open, we'll talk."
Mr. Bush today asked the business leaders, diplomats and government officials who make up the Council of the Americas to help turn critics around. "I'm counting on the council's help to bring sanity to the United States Congress," he said.
But Mr. Bush also signaled that he would be willing to deal with the detractors. "My administration wants to work with Congress and to listen to what the members have to say," he said. "We've been especially impressed by the fresh, new thinking of many members about how to advance environmental and worker protection concerns in ways that open trade rather than closing trade."
Robert B. Zoellick, the president's trade representative, has sought to bridge the gap between Democrats, who insist that trade pacts should impose sanctions on countries that fail to protect workers and the environment, and Republicans, who see such requirements as a form of protectionism. Forging a compromise has proven difficult.
In making his case, Mr. Bush decried what he called "a new form of protectionism."
"It talks of workers, while it opposes a major source of new jobs," he said. "It talks of the environment, while opposing the wealth-creating policies that will pay for clean air and water in developing nations. It talks of the disadvantaged, even as it offers ideas that would keep many of the poor in poverty.
"Open trade is not just an economic opportunity, it is a moral imperative. Trade creates jobs for the unemployed. When we negotiate for open markets, we're providing new hope for the world's poor. And when we promote open trade, we are promoting political freedom."
When it comes to trade pacts, Mr. Bush has his eyes all over the map. Besides the hemisphere-wide pact that he pursued at the recent summit meeting in Quebec, Mr. Bush is seeking trade agreements with such countries as Jordan, Chile and Singapore, as well as a new round of global trade accords. He also said China, which reached a trade agreement with the United States at the close of the Clinton administration, would benefit from political changes as a result of liberalized trade policies.
"Look at our friends in Mexico and the political reforms there," he said. "Look at Taiwan. Look at South Korea. And someday soon I hope that an American president will end that list by adding, 'Look at China.' "

HEADLINE: Tapping a Thirst for Latin Cinema; 
Films Win Festival Raves but Struggle to Reach Their Markets

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO 

 BODY:
In Fabian Bielinsky's film "Nueve Reinas" ("Nine Queens"), a swindler takes his reluctant apprentice out on the street to show him they are hardly alone in their pursuits. Looking around, they easily spot people being robbed, or about to be, by a purse snatcher, a car thief, a shoplifter.
 Although the film is set in Buenos Aires, Mr. Bielinsky said, its atmosphere of deception and self-interest is universal. 
 "The film reflects not reality but a particular mood, a mood that sometimes everybody goes through," he told a sold-out audience at the Museum of Modern Art last month during the New Directors/New Films festival. "Is everybody lying? Is there anybody that's not part of this big scheme?" 
With "Nine Queens" Mr. Bielinsky has become one of the new voices in Spanish-language cinema that are catching the attention of audiences at home and abroad. Filmmaking has gone through steep ups and downs in Latin America, cycles often tied to economic and government upheavals, film industry experts say, but the trend now is up, in production, film quality and popular appeal.
Latin American filmmakers may also find a huge potential American audience in the growing Hispanic population, industry representatives say, although movie distributors have yet to tap that market.
"At the most hopeful, Latin America is in a position Asia was in at the end of the 1980's, when there were a lot of promising people who have now emerged as major directors," said Richard Pena, program director for the Film Society of Lincoln Center. "There's certainly the talent there for filmmakers to broaden their audience so they become a permanent voice in world cinema like they were in the 60's and part of the 70's."
In the last two years, Mr. Pena said, Latin America has produced films "that have really captured the imagination of audiences around the world." He noted that at the Berlin International Film Festival this year, the most discussed film was "La Cienaga" ("The Swamp") by Lucrecia Martel, about Argentina's collapsing middle classes.
Last year at the Cannes International Film Festival, he said, a strong Latin American presence was felt with knockouts like Mexico's "Amores Perros," roughly translated as "Miserable Loves." Cuba, Peru, Colombia and Chile are other countries with smaller but notable Spanish-language productions that have played at recent film festivals.
"The decade itself has been up and down," said Geoffrey Gilmore, director of the Sundance Film Festival, "but at the end of the day there's a much stronger sense of national cinema than there was in the beginning."
One example of a revitalized film industry is that of Argentina, which has a long history of cinema. Private film schools have multiplied in the last decade and have about 10,000 film students today, compared with fewer than 100 in the early 1980's. Nearly 50 Argentine films were made last year, double the rate of the 1990's, said Manuel Antin, dean of the Film University, a private film school in Buenos Aires. He said that one distinguishing quality of Argentine filmmakers now is a preference for realistic themes and settings, often shot in black and white.
The Film Society of Lincoln Center is showcasing some of these films through May 17 in a program called "Passionate Stories, a Passion for Storytelling: Recent Argentine Cinema" at the Walter Reade Theater. Among them are "76 89 03," which traces key years in contemporary Argentine history, and "Tesoro Mio," ("My Treasure"), a film noir based on a real bank embezzlement case.
"We're learning to navel-gaze, to see ourselves like we are," Mr. Antin said. "We've always had cinema that exposed conflicts of a national character -- the disappeared, the dictatorship -- but they were works of fiction."
Today's films are helping create new audiences in Latin America, where homegrown filmmakers usually find it hard to compete with American movies. In Mexico, films like "Amores Perros" have been as much a draw as Hollywood films, filmmakers there say. But finding money to finance productions is still the main struggle for directors.
In Argentina, productions depend on subsidies, loans and grants from the government, which uses a percentage of admission tickets to foster filmmaking. But Mr. Antin said that about half the money ends up going elsewhere in the government budget.
"It's encouraging that there are so many people who want to make films, but the financial problems are endemic," said Mr. Bielinsky, 42, who won a contest for new talent sponsored by a major production company, the Patagonik Film Group, which financed the $1.3 million "Nine Queens," his first feature film.
A popular way to deal with the financial problems, capitalize on a common language and exploit each other's markets is in co-productions with European countries like Spain, whose moviemaking has also blossomed over the last decade.
Jerry Carlson, a film studies professor at City College of New York who specializes in Latin American cinema, said that even major Hollywood studios had dabbled in collaborations like "Bossa Nova," a Brazilian production in English and Portuguese released by Sony Pictures Classics. "It does bode well for the acceptance of all cinema as a truly international medium," he said.
Because of the size of each nation's audience, few films can recoup their cost just exhibiting in their home country, film industry experts say, but Latin American filmmakers have found it difficult to reach international markets.
Gabriel Retes, a Mexican filmmaker for 28 years who is working on "@festival.ron," a semiautobiographical film about a director who goes to film festivals in five countries trying to sell his movie, said that the biggest obstacle was "Hollywood's invasion."
"Hollywood has swept the movie theaters, even in our countries," he said. "And when I say Hollywood, I'm not talking about American cinema, because there are many independent American filmmakers who can't get a screen either."
But in the United States, the huge growth of the Latino population is a beacon of hope. Events like last month's Havana Film Festival New York 2001, a sampling of Cuban and Latin American cinema featuring winners of the annual Havana Film Festival in Cuba, have expanded to include more films and venues. Kenneth Halsband, the festival director, said there were plans to extend the event to Los Angeles next year. And the Film Society of Lincoln Center has scheduled four Spanish-language programs, the most it has held in a single year. The Spanish Cinema Now series, an annual tribute to films from Spain being held Dec. 7 to 27 this year, is among their most popular programs.
But distributors and exhibitors of foreign films, like Daniel Talbot, president of New Yorker Films and operator of the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, note that Latinos in the United States are hardly a guaranteed audience for Latin American films. The public for these films, he said, is drawn from the same limited pool that goes to any foreign movie: an ethnically mixed group of slightly older, reasonably well-traveled, college-educated people. Although interest varies film by film, he said, "these are subtitled films that reach a minority audience."
So is there a better market in the United States for Latin-theme American films? There have been both smash hits and flops in the genre, people in the film industry in the States note, but this is largely uncharted territory because relatively few have been made. Latino filmmakers have the same complaint as their Latin American counterparts: it is hard to find financing, in their case from Hollywood.
A limited study of Latino movie-going habits by the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute in California, conducted in 1999 for the Screen Actors Guild, found that for most Latinos, subject matter, not ethnic considerations, was the deciding factor in choosing a movie. But Latinos were six to seven times as likely to watch Latino-theme movies or movies starring Hispanic actors as to watch movies of a similar genre without a Latino theme or actors.
The study estimated that Latinos spend over $528 million a year on movie admissions.
Moctesuma Esparza, producer of "Selena," "Price of Glory" and other Latin-theme movies, argues that both Latin American cinema and American Latin-theme productions can look forward to growing audiences. For Latin American films to tap this audience, though, they must be marketed to Latinos and made accessible in Latino neighborhoods, he said.
Leon Ichaso, who is the director of films like "Crossover Dreams" and "El Super" and just completed a film about the life of the Puerto Rican poet and playwright Miguel Pinero, said it was up to Latinos and Latin Americans to coalesce so they can finance and distribute their films and develop the market themselves.
"There's a history of Hollywood failures that we pay for," he said. "Producers and directors need to talk among ourselves to create a cinema that is not a fad or a boom but that stays."

HEADLINE: A New Show at the Apollo Raises Hopes in Harlem 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
Since the 1930's the Apollo Theater in Harlem has been known for its variety shows, with acts like the tap-dancing Nicholas Brothers, the comedian Redd Foxx and the jazz singer Ruth Brown, and the weekly amateur nights, which started the careers of Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald. 
 Now, as the Apollo starts a $6 million renovation, the theater is planning to install a production with an open-ended run. The theater is to announce today that a new revue, "Harlem Song," is in the works, celebrating the history of Harlem since the 1920's through song, dance, dialogue, photographs and film. 
 The new production appears to be part of a larger effort to jump-start this struggling landmark. In March, Derek Q. Johnson, a co-chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner, stepped down to become president of the Apollo, saying that his priorities would be fund-raising and making the Apollo part of a major cultural center on 125th Street. 
"Harlem Song" is to be written by George C. Wolfe, the writer-director who is producer of the Joseph Papp Public Theater. The show is expected to begin an extended engagement next May, offering performances only on weekends -- three on Saturday, three on Sunday -- with the production going on hiatus each January through March. During the rest of the week the Apollo is to feature touring acts as well as the usual Amateur Nights on Wednesdays and begin originating its own attractions, said David D. Rodriguez, executive director of the Apollo Theater Foundation, which runs the theater. The Apollo is owned by New York State. 
"We want it to be a permanent attraction at the theater," said John Schreiber, an entertainment executive, who is producing the show with David Goodman, a former vice president for special programming and projects at Warner Brothers, and Frank Wildhorn, the composer of shows like "Jekyll and Hyde." The show will be produced in association with the foundation, which will share in the proceeds.
"It will speak to all sorts of audiences: the Harlem community, students, church groups from Maryland, traditional theatergoers, eventgoers," Mr. Schreiber added. "Harlem is the fourth most visited tourist attraction in New York."
Those involved say they hope that by drawing people to the Apollo, Harlem's other cultural offerings will benefit. With this in mind, Mr. Schreiber said, $1 of every ticket sold will be donated to the Harlem Strategic Cultural Collaborative, a consortium of nine arts organizations including the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Boys Choir of Harlem and the National Black Theater.
Barbara Ann Teer, founder and chief executive of the National Black Theater, said she was glad that "Harlem Song" planned to share its proceeds with the neighborhood's established cultural institutions. "I think it's wonderful that they want to acknowledge the groups that have been here and stayed the course," she said.
The creators say they also plan to reach out to schools in the area, inviting 200 students to the show every week without charge and developing a curriculum guide with Dr. Howard Dodson, a member of the Apollo board and director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem. "They'll get the most entertaining history lesson ever," Mr. Schreiber said. 
Mr. Schreiber, who produced last year's New Yorker Festival and met Mr. Wolfe there, said he asked Mr. Wolfe's advice for an Apollo show that would honor Harlem's heritage. Mr. Wolfe expressed interest in doing it himself. 
"I wanted to use my talent and my personality to help bring some energy into the community -- let me give something," Mr. Wolfe said. "Also, it means dealing with things I love, which are history and rejuvenation."
That doesn't mean "Harlem Song" will be a living, breathing wax museum or a history pageant, Mr. Wolfe said. "Harlem is one place where myth and reality have been dancing with each other since the beginning," he said. "I'm interested in exploring that." He said it would also be exciting to see his name on the Apollo marquee for the first time.
"It's not history from a distance," he added. "It's history that has an intimacy." One sequence, for example, will take place on the night in 1938 when Joe Louis fought Max Schmeling. "That fight, it was American idealism fighting facism and Naziism," Mr. Wolfe said. "It was a mythic, titanlike battle that affected everyone."
The show will also look at rent parties of the 1930's, when blacks who moved to Harlem from the South gathered to contribute to one another's monthly rent payments. "Fats Waller and Willy (the Lion) Smith would be playing," Mr. Wolfe said. "It was a way for newly arrived Southerners to acclimate themselves to an urban environment." In creating "Harlem Song," Mr. Wolfe has joined forces with his team from the award-winning shows "Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk" and "Jelly's Last Jam." It includes the choreographer Ken Roberson, the composers Daryl Waters and Zane Mark, the set designer Riccardo Hernandez and the projection designers Batwin & Robin Productions Inc.
As to how he would juggle the show with his responsibilities at the Public, Mr. Wolfe suggested that he would share the directing duties, adding that he was used to having a lot on his plate. "I don't see it violating any time and space at the Public," he said. 
The show, which will cost some $5 million to mount, will have a top ticket price of about $45, Mr. Schreiber said. The show expects to bring in more than 400,000 people in a nine-month period. "It's not just an art story, it's an economic development story," Mr. Rodriguez said.
The Apollo could use the boost. In 1998 the New York attorney general, Dennis C. Vacco, sued the theater and six members of the foundation's board, including Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Harlem congressman who was then the board's chairman, and accused them of mismanaging the Apollo's finances. Although Mr. Rangel denied wrongdoing, he resigned as chairman and agreed later to leave the board as part of a settlement with Mr. Vacco's successor, Eliot L. Spitzer.
The theater, which has 1,463 seats, is to start its renovation next month, including redoing its marquee and facade. Next month, for the first time, Dance Theater of Harlem will perform its season at the Apollo. And during the July 4 weekend the Apollo will test its first off-site Amateur Night t on the Mall in Washington, with local amateurs and the Smithsonian Institution as a co-sponsor. 
He said the planned schedule for "Harlem Song" harked back to the theater's early days. "For a number of years the Apollo had five shows on weekdays, seven shows on weekends," he said, adding that the dancer Maurice Hines "has said he would start the first show in the last row and work his way up through the day."

HEADLINE: A Hard Choice in Peru 

BYLINE:  By Steven Levitsky and Cynthia Sanborn; Steven Levitsky is an assistant professor of government at Harvard University. Cynthia Sanborn is a professor of political science at Universidad del Pacifico in Lima, Peru.

 BODY:
The American media has followed recent events in Peru with a mixture of fascination and horror. A year ago, Peru drew international attention when President Alberto Fujimori and his cronies maneuvered to steal their way to a third term. Then, while much of the international community prepared to recognize the election as a fait accompli, a leaked videotape revealed the extraordinary web of corruption spun by spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos, prompting Mr. Fujimori's resignation and the holding of new elections on April 8. The results of that election also stunned observers.
 A runoff contest early next month pits frontrunner Alejandro Toledo, a former shoeshine boy of indigenous descent who led the opposition to Mr. Fujimori last year, against none other than ex-president Alan Garcia, whose mismanagement and abuse of power in the 1980s generated the worst economic crisis in Peruvian history. Are voters suffering from "bad memory," as a leading U.S. newspaper recently editorialized? 
 Not necessarily. The roots of Alan Garcia's political resurgence lie in the extraordinary weakness of Peru's political institutions. Over the last decade, Peru has suffered two meltdowns of its political establishment. In 1990, the existing elite collapsed under the weight of hyperinflation, terrorism and its own failure to represent effectively the country's poor and non-white majority. Mr. Fujimori, a political neophyte, defeated renowned novelist Mario Vargas Llosa to win the presidency.
Two years later, Mr. Fujimori's closure of Congress delivered a coup de grace to the old guard elite, and his regime then eviscerated what remained of Peru's political institutions. The espionage and extortion network constructed by Mr. Montesinos gave him de facto control over the armed forces, the legislature, the judiciary, the electoral authorities, and much of the media.
These institutions were broadly discredited, and when the regime fell last year, the political establishment collapsed yet again. Established political parties have been replaced by an array of personality driven movements and amateur outsider candidates. Because outsiders lack political experience and a track record, they represent a shot in the dark for voters, both in terms of their ability to govern and their commitment to democracy.
It is in this context that Alan Garcia returned to become a major contender for the presidency. Mr. Garcia is a skilled politician with a real party base, but what truly permitted his rise in the polls -- his party's presidential candidate the previous year won just two percent of the vote -- was the weakness of the rest of the field. Mr. Toledo, though widely respected for his role in bringing down Mr. Fujimori, is a political amateur who has proved to be a mistake-prone candidate. He lacks clarity on major policy issues, and his clumsy efforts to dodge persistent allegations of personal misconduct -- including drug use and fathering a child out of wedlock -- have raised questions about his credibility. The third place finisher in April, Lourdes Flores, a former congresswoman with a record of honesty and support for democracy, could not free herself from the traditional political and socioeconomic elite that Peruvians rejected in 1990. Her National Unity movement never even faintly resembled the society she hoped to govern.
Mr. Garcia's return has economic roots as well. Although Mr. Fujimori's free-market reforms ended hyperinflation and initially generated growth, the economy stagnated in the latter part of the 1990s. Poverty and inequality increased, and many Peruvians now consider themselves worse off than they were 10 years ago. Yet of the leading presidential candidates, only Mr. Garcia appeared to address voters' urgent economic concerns. Although Mr. Toledo's main campaign slogan was "More Jobs," his policy proposals were generally perceived to lack content.
Mr. Garcia, while claiming to have learned from his past mistakes, vigorously challenged the economic policies of the 1990s and offered people specific changes, such as lower utility rates, public jobs programs and credit for farmers. Viable or not, these proposals struck a chord among an electorate that had grown deeply dissatisfied with the economic status quo.
 P eruvians thus confront a difficult choice: Mr. Toledo, an inexperienced leader dogged by personal credibility problems, or Mr. Garcia.
Contrary to what many observers fear, the greatest risk posed by Mr. Garcia may not be economic. He has already moved to reassure bankers and investors that, if elected, he would follow in the footsteps of the numerous other Latin American populists and leftists who pursued market-friendly policies in the 1990s. Rather, the main problem with Mr. Garcia is that he still faces credible charges of corruption and responsibility for gross human rights abuses during his first administration. If a vote for Mr. Toledo is a shot in the dark, a vote for Mr. Garcia is a vote for impunity.
Yet Peru's flawed presidential candidates do not necessarily condemn it to another cycle of instability. Although Mr. Toledo and Mr. Garcia have captured the spotlight, a more important set of developments may be taking place at the margins of the campaign.
Since assuming office last November, the transitional government led by interim President Valentin Paniagua has taken important steps to rebuild Peru's public institutions. Mr. Paniagua built a broad-based government, drawing skilled and respected people from across the political spectrum. All of these appointees voluntarily stayed out of this year's campaigns, which enabled the government to focus its attention on reforms.
The government's performance has been impressive. It has begun to restructure the armed forces, removing officers who collaborated with the past regime and eliciting a formal apology for the 1992 coup. It has restored credibility to the electoral authorities, begun to depoliticize tax administration and welfare programs, and introduced mechanisms of consultation with leading civil society organizations in such areas as education, labor and justice.
The new government has also attacked the misuse of power head on. Both the executive and the congress have launched extensive investigations into corruption and other abuses of authority under Mr. Fujimori, resulting in the arrest of top military officers, judges, previously untouchable business moguls and politicians of all stripes.
Finally, in stark contrast to his predecessors, Mr. Paniagua has governed by consensus and by the rules, seeking to strengthen rather than circumvent democratic institutions. In a society that long ago lost faith in its leaders and institutions, this represents an important change.
The international media has paid scant attention to the ongoing reconstruction in Peru. Yet this process may be critical to laying the foundation for democracy no matter who wins next month's election. Rather than wringing its hands over the return of Mr. Garcia, the international community should support this effort. If it fails, Peruvian democracy will remain vulnerable to corrupt and irresponsible leaders. If it succeeds, democracy will have a chance to survive in spite of them.

THE shift by major advertisers from compensating their agencies based on the traditional billings method to compensating them based on results has accelerated since 1997, according to a study conducted by the Association of National Advertisers in New York.
 The findings of the study are to be released today by the association, the trade organization for the country's leading marketers, at its advertising financial management conference, which is being held in Dana Point, Calif. The study is part of the 12th Trends in Agency Compensation survey, which is conducted for the association every three years. 
 The findings are indicative of the changes remaking Madison Avenue as advertiser clients rethink the way they do business as they grow larger, operate in more countries and seek to draw the attention of consumers who are becoming increasingly wary of and jaded about standard sales pitches. 
"Advertisers are asking their agencies to act differently," said John J. Sarsen Jr., president and chief executive at the association, "to proactively identify a broad cross section of solutions for profitable brand growth."
"Agencies are becoming consumer driven," Mr. Sarsen added, "and not traditional-media driven."
That was a reference to a belief that under the billings method, when agencies are compensated using fixed commissions and sliding scales, there is a bias toward spending the client's marketing budget in the mass media like television, whether or not such media make sense, because they generate the highest commissions.
"We'd like the agency to take a 'media neutral' approach to communicating the brand's essence to consumers," Mr. Sarsen said, "because sometimes something else besides TV or the mass media is an even better way to bring a brand to its target audience."
Typically under the billings method, an agency receives a commission of 15 percent of the billings. For instance, if a campaign is composed of television spots that cost $20 million for the commercial time, the client would pay the agency $3 million for its work. But if a direct mail campaign would be more effective, costing only $5 million, the agency would receive $750,000.
"The 15 percent commission, the standard for a century, has largely been supplanted," said David Beals, president and chief executive at Jones Lundin Beals in Chicago, a consulting company that specializes in agency reviews and compensation issues. He was the author of the survey with Robert H. Lundin, senior partner at Jones Lundin Beals.
"The interest in nontraditional media and marketing methods is absolutely the trend behind" the shift from the billings method, Mr. Beals said, in part because "less traditional media -- Web site design, event marketing, direct response, public relations -- are harder to compensate on a commission basis."
According to the study, which collected data from 136 corporate respondents in December and January, more than two-thirds had agreements last year centered on what is known as labor-based compensation, basing pay on performance or incentives. By comparison, according to the study released in 1998, 53 percent of respondents used labor-based compensation in 1997.
In the new study, 21 percent of respondents said they used billings-based agreements last year, compared with 35 percent three years ago.
"It's a pretty dramatic shift over a short period," Mr. Beals said.
Of those using incentives, most linked them to sales goals, so that the agency would be paid extra if, say, sales of the product advertised rose by a certain amount.
Incentives are also often linked to how the agencies perform in evaluations and to awareness goals, meaning the agency would be paid extra if consumers describe themselves as more aware of a product or its advertising than they had been previously.
Forty-nine percent of respondents said they made a change in agency compensation methods in the last three years, the study reported, while in the last survey, 38 percent said they had made a change.
"It largely has to do with a desire for greater accountability," Mr. Beals said, adding that "given tougher economic times, I can only assume the use of performance incentives is only going to increase in coming years."
"In fact, as the economy swings up and down, the 15 percent commission is a shakier approach," he added. "In boom times, it leads to inflated profits for agencies, and in down times, the agencies suffer quite a bit if compensation is based on media spending."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS; 
Longer-Term Treasuries Fall on Inflation Fears and New Sales

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasuries were mixed yesterday, with longer-dated issues tumbling on both a wave of new supply and on worries over potential inflation later in the year, when the market expects lower interest rates to result in an economic recovery.
 Those inflation fears were exacerbated after the government said productivity in the first quarter fell more than expected. Inflation erodes the value of long-term securities over time, and investors compensate for that expected loss by driving yields higher, the opposite direction from price. 
 But short-term issues held their ground on firming hopes that the Federal Reserve would make another deep interest rate cut at its policy meeting next week, keeping yields on two-year notes pinned near their lowest levels since late 1998.
Recent signs of economic weakness, including news that the economy shed more jobs in April than in any other month in the last decade, have bolstered expectations that the Fed will respond with a fifth cut of half a percentage point in its campaign to revive economic growth.
Analysts said new government debt sales coupled with a large corporate bond sale also weighed on longer-dated Treasuries. The Treasury sold $13 billion of new five-year notes in the first leg of its quarterly refinancing, while the big long-distance phone company WorldCom Inc. sold $12.2 billion of new debt in one of the largest corporate debt sales ever.
"It is a huge amount of securities between the agencies and corporates and now Treasuries that the investment community has to digest," said John Spinello, Treasury market strategist at Merrill Lynch.
The WorldCom deal drew more than $21 billion in bids, according to people close to the sale.
The benchmark 10-year note fell 10/32, to 98 5/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, climbed to 5.24 percent, from 5.19 percent. The 30-year bond tumbled 30/32, to 94 27/32. Its yield grew to 5.74 percent, from 5.67 percent. The selling of longer-dated Treasuries in favor of short-term issues caused the difference in yields between them to widen to new seven-year highs.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of five-year notes:

Price: 99.845

Technology Shares Gain But Dow and S.& P. Decline

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq composite index rose yesterday as investors hoped for a positive earnings report from Cisco Systems, the networking equipment giant, after markets closed.
 The Nasdaq climbed 25.20 points, or 1.16 percent, to 2,198.77, as other makers of networking equipment rose with Cisco. A decline in Dell Computer limited the index's gains. 
 "Investors are betting on a turn in the market" for Cisco's equipment, said John Davidson, chief investment officer at Circle Trust in Stamford, Conn. 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell for the fourth time in five days after a report showed that workers' productivity unexpectedly dropped in the first quarter.
American Express declined, leading the Dow to a loss of 51.66 points, or 0.47 percent, to 10,883.51, after a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst said the slowing economy would hurt the credit card business.
General Electric and Citigroup drove down the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which lost 2.31 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,261.20.
Market breadth was positive on both the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. Volume on the Big Board was about 990 million shares.
In regular-session trading, Cisco rose $1.12, to $20.37, on market-leading volume of more than 160 million shares. After the bell, the company reported profit from operations of 3 cents a share, surpassing analysts' forecasts of 2 cents a share, though down sharply from 13 cents in the quarter a year earlier. Cisco stock fell after hours to $19.74.
Earlier, Christopher Stix of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said that signs of an improved outlook for Cisco's sales to large business customers persuaded him to raise his rating on the stock to outperform from neutral. He added that past performance suggested Cisco shares anticipate changes in earnings growth by about six months. Because Cisco recently won business from China Telecom and Global Crossing, Mr. Stix said, and is expected to get more at a time when cost cuts may improve profit margins, it is now "timely to buy."
Among other networking producers, Ciena surged $6.32 yesterday, to $61.60, and Juniper Networks rose $1.82, to $58.90.
Some other groups of stocks fell after the Labor Department reported that productivity last quarter dropped for the first time since 1995. Analysts had forecast a gain. Some investors interpreted the decline, and a jump in labor costs, as further evidence that the slowing economy is squeezing corporate profit.
Still, the modest declines in the Dow and the S.& P. 500, and the rise in the Nasdaq, Mr. Davidson said, were encouraging in light of the recent signs of economic weakness. Investors, he said, had "seen that the market has absorbed an awful lot of bad news and not been destroyed by it."
American Express fell $1.93, to $41.30, after Kenneth Posner of Morgan Stanley said rising unemployment and bankruptcies could cause higher-than-expected credit losses. Mr. Posner lowered his rating on the shares to neutral from outperform.
Citigroup, the largest financial services company, declined 85 cents, to $49.80. General Electric dropped 48 cents, to $49.48. J. P. Morgan Chase slid $1.45, to $47.75.
Dell fell $1.08, to $24.83. The company, one of the biggest personal computer makers worldwide, said it would eliminate 3,000 to 4,000 jobs in the next six months, or about 10 percent of its work force.
Other computer producers also fell. Compaq lost 27 cents, to $16.83; Hewlett-Packard dropped 34 cents, to $27.33, Apple slid 39 cents, to $24.57; and Gateway declined 35 cents, to $18.
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing dropped $1.54, to $116.36. The chief executive, James McNerney, said at the company's annual meeting that there were "no signs" the global economy would improve anytime soon.
Shares of Cablevision Systems dropped $4.70, to $59.80, and Comcast lost $1.10, to $43.65, after the cable television companies said they would spend more to finish upgrading their systems for digital TV.
Carter-Wallace fell $2.57, to $19.99, after it agreed to split up and sell itself in pieces for $1.12 billion. Carter-Wallace's consumer division, which produces Arrid deodorant among other things, will go to a venture that includes Church & Dwight, while its health business will be sold to MedPointe Capital Partners.
Genesis Microchip, a maker of chips that process video and graphic images, rose $3.84, to $18.99. The company reported a loss of 15 cents a share in its fiscal fourth quarter, a penny narrower than forecast.

Flaws in Voucher Findings

BYLINE:  By Richard Rothstein; E-mail: rrothstein@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WITH education high on the national agenda, some scholars have been tempted to publish sensational but premature conclusions. These can exploit policy makers' inability to distinguish simplistic analyses from those that stand up to closer examination.
 This was apparently the case with an analysis of Florida's voucher program, published in February by the conservative Manhattan Institute. The author, Jay P. Greene, a former University of Texas professor and now a Harvard researcher, concluded that Florida scores showed schools "rising to the challenge of vouchers." On the eve of Congressional debate over President Bush's plan to give students at low-performing schools federal money for private school tuition vouchers, Dr. Greene announced that Mr. Bush's proposal would work as well. 
 "That's not a theory," Dr. Greene stated, "but proven fact."
In Florida, schools are rated A, B, C, D or F. If a school gets a second F in four years, its students can get state vouchers for private school tuition. Dr. Greene concluded that this makes public schools improve.
His method was creative. He reasoned that schools in the bottom of the D category were very similar to those in the top of the F category. He showed that after failing one time, higher-scoring F schools posted greater gains than lower-scoring D schools. Because these schools were otherwise alike, Dr. Greene stated that a threat of vouchers must have made F schools improve more rapidly.
His claims garnered extensive press coverage, but his report made no mention of having been submitted, before publication, to experts expected to express caution or even doubt about the results. Such review is normal for academic studies where complex statistics or extraordinary claims are involved. 
Had Dr. Greene's report undergone this process, nonpartisan scholars might well have suggested an obvious natural experiment to test his conclusions. Other states also rate schools, but threaten nonvoucher interventions for failure. If in these states, schools labeled failures improved rapidly when vouchers were not threatened, it would suggest that vouchers did not cause Florida's more recent gains.
Indeed, before 1999, Florida itself already grouped schools by test scores, but students in the lowest category did not get vouchers. Douglas Harris, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, analyzed the earlier Florida data. Dr. Harris found that before 1999, higher-scoring schools in the failing group also gained more than lower-scoring schools in the next group. The subsequent voucher policy apparently had no added effect.
Others have tested this elsewhere. At Duke University, Prof. Helen F. Ladd and Elizabeth J. Glennie, a researcher, examined North Carolina's accountability plan. There, schools are ranked "exemplary," "meets expectations," "no recognition" or "low performing." Low-performing schools are not given vouchers; instead, state experts intervene to improve the schools.
Dr. Ladd and Dr. Glennie found that as in Florida, higher-scoring schools in the bottom group gained more than lower-scoring schools in the next group. The researchers concluded that Dr. Greene's Florida results "probably have little or nothing to do with vouchers." If vouchers explained Florida gains, "it is unlikely we would have found comparable patterns" in North Carolina.
Texas has a similar system. There, too, students in failing schools do not get vouchers, but state experts intervene.
Scholars at the Charles A. Dana Center at the University of Texas have frequently defended the state's system against partisan attacks by critics of President Bush when he was governor. So it is noteworthy that a Dana Center analyst, Amanda Brownson, challenged Dr. Greene's conclusions by applying his method to Texas scores.
As in Florida and North Carolina, Ms. Brownson found that higher performing schools in the failing category posted greater gains than lower-performing schools in the next-to-bottom group.
These studies of North Carolina, Texas and earlier Florida scores are being published by the Economic Policy Institute, together with a summary by Martin Carnoy, a Stanford University professor. Dr. Carnoy speculates that these studies, along with Dr. Greene's, may only show a "scarlet letter" effect. Being termed failing is embarrassing and motivates schools to improve, whether vouchers or other interventions follow.
As education debates get more politicized, special burdens are placed upon scholars and the public. Academics ought to resist the temptation to publish hurried findings, even though exciting results assure easy publicity. And nonscholarly audiences should be more wary of researchers who fail to discipline themselves in this way.

Donna, Prima Donna

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After I saw "Town and Country," the strenuously libidinous comedy with Warren Beatty, Goldie Hawn and Diane Keaton, I was walking out behind three teenage girls.
 "Boring," said one. 
 "Cheating is so boring," agreed the second.
"Totally," yawned the third.
In a movie column in The Los Angeles Times yesterday, Patrick Goldstein said that "Town and Country" seemed dated by a quarter-century, underscoring the fact that sex farces with wife-swapping and breathless batrachian grapplings are a defunct genre in Hollywood. 
"The more commonplace sex has become in our culture, the less of a place it has in our movies," he wrote. "Sexual humor needs sexual repression to work its magic." 
Maybe because politics is one of the few spheres of life still steeped in sexual repression, it is also one of the few where the Feydeau-style sex farce still thrives, complete with angry wives storming in one door as agile mistresses scoot out another.
First we had the Bill, Hillary and Monica production of "What's New, Pussycat?" Then the Newt, Marianne and Callista version of "School for Scandal." Now we have yet another act of Rudy, Donna and Judi in "The Confounded Husband."
Donna Hanover has asked a judge to issue an order barring Judi Nathan, the mayor's "paramour," as Donna people refer to her, from Gracie Mansion.
"The paramour came into the house," one Donna ally says. "It's appalling. What kind of a woman behaves like this?" A veteran Donna watcher agrees: "She can't have this hussy chasing her out of her own house." 
It's a perfect New York saga of desire and real estate: the mayor and his wife locked in a titanic twilight struggle over a house they don't even own.
Ms. Hanover's legal maneuver against her husband is a brazen bid to control the ultimate control freak.
Her lawyers are arguing that Gracie Mansion is "the marital residence" and not a public facility. It's a tricky argument, given that Ms. Hanover is chairwoman of the Gracie Mansion Conservancy, which protects the house as a public institution.
She apparently does not want her two children -- Andrew, 15, and Caroline, 11 -- to meet Ms. Nathan until after they move out of Gracie Mansion when the mayor's term ends. 
"If the court ruled that Gracie Mansion was a private home, it would set a dangerous precedent," says Raoul Felder, the mayor's divorce lawyer. "What about all future mayors who would now have to think that they're living there at their wives' pleasure?"
The mayor and his wife are not legally separated, but they have begun divorce proceedings. They have been estranged for several years and the mayor has been dating Ms. Nathan, a sales manager for Bristol-Myers Squibb, for two years, taking her to so many parades and other public events that she now has her own police protection. He has been staying in the guest room for the last year, pals say.
"He can't invite his lady friend to the public part of the house? It's absurd," Mr. Felder says. "Judith Nathan has been at a handful of events in the public part, but she has never been in the private quarters."
Even though Rudy and Donna barely speak and have to negotiate every move -- including the mayor's trip with his son to the White House last week to hang out with President Bush and the Yankees -- she has continued to enjoy her perch as first lady, attending panels, shivas, wakes and the premiere of "The Producers." 
But as Mr. Felder dryly points out, "There is no title called First Lady of New York."
A Donna person explains that Ms. Hanover wants to stay in Gracie Mansion "for the stability of the kids, so that the kids can have their own rooms," and because she can't move back into the Giuliani apartment on East 86th Street because it is sublet until the end of the year.
"I'll happily be her rental agent," Mr. Felder says. "It's a recession. There are a lot of apartments available in New York. There comes a time we all have to get a life."
Even if her husband humiliated her, the house goes with his job. And why would you want your kids to live in the corner of a triangle? Ms. Hanover should gracefully vacate the premises.
It's time for her to say "Good night, Gracie Mansion."

HEADLINE: In Study of Nation's Worst Traffic, New York Must Yield 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 8 

 BODY:
The drivers of the South and the West, squirming ever longer in their upholstered commutes to work, can take perverse pleasure in a validation of their suffering. Just as they had always suspected, they had it worse -- much worse -- than the eight million residents of New York City.
 From Seattle to Los Angeles, and around the horn to Houston and Atlanta, drivers learned this week that they wasted much more of their time in road delays than New Yorkers did, according to a national mobility study by the Texas Transportation Institute, a research agency connected to Texas A&M University. 
 Where the average resident of those metropolitan areas loses more than 50 hours a year to traffic delays, New Yorkers lose an average of 34 hours a year, the study found. This put the nation's largest city in the unusual position of coming in 23rd in something unpleasant. (Los Angeles, of course, was the enduring emblem of vehicular immobility.) 
"They don't even know what traffic is in New York," said Gary Hudgins, a truck driver for Fulton County, taking a break at a gasoline station here this morning. "I've spent entire days of my life in traffic jams here, more times than I can count. I'd like to see a New Yorker come down here and try to deal with I-285 every day."
Of course, many New Yorkers would beg to differ, particularly the ones honking right now at the entrance to the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, or the ones who don't know they are about to spend an hour on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway because of some taxi's boiling radiator. They might point out that, of course, their traffic, averaged among eight million people, would be less than that of a city like Nashville, which came in 10th on the list, up from 21 the year before. With 40 percent of the New York region using mass transit to get to work, of course, they might look better on paper than cities with barely a bus system.
And they would, in a sense, be right.
"Yeah, it's true that the benefits all those people get by taking transit aren't really factored into the study," said Tim Lomax, a transportation research engineer who was co-author of the study. "And the bigger cities wind up with lower congestion levels, because their congested cores are diluted by suburban areas."
But they would also be wrong. Residents of the post-war South and West do not need a study to tell them that they are spending more time in their cars. They do not need to be reminded that with few sidewalks in their residential developments, they have to turn on their motors just to pick up a carton of milk.
"You get off in the afternoon, you're worn out as it is, and then you have to face the traffic, sometimes for an hour -- it just adds insult to injury," said Frank Bennett, owner of a learning center in Marietta, a suburb of Atlanta. Mr. Bennett switched careers in part because of his commute. "That's time that is basically taken directly away from your family."
Bill Miller, a political consultant in Austin, Tex., which is No. 7 on the delays-per-person list, described his daily strategy this way: "Know the short-cuts, leave early and stay late -- these are your only three options and even those don't always work."
Congestion in the Sun Belt has largely been the unintended result of a conscious choice by many residents to live in low-density neighborhoods far from commercial and employment centers. Many newcomers to the region were escaping the high densities of the Northeast, but it was those densities that justified the investments in transit that New York began making more than a century ago, and which, at least in studies like this one, continue to pay dividends.
"Transit has a huge amount to do with New York's showing," said Roy Kienitz, executive director of the Surface Transportation Policy Project, a research group that put out a parallel study on Monday estimating that New York City's congestion level was actually 68th in the nation, behind even Albany's. "There are many reasons why transit does not work too well in newer cities, mostly because of the growth policies they've pursued."
But even with millions of people in New York using mass transit every day, plenty of drivers stuck in traffic were convinced that New York should be at the top of any list of congested areas.
"Impossible!" was the immediate response of Ralph Morales when he was told of the Texas transportation study. Mr. Morales navigates his worn cream-colored Plymouth all over the city every day to bring deodorizing equipment to restaurants, "We should be in the top three at least. Nothing less than that."
Jerry Oleske had a similar response as he tried to make his way from Lower Manhattan through the Holland Tunnel to his home in Madison, N.J., this evening. 
"It will take me an hour and a half to get to Morris County from here," said Mr. Oleske, a lawyer who rides a a crimson and cream Valkyrie motorcycle. Without traffic, he said, it takes a little over a half-hour. "If there are cities with traffic worse than this, I wouldn't want to live in any of them."
The Texas study is mostly car-oriented, enhancing the prominence of car-oriented cities on its list. Although it studied the effect that transit has on the roads by removing thousands of vehicles, it said nothing about the commutes of people who took rail transit every day, as Mr. Lomax acknowledged. That number is huge in New York, Boston and Chicago, but most newer cities have been reluctant to spend money on rail lines.
Thus, New York has 21 times the total hours of traffic delays of Nashville, but per-person, Nashville's delays are 23 percent greater than New York's, because almost everyone in Nashville drives. Nashville has been talking about a commuter rail system to cope with the growth of its suburban counties, two of which grew by more than 50 percent during the 1990's. But last year, one Nashville neighborhood refused to accept a rail station, saying it would increase traffic on local streets. Planners are less than amused by these paradoxes.
"There's no way we can build enough roads to take care of this problem," said Maynard Pate, executive director of the Greater Nashville Regional Council, which coordinates multicounty mass transit programs. "We need to tailor our development to reduce congestion in the future."
The economic growth that led to such congestion has itself been stymied by the traffic. Barbara Marks, a recruiter for Questalent, an executive recruiting company in Atlanta, said she frequently had to persuade executives in the Northeast that the traffic was not as bad as they had heard, and she said some just were not convinced. Business leaders and environmental groups have joined forces in several states to lobby for "smart growth" policies and transit projects, and there are signs that a traffic backlash has increased the growth of many urban cores.
But the study showed that congestion was generally getting worse in every size city and that it was unlikely that any amount of investment would ever bring a Los Angeles, a Houston or a Denver down to New York's level on the Texas survey. Which, whether they admit it or not, is just the way many people like it.
"People take this weird pride in saying they've got the worst traffic," Mr. Kienitz, the transit policy researcher, said. "They want to be able to dine out on how bad their commute is, and if the statistics don't bear them out, they just feel cheated."

HEADLINE: After 6 Years, First-Quarter Productivity Fell in U.S. 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The productivity of American workers, which rose sharply as new technologies took hold and served as the great source of prosperity in the late 1990's, fell in the first quarter for the first time in six years.
 The decline of 0.1 percent, the Labor Department reported yesterday, reflected the sagging economy, particularly weakness in manufacturing. Output, in effect, rose more slowly than the number of hours worked, making labor less productive. 
 The surprising weakness reopened the debate among economists over how much of the heralded productivity revival of recent years will endure. 
"There seems to be a sustained rise in productivity," said Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis. "The still unanswered question is how much will last and how much will turn out to be cyclical."
Unit labor costs -- the amount of labor expense to produce, say, a pair of shoes or a computer -- rose sharply in the first quarter. Americans produced more goods and services than they had previously, but they were paid more and worked even longer hours to do so. As a result, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated, labor costs rose at a 5.2 percent annual rate. 
For now, the Federal Reserve is expected to focus on the slowing economy, continuing to cut interest rates until growth revives. But over the long run, weak productivity would put pressure on employers to raise prices, stoking inflation.
The squeeze on profits from higher costs is prompting employers everywhere to cut hours, eliminate overtime and shed workers through layoffs. That process is expected to continue for a while, increasing unemployment and making workers more fearful about the future.
But as that plays out, the productivity growth rate is likely to rise again.
"The collapse in the first quarter is 90 percent a temporary phenomenon," Mr. Varvares said.
Productivity measures the average output of the nation's work force in a period of time. If 10 factory workers, for example, produced 102.8 bathrobes an hour, on average, up from 100 the year before, then their productivity growth rate would be 2.8 percent.
That, in fact, has been the average annual improvement since 1995, when the boom got rolling. But over the last three quarters, as the economy has slowed, so has productivity -- from 3 percent in the summer quarter to 2 percent in the fall to minus 0.1 percent this winter.
Much of the collapse came in manufacturing, where the annualized productivity growth rate was a meager 0.3 percent, far below its usual vigorous performance as the economy's most efficient sector. The first-quarter downturn in manufacturing was concentrated in computer production, which had contributed mightily to the national productivity revival as the speed and power of computers has advanced.
Given its importance, productivity gets surprisingly little attention in the array of economic statistics issued each month. But when productivity rises, the extra revenue generated can be added to wages or profits or both. Or the higher quality -- the faster computers, for example -- enhance the productivity of workers who use computers, and thus the national income.
On the other hand, when productivity weakens or falls, as it did in the first quarter, then profits and wages are squeezed. Employers react by either raising prices -- difficult to do in a slowing economy -- or cutting costs, often through layoffs.
"No matter how fast businesses have tried to adjust, they just have not been able to keep up with the slowing economy," said Joel L. Naroff, an economic consultant.
Employers in fact shed an estimated 223,000 jobs in April -- the largest number since the last recession a decade ago -- and the unemployment rate rose to 4.5 percent from 4.3 percent. 
For the longer term, the pace of productivity has profound consequences. Future budget surpluses, for example, may fall short of the $5.6 trillion projected by the Congressional Budget Office over the next 10 years if productivity fails to rise at the 2.7 percent annual rate the agency expects.
"Let's say productivity averages only 2 percent a year instead of 2.7 percent," said Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist. "That shrinks the surplus by $1.7 trillion."
The first-quarter productivity decline -- the first since an 0.8 percent decline in the first quarter of 1995 -- focused attention on a subject of endless debate among economists: whether information technology has lifted the American worker to a permanently higher level of productivity and efficiency -- and that after nearly a quarter-century of sluggish productivity growth averaging only 1.3 percent a year.
Nearly everyone's answer is yes. Computers, the Internet, advanced software and all the other trappings of the information age have made workers more efficient. But part of the revival since 1995 is cyclical -- a result, for example, of workers pushing themselves to fill the flood of new orders, and employers running factories more efficiently than they normally would.
Mr. Varvares and many others argue that the productivity growth rate will settle in at 2.5 to 3 percent a year, while Mr. Gordon says the long-term growth will be closer to 2 percent, with most of that coming from the use of computers. 
"I will not take the ultrapessimistic view that all of the productivity gains are going to disappear as the economy slows," said Mr. Gordon, who had been the chief spokesman for just that point of view until recently, "but some of it will."

HEADLINE: California Utility Accuses El Paso of Inflating Gas Prices 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and LOWELL BERGMAN 

 BODY:
One of California's struggling utility companies accused the El Paso Corporation yesterday of artificially inflating the price of natural gas in the state by $3.7 billion over the last year by using its partial control of a major pipeline to curtail the flow of gas. 
 In a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the utility, Southern California Edison, said that market manipulation by El Paso had cost Edison alone at least an extra $1 billion for electricity generated by gas-fueled power plants over the 13 months ended March 31. 
 The commission is reviewing a complaint by California regulators that a chief reason for the state's soaring natural gas prices during the last year was market manipulation by El Paso, which owns the largest pipeline connecting Southern California with gas-producing regions in the Southwest. 
In a response, also filed yesterday, an El Paso subsidiary said that the high prices for gas in California came from "unexpected and unprecedented demand and an insufficient supply infrastructure," not from withholding of supply. California's energy problems, the company said, reflect "more than a decade's worth of bad public policy decisions that are now coming back to haunt the state." 
"This was a car wreck waiting to happen," said Joseph Kalt, a Harvard economics professor working on the case for El Paso. Mr. Kalt attributed the high prices to a severe shortage of pipeline capacity and resistance over the years by California officials to build more.
Southern California Edison, which is supporting the state's complaint, said its claims were based on records that it recently obtained as part of the discovery process in the federal proceeding. 
The controversy stems from a deal in February 2000 in which one El Paso subsidiary, El Paso Natural Gas, sold a sister company, El Paso Merchant Energy, the right to ship 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas a day on the pipeline. That is about 30 percent of the pipeline's total capacity and about one-sixth of California's daily demand. 
In March, the F.E.R.C. ruled that there was nothing improper in the deal between the two El Paso units but ordered further investigation into whether the company had manipulated the gas market in California. State regulators say that the price paid for gas at the California end of El Paso's pipeline plays a large role in setting the price for all gas sold in the state -- and, consequently, is a primary component in the cost of electricity and heating. 
According to sealed documents that are part of filings in the federal proceedings, El Paso Merchant executives said in internal memorandums that the unit's deal for capacity on the pipeline would give it "more control" of gas markets, including the "ability to influence the physical market" to benefit the company's financial positions. El Paso officials, citing a protective order prohibiting parties from discussing the sealed documents, have declined to comment on the documents except to say they have been taken out of context. 
In Southern California Edison's filing yesterday, the Brattle Group, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., hired by the utility, said that El Paso Merchant "withheld significant amounts of capacity from the market" between June and November of last year. 
During that period, the consultants said, El Paso Merchant used just 53 percent of the capacity it controlled on the pipeline that goes into the delivery system operated by the Southern California Gas unit of Sempra Energy, even though it would have been profitable to use more capacity. Other shippers made "significantly greater" use of the capacity they controlled through contracts with El Paso Natural Gas, the consultants said.
In its filing yesterday, Edison also attributed some blame to Southern California Gas -- a utility that provides gas service to homes and businesses across Southern California -- saying it did not store enough natural gas last year in preparation for the winter heating season. 
In its response yesterday, El Paso Merchant stated that it had "consistently made an effort to maintain high utilization" of the pipeline capacity. However, operational, service and scheduling restrictions pose an obstacle to that, while "credit, or the risk of not getting paid for the gas, is an important consideration."
On the portions of the pipeline capacity that are not hemmed in by special restrictions, Mr. Kalt said, El Paso Merchant, since June, has consistently offered more than 95 percent of its unused capacity to other shippers on terms consistent with the rest of the industry.
He said the numbers Edison cited were extremely misleading because they did not account for the restrictions imposed on El Paso Merchant's capacity. "To put out numbers like that, and not tell people that you are comparing apples and oranges, is misleading and diverts attention away from the real problems California faces," he said. 
Denise King, a spokeswoman for Southern California Gas, said that the company had met its obligation to serve its core residential and small-business customers. Some large industrial customers and power generators that hold storage capacity on the company's system did not store as much gas as they could have last year, she said, but that was their decision. 
Beginning in November, prices began to soar at the California border, and by early December the difference between the price of gas in Texas and its spot price at the California border -- known as the basis differential -- peaked at almost $50 per million British thermal units, or more than five times what gas cost in other parts of the country. (One million B.T.U.'s roughly equals 1,000 cubic feet of gas.) 
According to Edison's consultants, had El Paso Merchant fully used its capacity last year, and had Southern California Gas properly filled its core storage inventory, the gas market would have been considerably less constrained. Instead, El Paso Merchant's withholding of capacity increased the basis differential an average of $8.28 per million B.T.U.'s from December to March, according to Edison's filing. 
In all, the Brattle Group concluded that El Paso Merchant overcharged customers by at least $864.3 million on sales of gas at the California border during the 13-month period, only part of the $3.7 billion in higher costs that have affected California over all, the consultants said, because of El Paso Merchant's actions and the lack of gas storage that resulted.
El Paso Merchant denies that it has reaped large profits from the pipeline capacity, saying it has entered into hedging transactions that limited its risk but also its potential profit from rising gas prices in California. Mr. Kalt, for example, said that during December -- when the average basis differential was $17 per million B.T.U.'s -- El Paso Merchant's average differential on natural gas it sold into California was $3.04, after offsetting hedging losses.
"When the price spiked, they weren't going to capture that spike," Mr. Kalt said. "It's the most misleading part of Edison's case." 
El Paso Merchant also said prices for natural gas sold into California had not come down, even though the company decided earlier this year to relinquish the controversial pipeline capacity, which, after the end of May, will mostly be controlled by other companies. Prices actually rose after this was disclosed, the company's filing stated, and "this outcome is the opposite of what would have been expected" if the market believed El Paso Merchant had been trying to manipulate prices higher in California by restricting supply.

HEADLINE: Sotheby's 20th-Century Art Auction Fetches $54 Million 

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
Despite the rocky economy, when the prices are right and the material is top notch, the art market rallies with stunning vigor. 
 Sotheby's York Avenue salesroom in Manhattan was a bidding battleground last night with record prices being made as paintings by artists like Francis Bacon, Max Beckmann and Joan Miro were seriously fought over by multiple bidders. 
 The atmosphere could not have been more different than the one at Monday evening's auction when Phillips, de Pury & Luxembourg held its sale of Impressionist and modern art and, for the most part, the salesroom was dead, leaving 15 of the 41 works unsold. 
But the ingredients of last night's sale were just right. The 62 works were mostly 20th-century art collected over 50 years by Stanley J. Seeger, a reclusive American who lives in London. In the art world Mr. Seeger's name is instantly recognizable. Heir to a family fortune from lumber and petroleum, he is a quiet collector who buys millions of dollars' worth of art while keeping a low profile. Most pieces for sale last night were bought by him in the 1980's. 
As a collector Mr. Seeger does things on instinct, and in 1993 he became a celebrity of sorts. Just when the art market was in the doldrums, he decided to sell a group of 88 Picassos representing 13 years of collecting. Before the sale at Sotheby's in New York, naysayers said the auction house was taking a big risk by flooding the market with Picassos, which could drive prices down. But just the opposite happened. Every Picasso sold, many for double their estimates at a sale that totaled $32 million.
Last night's sale was another triumph. Of the works offered, only three failed to sell. The sale totaled $54 million, soaring above its $39 million high estimate. Sotheby's experts purposely kept estimates low to encourage bidding.
The evening's superstar was a triptych by Bacon, "Studies of the Human Body" (1979), in which the artist grapples with his obsession with Michelangelo. Five bidders tried hard to buy the triptych, which sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $8.5 million, a record for the artist and well above the work's $6 million high estimate. 
Miro's "Nocturne" brought another high price. One in a series of 23 gouaches called "The Constellations" painted from January 1940 to September 1941, the dream-inspired composition is an intricate field with many of the artist's signature forms. The work was bought by Robert Mnuchin, chairman of C & M Arts, a Manhattan gallery, for $5.6 million, a record price for a work on paper by the artist and way above its $3.5 million high estimate. In 1983 Mr. Seeger bought the Miro for $361,800 at Sotheby's in London.
(Final prices include Sotheby's commission: 20 percent of the first $15,000, 15 percent of the next $85,000 and 10 percent of any amount over $100,000. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
A painting of the Greek mythological heros Perseus and Hercules by Beckmann was another favorite. Martin Zimet of French & Company, a Manhattan dealer, bought it for a record $3.8 million, more than four times its high $900,000 estimate. (Tomorrow night Sotheby's is to auction a rare Beckmann self-portrait that is expected to bring between $7 million and $10 million. Judging from the appetite for works by the artist, the painting is expected to easily top last night's record price.)
In some cases prices have soared since Mr. Seeger bought many of the artworks. Two small paintings by Jasper Johns made a return on the collector's investment. "Colored Alphabet" (1959), an example of one of his Jasper Johns's signature images, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $3.7 million, nicely above its $3 million high estimate. Mr. Seeger paid $3.5 million for it at Christie's in New York in 1989, during the height of the market.
Another Johns, "Green Target" (1958), sold to a telephone buyer for $643,750, between its $500,000 to $700,000 estimate but far more than the $392,000 Mr. Seeger paid for it at Sotheby's in London in 1994. 
A Braque cubist still life circa 1913, "Glass, Pipe and Newspaper," sold for its high estimate, $2 million. At Sotheby's in London in 1986, Mr. Seeger paid $758,620 for the work, one in a series painted on oval canvases suggesting tabletops and using Braque's signature stencil-type lettering evoking a newspaper.
A Picasso "Seated Woman" saw six bidders willing to happily spend far more than $1.5 million. An abstract image from 1939, it depicts his mistress Dora Maar wearing a bright red hat and seated in an armchair. Mr. Seeger bought it in 1996, also at Sotheby's in London for $1.4 million. 
The sale included many works on paper. Among the top fliers was a three-quarter view of a man's back from 1910 by Egon Schiele. Estimated at $300,000 to $400,000, it sold for a whopping $907,750 to an unidentified bidder standing in the back of the salesroom. Mr. Seeger bought it for $165,000 at Sotheby's in 1986.
After the sale Tobias Meyer, the director of Sotheby's contemporary art department worldwide, said the secret to the auction's success was that Mr. Seeger trusted him to price the sale. "It's the glorious and rare combination of beautiful things at conservative estimates," Mr. Meyer said.

HEADLINE: Despite Denial, Torricelli Aided In Donor's Deal 

BYLINE:  By TIM GOLDEN and DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

 BODY:
Soon after Senator Robert G. Torricelli began his relationship with David Chang, the wealthy political contributor who says he gave the senator unreported gifts and cash, Mr. Torricelli intervened in an international business deal to help Mr. Chang recover a debt of more than $70 million.
 Mr. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, has repeatedly denied helping Mr. Chang, who was seeking payment for grain he had shipped on credit to the government of North Korea. Last year, Mr. Torricelli's office said he had refused to support one of Mr. Chang's appeals on the matter because it would have violated the senator's strong belief in the need to isolate "rogue regimes." 
 But on Sept. 22, 1995, while Mr. Torricelli was still in the House of Representatives and was an influential member of its Foreign Affairs Committee, he wrote to North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, warning that his country's failure to repay Mr. Chang could imperil any hopes it might have for better relations with the United States. 
"I hope you will join me in trying to resolve this issue so that there will be no matters standing in the path of the expanding U.S. trade and investment in North Korea," Mr. Torricelli wrote to the diplomat, Park Gil Yoon, according to a copy of the letter obtained by The New York Times.
The appeal produced no apparent results for Mr. Chang, who continued for several more years to seek help with the problem from Mr. Torricelli and other politicians. But the letter, which has also been obtained by federal prosecutors who are investigating Mr. Torricelli's activities, could be significant to any effort to charge him with taking illegal gifts.
Under federal law, gratuities to a public official are illegal only when they are given in exchange for a specific official action, whether that action is taken or merely promised. Since a 1999 Supreme Court ruling that raised the threshold of proof in such cases, legal experts have continued to debate how close a connection must be established.
Lawyers and aides to Mr. Torricelli have insisted that he never helped Mr. Chang try to recover the debt, which the businessman estimated at $71 million. They have also suggested that it would have been implausible for the senator to promise any help because his staff had quickly determined that there was nothing he could do to solve the problem.
But in statements to investigators, Mr. Chang has said Mr. Torricelli told him again and again in the three years after the letter was written that he was taking or would take further steps in the matter, people involved in the case said. At least two other witnesses in the case have told the authorities that they, too, heard Mr. Torricelli make such assurances, these people said. 
According to people involved in the case, Mr. Chang has told investigators that he gave the gifts in an effort to ingratiate himself with the senator that was motivated primarily by his North Korean debt problem. He said the gifts included an $8,100 Rolex watch, Italian suits, a large-screen television set and tens of thousands of dollars in cash. Other witnesses, including several New Jersey merchants, have corroborated at least some aspects of Mr. Chang's account, these people said.
Mr. Torricelli has not denied taking gifts from Mr. Chang, but said that he took no "illegal gifts" and that Mr. Chang was once his friend.
Senate ethics rules, which prohibit legislators or their aides from accepting expensive gifts, make a limited exception for gifts received from friends of long standing when they are publicly disclosed.
A lawyer for Mr. Torricelli, Ted Wells, declined to comment on the discrepancy between the contents of Mr. Torricelli's letter and the earlier assurances of the senator and his staff that he had done nothing to help Mr. Chang with the debt.
"This letter appears to be a routine constituent request from a local businessman and is similar to letters written for Mr. Chang by other members of Congress on the same issue," Mr. Wells said.
At least 10 other legislators -- including former Senators Bill Bradley and Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey and Representative Benjamin A. Gilman of New York -- wrote similar letters to senior North Korean officials between November 1995 and February 1996, according to copies of those letters.
Mr. Chang has been cooperating with the government since pleading guilty last June to obstructing justice and to campaign finance violations. His lawyer, Bradley D. Simon, said he could not comment on Mr. Torricelli's letter.
Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for the office of the United States attorney in Manhattan, which is handling the case, also declined to comment.
Mr. Chang turned to Mr. Torricelli for help in the summer of 1995, associates of both men said. At that point, court records show, Mr. Chang had been trying for more than two years to win repayment from the North Koreans for tons of corn and wheat he had shipped to the country in the early 1990's and was coming under growing pressure from creditors.
Mr. Chang had also been trying, without success, to persuade the Clinton administration to compensate him from a pool of $15 million in North Korean assets frozen by the United States. Mr. Torricelli, who had long been interested in Korean affairs, was encouraging, Mr. Chang has said.
Not long after meeting the businessman, Mr. Torricelli ordered his staff to draft the letter. According to one of his senior aides at the time, he became incensed when he found out one afternoon that it had not yet been completed. 
"Bob went ballistic," said the former aide, Georgianna Evans, who resigned a few months later. "He was screaming, 'I want this letter sent out now! This guy can be valuable to us!' "
The one-page letter, written on Congressional stationery, began: "As diplomatic and economic relations improve between our two countries, it is important that we resolve any pending financial matters. In that vein, I would like your assistance in settling a debt owed by North Korea to Nikko Enterprises."
Mr. Torricelli noted that the company, which was owned by Mr. Chang, was in his district and had been the first in the United States to win a license to trade with North Korea. "Settling any debt owed to them is of particular importance," he wrote. "Other U.S. companies seeking to trade with North Korea will naturally turn to Nikko Enterprises for advice and to hear of their experiences." 
Mr. Torricelli offered to meet with the ambassador, but Mr. Wells would not comment on whether he ever did. A spokesman for the North Korean Mission to the United Nations, Hong Je Ryong, said he had no information about the matter.
The possibility that Mr. Torricelli intervened in the debt problem was first raised in April 2000 in a document filed by prosecutors. The document stated that Mr. Chang had "received and/or solicited" the senator's help on four matters: the North Korean debt, Mr. Chang's attempt to buy a $1.5 billion life insurance company in South Korea, letters of introduction for business associates, and a college recommendation letter for a friend.
One of Mr. Torricelli's lawyers, Abbe D. Lowell, denied that the senator had assisted Mr. Chang with any of those issues, calling the prosecutors' assertion "totally inaccurate" with respect to the senator's actions. 
Interviews with South Korean and United States officials and letters written by Mr. Torricelli show that the senator lobbied extensively in 1998 and 1999 in support of Mr. Chang's attempt to buy the South Korean insurance company. Mr. Chang has told investigators that he promised Mr. Torricelli a $10 million commission if his bid for the insurer was successful, people involved in the case said.
In a statement last fall, Mr. Torricelli's office said he refused to help Mr. Chang when one of his lawyers had sought a letter endorsing the businessman's claim to part of the frozen North Korean assets. A handful of other legislators, both Republicans and Democrats, did write such letters for Mr. Chang at the request of one of his lobbyists and business associates, former Representative James A. Courter, a New Jersey Republican.
The statement by Mr. Torricelli's office referred to his ardent support for the United States embargo against Cuba: "The senator is one of the strongest voices in Congress supporting the use of economic embargoes and the freezing of assets against rogue regimes. He believed that such a letter was inconsistent with his policy and would not participate, even for a New Jersey company and contributor."
Legal experts said that if Mr. Torricelli were charged with taking illegal gratuities from Mr. Chang, it might be useful to his defense if he could show that he never acted on the businessman's behalf.
"Formally raising the issue with the North Koreans and even making a minimal effort to help Chang would probably give prosecutors enough of a nexus to charge him under the statute," William B. Canfield, a Republican lawyer and former counsel to the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, said of Mr. Torricelli.
According to documents from Mr. Torricelli's 1996 Senate campaign, he did not wait long to test Mr. Chang's potential value to his cause. On Sept. 26, four days after the letter was written, his staff contacted Mr. Chang to see if he would be host to a gathering to raise funds for the campaign. The event was held that December at the Fort Lee Hilton hotel, which Mr. Chang had owned.

FAB INDUSTRIES, MAKEROF TEXTILES, WILL SHUT 2 FACTORIES

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Fab Industries Inc., whose textiles are used to make sleepwear, sportswear and intimate apparel, will close two factories and eliminate about 150 jobs, or 15 percent of its work force, to cut costs. 
The company will close the Travis Knits plant in Cherryville, N.C., and the Adirondack Knitting factory in Amsterdam, N.Y., by the end of the year. The knitting, dyeing and finishing done at the two plants will be moved to the company's Mohican Mills plant in Lincolnton, N.C., the chief financial officer, David Miller, said. Fab Industries, based in New York, said the weak economy and competition from imports had reduced demand for its products.

HEADLINE: National Briefing South: South Carolina: State Budget Cuts Ordered 

BYLINE:  NYT 

 BODY:
 South Carolina's Budget and Control Board ordered a spending cut of 1 percent for most state services, including public schools, for the fiscal year that ends June 30. 
State economists blamed a stagnant first quarter, high tax refunds, and open-ended legislative commitments to property tax cuts and college scholarships. State law requires the board, whose chairman is Gov. Jim Hodges, to make cuts when revenue lags. The $48 million in cuts came as lawmakers debated how to cut $500 million from the budget for the year that begins July 1.

HEADLINE: Surging Prices Of Natural Gas Aid BP's Profit 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 8 

 BODY:
BP P.L.C., the world's third-largest oil company, said today that high natural gas prices in the United States along with BP's American acquisitions pushed its first-quarter profit to $4.12 billion, up about 52 percent from the period a year earlier.
 The figure was at the high end of forecasts, but it fell short of the $4.23 billion that some analysts had expected. The company's shares, which ended the day down 1.8 percent, slipped as much as 2.7 percent in an otherwise flat market for energy companies as analysts weighed whether increased oil supplies in America would push down prices. 
 "The place to be has been the U.S. because of natural gas and refining margins," said Steve Turner, an analyst with Commerzbank in London. "BP has been a big beneficiary of that." Now, Mr. Turner said, natural gas prices have "seen their winter peak and they will get a seasonal effect, dragging down gas prices."
Additionally, he said, many oil industry experts "are assuming a fallback in oil prices." Every dollar decline in the price of crude oil costs BP some $400 million a year in net profits, Mr. Turner said.
Sir John Browne, BP's chief executive, sought to play down the impact of falling prices.
"The trading environment remains broadly positive in spite of the slowdown in the world economy," Sir John said in a statement. "Oil and gas prices have fallen back from peak levels, but both are expected to remain firm."
For much of this year, investors favored BP stock because of its high exposure to the United States gas market, particularly after its purchase of Atlantic Richfield a year ago and its earlier acquisition of Amoco. Last year, almost half of BP's earnings came from the United States. BP, formerly BP Amoco, is the leading natural gas producer in North America.
The company's overall first-quarter results were adjusted to exclude one-time-only costs from acquisitions, and they assume that the oil reserves can be replaced at current prices.
Profits were buoyed by high gas prices, particularly in the United States, where, BP said, the benchmark price of $7.08 per million B.T.U. was almost three times the level of a year earlier. Globally, BP said, prices more than doubled in that time, averaging $4.96 per million B.T.U.
Among the challenges BP faces is to expand production, which the company has said will grow 5.5 percent to 7 percent annually. Excluding its acquisitions over the last year, however, BP's oil and gas production was virtually unchanged, growing around 2 percent from the fourth quarter of last year.
Doubts about BP's production growth, said Mr Turner at Commerzbank, stem from BP's heavy reliance on developing new oil fields in deep water in the Gulf of Mexico and off war-torn Angola.
Sir John insisted, however, that the company was "on track to achieve our announced targets, with higher reported production being a particular feature."

AFTER TAKEOVER BID, MORTON'S MAY OFFER ITSELF FOR SALE

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 The restaurant operator Morton's Restaurant Group Inc., the target of a takeover bid by a group backed by Carl C. Icahn, said yesterday that it might put the company up for sale. In a statement that warned that the company expected the weakened economy and reduced business travel to hurt its quarterly results, Morton's, which is based in New Hyde Park, N.Y., said it had contacted its financial advisers to evaluate options for the company. 
The announcement came six days after BFMA, a holding company based in Florida and backed by Mr. Icahn, offered to buy Morton's for $28.25 a share, a deal valuing the company at $106 million. BFMA already owns a 9.3 percent stake in the restaurant chain. Morton's, which released its statement after the close of trading, fell 5 cents, to $25.75 a share.

The Unrefined Truth

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Gasoline prices are rising again, and the administration is rushing to turn this into another argument for its drill-and-burn energy strategy. But a look at the causes of the current gasoline shortage actually suggests a quite different moral: namely, that conservation ought to be a major element in our energy strategy, and that lack of conservation is a large part of what we've been doing wrong. 
 First things first: This year's gasoline price spike has nothing to do with a shortage of crude oil. Even if we had already punched the Alaskan tundra and the ocean floor off Florida full of holes, we'd still be in the same fix. The binding constraint right now is the nation's limited capacity to refine crude oil into gasoline. 
 Why is refining capacity inadequate? No new refineries have been built in this country for 20 years, a point emphasized with obvious relish by Dick Cheney. His implicit subtext, of course, is that it's the fault of environmentalist types who stood in the oil industry's way. That must be the story, right? 
 Wrong. It's true that environmental rules have somewhat crimped the production of our existing refineries. The problem is not so much the strictness of the regulations as their lack of consistency: each region has its own rules -- like the insistence of Midwestern states that gasoline include corn-derived ethanol -- fragmenting the nation's production. But the reason the oil industry didn't build any new refineries for two decades was that they weren't needed. In fact, right up until last year oil refining was a persistently depressed business, plagued by overcapacity. 
 Here's what happened: In the wake of the energy crisis in the 1970's, ordinary people in the United States began conserving energy -- not as a "sign of personal virtue," as Mr. Cheney sneeringly puts it, but because they wanted to save money. Cars, in particular, became much more fuel-efficient. Meanwhile the oil industry was subject to "refinery creep," the tendency of refining capacity to grow through incremental improvements even when no new refineries are built. The result was excess capacity and squeezed margins, right up to the late 1990's. 
 What finally brought us up against capacity constraints was a surge in demand that was partly due to the economic boom of the later Clinton years, but mainly due to the renewed enthusiasm of Americans for huge, gas-guzzling vehicles -- an enthusiasm, er, fueled by cheap gas. In 1998 gasoline was cheaper compared with overall consumer prices than ever before in U.S. history -- 60 percent cheaper than it was in 1981. The nation rushed out to buy ever-bigger S.U.V.'s -- and then suddenly discovered that we had run out of refining capacity. Refiners weren't frustrated by rules that prevented them from building new facilities; they were simply caught by surprise.
 You have to bear this history in mind when parsing Mr. Cheney's recent speeches. To listen to him, you would imagine that we live in a country in which powerful political forces oppose energy production and preach a return to the dark ages. "To speak exclusively of conservation," Mr. Cheney declared in one speech, "is to duck the tough issues . . . it is not a sufficient basis -- all by itself -- for a sound, comprehensive energy policy." In another speech he ridiculed unspecified types for "saying to the American people that you have to live in the dark, turn out all of the lights." The story according to Mr. Cheney, in other words, is that we have an energy shortage because extreme conservationists prevented us from developing the supply capacity that serious people knew we needed.
 Need I point out that this, like so much of what one hears from this administration, is a cynical misrepresentation? I defy Mr. Cheney to come up with examples of influential people who "speak exclusively of conservation," let alone anyone who says to the American people that they have to live in the dark. In fact, hardly any important politicians have spoken about conservation at all -- never mind exclusively -- this past decade. 
 We will need to build more refineries -- and more power plants, and pipelines, and so on. But it is ludicrous to suggest that our current energy woes are the result of too much emphasis on conservation. It would be closer to the truth to say that we are in trouble now because our politicians haven't dared even use the word.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT; 
Telecommuting's Big Experiment

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
There is something quixotic about the quest of Representative Frank R. Wolf to encourage federal workers to stay out of the office more often.
 Mr. Wolf, a Virginia Republican and a vocal champion of telecommuting, conducts what he calls a field hearing on the subject twice every day, first on the drive to the Capitol from his home in Vienna, Va., in the morning, and then on the way home in the evening. And all too often, he does not like the results. 
 Last month, for example, he started at 8 a.m. to allow time to review his notes in his office before running a 10 a.m. hearing at which Secretary of State Colin L. Powell testified. Caught in heavy traffic, he arrived with 15 minutes to spare -- barely enough time to straighten his tie. 
"You've got federal employees driving 35 to 40 miles when they could be sitting in front of a laptop," he said. And his suburban Washington constituents, complain often about their commute. "It's a big issue for us here," he said.
So Mr. Wolf inserted a provision in the 2001 fiscal year appropriations bill for the Transportation Department, enacted last October, that requires every federal agency to give at least 25 percent of its eligible workers the option of working outside the office by this fall.
But reports from the alphabet soup of executive branch agencies on the status of their telecommuting programs, which had to be provided to the Office of Personnel Management last month, suggest that Mr. Wolf and several of his colleagues may be tilting at windmills.
It has been tough enough for companies in the private sector, where managers generally have more flexibility than government bureaucrats do to institute the practice. The number of telecommuters -- most on a sporadic basis -- has risen steadily over the last decade, to 23.6 million last year from 4 million in 1990, according to data collected by Joanne H. Pratt Associates, a Dallas firm that has studied telecommuting trends.
But the federal government is something else again. The figures speak for themselves. At the Justice Department, according to the agency's report to Office of Personnel Management on its telecommuting practices, only 581 employees regularly telecommute and 479 telecommute sporadically, out of 125,019 employees.
At the Interior Department, 1,450 out of 68,858 employees telecommute. Only 653 of the Energy Department's 14,461 employees telecommute. And at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 385 out of about 9,000 employees telecommute weekly.
"They have a long way to go," said Trina L. Hoefling, owner of the Consult One Group, a Denver telecommuting consultant.
Why the slowness in adapting to the new economy? In part, recalcitrant managers and the initial cost of installing computers in employees' homes are at fault. But officials at various agencies have another excuse: the very nature of their mission often makes working at home anywhere from difficult to impossible.
Some agencies handle top-secret documents, like intelligence reports on foreign powers, for example, that cannot be taken home on a laptop that might be stolen. Lawyers for the Justice Department are frequently involved in highly sensitive litigation, drawing on documents that while not classified, would typically be kept confidential. Justice employees who work at prisons generally need to do their work on the premises. And Treasury Department employees who work for the Secret Service; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; or other law enforcement agencies, might be hard-pressed to capture many violent criminals while working from home.
"We have a number of employees who do national security work who work daily with classified material," said Lisa Cutler, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department. "Those are things we are continuing to work through, trying to figure ways to get around."
Representative Wolf acknowledged the problem. "It depends on where you are and what your job is," he said. "The postman can't."
Despite the obstacles, Mr. Wolf is determined to ensure that all federal employees whose jobs make them eligible -- that is, whose jobs do not require their physical presence -- have the option to telecommute to some degree by 2004. By his estimate, 45 percent to 60 percent of the 1.8 million people who work for executive agencies are eligible.
Ms. Hoefling, the Denver consultant, says that is a lofty, though not impossible, goal. "I don't think the initiative is overly zealous," she said. "I think having it 100 percent in place by the fall may be overly zealous."
There are signs, though, that telecommuting may spread through the federal government. The experience of Martin Gertel, who has telecommuted in various ways for about five years, or as long as the option to do so has existed, is one.
Before he began to telecommute, Mr. Gertel, who is audit liaison for the Transportation Department and who has worked for the agency for about 10 years, spent three hours getting to and from his office in Washington every day: half an hour to the train station near Warrenton, Va., and then an hour to the city.
Then he cut his commute to half an hour by using a telework center closer to home. These centers are offices set up in the suburbs to allow federal workers to have access to computers and other office equipment, without having to travel all the way to their desks downtown.
Now, the declining cost of the technology needed to set up a home office may have made the centers passe. Mr. Gertel currently works from home, where he has his own computer, a separate phone line and a fax machine. Practical considerations, like meetings, require him to go to the office on many days, but he generally works at home on Mondays and Fridays.
"I can do just about anything from my study that I can do here," said Mr. Gertel, in his office to go through his in-box -- one thing he must do in person. "I can move documents, I can work cooperatively with people on drafting and redrafting responses to reports." And, said the father of two, "I get to be home for dinner."
Despite the low number of telecommuters, government agencies have recently voiced strong support for the practice, perhaps in part because Representative Wolf sits on the House Appropriations Committee and could hit laggards where it hurts -- in their budgets.
"The environment to me seems right to make this work," said Teresa M. Jenkins, director of the office of work force relations at the Office of Personnel Management, whose report on agencies' telecommuting policies and practices will be sent to Congress sometime in the next few weeks. "It's just good government if you want to stay competitive," Ms. Jenkins said, "and you want to recruit the best and the brightest."
To increase the number of people working from home, the Office of Personnel Management plans to hold a series of workshops and seminars on successful telecommuting arrangements for managers of different agencies and will help them set targets, Ms. Jenkins says. 
Another big obstacle to increased federal telecommuting, which workplace consultants say used to be the cost of setting up home offices, is probably management.
"A lot of us who learned our management techniques or styles in the 60's or 70's have sort of a bias that we have to see our employees at work," said Paul Chistolini, acting commissioner of the public buildings service of the General Services Administration. Of the roughly 7,300 people who work for him, 10 percent to 15 percent telecommute, he said. "It's quite a culture change to have to let people go and simply trust them to do the work," he said.
But if telecommuting poses obvious risks for managers by diminishing their control over subordinates, it also holds potential benefits for them. For one thing, it is a perk that can be a great recruiting tool. Surveys of federal workers show that telecommuting and flexible hours appeal to them and may reduce employee turnover, Ms. Jenkins said.
Whatever the actual advantages of telecommuting, Representative Wolf and some of his colleagues have undertaken a monumental task. The federal employees affected by the new law make up the largest work force in the country, and their employer is notoriously slow moving.
"If the federal government decided to change the style of paper clips that they wanted to use, it would probably take 18 months," said Gil Gordon, a telecommuting consultant in Monmouth Junction, N.J.
But the effort to change federal managers' thinking about telecommuting is worthwhile for reasons beyond improving the quality of life of government workers. The government often functions as a role model for private businesses, consultants say.
"They set the standard for the rest of American industry," said Ms. Hoefling, the consultant. Representative Wolf's goals may be ambitious, she said, but are probably necessary -- even though it may take a while to achieve them.
"The federal government is probably in the first stage" of adopting telecommuting, said Mr. Wolf, who remains a stalwart optimist. "It's beginning to take off."

HEADLINE: Cheney Is Backing Plan to Expand Cleaner Sources of Energy 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8 

 BODY:
The Bush administration will encourage the widespread use of agricultural, animal and human waste to produce energy as part of an effort to expand environmentally friendly energy supplies along with fossil fuels, administration officials said today.
 The so-called biomass refining effort would be modeled on a government-industry partnership that produces ethanol from corn, a program that is popular in farm communities and is seen by some as a relatively clean source of energy that reduces reliance on imported oil. 
 The effort would seek to refine organic waste, like corn fiber, manure, even saw dust, into a new kind of ethanol. It would require hundreds of millions of dollars in government tax incentives and research spending but could rival corn-based ethanol as a source of energy within a decade, industry lobbyists said. 
Vice President Dick Cheney has backed the plan as one of the most promising renewable sources of energy, and it is expected to feature prominently in the final report the administration's task force issues this month, officials confirmed.
Mr. Cheney, speaking on television today, also sought to show that his task force had put a balanced emphasis on increasing energy efficiency as well as expanding supplies of oil, coal and natural gas.
In a surprise, Mr. Cheney said the administration had not ruled out raising government-mandated fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks. But he said the administration would not make a final decision until a scientific study on the matter was completed this summer.
Some Democrats and environmentalists have urged the administration to raise the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards. They have not been increased since the 1980's, and the average fuel economy of cars and light trucks has declined in recent years with the rise of minivans and sport utility vehicles.
The automobile industry has tended to oppose any change in government mandates for fuel economy, arguing that tax incentives for highly fuel efficient vehicles work better.
"We think they have made a significant contribution over the years, improve the efficiency, if you will, the mileage of our automobiles," Mr. Cheney said of the standards in an interview with CNN. He said that when the National Academy of Sciences completed a study of the subject, the administration would decide "whether or not to go forward" with a change in standards.
Mr. Cheney also suggested that the administration would seek powers of eminent domain for electrical transmission lines, and President Bush, speaking to an electronics group tonight, indicated that was a priority.
"We need more electricity wires carrying product across the country," Mr. Bush said, warning that the nation "can't conserve our way to energy independence."
Mr. Cheney also said his energy report would recommend financial incentives for energy conservation, renewable energy and efficiency programs. Environmentalists and some scientists have criticized the administration as for playing down the potential of energy efficiency and renewable energy.
The vice president said, however, that renewable sources like solar, wind, biomass and geothermal were unlikely to account for more than 6 percent of total energy supplies by 2020, meaning that it was still necessary to drill for more oil and gas and ease regulatory barriers for the coal and nuclear power industries.
The energy report, Mr. Cheney said, would instruct Christie Whitman, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to review regulatory requirements on coal-fired power plant companies. 
Many coal-using utilities have complained that the agency's regulations, which were designed to make sure that old coal-fired power plants adopt pollution controls, made it difficult for them to upgrade old plants.
In biomass production, enzymes break down organic waste into sugars that can be fermented into ethanol. But while the process of turning corn into ethanol is well established, development of a refinery system that can use waste products is considered less advanced. 
Administration officials have indicated that they plan to increase Department of Energy spending on biomass greatly in the 2003 fiscal year. In the 2002 fiscal year, President Bush's first budget, the administration sharply cut spending for renewable energy.

HEADLINE: No. 2 Official Of the I.M.F. To Step Down By Year's End 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8 

 BODY:
Stanley Fischer, who engineered record bailouts for several of the largest developing countries as the day-to-day manager of the International Monetary Fund, announced that he would leave his post by the year's end.
 His resignation clears a path for Bush administration officials, several of whom have been vocal critics of the fund's lending to Russia and several Asian countries in recent years, to help select a person to fill the No. 2 post, which by tradition is held by an American. 
 Mr. Fischer, 57, a former economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said today that he had resigned the post voluntarily. Other fund officials and a spokesman for the United States Treasury Department were quick to agree, with several people saying that Mr. Fischer had been urged to stay on longer. 
Mr. Fischer briefly served as the fund's top official last year while the United States, Germany and several other European nations waged a protracted and sometimes bitter diplomatic contest over who would serve in the top post. The post eventually went to Horst Kohler, a former German government official, following the tradition of naming a European to the job but disappointing some developing nations that had nominated Mr. Fischer for the job.
Mr. Fischer said at the time that he would stay on under Mr. Kohler. But fund officials said they were not surprised that Mr. Fischer chose to resign after slightly less than a year under Mr. Kohler. Mr. Fischer said today he would continue in his post until later this year, when a successor is found.
"I will leave the fund with the highest respect for this institution and the deepest regard and affection for its dedicated and outstanding staff," Mr. Fischer said today.
Mr. Kohler and Mr. Fischer did not always work well together, several fund officials said. Mr. Kohler came into office vowing to rectify what some critics had identified as weaknesses, including the number of conditions attached to its loans, these people said. They added that Mr. Fischer did not always agree with Mr. Kohler about how, and how quickly, to enact changes.
Mr. Kohler issued a statement that was highly supportive of Mr. Fischer and expressed regret for his departure.
Since joining the fund in 1994, Mr. Fischer has overseen the details of its most economically challenging and politically delicate rescue operations.
He helped infuse money into Mexico after the crash of the peso in 1995. That effort, judged by many economists as successful, was quickly followed by the Asian financial contagion beginning in 1997. Mr. Fischer flew among South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia, arranging giant loan packages in exchange for commitments to open markets and streamline regulations. Those bailouts are still a much debated topic in economic circles.
The I.M.F.'s repeated loans to Russia in the 1990's are almost universally seen as failures. But Mr. Fischer and his supporters in the Clinton administration defended them as necessary gambles, given Russia's strategic importance. 
A technocrat who espoused classical views of economic management, Mr. Fischer defended the fund's efforts to force nations to tighten their fiscal belts and restrain spending even as they grappled with economic slowdowns.
Critics of the fund, including street protesters, members of Congress and both liberals and conservatives in academia, have often argued that it interferes too much in the financial affairs of the developing world and achieves poor results. But the critics have rarely aimed at Mr. Fischer himself, whose mastery of details, dry wit and easy diplomacy leaven his otherwise orthodox style.

HEADLINE: Panel Reaches Deal on Budget Framework 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8 

 BODY:
Republicans in the Senate and a handful of moderate Democrats reached a final deal tonight on how much money to allocate to tax cuts and spending, and Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee intensified their talks over how to apportion the tax reductions.
 The committee's Republican chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, met twice today with the senior Democrat on the panel, Senator Max Baucus of Montana, and said they were making progress toward a tax bill that could attract bipartisan support. 
 Mr. Grassley said the bill would include all four of the main elements sought by President Bush in his proposal to cut taxes by more than $1.6 trillion over the next decade. They are a reduction in all income tax rates, an increase in the child credit, a tax break for married couples and repeal of the federal estate tax. 
But in part because the budget plan will provide less for tax cuts than the $1.6 trillion sought by Mr. Bush -- $1.25 trillion over the next decade, plus $100 billion for tax cuts this year and next year to boost the flagging economy -- Mr. Grassley said the committee would scale back and modify each component of the Bush proposal.
Mr. Grassley said the bill would not cut the top personal income tax rate to 33 percent from 39.6 percent, as Mr. Bush wants. Congressional aides and senators from both parties said they expected a compromise that would reduce the top rate to around 36 percent and the current 36 percent rate to about 33 percent.
"We're going to have a reasonable compromise on the top rate," Mr. Grassley said.
Mr. Grassley said the committee would take up the tax bill soon, following a vote in the House on Wednesday and in the Senate on Thursday on the final budget framework setting overall tax and spending levels. Republican aides said tonight that they had completed negotiations on the budget with moderate Democrats whose votes they need to adopt it in the Senate, trying to resolve differences over how much money Congress would make available for spending on education as well as agreeing on the final details of the scale of the tax cut.
The Senate Finance Committee is one of the most critical stops for the tax bill. Unlike the Republican-controlled House, which has passed a series of bills that would enact President Bush's plan in more or less the form he proposed, the Senate, where each party has 50 seats and the committees are evenly divided, is going to substantially rewrite his plan.
Mr. Grassley and Mr. Baucus have been trying to develop a compromise that could win support from at least 8 or 9 of the 10 Republicans on the Finance Committee and as many as 4 of the 10 Democrats. 
The committee's work could be amended on the Senate floor, and the bill that comes out of the Senate is sure to be modified again when negotiators from the House, the Senate and the White House sit down to agree on a version.
The Finance Committee is the best venue available to Democrats to reshape the tax bill to direct more of its benefits to lower- and middle-income taxpayers than the Bush plan would. 
Republicans cannot report a bill out of the committee without at least one Democratic vote -- and possibly more, since one moderate Republican on the panel, Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, has indicated he might vote against it, and another, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, has expressed reservations.
"It's going to be hard to accommodate everybody," said Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, a Democrat who might back the bill. "The basic choice the Bush administration has is to attempt to win by a single vote and produce very conservative tax legislation, or build a broader coalition with more philosophically moderate legislation."
There is general agreement on a few points. Members of both parties want to create a new tax bracket below the current 15 percent bracket to give all taxpayers an immediate cut this year. And Mr. Grassley has said he intends to take some steps to deal with the alternative minimum tax, which was created to reduce tax avoidance by upper-income people but now subjects increasing numbers of middle-income taxpayers to higher tax bills.
The debate over how much to limit the reduction in the top income tax rate of 39.6 percent is one of the most ideologically contentious, but members of both parties said arithmetic is likely to drive the outcome.
Mr. Bush's proposal to reduce all income tax rates would reduce tax revenues by $877 billion over the next 10 years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Of that, about a quarter, or more than $200 billion, would come from the reduction of the top rate to 33 percent. With the size of the overall tax cut shrinking, reducing the top rate by less than Mr. Bush wants is an obvious way to help fit all the pieces into the money available.
At the same time, centrists from both parties on the panel are pushing for ways to expand the 15 percent tax bracket to help middle-income families. One proposal is to increase the bracket's income ceiling for married couples to twice the level for single people; now, the bracket is about 1.7 times higher for married couples than for single people.
Several members of the committee, including Senators Snowe and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, a Democrat, are pushing for a change in Mr. Bush's proposal to double the child credit to $1,000. 
They want low- to moderate-income families who do not pay any federal income tax to be able to benefit from the increase in the child credit. They would accomplish that by letting them use the child credit to offset part of the payroll taxes they pay to help finance Social Security and Medicare. For many low-income working families, payroll taxes are the biggest tax liability.
The estate tax could prove to be the most difficult issue for the committee. Mr. Bush's plan calls for gradual repeal of the tax, which would reduce revenues by $306 billion over 10 years. 
Its cost, and criticism from Democrats who say it would provide a disproportionate benefit to relatively few wealthy families, have made it an obvious target. But conservative Republicans on the committee, including Senators Phil Gramm of Texas and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, have made clear that they will fight hard for full repeal, and Mr. Bush said today he would back them up.

The Price Is Right; So What if It Isn't Perfect?

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
LISTEN to real estate agents and cocktail party pundits, and you might think there's no point in even looking for a decent one- or two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan south of 96th Street for less than $450,000.
 So $300,000 is out of the question, right? 
"It's embarrassing to admit it, but there's almost nothing," said Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate. "It's embarrassing because for $300,000 -- an amount way above the median home price in the United States -- you can find barely more than a coal chute in Manhattan." (A coal chute, for those too young to remember, was a hole under the sidewalk with a dim-glass-and-iron lid.) 
Other brokers agree. "How about a nice studio?" suggested Diane Ramirez of the Halstead Property Company. 
Dexter Guerrieri, president of Vandenberg Real Estate, just laughed -- and laughed.
But would-be buyers who persist -- either out of economic necessity or sheer stubbornness -- will be rewarded. A search this week of the shared listings of Manhattan agents uncovered 156 candidates for under $300,000.
While some were quickly eliminated because of monthly maintenance fees way beyond the standard $1 a square foot, there still remained dozens offered in the $200,000's. Six had two bedrooms.
Catch them while you can: a one-bedroom at 417 East 90th Street with a terrace -- and glimpses of the East River -- came on the market last Thursday for $197,000. (It's still available, but offers are pending.) And don't overlook the petite second-floor flat at 337 West 20th Street in Chelsea, complete with a shared courtyard garden and birdbath.
There were (relatively) cheap apartments on West 87th Street and Riverside Drive, on Minetta Lane and Sheridan Square, on Grand Street and East 35th Street, and even on Park Avenue. This reporter went to inspect the ones that sounded the most promising.
An apartment at 227 East 87th Street has two real bedrooms (not just one plus a dining L, like some on the list) and, even more unusual, two bathrooms. And the layout is desirable, too, with a bed and bath at each end of the apartment -- perfect for college students, hosts and house guests, or parents and children. The ceilings are high (12 feet), there is a nonworking fireplace in one bedroom and, for those who like them, exposed brick walls throughout. 
So far, so good. So what's the drawback?
While avoiding the bedroom-through-bedroom arrangement of a classic railroad flat, this apartment is nevertheless shaped like a bowling alley -- 83 feet long and 11 feet wide at its widest point. And it is dark, partly because it is on the first floor. The 1930 building, not exactly a tenement, is one of those double-width, non-doorman rental buildings that were converted to co-ops in the 1980's. The small kitchen is done in mundane Formica, and one bathroom looks dated with its bright turquoise tile. 
Despite its problems, the $275,000 apartment has a handful of prospective takers, said Cynthia Keskinkaya, a Corcoran Group agent, who started showing it three weeks ago. But the would-be buyers may not make the grade because they are first-time buyers -- and may want to bring in roommates. "It's a co-op; they have to satisfy the board," Ms. Keskinkaya explained, echoing other agents who encounter similar troubles with youthful buyers.
Next, it was on to a corner one-bedroom at 16 Park Avenue (35th Street), where it quickly became clear why the owners were eager to sell: two tiny cribs crowded the bedroom.
It also became obvious why the apartment, 725 square feet and with a view of the Empire State Building from the kitchen, had not sold. Laura McGinn and David Leichtman, the owners, did what many sellers do in a real estate market not even the brokers fully understand: they overpriced their apartment. The price has slid from $375,000 in January to $345,000, then $315,000. This week, it was $295,000.
Other inexpensive apartments are in so-called off-neighborhoods (as in "off the beaten path"). The largest apartment spotted for under $300,000 was on Suffolk Street on the Lower East Side, near Delancey and Orchard Streets. This is hardly blue-chip or blue-stocking territory, but it may be white-hot -- at least for the youngest, hippest apartment hunters.
The loft-style 974-square-foot apartment has space for two bedrooms, though one is separated from the living area by orange curtains instead of a wall. Priced at $238,000, it would be closer to $500,000 in Greenwich Village or TriBeCa, judging from comparable listings.
Like many lofts, it is a walk-up, in this case two flights in a clean, newly painted brick building across from a parking lot and catty-corner from a gothic-style school building. Unlike many lofts, which can be dark and narrow, this one is bright and square, with four windows on the street facing west. The second bedroom has real walls but is small and close to the entrance.
The open kitchen is plain but well designed, and the exposed brick contributes to a gritty, airy ambience. The loft benefited from a co-op conversion in the 1980's that turned 20 apartments into 10.
The one real drawback (assuming the neighborhood isn't an issue) is the parking lot across the street. "They all want to know what kind of building will be built there -- you know, will it block their light," said the broker, Henry Davis of Ashforth Warburg.
But that hasn't stopped people from bidding. One offer, which is close to the asking price, has already been accepted, and two others are in line.
In this uncertain market, brokers say the asking price is all important. It is well known that $2.99 sounds like a lot less than $3, and the same thing applies to $299,000.
One thing many apartments under $300,000 have in common is that they started out over $300,000 and gradually or not so gradually worked their way down, agents say, growing a little stale in the process. If Ms. McGinn and Mr. Leichtman had asked $295,000 for their prewar one-bedroom in January, they think they would have sold it right away.
"What I've learned," Ms. McGinn said, "is not to go for what the apartments are listed for in the newspapers, to try and find out what they actually sold for." 
The brokers handling many of the properties for less than $300,000 say the market is at least 10 percent lower than it was a year ago.
On Tuesday, Elaine Tross, an agent with Douglas Elliman, was showing a large one-bedroom in a 1969 "plain vanilla" -- white-brick -- postwar co-op at 400 East 77th Street. It has open southern views of the city, central air-conditioning and a 24-hour doorman. The maintenance is $787, and the price is $299,000.
"A year ago, they would have been asking $330,000," Ms. Tross said. "I sold a similar apartment here in the same building a year ago. It was two floors higher and in triple-mint condition. It sold for $349,000."
The apartment Ms. Tross is selling now is in good condition, too -- partly because she helped to make it that way. This is a common gesture among brokers in a market where fixer-uppers are not the hot commodity they were a year ago. Back then, they were going for almost as much as the fixed-up ones. But as buyers become nervous, they are less willing to gamble on construction spending. So today, agents are advising sellers to paint walls, refinish floors and put away the dishes.
"When I first walked in, the apartment looked a little cluttered," Ms. Tross said. Some of the chairs disappeared ("they're in the front closet," she whispered) and bric-a-brac was removed from the windowsills. "Buyers like a sparser look, so you can see the view," the agent said.
A year ago, when the market was at its peak, buyers often overlooked not only cluttered sills but also what agents used to call the fatal flaw. It might have been the apartment's location, like a funky block off Avenue C. Or an air-shaft overlook. Or an astronomical monthly maintenance fee.
Or an apartment in want of $150,000 worth of renovations. But nowadays, there appear to be fewer wrecks. 
Haruno Arai, an agent with the Corcoran Group, who is showing the one-bedroom Chelsea flat with the shared backyard garden ($285,000), says that young sellers have the resources to fix their apartments up. "I see so much stuff from Ikea now," she said.
And there are fewer bad neighborhoods. While not everyone might want to live on the Lower East Side or in the meatpacking district, there are lots of people who do -- and not only 23-year-olds.
It all depends on the buyer.
"There are some adorable apartments, charm with a working fireplace," said Hall Willkie, director of sales at Brown Harris Stevens. "They're great for people who are young or want exercise." Those apartments, he added, are fourth-floor walk-ups.
About those and the other less-than-perfect apartments, Mr. Willkie was blunt.
"They only can be considered fatal flaws if you pay too much," he said.

HEADLINE: Digital Storage: Computer Age Gets a Valhalla 

BYLINE:  By KATIE HAFNER 

DATELINE: MOFFETT FIELD, Calif. 

 BODY:
TWELVE years ago, Keith Uncapher, a computer scientist at the RAND Corporation, was shocked to discover that the Johnniac, a behemoth of a computer he had helped develop in the 1950's, had been left out to rust in a parking lot behind the Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles.
 After some hasty negotiations, Mr. Uncapher managed to rescue the computer before it was trucked off to a junkyard. Now the one-of-a-kind Johnniac, named for the computer pioneer John von Neumann, is safely ensconced 350 miles north, at the Computer Museum History Center here. 
 So goes the practice of saving the machines that both ignited and sustained the computer revolution.
The Johnniac is part of a vast collection of computer and electronic equipment assembled over the last two decades by a dedicated cadre of computer pioneers who are determined to prevent the industry's tangible roots from slipping away. 
Part of the collection is displayed in what the museum calls "visible storage" in a large warehouse at the eastern edge of Moffett Field, a former naval air station that is home to NASA's Ames Research Center. It looks almost, but not quite, like a proper museum exhibition. Next to the Johnniac is a large chunk of an I.B.M. SAGE computer, one of about two dozen built in the 1950's as part of an early warning air-defense system. A few feet from the SAGE is the Cray-1, an early supercomputer introduced in 1976.
The rest -- several thousand computers, pieces of peripheral equipment and gigabytes of software -- is stacked to the rafters in an adjacent warehouse.
Behind the confusion of metal and vacuum tubes lies an ambitious plan: to raise $100 million and build a 114,000-square-foot museum to house the collection. The museum, scheduled to open in 2005, will be built on a three-acre parcel at Moffett Field, near the city of Mountain View in the midst of Silicon Valley.
For now, the 10 staff members sit in a trailer next to a decommissioned Titan missile, and the collection is open to the public only by appointment. "The long-term plan is to put it on every Silicon Valley tourist's must-see list," said John Toole, the museum's executive director.
The idea of amassing historical artifacts has wide appeal in Silicon Valley. 
"This is the information age, after all," said Eric Hahn, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor who is a museum trustee and donor, "and the textured stories behind all these artifacts are very, very important for this century. They deserve to be treated with reverence."
One of the most conspicuously impressive pieces in the collection is a fully functioning Enigma machine, a portable typing device used by the German military during World War II to created encoded messages. The machine is on loan to the museum from Dr. C. Gordon Bell, a computer scientist who helped design the first minicomputers in the 1950's and 1960's and is one of the museum's biggest supporters. Dr. Bell, who bought the machine in 1991, estimates that no more than 20 Enigma devices still exist.
The museum is also the repository for unique machines like the Johnniac and the WISC, or Wisconsin Integrally Synchronized Computer, a mainframe computer built by Gene Amdahl for his doctoral dissertation at the University of Wisconsin in 1953. (Mr. Amdahl designed early mainframes at I.B.M. and later founded the Amdahl Corporation, which was a major computer manufacturer.) The WISC was discovered in Wisconsin in an engineer's basement, where it had apparently been used on occasion for target practice. And Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, has donated the paper tape of a computer program he wrote as a Harvard student.
Beyond the curiosities and collector's items in the collection, the museum also takes a Library of Congress approach, acting as a repository for most products of the computer era, including more recent ones, like the original Palm Pilot. 
"If you've been a computer user for more than two years," said Dr. Leonard Shustek, chairman of the museum board of trustees, "your computer is obsolete and we have it in the collection." 
The museum's holdings are drawn partly from the former Computer Museum in Boston, which sent more than 100,000 pounds of old computers in 1996 and 1999. 
The main driving force behind the museum project is Dr. Shustek, a successful Silicon Valley engineer who joined the trustee board of the Boston museum in 1995 with an eye toward starting the West Coast outpost. "It really bothered me that no one except the museum in Boston was doing anything like this," he said. 
With his wife, Donna Dubinsky, who is a founder of Handspring, the hand-held computer manufacturer, Dr. Shustek has carried out an ambitious fund-raising campaign. To date, the museum has secured pledges of nearly $50 million, the projected cost of the new building, and the board hopes to raise another $50 million by the time ground is broken in 2003.
Dr. Shustek is especially proud of the pieces in the collection that were rescued from junk heaps, like the Johnniac. In another instance of disaster aversion, Ken Olsen, who founded the Digital Equipment Corporation, saved the Whirlwind computer, a ground-breaking machine built at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and completed in 1951, by keeping a truck from hauling the machine to a landfill. 
"The museum prides itself in just-in-time collecting," Dr. Shustek said. "We get to things just before it's too late."
Very few of the older machines in the collection are still functioning. One that is, a 40-year-old I.B.M. computer called the 1620, was painstakingly pieced back together by a group of volunteers, who worked on weekends for 18 months to bring it back to life. An emulation of the machine is on the museum's Web site.
The museum also showcases products that did not succeed. A notable example is the $10,000 Honeywell Kitchen Computer, a recipe-generating machine marketed in the 1960's that required of its users more than a passing acquaintance with computer programming. Mr. Toole said he doubted that any were actually sold. 
Successful or not, all legacies of the computing era deserve recognition, Dr. Shustek said. "If we don't preserve these things," he said, "future generations will be annoyed at us for not having told the story of how it all happened."

HEADLINE: Sham Election In Kyrgyzstan Erodes Image Of President 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan 

 BODY:
For years, Western diplomats held up President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan as a champion of democracy among a gang of authoritarian leaders who control the other former Soviet republics of Central Asia. 
 But the image of Mr. Akayev and his tiny country have been tarnished in recent months. Political rivals have been jailed, opposition newspapers and independent television stations have been intimidated and silenced and, most damaging, international observers condemned Mr. Akayev's re-election last October as a sham. 
 The former university professor says he is determined to restore the prestige that he acknowledges he and his country have lost. Regaining the attention and respect of foreign leaders and international lenders is essential for any hope of prosperity in this nation, which lacks the energy resources of its neighbors. 
"We admit that we made mistakes and we are fully committed to correct them and stay on the track of democracy," Mr. Akayev said in a 90-minute interview at his residence in an orchard-filled park on the outskirts of Bishkek, the capital. 
Mr. Akayev then outlined what he knows foreign lenders would like to hear. His top priority, he said, is a new national plan for micro-credit loans to alleviate the extreme poverty that grips much of the country. He described the importance of the ombudsman post being created to monitor human rights. And he promised to work with opposition politicians and independent journalists. 
"As Victor Hugo said, the real mistake is the one that cannot be corrected," said Mr. Akayev, 56, sounding more like a penitent than the autocrat his critics say he has become after nearly a decade in office as Kyrgyzstan's first president after its independence. 
"I'm glad to hear that he acknowledges the mistakes because they are obvious and bad," said Christoph Schuepp, country director of Internews, an American-based foundation that promotes press freedom. "But the media is still under enormous pressure." 
A Western diplomat gave Mr. Akayev credit for some positive steps, like authorizing elections of local officials and adopting a progressive needle-exchange program to combat drug-related diseases. But he said each step forward seems to be matched by at least one step back. 
One of Mr. Akayev's earliest supporters, Feliks Kulov, is serving a seven-year prison sentence on charges supporters say were trumped up to keep him from opposing Mr. Akayev in last year's presidential race. 
Mr. Kulov was acquitted last August by a military court of charges he abused his office while he was vice president, but an appeals court found him guilty of the same charges and sentenced him to prison. 
After the presidential election, Mr. Akayev appointed a former Communist Party boss known for his hard-line attitude as his new chief of staff.
Mr. Akayev knows democracy is one of the few products Kyrgyzstan has to market, particularly if he wants to keep international aid flowing and tourists arriving to trek in the rugged Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains, whose soaring peaksare called the Roof of the World. 
Kyrgyzstan's only other major resource is the network of rivers and dams that regulate the flow of water essential to the farmlands and cotton fields of the Ferghana Valley and the production of electricity. 
The limited resources have left the country with an anemic economy. Per capita income is about $300 a year, less than $1 a day, and declining. 
The poverty and outbreaks of violence by Islamic insurgents in southern Kyrgyzstan during the past two summers have raised tensions, particularly in southern Kyrgyzstan where ethnic Kyrgyz, Uzbeks and Tajiks live in sometimes uneasy proximity. 
President Islam Karimov of neighboring Uzbekistan has responded to the Islamic radicals with mass arrests, something Mr. Akayev has avoided so far. The way to counter the appeal of the militants, he said, is by alleviating poverty. 
"In some cases these people live in extreme poverty and for that reason the ideas of the Islamic fundamentalists are appealing to them," he said. "Only economic well being and education will help us in defeating extremism."

PERSON: Marie Jahoda 

HEADLINE: Marie Jahoda, 94; Studied Work and Women 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Marie Jahoda, one of the world's foremost social psychologists and an emeritus professor at the University of Sussex, died on April 28 at her home in Keymer, in southeast England. Dr. Jahoda, who taught at New York University in the 1950's, was 94.
 In a long career as a researcher, teacher and writer, Dr. Jahoda, known as Mitzi, examined social issues in the field well beyond the realm of dry statistics, and in her classes emphasized a humanistic approach and adherence to scientific rigor in social research. 
 In New York from 1949 to 1958, she was a professor of social psychology at N.Y.U. and was a founding director of its Research Center for Human Relations. She was the source of a steady stream of surveys and reports on the social fabric of the city and the country.
Her topics included anti-Semitism and ethnic and religious prejudice in the work place and in intergroup relations. In one report she found that opinion researchers must sometimes resort to biased questions to detect bias on the respondent's part.
"People with prejudices," she concluded, "seldom like to admit it."
On behalf of the federal Public Health Service, she investigated the effect of conditions in a wartime boom town on the mental health of workers. For this, she documented overcrowded living quarters and a dearth of education, health and recreation centers.
She tackled the delicate issue of loyalty in the political atmosphere of the 1950's by studying the impact of federal security measures on government employees.
In 1954 she assessed the role of women in America and wrote that women seeking to combine marriage with a career need strong mental health and an ability to solve problems.
Her investigation of conformity in America in the 1950's found the issue to be oversimplified. There were several basic types of conformers, she said. The most common type she called drifters, people who willingly changed their beliefs because they lacked adequate knowledge of the arguments pro or con. Another category she characterized as people who had definite and unpopular beliefs that they kept to themselves for fear of the consequences of speaking out.
Born in Vienna, Marie Jahoda absorbed the teachings of Freud and Jung and received her doctorate at the University of Vienna. She gained early recognition with a sociological study conducted in Marienthal, near Vienna, with Hans Zeisel and her first husband, Paul Lazarsfeld.
Marienthal, an industrial district, was racked by unemployment in the 1920's and 1930's. Working unobtrusively, the researchers measured the psychological consequences. For Dr. Jahoda the project demonstrated that work met a basic need for most people, giving them personal worth, social coherence and structured time.
As a Social Democrat opposed to the Austrian government even before Hitler annexed the country, she was imprisoned in 1936 but managed to reach England. There her research took on topics like unemployment in the coal mines and the transition from the classroom to the work place.
She came to the United States after World War II and worked as a researcher for the American Jewish Committee and at Columbia University before moving to N.Y.U.
She returned to Britain in 1958 to marry Austen Albu, a Labor member of Parliament. She worked as a researcher and teacher at the University of Sussex from 1965.
Mr. Albu died in 1994. Dr. Jahoda is survived by a daughter from her first marriage, Lotte Bailyn of Belmont, Mass., a professor of management at M.I.T.; and two grandsons. Dr. Jahoda and Dr. Lazarsfeld divorced in the 1930's. He became a professor of sociology at Columbia University and died in 1976.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS; 
Treasuries Climb as Traders Hedge Giant Corporate Issue

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday as dealers snapped up longer-dated issues after the biggest debt sale ever by an American company and an auction of new benchmark 10-year notes.
 Both 30-year bonds and 10-year notes jumped higher as dealers abandoned hedged positions related to WorldCom's record sale of $11.9 billion in bonds. 
 Much of the WorldCom deal was concentrated in 10-year notes and 30-year bonds, and traders said the unwinding of those positions lifted long-term Treasury issues. 
The Treasury sold $9 billion in a reopened issue of 10-year notes, the second sale in its two-part quarterly refunding. 
"It's a combination of very good reception to the WorldCom deal and a fairly good Treasury 10-year note auction that's helping the market do better," said Gemma Wright, senior market strategist at the Barclays Capital Group.
The current-issue benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 19/32 , to 98 24/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to 5.16 percent from 5.24 percent on Tuesday. The yield on the newly auctioned notes, which were sold at a price to yield 5.189 percent, improved to 5.185 percent by late in the day.
The 30-year Treasury bond jumped 1, to 95 28/32 . Its yield fell to 5.66 percent from 5.74 percent on Tuesday.
There were no economic reports yesterday. Bond traders are awaiting reports tomorrow, which include a preliminary reading on consumer sentiment in May and retail sales nationwide in April, for further direction on Federal Reserve policy.
The Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday and is widely expected to cut overnight lending rates another half a percentage point.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 10-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price: 98.551
High Yield: 5.189%
Low Yield: 5.139%
Median Yield: 5.175%
Total applied for: $25,481,724
Accepted: $11,457,320
Noncompetitive: $77,102
Interest set at: 5%

The 10-year notes mature Feb. 15, 2011.

HEADLINE: Economists Say Recession Is Unlikely 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9 

 BODY:
Business economists still say they believe that the United States will probably avoid recession this year, a quarterly survey released today found.
 The survey by the National Association for Business Economics did find an increased chance of recession this year, up to 35 percent from 33 percent in February and 20 percent in November. 
Still, the panelists did not consider the change alarming. 
 "While the business outlook remains cloudy and profits are under severe pressure, panelists have remained steadfast in their belief that a recession is unlikely," said Richard Berner, president of the association and chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
The 27-member panel lowered expectations for growth next year, meanwhile, to 3.1 percent, from the 3.5 percent forecast in February. The forecast for 2 percent growth this year was unchanged. The economy grew 5 percent in 2000.
Slowing growth has prompted Federal Reserve policy makers to reduce their benchmark interest rate four times since the beginning of the year and most of the 25 banks and securities firms that trade directly with the Fed expect a further rate cut next week and additional reductions later in the year to preserve the record expansion.
The economists surveyed said the Consumer Price Index would probably rise 3 percent in 2001, up from a 2.6 percent forecast in the previous survey, mainly because of higher energy costs, and 2.5 percent in 2002, unchanged from the last survey. Prices rose 3.4 percent last year.
There is a 25 percent probability of recession in 2002, the group found. That compares with 20 percent and 25 percent in the prior two surveys.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Lest we forget: each generation has its own 'new economy.'

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; This column appears here every Thursday. Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and a fellow at the Shorenstein Center at Harvard University.

 BODY:
EVER since high-technology stocks began to plummet last spring, the press has become increasingly disillusioned with the "new economy." But this was always a loosely defined concept. As The Economist wrote in 1999, the stunning economic boom of the late 1990's needed a "very big idea" to explain it. The press, Wall Street and a handful of influential authors rushed to fill the void. 
 Such a big idea is rarely right, and some might argue it is disingenuous to criticize it in retrospect. But America took the new economy seriously, causing a lot of damage. The enthusiasm the term fostered, the sense of authority it conveyed, convinced Americans that they might at last have solved their central economic problems. Yet a recession may arrive long before family income is back on a firm growth track and enough people have been lifted out of poverty. 
 Claims that there was a new economy helped justify soaring stock prices that could not possibly be maintained and enormous commitments of capital to new ventures that inevitably went bad. While economists wrung their hands over America's lack of savings, tens of billions of dollars that could have been spent more wisely were dissipated.
What was the genesis of the idea? Research I recently completed at the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard shows that the press, business economists and economics authors have been using the term "new economy" since the 1970's to describe many different and often unrelated things. Sometimes it was about computer technology. But it has also been used to describe a service economy, globalization, the two-worker family, stagnating wages, the rise of small companies, deindustrialization and corporate restructuring.
In the 70's, there were references to a new economy as the nation tried to adjust to high inflation and expensive oil. Fuel-efficient cars were called new-economy cars. By 1981, some made the familiar claim that a new economy would no longer be subject to harsh recessions; the worst recession since World War II began the next year. 
In the mid-1980's, the idea of a new economy gained wide acceptance. There were books with titles like "Doing Business in the New Economy" and "Understanding a New Economy." In 1986, Fortune hailed "America's New Economy" on its cover, as did U.S. News & World Report. Business Week asserted that the nation was undergoing "the most revolutionary economic change in a century -- the emergence of a 'new economy' of services and high technology."
The reason for the mid-1980's exuberance was not hard to trace. By the end of 1985, the economy had strung together three strong years. But in 1987 the stock market crashed and economic growth ultimately sputtered. It was time for another new economy, but this time an economy of strain. "Sacrifice and industriousness will be the features of the new economy," Business Week wrote.
There have always been "new eras" and "new ages," but such phrases never before gushed forth as frequently as they did in the last two decades. Partly, the repeated claims of epochal changes reflected increasing competition in the business media and on Wall Street; big ideas, after all, attract attention. 
But the modern era was also both confusing and disappointing. The 1970's began with virulent inflation and were followed by high unemployment rates, insecure jobs, falling wages and historically slow productivity growth. Americans seemed to hope that a new economy would come along to sweep their problems away, and many were willing to oblige them.
By the late 1990's, claims about a new economy at last had staying power. The surprisingly strong economy of 1996 and 1997 did not peter out. Capital investment in new technologies continued to grow rapidly, the unemployment rate fell, and, most important, productivity grew rapidly again.
From 1985 to 1995, the business press had about 775 references to a new economy. In 1998 alone, there were more than 1,000.
Even in the late 1990's, however, it was hard to tie the new economy down to a precise definition. Most analysts and the press attributed the strong economy to the spread of the computer. But just how information technology produced these gains was far from clear.
Some economists, like Robert Gordon of Northwestern University, argued that much of the increase in productivity had to do with the cyclical strength of the economy, and that any additional gains were being made by the producers of computers, not their customers.
Ironically, even the proponents of the new economy seemed insecure. The Economist wrote that most experts believed it would require the Internet to solidify the new economy's gains. But sales on the Internet were too minuscule even by 2001 to have accounted for rapid economic growth. 
It was the rising stock market, not economic analysis, that pressed the new economy indelibly into the nation's consciousness. High-tech stocks soared in 1999, and references to the new economy in the business press tripled, to more than 3,000. 
In 2000, such references totaled more than 20,000, and hyperbole was rampant. "Thanks to wondrous new technology," The Economist wrote, "the business cycle was supposedly consigned to the history books, and productivity would grow forever at a miraculous rate."
Now, the economy is slowing, dot-coms are failing, venture capital has dried up, fortunes are lost, as is a goodly portion of retirement savings, and doubters are rising from the woodwork. Is a more clear-headed age upon us? 
It is not likely. We economics writers cannot seem to get out of the way. The Wall Street Journal recently wondered, for example, whether there would be a "New Economy growth recession."
There is little doubt that information technology is having a constructive impact on the nation's capacity to produce goods and services. But claims that America had a new economy rested more on the need for simple answers and promises of deliverance from difficult times than it did on solid economic analysis. Reasonable people will make mistakes, but such cynicism exacts a price.

HEADLINE: Kingman Journal; 
Famous by Association And Not Happy About It

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: KINGMAN, Ariz., May 8 

 BODY:
Sitting just beyond the blazing desert sun in the shade of his carport, a handgun strapped, as always, to his hip, Walter McCarty welcomed the opportunity to talk of his anger.
 Mr. McCarty, a 78-year-old former marine, described his contempt for what he called the federal government's abuses of power and how his views and a handgun course he taught brought him together with another angry man, Timothy J. McVeigh. 
 Mr. McCarty said he was even mad at Mr. McVeigh, who spent nearly two years here before blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995. That senseless loss of 168 lives left him furious, Mr. McCarty said, as well as the way the F.B.I. swooped into Kingman after the attack in search of a conspiracy. 
What upsets him now, said Mr. McCarty, whose modest home is decorated with Marine insignia and a Marine flag, is the way Mr. McVeigh's scheduled execution next week has dragged Kingman again under an unflattering spotlight that he and other residents say the town does not deserve.
Mr. McCarty and others admit that the desolate, sun-baked flats and canyons along the old Route 66 here have long been a magnet for malcontents and that some extremist groups have found recruits in the area. But they insist that Kingman itself, a former mining and railroad town transformed by a burst of growth in recent years, has been branded wrongly as a militia haven.
"There never was at any time a really organized militia or group like that around Kingman, and I would know," said Mr. McCarty, who works as a bailiff in the Mohave County Courthouse here. "There are some people around here who think that way, I can tell you that. But it's not organized like they say."
This is a sore point in Kingman. But most concede that the evidence is mixed. There were some active militias in Arizona a decade ago, and a few terrorist attacks, including the derailing of an Amtrak train several years ago. Larry J. Butler, Kingman's chief of police, said that in the heyday of antigovernment movements in the mid-1990's, he would occasionally hear of hunters stumbling on makeshift survivalist camps in the desert.
Chief Butler also said his officers would sometimes confront zealots who claimed the government had no right to force them to register their cars or obtain driver's licenses. But he said those confrontations were never violent and had all but stopped.
"To the extent there were any, Tim McVeigh killed the feelings for militias around here," the chief said. "I can tell you, there's no sympathy for them."
Steve Johnson, a spokesman for the Mohave County Sheriff's Department, agreed, saying of the militias: "I can't say that they are here and I can't say that they aren't here. We just don't see them."
Mohave County had been inviting for antigovernment protesters at least in part because it is so vast and empty. It stretches across Arizona's broad northwest corner, covering 13,260 square miles of dun-hued desert. Arizona's liberal gun laws had also been attractive, making it easy to buy and carry weapons.
But groups that track the militant antigovernment movements say they have nearly disappeared. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors extremist groups, the number nationwide plummeted to 194 last year, from a peak of 858 in 1996. Just three are reported in Arizona.
Sean McMahon, the editor of The Kingman Daily Miner, said his paper used to publish articles regularly tracking the groups, but had not done so for more than a year because there was little to report.
Kingman has been changed by a more powerful force than anger: opportunity. The city has been caught up in the Sun Belt boom. Its population soared in the past decade by 60 percent to 20,069, according to the 2000 census. In Mohave County, population grew to 155,032 in 2000 from 93,000 in 1990.
Lou Sorensen, Kingman's city manager, said many of those new residents had been attracted by jobs in the casino-fueled economy of nearby Nevada, not right-wing ideologies.
Mr. McCarty said local residents still loved their guns and feared that the government might take them away -- a concern he shared with Mr. McVeigh. But, he added, people are no longer as naive as they once were. In his neighborhood, he said, they are delighted that things have calmed down. 
Elsie Starkey agreed. She had been a neighbor of Michael Fortier -- a friend of Mr. McVeigh who pleaded guilty to knowing about the bomb plot but failing to alert the authorities -- just a couple of blocks from Mr. McCarty's home. Despite the talk of illegal activity at Mr. Fortier's house, where Mr. McVeigh often visited, she said she had seen none of it. 
"He seemed like a nice guy," Ms. Starkey said of Mr. Fortier, who is serving a federal prison sentence. "I just never saw any of that stuff. I never expected any of that to happen and I'm glad it's back to normal."

HEADLINE: Excesses of Hoboken's Success Helped Defeat Mayor 

BYLINE:  By MARIA NEWMAN 

DATELINE: HOBOKEN, N.J., May 9 

 BODY:
For some voters, it may have been Mayor Anthony Russo's strong-handed style. Others may have had concerns about his health, after his bouts with a brain tumor and lung cancer. And nearly everyone seemed to have an opinion about the mayor's aborted plan last month to keep out-of-towners from driving through the city on their way elsewhere.
 But hours after Mr. Russo lost his race for a third four-year term as Hoboken's colorful power broker, the feeling here today among many residents -- including Mr. Russo -- was that he had fallen victim to one of the proudest boasts of his administration: the headlong growth of this waterfront city. 
 In an upset, Mr. Russo lost to City Councilman David Roberts Tuesday by 53 percent to 42 percent in a nonpartisan election.
Mr. Russo, 54, said today that he had lost in part because he had not run a spirited campaign. "I did not have the fire in the belly that I did in 1993," he said, referring to his first mayoral race. "I think I really didn't have my heart in this campaign."
But he also said voters had blamed him for problems caused by the city's rapid growth. Since Mr. Russo was elected mayor, Hoboken's business district has thrived, and it has added 5,000 housing units. But there is also more traffic, noise and complaints about lack of parking.
"What were once garbage-strewn lots became taxable property," Mr. Russo said in a telephone interview. "But the spin on the economic development of the city became overdevelopment."
This afternoon, Mr. Roberts, who will take office on July 1, said that voters felt the mayor was insensitive to their complaints.
"In one year, five different citizens' groups had to hire private lawyers just to get their issues heard by city government," he said, sitting at a sidewalk table at the Hoboken Gourmet Company on Washington Street. "What we will bring to city government is more respect."
Mr. Roberts, 44, a Democrat who has been on the City Council for 16 years, ran on a slate with three Council candidates: current Councilmen Ruben Ramos Jr. and Anthony Soares, and Carol Marsh, a community activist.
"We had a diversity of support in Hoboken," Mr. Roberts said. "That included young professionals, people who had moved to Hoboken recently, the more traditional Hoboken residents and people of all economic levels. Our campaign headquarters looks like a mini-United Nations."
Mr. Roberts said that he and his running mates want to draw up a new master plan for the city that would call for controlled growth, and that might restrict most parking to the perimeter of the city, an issue of great concern here. 
Last month, Mr. Russo tried a radical solution to the traffic problem: he announced that at certain hours, he was closing off the city to traffic by people who did not live or work there. But before the police could turn away drivers, Frederick J. Theemling Jr., the Hudson County prosecutor, halted the plan, saying it was probably unconstitutional.
Many on the streets of Hoboken said today that growth and traffic were big reasons they voted against Mr. Russo. Cheryl Villone, 44, who has lived here all her life, supported him four years ago, but not this time. "He overdeveloped the town and broke a lot of promises," she said. "He lost touch with the town, and everything went out of control."
Ms. Villone also said that Mayor Russo's proposal to close the town to outside traffic was a last-minute effort to win votes. "He only visited the important topics when it was time for people to vote. Other than that, no one in town knew what he was up to."
At Mr. Russo's storefront campaign headquarters on Washington Street, the door was locked and the lights were out. Joe Wainright, 59, peered into the office and conceded that as a Russo supporter, "I'm part of the minority now."
"I thought Russo did a decent job and I voted for him," he said. "The town flourished and it's a nicer place now, but I guess some of the lesser things he did caught up with him."
Mr. Russo had also lost the support of crucial political players in Hudson County, including members of his own Democratic Party.
Then there was the issue of his health. In the last year, a tumor was removed from his brain and he was found to have lung cancer. "Some people were concerned that I wouldn't make it through a third term," he said. "But that's baloney."
Still, he said the city's development became an emotional issue. "A person rides around the neighborhood looking for parking that he can't find, and he gets angry and he votes against the incumbent," Mr. Russo said. "Most votes for my opponent were really votes against me."

HEADLINE: Yellow Taxis Battle to Keep Livery Cabs Off Their Turf 

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
A former New York City police detective stood on the corner of 67th Street and Central Park West the other morning trying to hail a taxi. What made this unusual was that he was not going anywhere.
 Instead, the former detective was working as a foot soldier in a war being waged on the streets of Manhattan, one whose battle lines became apparent the minute he raised his hand: the cabs that raced to his side were not yellow. They were livery cabs, from sleek corporate sedans to battered gypsies, and they arrived in a virtual procession, rushing over and stopping illegally to haggle over a price. 
 "It's like rapid machine-gun fire," said the man, appropriately named Harry Hard, a flinty private investigator employed over the last month by the yellow taxi industry to document livery pickups and report the findings to the city. 
Turf wars are nothing new between the medallion and livery cab industries -- the complex two-class taxi system that has evolved in New York since the 1930's. Medallion taxis were always supposed to be restricted to picking up street hails. Liveries were to be restricted to prearranged calls -- though they have always picked up street hails on the sly, usually in neighborhoods where yellow cabs have no interest in going.
But over the last two years, according to yellow cab owners, livery owners and even the Taxi and Limousine Commission, liveries have increasingly invaded the yellow cab's traditional stronghold, south of 96th Street in Manhattan, cruising around business areas, hotels and restaurants and illegally taking hails.
The reasons they say this is happening now more than ever -- even in Midtown -- include a dearth of yellow cabs, especially during the day; more people in Manhattan trying to hail them; and what yellow cab owners see as a lack of enforcement by the taxi commission against liveries.
"Clearly, we are seeing it happen," said Diane McGrath-McKechnie, the chairwoman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission. "It's illegal and we have to stop it."
The livery invasion has done more than raise the hackles of yellow taxi drivers and owners, who sometimes pay more than $200,000 for the metal medallions riveted to their hoods, medallions that are supposed to give them the sole right to street hails. In effect, it threatens to turn the whole taxi system on its ear, challenging the logic of the way the medallion industry is regulated.
The regulations have always been much stricter for medallion cabs on the theory that New Yorkers and tourists need more protection when hopping into a cab than when calling ahead for one. For example, livery cabs have no limits on what they can charge, while taxis do. Their drivers do not have to attend an 80-hour preparation course, get a physical examination or prove they are proficient in English. They do not have to retire their cars when they are three years old, install air-conditioning or post any information in the cars to let passengers know who they are or whether they are licensed.
The yellow cab industry says that the breakdown in the taxi system not only makes the stricter rules against them unfair, but also undermines the economic balance in the industry. Because it is less complicated and costly to drive a livery car than a taxi, and because it is now easier for livery drivers to supplement their incomes by picking up street hails with relative impunity, more new drivers are gravitating to the livery industry than to the yellow industry.
Yellow taxi owners say this exacerbates a longstanding driver shortage. That translates into a cab shortage that they consider to be, in part, responsible for the greater number of liveries cruising for street hails in Manhattan.
"It's a vicious cycle," said Ronald Sherman, president of the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents owners of big yellow cab fleets. "My drivers that are legal and go out and spend more than $600 for a license and do everything properly, they go out on the street and see people in their own cars picking up people left and right. The law-abiding drivers are saying, 'Why should I go through all these hassles when I can just go out and make a lot of money doing it on my own?' "
The situation has become so bad that a group of yellow taxi fleets, whose members have long cried poverty, recently came up with money of its own to produce a series of radio ads intended to protect its turf, essentially by trying to scare people who hail livery cabs.
"Think about it," says the voice-over on the ads, which ran last month on three radio stations. "The driver's already broken the law once -- just by picking you up. What's stopping him from breaking the law once you're inside the car? And who do you call when you have a complaint?"
The industry also hired Mr. Hard, the private investigator, to spend a month on the streets quietly gathering information about the incursion of liveries. During the recent morning on Central Park West, for example, 20 livery cabs responded in 30 minutes to his outstretched hand -- an average of one every minute and half -- some of them so aggressively that they cut off the few available yellow cabs, whose drivers honked and pounded their steering wheels as they saw their next fare being snatched away.
Mr. Hard is focusing mostly on hotels, where yellow taxi owners say they are losing a substantial amount of business to liveries that line up to snag passengers headed to the airports. Industry leaders say they plan to present his findings -- including tales of $65 rides to Kennedy Airport and payoffs to hotel doormen -- to the taxi commission, the hotel industry and to tourism officials.
In an odd twist, one that also speaks to the shifting dynamics in the taxi industry, many livery fleet owners have found themselves on the same page as their yellow fleet counterparts when confronting the issue.
They both vehemently oppose a proposal by Fernando Mateo, president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers, for the city to create zones in which it would be legal for liveries to pick up street hails. They point out that many of the murders of livery-cab drivers have occurred when they picked up street hails.
And the livery owners say that as illegal livery street hails become more commonplace, radio bases -- which dispatch cars to pick up passengers -- are also having a harder time fielding cars to fill all of their calls. And so they, too, would like to see the taxi commission crack down on liveries that break the pickup law.
Ms. McGrath-McKechnie, the taxi commission chairwoman, said the agency was aware that illegal livery activity had become more pervasive and was threatening the livelihood of the yellow taxi fleets. And she said that the agency had recently stepped up enforcement, particularly in conjunction with hotel managers.
The agency's lawyers are also exploring with the city's corporation counsel whether taxi enforcement officers can seize the cars of licensed liveries who are caught too many times picking up street hails, she said. Under the law, the agency can now seize only gypsy cabs -- essentially private, unlicensed cars -- when they are caught carrying passengers or making pickups.
But both yellow taxi fleet owners and livery owners say that they think the problem will persist, no matter how hard a line the taxi commission takes against it, because the agency has only about 200 taxi officers to cover all five boroughs and those officers usually must concentrate on more pressing public safety problems. And the Police Department, though able to respond to illegal pickups, almost never does.
"If it keeps up, then eventually what you're seeing is that the whole structure that the industry is based on begins to deteriorate," said Bruce Schaller, who was a policy expert for the taxi commission before starting his own taxi consulting company.
The other day on Central Park West, it was not easy to find anyone who really cared one way or the other about structures deteriorating or industries suffering, so long as he could find a cab. And if a yellow one wasn't around, he did not hesitate long to hop into a livery.
"There just aren't enough cabs out there," said Stewart Unger, a vintage-watch salesman, who was haggling with a livery driver. "Water seeks its own level, and guys look for jobs where they can find them. That's what's going on."

HEADLINE: City Clothing Bank Manager Charged in Fraud 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SAULNY 

 BODY:
A top official at the city Clothing Bank, which distributes apparel to the needy and homeless, was arrested yesterday for taking cash payoffs from an undercover investigator who said he wanted to divert $9,000 worth of donated clothes and merchandise to bogus charities, officials said.
 An inquiry began last July when the city's Department of Investigation received a tip that Philip E. Sheil, 44, the distribution manager at the Clothing Bank's warehouse at the old Brooklyn Navy Yard, was selling garments to noncharities for resale and keeping the money. 
 Mr. Sheil allegedly solicited a total of $300 from an agent over several occasions, and helped the agent fill out paperwork and create fake charities. 
"This defendant was supposed to help clothe New York City's poor and homeless," said Edward J. Kuriansky, the commissioner of the Department of Investigation. "Instead he took the clothes off their backs and put money in his own pocket."
Mr. Sheil, of Dean Street in Brooklyn, was a full-time employee at the Clothing Bank since 1998, earning $25,000 a year. He was charged with mail and wire fraud, officials said, and, if found guilty, could spend up to 10 years in federal prison.
The Clothing Bank, a unit of the Mayor's Voluntary Action Center, was established in 1986 and stocks irregular and out-of-season clothes, as well as counterfeit designer garments seized by the police and no longer needed as evidence. More than 800 retailers nationwide also donate surplus or overstocked goods. The bank's citywide distribution network includes more than 400 charities that pay an annual membership fee to make warehouse pickups. 
To get the clothing, Mr. Sheil allowed the agent to claim to represent Bronx Educational and Charitable Organization, which did not exist, according to the charges. The two men also created a second fake charity, the Tyler Youth Education Foundation.

HEADLINE: U. of Virginia Hit by Scandal Over Cheating 

BYLINE:  By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., May 9 

 BODY:
As they have for 160 years, students at the University of Virginia took their final exams unsupervised today, despite a cheating scandal that has shaken the campus. 
 Under trees and on benches, on a beautiful spring day, lone figures scrawled their answers in blue books, with teachers trusting that students would not peek into textbooks, steal solutions from the Internet or seek help from friends. 
 But the University of Virginia's code of student honor, a proud tradition that relies on students signing pledges not to cheat, steal or lie, is facing what may be its most severe test. Some 122 students stand accused of cheating on term papers in a popular introductory physics class, with as many as half of them expected to face the only penalty available for cheating here: expulsion or loss of degrees awarded in earlier years. 
The scandal at this campus of 18,000 as the academic year ends has prompted new questions about the university's widely admired code of honor and its single sanction system, rare among American universities. 
Cheating was discovered after a student from last semester told Louis A. Bloomfield, the physics professor, that the grade he had given her paper was low and that others with higher marks had cheated. The class has 300 to 500 students each semester. 
Professor Bloomfield set up a computer program to detect similarities of six consecutive words or more between term papers submitted to him over the last five semesters. It took the program 50 hours to run through more than 1,800 papers, but it was not long before the first matches appeared, he said, and they showed the papers to be virtual replicas. 
"In this universe, it's not 6 or 12 identical words in a phrase," Professor Bloomfield said, "it's 1,500."
"I expected to see a couple of matches," he said. "I was a bit shocked to find 60."
Professor Bloomfield's discovery was first reported in The Richmond Times-Dispatch.
He suggested that in an era when people swap music over the Internet, forward e-mail messages and send texts to each other with a single keystroke, the lines between collaboration and theft have blurred. 
While some educators have raised concerns that the Internet has made cheating on exams and term papers easier, Professor Bloomfield's program raises the potential of electronic sleuthing to match it.
Some university officials say they suspect the Internet has increased cheating. But Linda K. Trevino, chairman of the department of management and organization at Pennsylvania State University's business school, said she found little evidence that cheating on term papers had increased when she compared a 1963 survey of students with one she wrote in 1993 with Donald McCabe, a Rutgers University professor who founded the Center for Academic Integrity. 
But Dr. McCabe said he believed that cheating on exams had increased sharply. In the 1960's, he said, one in four students admitted to cheating once or more on a test in the previous year. By 1993, that figure had doubled. 
Both researchers said that colleges that relied on an honor code appeared to have less cheating.
In 1993, 53 percent of students at schools without honor systems admitted to cheating once or more on a test in the previous year, while 29 percent of students at schools with honor codes admitted cheating. Two out of three students surveyed at colleges and universities without an honor code admitted to copying another student's papers, while 42 percent of students on honor codes said they had done so.
Thomas Hall, a student who heads the University of Virginia's Honor Committee, said that an investigative panel was going through the 122 cases Professor Bloomfield had referred, and that some students were found to have cheated and been told they would be expelled. Often, he said, the students whose papers were copied said they had shared their work to help a fellow student, but did not know it would be plagiarized. In those cases, the students have not been thrown out.
Several students under investigation had graduated, Mr. Hall said, and so could see their degrees revoked.
"The majority of students who don't cheat don't want to put up with those that do," said David Gies, a Spanish professor and former head of the faculty senate.
Professor Gies said that he welcomed Professor Bloomfield's discovery of cheating, and that the expulsions would force students to think twice about cheating.
At the Alderman Library, undergraduates facing final exams said the plagiarists should be punished, but some raised questions about the fairness of scrutinizing just one class. 
"I would agree to it if they could apply it to everyone," Chris Reams, a sophomore from Richmond, said.
He said he knew of students who cheated in advanced economics courses that were essential for admission to business school, driving up the grading curve. Though he considers them more serious offenders, he never reported them.
"The honor system is like a death penalty," Mr. Reams said. "Because it's so severe, if you see cheating, and I have, you're reluctant to report it, so we end up resorting to these spy systems. We've created an atmosphere that makes cheating more seductive."
Sean Turner and Jason Bakelar studied for a calculus test just hours away.
"I'm having a hard time finding a gray area when you say, What's cheating and what's not?" Mr. Bakelar, a senior majoring in politics, said.
Mr. Turner, a junior majoring in economics, agreed, saying students caught cheating should be expelled. "It's not fair to students like us," he said, "who study and do our work." 
But Kristen Edington, a freshman about to take a final in a class on religion and ethics said, "I think the honor system's an ideal." By giving students so much freedom, she said, "it sets up for people to cheat and steal and lie."

HEADLINE: Bit by Bit, Tiny Morland, Kan., Fades Away 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: MORLAND, Kan. 

 BODY:
As a lawyer in this little town, Jerry Helberg does just about everything. He settles estates, writes contracts and wills, prepares tax returns and handles the rare small crime. Mr. Helberg is Morland's only lawyer. At 63, he is also probably its last, for this town is getting smaller by the year.
 Mr. Helberg's three grown children, all graduates of Morland High School, have moved away. 
 "There was no place here for them to take a job and make a living," he said. "Every one of them would come back if there was a job here." 
Morland, population 164, down from 234 in the 1990 census, sits squarely in the path of a decline that the 2000 census found sweeping through the small towns of the Great Plains. While the nation's population grew 13 percent in the 1990's, the Census Bureau found that 676 of the nation's 3,141 counties lost people. 
Most of the decline was in wheat, ranching and oil country in Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota and the Dakotas. In Kansas, for example, there are now more "frontier counties" -- defined by the census as having from two to six people per square mile -- than there were in 1890.
Graham County, which includes Morland, lost 17 percent of its population, which fell to 2,946 in the last decade. Within 50 miles of Morland, fading towns settled more than a century ago -- like Zurich, Palco, Jennings, Clayton and Dresden -- lost 15 percent to 30 percent of their inhabitants. In many places, headstones outnumber mailboxes 10 and 20 to 1.
The population of the Great Plains peaked in the 1930's, but many communities throughout the Plains had been losing people for nearly a century. Demographers spotted some recovery at the start of the 90's.
"In the early 90's there was some hope for what demographers call a population rebound," said Leonard Bloomquist, director of the Population Research Laboratory at Kansas State University in Manhattan. But those hopes quickly sank as water shortages impeded growth and as chain stores like Kmart and Wal-Mart opened in towns, helping them grow but draining business from smaller communities with stores that could not compete.
A town does not vanish in a single moment. Nor does it vanish for a single reason. In Morland's case, the decline was brought on by the mechanization of agriculture and nearly two decades of low wheat prices and shrinking oil fields.
The staples of the community fell away one by one. The Union Pacific Railroad pulled out in the mid-1990's; the tracks were pulled up a couple of years ago. The Methodist church lost its full-time pastor, so the parsonage, built in the 1970's, is rented out. Over the years, Morland has lost its opera house, one of two banks, its two-story hotel, the pool hall, its weekly newspaper, its lumber yard, its three gasoline stations, its automobile dealership, three clothing stores, the shoe store and two of three grocery stores.
In 1973, the town lost its furniture, hardware and mortuary businesses at once when Joe and Jane Nichols, who ran all three, died. The hardest loss will come on Saturday, when Morland High will graduate its last class and close its doors.
What is left is on increasingly unstable ground. Houses that remain sturdy are often close to worthless.
"How do you sell houses to people that aren't here?" asked Fred Pratt, Graham County's main real estate agent. In the county seat, Hill City, he said, "Most of my houses are in the $20,000 to $30,000 range."
Mark E. Niehaus, the county appraiser, said the assessed value of property dropped to $25.5 million last year, from $36.6 million in 1989.
Lana Barton, 32, a divorced mother of two, moved to Morland two years ago to be closer to her parents. She bought a four-bedroom house on Main Street.
"I paid $13,000 for it," Ms. Barton said. "It's a nice house, too."
But her plans exclude Morland. She is studying in Hays, an hour away, to be a teacher and expects to work away from Graham County. 
"I send my children to school in Hill City," she said. "It's a bigger school, with more going on."
The rolling prairie and pasture around Morland are bound by telephone lines and barbed wire, with outcroppings of sandy yellowish shale. Every two or three miles along Graham County's packed dirt roads, stands an empty farmhouse, its clapboard walls scraped of paint, its land rented or sold to big farmers. Occasionally the vista is broken by a rusty oil tank and drilling gear or the bones of a half-century-old tractor and other farm equipment. The roads, some paved, wear shifting layers of shale dust, which April storms whip into blistering fogs.
People do their best to get by. Fred Pratt runs farm auctions and sells real estate and used cars.
"We like living here," Mr. Pratt said. "It's a beautiful place. The only thing we don't like, you can't make any money to survive. My son is getting straight A's. He's not going to be around here."
Patty Minium Bean's father settled here in 1901 and became mayor. Her mother opened the Minium Dry Goods store on Main Street in 1958. Although it loses money, Mrs. Bean keeps it open, selling boots, overalls, zippers, thread and fabric.
"I should close it, but I just don't," Mrs. Bean said.
Her husband, Robert, 70, owns Bean's Country Store at Main and Tiger Streets, the latter named for the school's mascot, a fighting tiger. After school, until a couple of years ago, "the store would fill up with kids," said Faye E. Minium, president of Citizens State Bank on Main Street. "It doesn't anymore."
With the shuttering of Morland High, it is not likely to fill up again. The beginning of the end for Morland's combined high school and junior high came last July. Shelly Swayne, 27, the principal, waited for students to come in to talk about courses and sports for the next year.
"We kept waiting for people to walk in the door, and they never came," Ms. Swayne said. Days later, she said, "other schools started requesting our students' academic and health records."
A school that had graduated 20 to 30 students a decade ago opened this school year with just 19 high school students, an eighth grader and a seventh grader. Sports had to be discontinued, and students were sent to join Hill City High School's teams.
After some parents made clear that they would not enroll their children next fall, Morland's school board surveyed the remaining parents and found even more had decided to send their children to other schools, so the board voted in April to close the school. The elementary school with 30 pupils, an average of about four in each class, has been spared for a year.
"You shut your school and you take some of your identity away," said Todd Toll, 43, a home remodeler and chairman of the school board.
Terry Allison, 40, associate director of the Graham County United Methodist Parish who preaches here on alternate Sundays, said losing the school shook his few parishioners.
"They're proud to live where they are," Mr. Allison said. "But they feel they can't do anything to replenish what they had."
The school's closing is also shaking the economy. Last year, before the latest plunge in enrollment, Mr. Bean sold the school district $1,000 a week in food. This year he is selling it $500. Next year, he might get $350 from the grade school, then nothing.
For all that, the pioneer spirit still glows. Morland's residents take pride in their smart children and imperceptible crime rate. They relish their customs, like ham and eggs on Sunday night at Hill City's Western Hills Restaurant, their traffic-free roads and hunting wild turkeys and ringneck pheasants and fishing in Antelope Lake.
People are also doing their best to survive. Faye Minium's bank has opened branches in Hill City and WaKeeney, 25 miles south of Morland. With 800 checking accounts, almost five times the population of Morland, the bank has been growing about 15 percent a year, Ms. Minium said. She is also organizing a museum in a renovated bank building to draw tourists to Morland.
"You have to be somewhat of a pioneer to live here," she said.
Mr. Bean is reaching out, too. He persuaded small grocers in the region to combine their orders so they can get the volume discounts that wholesalers offer supermarkets, and he delivers the groceries to them.
Still, with downtowns boarded up and shopping strips struggling, the tide of flight from Graham County may be impossible to turn.
But interviews with six of Morland High's eight juniors and seniors revealed fiercely loyal Morland Tigers. Kyle Lemon, a junior who was sent last year to play for Hill City High's teams, said, "I still felt like a Tiger, even if I had to wear the red shirt" of the Hill City Ringnecks.
Georgann Meier, a cheerleader and hurdler whose mother owns the town's beauty salon and whose father works at the grain elevator, said of the school's closing: "I didn't want this to happen. You learn more at a small school. You can't hide."
But in their own aspirations, the school's final classes may be writing Morland's epitaph. Seven of the eight are children of farming families, but not one plans to become a farmer or to live in Morland.
Ms. Meier is going to a junior college across the state in Kansas City and then perhaps to a university.
"I will probably live in a small town, but not in Morland, Kan.," she said. "I'll probably come back when I retire, maybe."
Becky Ellis, 47, the music and special education teacher, is the third generation of her family to graduate from Morland High. She is the wife of a Morland farmer, and they sent their three children to Morland schools. The two older children have gone on to the University of Kansas. 
"Kids here are able to go as far as they can go," Mrs. Ellis said. But, she added, "I think the loss of the school is the beginning of the end of this community."

HEADLINE: Utility Seeks 2 Power Plants To Meet Long Island Demand 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., May 9 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Long Island Power Authority said today that the utility would propose two new power plants on Long Island to meet a demand for electricity that is growing at twice the state average and to avoid the kind of blackouts that have recently afflicted Californians.
 The chairman, Richard M. Kessel, said details about the location of the first plant would be announced Thursday, while information about the second would be announced this summer. The plants would be away from houses, in commercial or industrial areas or at sites where power plants already exist, said Mr. Kessel, who would not provide more details. 
 "While we're going to be O.K. this summer, and we're going to be nothing like California, we will be exactly like California in a couple of years if we don't start" the process for getting permits for at least two new power plants, Mr. Kessel said today at a news conference at a KeySpan Energy electric substation here. "Without some new on-Island power plants, we can't survive here." 
But even if the approval process begins by fall, as Mr. Kessel expects, the earliest the plants could be operating is in 2004. Then, they would add a combined 600 to 700 megawatts of power to LIPA's current available electricity capacity of 5,293 megawatts. LIPA estimates that in an extended heat wave, demand might rise to 5,023 megawatts. Demand is growing at a rate of 100 megawatts a year.
Mr. Kessel said a new plan for an electrical cable traversing the Long Island Sound, to Connecticut, would be proposed within 30 days in hopes of providing an additional 330 megawatts of power by summer 2002. An earlier LIPA plan for such a cable was rejected in March by Connecticut officials.
The first new power plant would be built and operated by KeySpan, and LIPA would buy a portion of the power for Long Island's 1.1 million electricity customers. But Mr. Kessel would not rule out LIPA's owning and operating future plants. LIPA is already considering buying 5 major power plants and more than 40 gas-powered turbine units from KeySpan, Mr. Kessel said.
Applications for the two new plants must be filed with the New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment.
David Flanagan, a spokesman for the State Public Service Commission, said nine projects around the state -- for new plants and for work on existing plants -- have applications under review. Ten others are in the preapplication stage, including two in Brookhaven and one in Smithtown, which together would generate 1,630 megawatts.
Gerald A. Norlander, executive director of the Public Utility Law Project of New York, which represents low-income power users, said LIPA's plans for two new plants "is a common-sense and realistic" approach to the anticipated growth in demand for power. 
Long Island is unique in its transmission constraints, he said, so utilities have to strive for self-sufficiency "whether they build or enter into a contract to buy the power."
"Both of those are reasonable alternatives to either running short and having blackouts or having to pay exorbitant prices in the short-term wholesale market," Mr. Norlander said.
But Ashok Gupta, the senior energy economist with the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council in Manhattan, was skeptical.
"The public is still not convinced that either Long Island or the state knows what it is doing to solve the energy problems and is not, therefore, ready to support new power plants, whether built by private companies or built by the state," he said. "What the public perceives is a lot of confusion and no strategy."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 
Ad Revenue Drops At Magazines

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
 In another sign of the effect of the weakening economy on advertising and the media, the Publishers Information Bureau in New York reported yesterday that ad revenue in magazines declined in April compared with figures in the month a year earlier. 
 Ad revenue last month totaled almost $1.6 billion, down 1.2 percent from $1.62 billion in the month a year earlier. 
That decline was somewhat less than expected given the cutbacks many advertisers have made in print ad budgets. Ad pages for April fell off more sharply, down 9.5 percent from April 2000 to 23,330 from 25,791. For the first four months of 2001, revenue totaled $5.18 billion, up 0.3 percent from last year, and ad pages totaled 79,109, down 7.5 percent.

HEADLINE: M.I.T. Official Is Chosen to Be the President of Tufts 

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
Lawrence S. Bacow, chancellor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an architect of its research partnership with the University of Cambridge in England, was appointed president of Tufts University yesterday.
 In August, Dr. Bacow, 49, will succeed John DiBiaggio, who became president of Tufts in 1992 and who announced last fall that he intended to step down. Dr. Bacow, who received a Ph.D. in public policy from Harvard in 1978, will become the 12th president of Tufts since it was founded in Medford, Mass., in 1852. 
 A professor of environmental studies who specializes in resolving disputes over environmental policy, Dr. Bacow has served as one of two deputies to the president of M.I.T. since 1998. 
While his responsibilities at M.I.T. include overseeing graduate and undergraduate education, and strategic planning, his highest-profile assignment was the creation of the Cambridge-M.I.T. Institute in 1999. The institute, founded with an initial $108 million investment from the British government, is seeking to develop technologies and products to sharpen the competitiveness of British manufacturing industries.
Dr. Bacow, who earned his bachelor's degree at M.I.T. in 1972, said he hoped to build on a similar spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship at Tufts, where experts on nutrition and international diplomacy have already collaborated on efforts to ease world hunger, and where engineers have sought to improve the practice of dentistry.
"This is an institution that gained enormous stature in the last 10 to 20 years," said Dr. Bacow, who cited the 14,000 applications that Tufts received last fall for the 1,100 seats in its freshman class. "It's gone from being a regional institution to one that has national and international stature."
Dr. Bacow received a law degree from Harvard in 1976, but never practiced. The following year, he joined the department of urban studies and planning at M.I.T. He has since specialized in finding ways to forge consensus, outside the courts, on thorny environmental disputes like those over the location of hazardous waste facilities. He is the author or co-author of four books and is writing a fifth, "The New Protectionism: Environmental Policy in a Global Economy," for M.I.T. Press.
Dr. Bacow's wife, Adele Fleet Bacow, is a community planning consultant. They have two sons, one an undergraduate at M.I.T., the other at the University of Pennsylvania.
During Dr. DiBiaggio's nine-year tenure, the Tufts endowment has tripled, to nearly $600 million. Dr. DiBiaggio, 68, says he plans to continue his work "promoting issues of active citizenship."

HEADLINE: Competition Is Feverish As 3 Cities Woo Boeing 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 9 

 BODY:
Some cities will do just about anything to lure the Boeing Company.
 Denver trotted out John Elway, the football great, to greet Boeing executives when they scouted the city for their new headquarters; in Dallas, top executives were met by a mariachi band and a letter from Alex Rodriguez, the baseball superstar who recently left Seattle for Texas, encouraging Boeing to do the same. And Chicago played the culture card by uncorking a string quartet at a dinner with the city's elite at the Art Institute. 
 Now, just seven weeks after Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, said that it would leave Seattle and move its corporate headquarters to either Chicago, Dallas or Denver, the competition is largely over and the three contestant cities are nervously awaiting a decision that could be announced as early as Thursday. 
News reports, which were unconfirmed, have put Chicago ahead in the horse race, though some accounts have Dallas way out front; most reports place Denver, whose economic incentives were perhaps least generous, as the underdog.
"We pretty much feel like everyone else does," said Andrew Hudson, a spokesman for Denver's mayor, Wellington Webb. "We just tried out for the high school play and we're waiting for them to post the results. We're the underdog, but we kind of like it that way."
Though the new Boeing headquarters would house only about 500 employees -- more than 70,000 manufacturing jobs will remain in the Seattle area -- each city hopes to gain in prestige and bragging rights what it cannot gain in head count.
Indeed, the high-stakes contest for Boeing has stirred not only the pride of the competitor cities, it has also created a sideshow to the effort to find a suitable home for Boeing and wrest tax breaks, subsidies and other concessions out of the process.
Newspaper columnists have weighed in on the advantages and disadvantages of luring Boeing. Television choppers have chased Boeing helicopters as top executives tried to scout locations in privacy; and Ron Kirk, the mayor of Dallas, has thrown in what could tip the balance in the Boeing sweepstakes.
"We've got chalupas; we've got tacos," he reportedly told Boeing executives.
Landing Boeing's headquarters would be more of a symbolic victory than an economic boom. With just 500 employees, Boeing would not even rank among the largest employers in the Chicago area. Sears, Roebuck; Sara Lee; and others have tens of thousands of employees here.
But the move would add cachet to an already big lineup and help Chicago send a message to a global audience. After losing some giant corporations, like Quaker Oats and Amoco, to mergers or acquisitions in recent years, Chicago is looking to snare another Fortune 500 company and prove that it is still the City of Big Shoulders.
'It would be a great shot in the arm for us," said Paul O'Connor, executive director of World Business Chicago, a nonprofit economic development association. "To be the place that sends a dramatic global message would be great.'
Critics have long debated the economic benefits of offering tax breaks, subsidies and other financial incentives to wealthy corporations. Now it is clear that Chicago, Denver and Dallas are willing to offer millions of dollars in incentives because they want more than 500 jobs; they believe attracting Boeing could give them enormous marketing influence and help persuade other corporations to follow suit.
"This says to the rest of the business world, 'This is a strong business environment,' " said Patty Silverstein, chief economist at the Metro Denver Network, an arm of the Denver Chamber of Commerce.
Though Boeing said it wanted to conduct a quick and low-key search for a new home, the company's announcement in March that it wanted to have a "leaner corporate center," touched off a media blitz and a frenzied triangular courtship.
Denver played host to Boeing executives by treating executives to buffalo meat and eggs at the Governor's Mansion, where Mr. Elway, the former Broncos quarterback, played top booster among a Who's Who in the business elite.
The news media in Denver were less cordial, though, openly questioning whether the city could handle any more growth. "Boeing executives are thinking about moving their luxurious suites to Colorado because of our quality of life in this little part of the world we call paradise," wrote Chuck Green, a columnist at The Denver Post. "Nearly 1.5 million people came here during the last 20 years for the same reason. So when is paradise lost?"
In Texas, where saying something is overgrown is a compliment, Boeing executives were showered with gifts. There were autographed pictures; a bobble-head doll in the likeness of Dirk Nowitzki, the German-born Dallas Mavericks basketball player known as the Flying Dutchman; and a letter from Alex Rodriguez, formerly of the Seattle Mariners and now the Texas Rangers' $252 million man.
Chicago chose to emphasize culture. A glossy brochure promoted the city's diversity, parks and neighborhoods. Top executives had dinner at the Art Institute, the museum that holds treasures like works by Cezanne and Edward Hopper. 
Chicago officials called it the soft sell, but when the executives tried to tour the city and its suburbs, their corporate jet was tailed by a local television station helicopter, and vans with other employees were pursued by car-bound journalists; the same thing happened in Dallas.
The press also printed daily rumors about where Boeing might move, what incentives it was offered and even who was believed to be the front-runner. They also offered subtle knocks of the competitor cities. In Texas, Boeing was greeted by great weather and blue skies. The Dallas Morning News contrasted that with the Chicago visit.
"Chicago didn't do as well when Boeing came to visit last week," The Morning News said. "The Windy City lived up to its name, welcoming Boeing with gusty days, rain and some snow flurries."
The relief from the corporate storm over the Boeing headquarters could come as early as Thursday. If news accounts are to be believed, Boeing's chief executive, Philip M. Condit, will not make the announcement until he is aboard the corporate jet. He will place a call to the three governors just before he touches down in the winning city. State and local officials confirmed today that they gave Boeing officials telephone numbers and their whereabouts over the next few days in case of the sudden announcement.
Boeing was typically mum on reports: "I can't talk about the process or the logistics of making an announcement," said Ken Mercer, a spokesman at Boeing.

HEADLINE: Labor Abuses In El Salvador Are Detailed In Document 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
A long-suppressed report by the Salvadoran government, made public yesterday by an American labor rights group, spelled out serious problems in the country's apparel factories, including unhealthy air and water, large amounts of forced overtime and the frequent dismissal of workers who supported labor unions.
 The National Labor Committee made the copy available as part of a campaign by labor unions and their Democratic allies to pressure the Bush administration and Congress to include strong worker protections in any new trade agreements. 
 El Salvador's government originally issued the unusually critical report last August, but withdrew it from circulation the next day, saying it was technically flawed. On the day the report was issued, managers of the country's duty-free, export-oriented factories, known as the maquiladoras, denounced it. 
Last year, El Salvador exported $1.6 billion worth of apparel to the United States, making it the eighth-largest apparel exporter to this country.
The report found that many of the country's 229 apparel factories did not provide basic safety equipment and threatened to fire workers unless they agreed to work long hours of overtime. The report also faulted many factories for setting unrealistic production quotas and for requiring many workers to put in extra hours with no pay when they fell short of those quotas.
The report's harshest conclusion involved what it described as the systematic violation of workers' efforts to form unions.
"It was found that there exists an anti-union policy in the maquilas, by which any attempt at organization is repressed," said the report, prepared by the El Salvador Labor Ministry and financed in part by the United States Agency for International Development. "According to union leaders interviewed, it is very common for supervisors and chiefs of personnel to threaten workers with firings if they belong to a union or attempt to form one," it said.
The report noted that not one of the 229 maquiladora factories had a union contract. Many workers interviewed told Labor Ministry officials that there was a blacklist that factory managers used to make sure that known union supporters were not given jobs.
The report was made available just days after President Bush announced plans to seek expedited negotiating authority in the hope of establishing the Free Trade Area of the Americas, a duty-free trade zone from Canada to Chile. In a speech on Monday, Mr. Bush said such a free trade area was essential to improving living standards throughout the Western Hemisphere.
But union leaders assert that unless the treaty establishing the free trade area includes strong labor protections, it will encourage companies to move operations to countries with the worst wages and working conditions, thus undermining efforts to upgrade living standards.
The El Salvador report criticized the country's factory inspectors, saying that many workers interviewed were emphatic in declaring that there was a great deal of corruption among inspectors.
Jorge Nieto Menendez, El Salvador's minister of labor, said the government was seeking to train inspectors better. "We want investment, but only with respect and fairness," he said. "Only when workers' rights are respected can we generate more contracts with American companies."
The report describes how important the export apparel industry is for El Salvador, growing at a 13 percent annual rate and accounting for 79,000 jobs.
Charles Kernaghan, executive director of the National Labor Commission, and several members of Congress are planning to hold a news conference today in Washington where they will issue a report detailing problems at El Salvador factories that make goods for many well-known companies, including Kohl's, the Gap, Liz Claiborne and Nike. That report found that many apparel workers face mandatory pregnancny tests, work 80-hour weeks and have to work in temperatures of more than 90 degrees.
The Labor Ministry report found that many workers complained about inadequate wages. According to the report, many workers said that despite the many hours of overtime they worked, "the wage was insufficient to satisfy their family needs with dignity."
Factory managers told the labor ministry that an important reason that employees have to work so much overtime is that, in their view, the workers deliberately delay production to force the company to continue operations beyond the normal shift, thus allowing the workers to receive overtime pay.

HEADLINE: Annan in Washington to Seek AIDS Funds 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE with DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 9 

 BODY:
Against a background of rising anger in Congress over the loss of American seats on two United Nations panels, Secretary General Kofi Annan went to Washington today to ask the Bush administration for more money to fight AIDS in Africa.
 Mr. Annan has proposed a global fund to provide $7 billion to $10 billion annually on top of money already being spent to battle AIDS and other infectious diseases. He met this afternoon with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the secretary of health and human services, Tommy Thompson. 
 General Powell told reporters after the meeting that the talks had been "excellent."
Mr. Annan has been invited to the White House on Friday, when President Bush is expected to announce an initial pledge to the AIDS fund, probably about $200 million. 
But an administration official said the United States would have certain criteria for establishing the fund and would expect other leading industrial nations to contribute.
On Friday Mr. Annan will take part in talks with President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, who recently convened a summit-level meeting of African leaders to discuss the AIDS crisis. 
Africa has about 70 percent of the world's 36 million people infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and 17 million Africans have died of the disease. Epidemics -- tuberculosis and malaria as well as AIDS -- are not only shortening African lives but also creating havoc in already weak economies.
Secretary General Annan's trip to Washington today, in advance of a special General Assembly session on AIDS next month, was planned to focus strictly on his proposed global fund. 
The deputy United Nations spokesman, Manoel de Almeida e Silva, said after the meeting that no other topics had been discussed. Some officials had expected that broader questions about United States relations with the United Nations would arise, but they did not.
As Mr. Annan made the rounds in Washington today, the Bush administration sought to halt Congressional efforts to put pressure on the United Nations to reinstate the United States to the two committees -- the Human Rights Commission and the International Narcotics Control Board.
On Tuesday leaders of the House International Relations Committee agreed to a plan agreeing to pay $582 million in back dues owed to the United Nations but withholding $244 million unless the United States was voted back onto the rights commission.
"We don't think that linking our obligations and payments to the United Nations to the outcome of that particular vote is a good idea," said Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman. "We think that that would be extremely damaging to our ability to cooperate in multilateral organizations and with a sense that we are a reliable participant in these organizations and that we'll pay our way."
Mr. Annan met today with Senator William H. Frist, Republican of Tennessee. Mr. Frist, a well-known surgeon before turning to politics, was among a group of senators that introduced a bill in early April committing the United States to a contribution of $1 billion to fight AIDS over the next two years. 
Various programs taken together now total less that half of that, though the United States remains the largest single contributor to anti-AIDS campaigns globally.
In March Senator Frist, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Africa, asked the General Accounting Office to study how effectively American money was spent in Africa to combat AIDS through the United States Agency for International Development, which handles a large part of the budget. 
That study found that while the agency had been allocated a 53 percent increase in its budget for Africa this year -- to $174 million from $114 million -- there still were problems in distributing the assistance.
The study found, for example, that Congressional restrictions on assistance to foreign military forces got in the way of programs aimed at troops and police officers. 
The General Accounting Office referred to a National Intelligence Council report that between 10 percent and 60 percent of soldiers in sub-Saharan Africa were infected with H.I.V. For example, in Tanzania, the report said, the infection rate in the armed forces is between 15 percent and 30 percent, compared with 8 percent in the general population. Similar patterns were found in other countries.
The G.A.O. report said that laws limiting American aid to foreign troops were a "disincentive" to pursuing prevention campaigns where they might be most needed.
Members of Congress have also restricted family planning assistance in efforts to prevent money from going to organizations that advocate abortions. Family planning experts say that contraceptives, particularly condoms, are the most effective weapon in preventing AIDS, and that there is not enough money to meet international needs.
Diplomats and members of Congress say it is hard to judge what effect if any the confrontation between Washington and the United Nations will have on Mr. Annan's efforts to involve the United States in his global campaign against the AIDS epidemic. Officials here say Mr. Annan regrets the unexpected votes that dropped American representatives from international panels.
In an interview on Tuesday, General Powell said of the American setbacks at the United Nations, "Kofi Annan is as distressed as we are."
For much of last year, Richard C. Holbrooke, the Clinton administration's United Nations envoy, had to drop most other issues to campaign for reduced American dues in return for a promise to pay arrears totaling more than $1 billion. 
Today, Fred Eckhard, spokesman for Mr. Annan, said the secretary general had told a meeting of senior United Nations officials this morning before leaving for Washington that he was concerned about calls in Congress to punish the organization for votes cats by fewer than one-third of its member nations.
"Punishing all 189 member states would be counterproductive, and punishing the bureaucracy would be unfair," Mr. Eckhard quoted Mr. Annan as saying. The secretary general also recognized the significant contributions the United States had made to the commission since its inception in 1947 and hoped that the United States would be voted back onto the rights commission next year, Mr. Eckhard said. The next election takes place next spring.
Mary Robinson, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, who was here for the senior officials' meeting, said there was "shock and dismay" in Geneva last week when the results of the voting became known.

HEADLINE: IN SHOW OF UNITY, HOUSE REPUBLICANS PASS BUDGET BILL 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER with DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9 

 BODY:
Again displaying a solid wall of support for President Bush, House Republicans voted nearly unanimously today to pass a budget resolution that was favored by the president and opposed by nearly all the Democrats. 
 The vote was the latest in a string of House victories for Mr. Bush on issues like ergonomics, bankruptcy rules and tax cuts, and it illustrated how House Republicans were defying expectations that their narrow majority would leave them hamstrung by infighting. 
 Representative Jim Nussle of Iowa, the Budget Committee chairman, said the votes of all but 3 of the 220 House Republicans reflected the wide support the measure had from conservatives, who were "satisfied that we have held the line on spending," and moderates, who were pleased that the tax cut contained in the measure was a bit smaller than the original March version.
But the legislative details are less striking than the unity, which has set off complaints from Democrats, who say that Republican partisanship exceeds all decent bounds, and celebration among Republican leaders, who hope that the cohesiveness will help them increase their 10-vote majority. 
The vote approving the budget resolution, 221 to 207, included support from six Democrats. The final vote in the Senate is scheduled for Thursday. Congressional leaders said they would not allow the measure to come to final votes unless they were certain it would be passed by the Senate. The measure, which White House and Congressional negotiators agreed to last week, would allow $1.35 trillion in tax cuts over the next 11 years and nearly $2 trillion in spending in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
Republicans argued that they had set aside sufficient money for Social Security, Medicare, debt reduction and other needs and had plenty left for a tax cut.
"Who does the money belong to?" Mr. Nussle asked. "The American people."
Democrats said the measure would allow too much tax reduction for the wealthy and was dishonest in that the spending limits for the military and other programs were sure to be exceeded.
"This is the day Republicans return to high deficits and high interest rates that could stall our wonderful engine of economic growth,"said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader.
There are at least four major reasons the Republicans' thin margin has been enough to help pass the Bush agenda.
First, that agenda has been kept simple, focused on the most unifying issue to Republicans -- tax cuts and their cousins, budget resolutions. As Representative Phil English of Pennsylvania said: "We've been hitting on the easier stuff. There hasn't been much to set off any ideological war."
Even a potential split over education has been papered over, at least for now, with approval today by a House committee of an education bill backed by Mr. Bush that would require annual testing in grades three through eight. Conservative Republicans complained that the bill no longer contained a measure backed by Mr. Bush to give parents of students from failing schools vouchers to use for private school tuitions. But enough conservatives set aside their opposition, and the committee passed the bill 41 to 7. 
But they have also succeeded because of effective party leadership, from a patient Speaker J. Dennis Hastert to a hard-driving, persistent majority whip in Tom DeLay; pride in President Bush and a desire to see him succeed; and the narrow majority itself, which reminds Republicans that if they do not hang together, they will not really be running the House.
As Mr. DeLay said last week, "The closer the majority, the easier it is to hold people together."
That maxim plainly does not work in the Senate, where the Republican majority is only one vote -- when Vice President Dick Cheney is there -- and Republican senators desert their leaders on issues like taxes and campaign finance. But the Senate is a different place, where members have larger and more diverse constituencies, where independence and individualism are exalted. 
Of course, issues like family planning abroad, support for the United Nations, and other ideologically charged matters can still create deep divisions among Republicans. And the education bill will test the Republicans' winning streak in the House, where it will be considered as early as next week. Because enough conservatives are likely to oppose this legislation, a strong Democratic vote will be needed. And everything done to please the Democrats risks displeasing more Republicans.
But thus far, Republicans' unity has been astounding. Of eight important measures adopted through last week, Republican dissent reached double digits only twice. The Republicans who voted against the budget resolution today were Representatives Charles Bass of New Hampshire, Joel Hefley of Colorado and Ron Paul of Texas. Democrats voting for the measure were Representatives Gary A. Condit of California, Ralph M. Hall of Texas, Earl F. Hilliard of Alabama, Chris John of Louisiana, Ken Lucas of Kentucky and James A. Traficant Jr. of Ohio. 
Democrats grumble over the Republican unity. Representative Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota accuses Republican moderates of "abject surrender" to the "hard right wing." Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, known for seeking accommodation across party lines, said that the Republicans' excluding Democrats from budget discussions "is about as bad as it can get."
Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts said, "They believe that the Democratic minority is a nuisance to be tolerated, rather than elected representatives." (When Democrats ran the House until 1994, Republicans said much the same things about them.)
Mr. DeLay replies that "Democrats have devoted themselves to one thing only: total and complete obstruction."
But much as they would like to, House Democrats have not managed to obstruct anything important.
The biggest difference for House Republicans is the Bush presidency. Only 69 of the 220 Republicans ever served under a Republican president, and then they were in a minority; they delight in the change. Representative Jennifer Dunn of Washington, said, "It's very important to us to make him succeed." 
Representative Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, credits Mr. Bush's leadership with making "the fractured nature of the Republican conference almost nonexistent."
Party leadership shows in those lopsided votes. Mr. DeLay says he talks weekly to almost every Republican. Representative Peter Hoekstra of Michigan said, "This guy intuitively knows how far the leadership can push."
Even some Republicans who think Mr. DeLay's views are too far to the right credit him with diligent, determined leadership.
But while Democrats, seizing on those views and his hard-edged partisanship, would like to portray Mr. DeLay as running the House, most Republicans insist that their low-key speaker, Mr. Hastert, is in charge. Representative David Dreier of California, chairman of the Rules Committee, said, "Here's a guy who has incredible patience, he has large groups of members who come in and, for lack of a better term, beat him up on things. And he takes it, and then gets them to go along."
Ms. Dunn identified another reason for the successes: dealing with tax legislation they had worked on in previous years: "We knew the strengths and the weaknesses -- what would come up. We already had our act together." 
The education bill is a different matter. As Mr. DeLay said last week, "Many on our right don't see education as a responsibility of the federal government."
He should know. Opposing a Clinton measure to pay for increased testing -- the cornerstone of Mr. Bush's plan -- Mr. DeLay said in 1998, "We don't need the federal government and national organizations getting involved in our local school districts." 
Mr. DeLay may see things differently now, since it is Mr. Bush making the proposal.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about House passage of a budget resolution misidentified one of the six Democrats who supported it. He was Robert E. Cramer of Alabama. (Earl F. Hilliard of Alabama voted against it.) The article also misstated the breakdown of Republican votes. Three Republicans voted no and 214 yes; three did not vote.

HEADLINE: The Next Mayor's Education Agenda 

 BODY:
Polls show that New York City voters rank education at the top of their issues list this year. It should therefore come as no surprise that so do the candidates who hope to succeed Rudolph Giuliani as mayor. The city has 1.1 million public-school students, many with parents who vote. But plenty of people who do not have children in the public schools are no less concerned about the sad state of those schools. This broad interest in better schools offers the mayoral candidates an unusual opportunity to wrestle with a problem that looks as intractable today as the city's crime rate appeared to be a few years ago. 
 The basics clearly come first. A State Supreme Court justice framed the city's problem in stark terms in January. The state, he said, has failed in its obligation to provide New York City's students with a "sound, basic education" as required by the State Constitution. The two worst problems the next mayor will confront are acute shortages of both space and certified teachers, which in turn create overcrowded classrooms. Solving both problems will require the political will to commit extra state and city money to New York City's schools. 
 City officials estimate that they will need almost 70,000 new seats by 2004. Even now, thousands of high school students attend in shifts and are robbed of a full day of class just when they need it most. At the same time an entire generation of teachers, including some of the best in the system, is preparing to retire, greatly complicating the chancellor's job of finding enough certified replacements. Meanwhile recruitment is hobbled by the fact that the city offers less pay than the suburbs, even though city jobs make demands that suburban teachers rarely face -- including the hassle of ensuring order in large and unwieldy classes and introducing students who speak 140 different languages to a new educational and civic environment.
There are other factors over which the candidates now have little control. If Mayor Giuliani negotiates a short-term contract with teachers, or fails to negotiate any contract at all, the next mayor will face a labor problem. If the State Legislature fails to abolish the Board of Education, the next mayor will have less authority over city schools than he requires. If Albany shies away from extra funding in its new education formula, or the City Council fails to restore Mr. Giuliani's cuts in education money, the next mayor could have his educational agenda clipped from the outset.
Such an accounting of the city's education needs can make New York's school problems seem insurmountable. But if a city of eight million can be made to work better, as Mr. Giuliani has demonstrated it can be, then surely the nation's largest public school system can work better as well. 
Historically, New York's public schools have brought millions of immigrants into the American mainstream and have helped fill this vibrant city with productive citizens. Good schools are central to New York City's quality of life and to its economic base, both of which decline when the middle class flees to suburban schools. The city and the country lose ground, both educationally and in terms of social justice, when poor children find themselves trapped in a crumbling system that serves only to reinforce their poverty.

HEADLINE: An Irresponsible Budget Plan 

 BODY:
After several days of backroom negotiations, the House approved a federal budget plan yesterday that is a model of fiscal evasion and irresponsibility. The tax cut of $1.35 trillion, to be spread out over 11 years, is lower than the original proposal by President Bush but still so large that it wipes out resources for vital domestic spending programs. Mr. Bush and the Republican leadership assert that there is plenty of money for domestic needs, but their claims are belied by the embarrassing fact that this budget does not even provide the money on the spending side that Mr. Bush sought for education and health research. If Congress wants to come up with funds for these areas, it will have to find the money by cutting even more elsewhere. 
 The expectation is for the Senate to approve the budget resolution, which is non-binding, today. Nevertheless, as a matter of principle we urge those senators who care about making progress on health care, schools, the environment and energy conservation, and who say they favor money to shore up Medicare and Social Security in the future, to reject this budget as inimical to those objectives. An earlier budget resolution in the Senate with an outsized tax cut passed with a bipartisan vote because it called for a discretionary spending increase of 8 percent. This budget's spending levels fail to reach that standard. Indeed they are below what the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office says would be necessary to maintain current domestic programs. 
 The budget, which is for the next fiscal year and totals nearly $2 trillion, was supposed to be passed last week but got put off because of last-minute objections. On Tuesday night negotiators agreed to budget language that is shameless in its deliberate ambiguity. On education and health research, the budget does not set aside additional funds but simply allows the Senate to pass an empty resolution declaring its intention to find the money in other parts of the budget. Where those cuts would come is not specified.
Fortunately the budget resolution before the Senate today is not the final stage of the process. Congress can still correct some of the flaws in the tax cut when it writes the actual tax legislation in coming weeks. Lawmakers should make sure that $100 billion of it is used for immediate economic stimulus and not folded into the long-term tax package in order to reward the wealthiest taxpayers, as sought by House Republicans. It is a good sign at least that Senators Charles Grassley of Iowa and Max Baucus of Montana, the Finance Committee's chairman and ranking Democrat, are trying to write a more equitable, bipartisan tax bill. To meet that goal, they should not lower the top marginal tax rate significantly and should modify rather than repeal the estate tax. As much as possible, tax cuts and rebates should be granted to those with lower incomes by making them refundable against payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare.
On the spending side, the House-approved budget is completely unrealistic. Even Republicans serving on the various appropriations committees are saying privately that they cannot live within its ceilings. On defense, increased spending would be allowed over what is prescribed in this resolution. Congress should feel no hesitation in doing the same for domestic spending as various spending bills make their way through the process in the next several months. This budget embodies an abdication of responsibility and a retreat from the goals of improved safety, education, health and retirement security for Americans.

A Scandal Unadorned By the Media

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
WHOSE house is it, anyway -- his, hers or ours?
 Ah, the complexities of urban policy. 
 Luckily, this sensitive question will be resolved in court. We don't have to think about it. But we can think about it, and here is the thought of the day. The latest salvo from the city's most awkward divorce case comes with a useful lesson -- namely, that the public must finally realize that it cannot blame the messenger for the moral lapses, the bad taste, the foibles of public figures. 
If anything, even the tabloids have shown restraint in their coverage of the imbroglio over Gracie Mansion. Of course that could reflect fear of a mayor with a predilection for exacting retribution.
But more likely, it's that even the most aggressive journalist would be hard pressed to embroider what is already a tangled tale involving a classic triangle: the mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who brazenly parades his companion in front of the whole city; the companion, Judith Nathan, so often at the mayor's side that she's had taxpayer-financed security; and the wife, Donna Hanover, an actress who was blindsided by her husband last year, when he announced, without forewarning her, that he was seeking a separation. Now the wife wants to bar the companion from the family home.
Some say it's Ms. Hanover who should face reality and disappear, but the couple have two children, Andrew, 15, and Caroline, 11, so maybe she's trying to create at least a semblance of stability by staying in what has been their home for almost eight years. And keeping her husband's good friend away from the door. Also, it must be nice to live in a riverfront house, just as it must be nice to have a city-paid staff as Ms. Hanover still does, though unofficially fired as first lady.
See, there's no credible way for even the irresponsible arm of the media to embellish on that set of facts. The mayor's marital mess is not the result of investigative snooping, any more than Bill Clinton's impeachment was. His relationship with Monica Lewinsky became public knowledge through the lawsuit of another woman, Paula Jones.
It's fair to say that nobody has ever seen anything quite like Mr. Giuliani's willfulness, perhaps the result of facing cancer, or term limits, or both. Or maybe it's just a function of his personality.
Whatever the reason, thanks to the Giulianis, the Clintons, Jesse Jackson and such venerable malfunctioners as Senator Edward M. Kennedy, John F. Kennedy, Gary Hart and all the rest, the personal and political have become inextricably intertwined -- inseparable, really. The full range of human weakness and moral confusion has been dragged through our courts and become part of our electoral politics.
The media did not do that; they were once so protective of public figures that many Americans never even realized that Franklin D. Roosevelt used a wheelchair (hardly a sin), or that reporters were hearing rumors that President Kennedy was involved in dalliances. Some tried to check out the rumors, unsuccessfully.
TODAY, they wouldn't have to; they'd probably get chapter and verse handed to them at a news conference or in a lawsuit. Journalists couldn't ignore these stories if they wanted to. And most people, except for the religious right, seem to be getting inured to it all. It's incremental. Divorce badly hurt Adlai E. Stevenson and Nelson A. Rockefeller in the 1950's and 1960's; by 1980 the country elected Ronald Reagan president, ignoring his divorce. Peccadilloes like George W. Bush's 1976 arrest for driving while intoxicated, revealed in the waning days of last year's presidential campaign, barely drew a public shrug. 
"I think it goes in waves," said Tom Goldstein, dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. "The journalists knew more in the past and they were more tolerant. The difference now is, more gets out, and so standards have changed. In some ways the media drive the culture and in some ways they lag a little behind. They work in tandem."
This is not to suggest that the coarsening of the public discourse has no impact, even today. But for his philanderings, Bill Clinton would have had a totally different second term, and might even have been free to repair Social Security and address the looming energy crunch. 
And but for his self-indulgence, Mr. Giuliani would have left office with honors, his difficult personality relegated to a footnote. Now the footnote may well become the headline. And not because of the headline writers.

HEADLINE: Bush Links Aid to Yugoslavia to the Extradition of Milosevic 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9 

 BODY:
President Bush told President Vojislav Kostunica of Yugoslavia today that American financial aid to Belgrade would depend on cooperation with the war crimes tribunal at The Hague.
 Mr. Kostunica did not commit to handing over his predecessor, Slobodan Milosevic, but did say that he was pushing to have his country's law changed by the end of May so that Belgrade can cooperate with the international tribunal investigating war crimes against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in 1999. 
 The White House saw Mr. Kostunica's remarks as a first step and an evolution in his thinking from just a month ago when he refused outright to hand over the former president. But administration officials continued to press Mr. Kostunica to move further and allow a foreign trial of Mr. Milosevic.
Washington holds considerable leverage as Mr. Kostunica tries to attract foreign investment to rebuild his battered country. Yugoslavia was invited to rejoin the World Bank this week but the White House has said it will not take part in a donors' conference where Belgrade is seeking to raise as much as $1 billion to recover from more than a decade of war, economic sanctions and misrule.
In a speech today at the Cato Institute, a conservative public policy center in Washington, Mr. Kostunica urged the West to give his country "a shot of economic adrenaline" without imposing political conditions on the assistance. He spoke of the importance of trying Mr. Milosevic in Yugoslavia to promote justice among the people who suffered under his leadership.
"Justice is very important because we have been living for a long time with something that is contrary to justice," Mr. Kostunica said. "It should be in their hands and not the hands of foreigners."
The new president, who translated the Federalist Papers into Serbian years ago, invoked the founding of America in urging officials in the United States to give Yugoslavia time to evolve. "Democracy cannot be imposed by above," he said in his speech, adding, "We understand that you do not want to be mired in our region indefinitely."
The Bush administration took pains today to send Mr. Kostunica a dual message: praise for Yugoslavia's democratic progress coupled with a firm demand that Belgrade extradict Mr. Milosevic.
Mr. Kostunica was granted a meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney at the White House and Mr. Bush dropped by for about 10 minutes with Condoleezza Rice, his national security adviser.
"The president stated clearly that Milosevic must face justice for his international crimes," said Mary Ellen Countryman, a White House spokeswoman. She added that Mr. Bush welcomed the improved relations between the United States and Yugoslavia and that he was ready to help Belgrade with its democratic transition once Mr. Kostunica agreed to cooperate with The Hague.
Mr. Kostunica received more pressure this afternoon from Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. 
Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said the disagreement over Mr. Milosevic did not compare to the divisions between the United States and Yugoslavia in recent years. "The context in which we're meeting is not a context of negotiating over some horrible things that have happened but it's of discussing cooperation over some wonderful things that have happened," Mr. Boucher said.

HEADLINE: White House Asks Unions To Meet on Energy Policy 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9 

 BODY:
In an effort to generate support from organized labor for its new energy policy, the Bush administration, has invited officers of about a dozen unions to the White House next Monday for a confidential preview of the policy.
 The administration had made few successful overtures to labor, but it is seeking -- and expects to win -- union support for its energy plans, which will call for extensive new oil and gas drilling, the laying of pipelines and the construction of power plants. All of that could translate into thousands of union jobs. 
 "They're going to look for support for their energy policy wherever they can," said a Republican strategist familiar with the administration's carefully orchestrated efforts to sell the policy. "And they're finding an unlikely bedfellow in labor, which would be a huge beneficiary from drilling and from building plants." 
The administration's courtship of organized labor could drive a wedge between unions and environmental advocacy groups, which complain that the administration has made little effort to work with them. Andrew D. Lundquist, who directed Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force, invited environmental organizations to a meeting, but the groups said he did not solicit substantive recommendations.
The Teamsters and Laborers International unions -- which will be represented at Monday's meeting with Mr. Cheney and Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao -- have already come out in favor of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
"We view this as a jobs opportunity," said Mike Mathis, the government affairs director for the Teamsters International, who will accompany the union's president, James P. Hoffa, to the meeting.
Union workers and environmentalists have been allied on trade issues and overwhelmingly supported Vice President Al Gore's presidential candidacy last year. None of the unions invited to the White House on Monday endorsed President Bush.
The courtship of labor also comes as President Bush prepares to press his bid to win authority from Congress to negotiate new trade deals with Latin America and countries around the globe. The intensity of organized labor's efforts to oppose that bid -- as it did when President Bill Clinton unsuccessfully sought such authority -- could prove decisive.
Environmental groups are already criticizing the energy plan as increasing pollution and giving to the energy interests that contributed to Mr. Bush's presidential campaign.
The environmental groups will coordinate an assault on the plan next week when it is released, with local demonstrations and lobbying efforts to steer Congress toward a strategy based on efficiency, conservation and renewable resources, leaders of several organizations said today.
The groups are also considering a television advertising campaign, based in part on polling by Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who has advised the organizations on how to pitch their argument.
Mr. Mellman said his research shows that people overwhelmingly believe that energy problems in California and nationwide are not the result of underlying shortages but of corporate profiteering.
"There is a very strong belief that George Bush and this administration represent the interests of big business, including the oil companies and utilities, exactly the people who seem to be manufacturing this crisis for their own benefit," Mr. Mellman said.
At a news conference today, representatives of several environmental groups questioned virtually every assumption of the Bush energy plan. For example, they challenged the idea that the nation was in an energy crisis, saying that was an argument intended to spur Congress to roll back environmental laws and increase the profits of oil, gas, coal and nuclear power companies.
Dave Hawkins of the Natural Resources Defense Council said, "The reason that this Bush energy plan emphasizes production is not because the private sector needs help in increasing production, it's that they need the Bush government's help in overturning environmental, health and safety laws."
A memorandum Mr. Mellman prepared for the Sierra Club says that voters oppose all of the energy proposals offered by the administration. His polling shows, for example, that 69 percent of voters oppose relaxing clean air standards and 68 percent oppose drilling for oil in national monuments. The proposal with the least opposition, 48 percent, was building more nuclear power plants.
Monday's meeting is part of a larger campaign by the White House to lay the groundwork for its energy initiatives, a campaign that has included months of research into how best to frame and talk about the plan to make Americans comfortable. The energy-related polling and focus groups conducted by the Republican National Committee have been more extensive than on any issue other than the economy, party officials said.
Administration officials confirmed Monday's meeting with union officials but would not provide details.
But union and political officials familiar with the discussions about the meeting said representatives from about a dozen unions, chosen because they would likely benefit from drilling and construction projects, had been invited and more than half would probably attend. In addition to the Teamsters and Laborers, the unions invited include the Carpenters, Iron Workers and Operating Engineers.
Representatives from several of those unions said they did not see this as the beginning of a newly cozy relationship between the administration and organized labor but as a finite area of shared interest.
Zack Matus, a spokesman for the laborers union, said that despite the potential benefits to organized labor from the energy policy, the Bush administration's attitude toward unions had been "neglect, and it's nowhere close to benign neglect."
Mr. Matus was referring to executive orders and rules issued by the administration that overturned worker protections put in place by Mr. Clinton or that made it easier for federal jobs to go to nonunion crews.
The White House has had at least two other sessions to build support for the energy plan. Administration officials recently met with representatives of the nuclear power industry, and at a meeting about 10 days ago, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham met with representatives from the coal mining industry and politicians from regions that depend economically on coal production.

HEADLINE: PRICE OF GASOLINE MAY POSE PROBLEM FOR WHITE HOUSE 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9 

 BODY:
Republicans in the White House and around the country are increasingly nervous that surging gas prices and rolling blackouts will pose a colossal political problem for President Bush because they are matters that he has limited control over but that touch people in their daily lives.
 For Mr. Bush, the issue is particularly perilous. He is trying to defuse a political time bomb while not threatening the oil industry, which once employed both him and his vice president and was a huge source of donations to his campaign. 
 Even as the president scrambled to blame the Clinton administration for the energy woes, House Democrats held a news conference today to upbraid Mr. Bush as having a "do-nothing response" because he is captive to the industry. 
"Politically, Bush has got an absolute nightmare," said Gov. William J. Janklow of South Dakota, a Republican who is close to Mr. Bush. "People are not even discussing taxes right now. They're discussing petroleum. It's money out of their pocket. Everybody knows what they paid for gas last year, last month, last week -- and yesterday. This is the most unfair heat he will take. He's been president for only 100 and some days."
Many Republicans say they are worried that, fairly or unfairly, Mr. Bush could find himself in the same predicament as President Jimmy Carter. Even after Mr. Carter declared that his energy policy was "the moral equivalent of war," energy problems were widely viewed as contributing to his defeat in 1980.
Republican Party polls show that energy is intensifying as a major issue, and that it could easily escalate around Memorial Day weekend, when millions of Americans will start their vacations by filling up their tanks with gasoline that already costs $2 a gallon or more in some places. 
Leading Republicans expressed fear that the close ties of Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to the energy industry had cost them credibility. Some also said they were concerned that Mr. Cheney's remarks about conservation last week -- that saving energy was a "sign of personal virtue" but not a basis for "a sound, comprehensive energy policy" -- could invite more recriminations from Democrats and environmentalists.
"This is going to be a very sticky wicket for them," said a Republican strategist who is close to the White House. "Emotionally, there's a lot of suspicion about the oil companies' motives" and that energy executives are Mr. Bush's "pals making money -- and he's not going to crack down on them." He added: "It really throws his message discipline and agenda control out the window. This is going to be a really significant test because all of a sudden education doesn't matter as much."
Seeking to point blame elsewhere, Mr. Bush asserted in a speech here on Tuesday: "For too long we have had no energy policy. And like you, I am deeply concerned about consumer prices. They are going up."
Sensing Mr. Bush's vulnerability, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, lambasted him today. "The president has responded to the gathering crisis," Mr. Gephardt said, "by throwing up his hands and saying, 'There's nothing we can do. There's no way to give people immediate relief from blackouts and sky-high increases of the price of gasoline at the pump.' "
Representative Jay Inslee, Democrat of Washington, cast the matter as one of the people battling big oil, saying: "The president of the United States needs to start listening to those people in the food banks rather than his contributors in the state of Texas. He doesn't work for the oil companies anymore, he works for us."
Jack Oliver, the deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee, responded: "We're not going to get in a mudslinging contest. Obviously this is not an easy situation but it's an opportunity to show leadership."
Mr. Bush is planning to release an energy blueprint next week that is expected to call for more oil and gas drilling and the construction of new power plants. But his advisers caution that the plan would do little to address the escalating gasoline prices, especially since Mr. Bush has opposed cutting the federal gasoline tax. Mr. Bush has also adamantly refused the pleas of California officials, who want the federal government to impose caps on wholesale electricity prices.
Anticipating that Mr. Bush will be accused of not doing enough to remedy the troubles, his advisers have told allies on Capitol Hill not to expect any easy fixes.
Explaining Mr. Bush's limited options, Governor Janklow said: "What do you do if you're president? You can't just tell the oil companies to lower the prices. It's not so simplistic. You've got to deal with these people in the Middle East who are running their own agenda. And you've got political groups in America who don't care if we all have to walk around with backpacks on their backs. They call all development energy exploitation."
One move the administration could make would be imposing higher fuel economy standards on the large and popular sports utility vehicles. But that could, in turn, set off an outcry from auto workers in Ohio and Michigan.
Lawmakers from different regions said in interviews that they were being inundated by complaints from their constituents about energy prices.
"People are concerned about gas prices," said Senator John Edwards, a North Carolina Democrat. "It's a regular subject at town hall meetings. The people you hear from the most are the small business people. 
"There's a gut feeling among a lot of people that the oil companies seem to be making a lot of money while gasoline prices are going up. The fact that the president has a long and deep relationship with oil companies is the kind of thing that Americans may associate with these gasoline prices."
Well before he took office, Mr. Bush clearly recognized the potency of the energy issue, campaigning to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. He has also used it to bolster his case for easing some environmental rules that industry has long fought. In March, for example, he defended his decision to back away from regulations on carbon dioxide emissions by saying that the nation could not afford such an effort when it faced an energy crisis.
As concern grows, the oil industry appears primed for political battle. This week, industry officials, seeking to shift the blame for the energy shortage, began attacking lawmakers from farming states for backing production of ethanol as an alternative fuel. The officials argued that the effort to promote ethanol came at the expense of the oil companies. 
Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, said that he met this afternoon with the head of his state's farm bureau, who complained that high energy costs were raising the price of fertilizer. Asked if Mr. Bush could be tarnished by such problems, Mr. Brownback said: "That is a potential, particularly if you don't step up and really try to address the problem. I hope we really address the problem and don't announce two or three things that just sound good."
Some Republicans argue that Mr. Bush will not be held accountable for energy problems. 
"This is not one of those situations where someone else eats the meal and the last guy in gets stuck with the check," said Alex Castellanos, a Republican media consultant who works closely with the White House. "The president will be measured by how he moves forward on this now."
But Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, says the White House can get away only so long with blaming the past administration. "There's a heck of a lot better chance you can avoid the blame now than two and a half years from now," he said. "But, sooner or later, you get deep enough into an administration when it starts becoming your problem."
White House officials had initially argued that Gov. Gray Davis of California, a Democrat, would bear the brunt of that state's energy crisis. But there has been a growing concern among some people around the president that he, too, could be tarred with the crisis there. As part of a public relations offensive, the administration dispatched Spencer Abraham, the energy secretary, to California last week to speak out about the administration's proposals.
The Democrats' efforts to saddle Mr. Bush with the energy troubles marks a striking role reversal from last summer, when party leaders were worried that increasing gasoline prices would be linked to the Clinton administration -- and threaten Al Gore's presidential prospects.
In the campaign, Mr. Gore questioned whether Mr. Bush would "stand up to big oil" interests. In words that he echoed this week, Mr. Bush retorted that under the Clinton administration, "There has been no energy policy."

HEADLINE: Traffic and Tax Cuts 

BYLINE:  By Robert H. Frank; Robert H. Frank, an economics professor at Cornell, is the co-author of "Principles of Economics."

 BODY:
Traffic jams are a nuisance, but they are more than that. Studies have shown that compared with people who walk or take public transportation to work, people who face protracted commutes in heavy traffic are more likely to experience high blood pressure. They have more frequent disputes with their coworkers and families. They suffer more frequent and more serious illnesses. And they are more likely to experience premature deaths. 
 Traffic jams are also getting much worse. A recent study by Texas A&M University, for example, reported that Americans spent three times as many hours stalled in traffic in 1999 as they did in 1982. 
 Although increased traffic congestion stems from many familiar causes (like population growth, cheap gasoline prices, increased urban sprawl and failure to invest in public transport), it is also the result of another factor that has received little attention -- increased inequality in income and wealth.
The basic mechanism at work is something we may call the Aspen effect. Wealthy residents have long since bid up real estate prices in Aspen and other exclusive resort communities to levels that virtually exclude middle- and low-income families. Most of the people who provide services in these communities -- teachers, policemen, firemen, laundry and restaurant workers -- must therefore commute, often at considerable distance. As a result, all roads into Aspen are clogged morning and night with commuters, many of whom come from several hours away. "Greater Aspen" now has a radius of more than 50 miles!
Traffic congestion has been getting worse in part because during the past 20 years much of the United States has become more like greater Aspen. Since 1980, the inflation-adjusted incomes of the top 1 percent of families have more than doubled, while the corresponding growth for the median family has been less than 10 percent. During that same period, families in the bottom 20 percent actually saw their incomes fall in real terms.
As a result of these changes, residential patterns have become much more stratified by income. The effect has been more pronounced in some communities (the San Francisco peninsula, Austin and Seattle) than others (Chicago or Philadelphia). But the direction of change has been the same almost everywhere, and it has contributed to the rise in traffic delays.
The current policy agenda in Washington not only promises little relief for harried commuters, but is likely to make matters worse. Start with the tax cut. In the proposed $1.35 trillion reduction, 40 percent of the benefits would go to families in the top 5 percent. By making the income gap greater than it is already, this measure is likely to push low- and middle-income families even farther from their jobs, thus increasing the length of their commutes. Granted, the Aspen effect probably would not make anyone's list of the 10 most important reasons for opposing the tax cut. But it's yet another drawback to the Bush proposal.
Tax cuts would also put more pressure on already overcommitted government budgets, making it all but impossible to launch significant new urban transit programs in the next decade. And prospects for curtailing traffic congestion are further dimmed by the Bush administration's denial of any legitimate national interest in energy conservation. "The American way of life is a blessed one, and we have a bounty of resources in this country," said Ari Fleischer, the president's spokesman. "The American people's use of energy is a reflection of the strength of our economy, of the way of life that the American people have come to enjoy." 
Our country does have a bounty of resources, but that doesn't eliminate the need to make intelligent decisions about how to use them. Traffic jams make life miserable for the rich, as well as for low- and middle-income families. They are neither an essential component of the good life nor inevitable. They can be greatly curtailed by smart public policy.

HEADLINE: Import Prices Ease Again 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10 

 BODY:
The prices of imported goods declined in April, the seventh consecutive month without an increase and a sign of tame inflationary pressure, the Labor Department reported today.
 The import price index, a gauge of the cost of imported goods and raw materials, fell 0.5 percent after falling by a revised 1.5 percent in March, the report said. April's decrease reflected declining costs of autos and computers. 
 Excluding petroleum, import prices dropped 0.5 percent as well. A dollar that has risen by more than 8 percent since the middle of last year and an influx of cheaper foreign goods are limiting prices in the United States. "The persistent strength of the U.S. dollar and weakness in global economies are helping keep a lid on U.S. inflation," said Doug Porter, senior economist at Burns Nesbitt Securities in Toronto.
Analysts had expected a 0.2 percent decline in import prices after a previously reported drop of 1.6 percent in March.
Imports account for about 15 percent of goods and services purchased in the United States. Import costs have not increased since September 2000.
The price of imported computers and office equipment declined 1.2 percent in April after falling 0.5 percent a month earlier.
Those for imported autos and auto parts fell 0.2 percent after rising 0.1 percent in March. Imported food prices decreased 2.1 percent after rising 1 percent the month before.
A separate report today showed that the number of workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits plunged last week. Initial jobless claims fell a greater-than-expected 41,000, to 384,000, in the week ended Saturday, the Labor Department said.
Weekly jobless claims have averaged 367,000 this year, up from 302,800 last year and the most since 407,800 in 1992. The four-week moving average fell to 402,500 last week from 405,500, the highest since October 1992.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS; 
Flood of New Corporate Debt Pushes Down Treasury Prices

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices posted their biggest losses in two weeks yesterday as investors sold government debt to buy more than $20 billion of bonds issued by companies including Viacom, WorldCom and the CIT Group.
 "There's just no significant upside to Treasuries," said Mark MacQueen, who helps manage $1.7 billion of fixed-income assets at Sage Advisory Services in Austin, Tex., "especially since there's a huge supply of corporate bonds coming to market." 
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell one full point, to 97 24/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.30 percent from 5.16 percent on Wednesday. The 30-year Treasury bond lost 19/32, to 94 19/32, increasing its yield to 5.76 percent from 5.66 percent on Wednesday. 
The decline in prices also followed a move by the European Central Bank, which lowered its key lending rate for the first time in two years, to 4.5 percent from 4.75 percent.
The European bank is "starting to cut rates, and that's a new drug on the street for investors," said Barry Evans of John Hancock Funds in Boston, adding that he was considering buying European debt.
Merrill Lynch advised clients last week to reduce their holdings of United States bills and notes with one- to five-year maturities to 13 percent of their credit portfolios from 14 percent previously. Merrill also suggested increasing the share of similar-maturity European paper to 19 percent from 18 percent.
Even without the European rate cut, American corporate bonds are giving investors reason to consider selling Treasuries, which carry lower yields than corporate securities.
Viacom sold $1.4 billion of 5- and 10-year securities in a private placement, people close to the transaction said. CIT raised $1.25 billion yesterday selling three-year notes and 750 million euros, or $661 million, in four-year debt. Verizon sold $3 billion of convertible bonds. And WorldCom, the No. 2 long-distance company, sold $11.9 billion of bonds on Wednesday, the largest such sale by an American company.

HEADLINE: A Conservation Countdown 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA WHITAKER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 9 

 BODY:
To understand what California is up against in its search for enough electricity to get through the summer, look no further than Michael Chroman, owner of Brooklyn Hardware in East Los Angeles.
 In the months since the energy crisis began, he has not changed the way he does business or the way he lives. 
 "I guess I think it's pretty much contrived," Mr. Chroman said of the shortage. "I think it's something they want to do to increase the rates, and they'll do it whether I conserve or not." 
As for the rising rates, "I can afford it, I guess," he said, as he loaded beverages into his Jeep Grand Cherokee outside a local Costco.
The state, on the other hand, cannot. Because little new power will be available soon, conservation is crucial. 
Armed with more than $850 million in new money for an array of initiatives, the state is establishing programs to educate consumers on ways to use electricity more efficiently, provide a multitude of rebates on energy-efficient lighting and appliances, and support businesses wanting to cut electricity use. The state has also strengthened requirements for new construction and pledged to use 20 percent less electricity in state offices when power supplies fall to the level of a Stage 2 emergency, which is just short of forcing blackouts.
"They're putting everything but the kitchen sink into this, and it's probably going to take that kind of effort," said Martin G. Kushler, director of the utilities program for the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a nonprofit group based in Washington that promotes energy efficiency. 
The initiatives look promising, experts say -- but not right away. "Will all these programs be in place by summer?" said Ed Vine, a staff scientist who evaluates energy-efficiency programs at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. "I think that's a big question mark. I think they may get to this goal, but it may be next summer."
One hurdle is that there is little fat to cut. As Mr. Kushler and other energy experts have noted, California has been a leader in energy efficiency for more than two decades, and its per capita consumption is among the lowest in the country.
"California is entering uncharted territory," Mr. Kushler said. "What's different here is the magnitude of what they are trying to accomplish in a very short period of time." 
This week was not encouraging, with the first rolling blackouts since March -- necessitated by a bout of unusually warm weather just when some power plants were out of service, mainly for maintenance.
The state projects a shortfall of as much as 5,000 megawatts at periods of peak demand this summer -- out of projected total demand of about 55,000 megawatts. To provide a cushion, it has a plan to cut use by 5,200 megawatts. And it hopes to find 2,000 of those megawatts -- enough to power two million homes -- through consumer outreach and incentive programs. A big question is whether that 2,000 figure is realistic.
"Quite frankly, the level of savings they're projecting from that have never been accomplished anywhere," Mr. Kushler said. "On the other hand, the situation California finds itself in has never been found before."
Much will depend on people like Mr. Chroman. At his home in Los Angeles, he gets his electricity from the city's Department of Water and Power. That public utility did not participate in deregulation and has not suffered the same problems confronting Pacific Gas and Electric, which recently filed for bankruptcy protection, and Southern California Edison, whose rates are about to rise sharply. At his business, Mr. Chroman is served by Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International. And, like many Californians, he shows no inclination to conserve.
With little hope of getting significant sources of new generation on line by summer, California -- which confronted rolling blackouts this winter as electricity ran short and prices skyrocketed -- is limited in what it can do.
The state is seeking a 10 percent across-the-board reduction in energy consumption, and state government is leading by example, making numerous changes in buildings, right down to the way janitors clean, while turning off unnecessary lights and office equipment. 
It also moved quickly to strengthen energy-efficiency regulations for commercial and residential construction, which, when they take effect on June 1, will make the state's guidelines the most stringent in the nation.
Additional conservation financing approved in April includes $50 million for energy-efficient household appliances; $60 million for high-efficiency lighting in commercial buildings; $35 million for improving the ability to scale back heating, ventilation and air-conditioning when shortages loom; $35 million for real-time or time-of-use meters; and $50 million for peak load reduction programs.
There is also about $240 million for assistance for low-income customers that will include weatherization programs, cash assistance and discounts.
But state officials are racing the clock to get the money distributed before hotter temperatures play havoc with demand, and consumer groups have criticized the state for taking too long to act.
Although much of the new financing will be run through existing channels, questions remain about whether the system can cope.
"Is the infrastructure ready to handle this?" Mr. Vine said. "I don't think anybody knows."
He also questioned whether the bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas and Electric, a unit of the PG&E Corporation, would affect its ability to run rebate programs and whether its financial difficulties, as well as Southern California Edison's, would affect decisions like whether to hire additional people to carry out such programs.
But whether the state reaches its goal ultimately comes down to whether consumers significantly change their behavior. That is far from clear.
"Programs that rely only on behavioral changes are fickle," said Thomas Feiler, managing director of the Rocky Mountain Institute, which promotes energy efficiency and finding renewable energy sources.
Millions of dollars is being spent to get the message out, enlisting a variety of groups. The State Department of Consumer Affairs is orchestrating a $20 million advertising campaign. McDonald's is putting energy-conservation messages on four million tray liners in 1,100 restaurants. The Grocers Association is working with retailers to put messages on receipts and in grocery bags.
Dana Michels, a 28-year-old Los Angeles resident served by the city's Department of Water and Power, said she did not need to be sold. She said she had always been thrifty about energy and was even more careful now to turn off lights and other household items, like the VCR, when they were not in use. But, she said, many people she works with do nothing.
In fact, while driving through Santa Monica earlier this spring, she was appalled to see homes that still had Christmas lights lighted.
By contrast, in areas harder hit, particularly where the investor-owned utilities are predominant, sales of energy-efficient lighting like fluorescent bulbs are soaring.
Home Depot said sales of such lighting were up more than 300 percent in Northern California, where PG&E is predominant, though the products have not really caught on at stores in Los Angeles and Orange Counties; statewide, they are up 224 percent.
According to state figures, there is reason to feel encouraged. Power use dropped 6 percent in January, compared with January 2000; 8 percent in February; and 9 percent in March and April.
Representatives from all three investor-owned utilities -- Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric -- said they had seen sharp increases in consumers taking advantage of rebate programs in recent months. Though changing a few light bulbs may seem like no big deal, energy officials say no detail is too small to make a difference.
Steve McCarty, director of customer energy management for Pacific Gas and Electric, said that if every customer turned off three 75-watt bulbs, it would mean a 2 percent energy savings a month. Unplug that second refrigerator and that is an additional 9 percent.
"There are no silver bullets," he said. "Only silver BB's."
State officials said businesses were taking advantage of programs to help them change out inefficient items like lighting and air-conditioning. Businesses are also being asked to turn up the thermostat and turn off some lights, including signs outside stores after closing. Home Depot said that by taking steps like turning off outdoor lighting after closing, its western division saved more than 1.5 million kilowatt hours in February, the equivalent of the total consumption of 1,800 homes or 9 Home Depot stores.
The Building Owners and Management Association, whose members own about 500 million square feet of office space in California, has pledged to cut consumption by 10 percent. Janitors are supporting their efforts by team cleaning and turning off unnecessary lights. But the organization acknowledged that getting tenants to cut back would be a harder sell.
In addition, there does not appear to be wide compliance with an executive order by Gov. Gray Davis that businesses -- particularly auto dealers, shopping malls and megastores -- reduce outdoor lighting by 50 percent after hours. Although the order provides for fines of up to $1,000 for violations, no tickets have been issued and law enforcement officials have expressed reluctance about enforcing the order. With downtown office buildings still leaving many lights on well after business hours, state officials are weighing steps to allow landlords to find a way to charge tenants based on electrical use.
While much of what is being called for is voluntary, the state's plan could get a big lift as many consumers confront higher rates next month. The Public Utility Commission has approved a rate increase of 3 cents a kilowatt hour, on top of a previous temporary 1-cent increase that was made permanent. That will increase bills for PG&E and Southern California Edison customers by as much as 46 percent. However, rates are tiered to reward those who conserve, with customers who stay within 130 percent of a base line level of use facing no increase.
In addition, the state has a plan that will provide a 20 percent rate reduction for customers of investor-owned utilities who use 20 percent less electricity than they did last year.
"California has world-class experience in energy-efficiency programs," said Mr. Feiler of the Rocky Mountain Institute. "Where the rubber will meet the road is how those plans are implemented. Are consumers seeing the right incentives, the right type of rebates, the right type of rates to bring about a behavioral change? That will determine whether they win the battle this summer."

HEADLINE: A Diverse City Exists Equal but Separate 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: VALLEJO, Calif. 

 BODY:
Stephanie Davis sat serenely on the bleachers watching her son, David, romping on the grass in his Reds uniform, getting ready to play the dreaded Twins. On the field a gaggle of boys -- whites, blacks, Asians, a few Hispanics -- tossed balls back and forth, united by the universal inability of 6-year-olds to catch most things thrown their way.
 That mixture of races was one reason Ms. Davis and her husband moved to this Northern California city seven years ago. "I liked the diversity," said Ms. Davis, a black postal worker. 
 She could not have picked a better place. Vallejo, a working-class town just below the rolling hills of California's wine country, is one of the nation's most racially balanced cities, according to the 2000 census; its population of 116,760 is 30.4 percent non-Hispanic white, 24 percent black, 26.1 percent Asian and 16 percent Hispanic. 
But Vallejo (pronounced va-LAY-ho) also highlights another, more stubborn trend. Though the United States is more diverse than ever, it is also as racially separated as ever.
In Vallejo, while residents live in a nearly equally spiced racial stew, they often exist in separate worlds, officials and some residents say. 
"There is not a lot of racial fighting out in the streets," said Liat Meitzenheimer, the chairwoman of the city's Human Relations Commission, who despite her German name is half black and half Japanese. "But there is not really the interaction in the way we would like. Kids in the neighborhoods play with each other, but, by and large, people stay to themselves."
Vallejo's racial balance is a result of addition and subtraction. For many years, it was a Navy town, dominated by the Mare Island Shipyard, which during World War II employed more than 50,000 people, including thousands of blacks who were drawn from the South. Even before the war, the city attracted large numbers of Filipinos, many of whom had served as stewards on Navy ships.
And the city has a history of tolerance. In the 1890's, when the United States Supreme Court permitted rigid segregation laws, Solano County, which includes Vallejo, voted to integrate its schools. One of Vallejo's most famous exports was the integrated rock band Sly and the Family Stone, whose appeal crossed racial lines.
The Pentagon shut down Mare Island in 1996. From 1993, when the Navy first announced the shutdown, through 1997, the city's population dropped to 110,519, from 115,873. Many of those who left were white. While whites made up 51 percent of Vallejo's population in 1990, by 2000, they were about 30 percent. The downtown became a ghost town. The median housing price dropped to $119,000 in 1997, from $140,000 in 1995, city officials said. 
By the late 1990's, however, Vallejo began to benefit from California's overall economic rebound. Its housing prices, some of the lowest in the Bay Area, began to attract young professionals fleeing the high prices of San Francisco. 
But much of the growth in the late 1990's came from those who sought the comfort of familiarity, rather than diversity. There were Hispanics and Filipinos like Melani Velanueve, a divorced mother who enjoyed the opportunity to eat at Filipino fast-food restaurants like Jubilee and Goldilocks and wanted to rear her two children among Filipinos.
"It's just nice to stay connected to your culture," Ms. Velanueve said.
So the city's racial equipoise has not necessarily led to close interactions across racial lines. Watching her son play T-ball, Ms. Davis first spoke of the number of friends of another race she and her husband had in town. On further reflection, she said: "We get together for play dates for the kids. It's really more so, I think, the kids."
But as in many cities, racial lines start being drawn as the children grow older. At a recent meeting of the senior class in the auditorium of Jesse Bethel High School, knots of black, white and Filipino students huddled together in separate rows. 
Rosalyn Pumares, 16, a junior at a private school that is overwhelmingly Filipino, expressed surprise when told that Vallejo was so racially and ethnically balanced.
"In my homerooms, there are only about two white people," she said. "In my classes throughout the day, I would say that I only have about four black people, and I only know like two Latino people, and the rest are Filipino." 
"I had a friend visit me from out of the state one time," she added. "She went to my school and all the people were Filipino, and she went to my church and everybody was Filipino. So I really didn't think Vallejo was that diverse."
Across town, in the northern part of the city, Philmore Graham walked through the Continentals of Omega Boys and Girls Club he founded in 1966. He nodded with pride at the children playing basketball and taking art classes, but his satisfaction was tempered. Though the club is in a racially mixed neighborhood, nearly all the children attending are black, which rankles Mr. Graham, who is also black.
"As long as a black person is in charge, you're not going to see other people send their children here," Mr. Graham said almost wistfully. 
In many ways, Vallejo goes out of its way to acknowledge its diversity. City officials strive to ensure that all citizens' commissions and advisory boards are balanced. Yet the city also has a Black Chamber of Commerce, a Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and a Filipino Chamber of Commerce, in addition to the original Chamber of Commerce, which is dominated by white businesses.
"Every time we try to put ourselves together," said Thomas Egidio, who is white and president of the Vallejo Chamber of Commerce, "we end up fighting with each other, so it was decided that each group would have its own organization." 
In addition to the federal holidays it observes, the city also officially commemorates Juneteenth, which was originally a Texas holiday celebrating the end of slavery there but which has spread to other states; Cinco de Mayo; and Philippine Independence Day. But officials decided three years ago to add a Unity Day that would celebrate all cultures, in part because the separate holidays tended to be segregated. 
"Events like Cinco de Mayo basically attracted Latinos," said Tranquilino Martinez, the executive director of the Federation of Employees of Latin American Descent. "Juneteenth only got African-Americans. When we have Native American events, only Native Americans show up."
The only outward racial grumbling in recent months has concerned the lack of black officers above the rank of sergeant in the Vallejo Police Department. That grumbling turned to hostility when Robert Nichelini, the police chief, shrugged off those concerns by noting that affirmative action was no longer legal in the state. Mr. Nichelini, who is white, went on to say that if blacks wanted to be promoted, they needed to study harder and earn higher degrees.
Jimmie Jackson, a vice president of the Vallejo N.A.A.C.P., said: "I'm from Vallejo, and I want city agencies to reflect the community. If the council can't do that, then we need to find people who can."
The tensions over the police department are the exception to the rule. Even if the people live separate lives despite their diversity, they still take pride in the balance their community offers.
"Would I rather live in Maine or someplace where they're 96 percent white, or would I rather live in Vallejo?" asked Mr. Egidio, with a grin that indicated the answer was obvious. "They don't know what they're missing."

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
On This Isle, Maternal Is No Instinct

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
ON the Upper West Side, a private school has banned Mother's Day activities on the ground that making cards for Mom leaves some children "uncomfortable." On the Upper East Side, the First Mother is preparing for Mother's Day by asking a judge to keep Dad's girlfriend out of their home.
 We're not really in the holiday spirit yet, are we? But then, Manhattan never is. It's probably the least mother-friendly place in America, if not the world. 
 You can get some sense of the islanders' maternal instincts by the paucity of children. For every adult woman of childbearing age, there are just 0.57 children, a ratio that puts Manhattan below all but three counties in America, according to an analysis of census data by the Queens College sociology department. 
The only places with fewer kids per fertile female are Aspen, Colo., a high-altitude version of Manhattan, and two Virginia suburbs, Alexandria and Arlington, home to the Pentagon. You could argue that the Pentagon is even less maternal than Manhattan, but military leaders at least pretend to favor motherhood for noncombatants. Manhattan's leaders have made icons out of infertility. Fashion models and Social X-rays are the reigning images of femininity. The emaciated look is the ideal, which is weird by historical standards.
Voluptuously fertile females have been venerated in most societies for at least 25,000 years, since the wide-hipped Venus figurines were carved in European caves. In 81 percent of the societies around the world for which data exist, the ideal female body type is plump, according to Peter J. Brown, a professor of anthropology at Emory University.
The plump ideal makes sense to Darwinians, who equate fitness with fertility. Subcutaneous fat traditionally was an upper-class status symbol marking a well-fed woman capable of bearing children. Yet in New York, the most affluent, status-conscious women want to look as if they barely eat and will never conceive. 
They yearn not for Darwinian fitness but for what Dr. Brown calls Fondanian fitness, in honor of Jane Fonda. He sees several reasons for the shift, which began more than a century ago. As Americans left the farm for the city, children who had been valuable farmhands became economic liabilities, and motherhood became a less valued role for women. 
Their quests for equality with men coincided with more androgynous shapes for the ideal body. As suffragists began crusading in the late 19th century, women discarded the bustles and corsets they had used to exaggerate their hourglass figures. In the 1920's, the new emancipated ideal was a young, cigarette-smoking flapper in the city, rail thin and unmarried -- definitely not a mother. The women's rights movement starting in the 1960's was accompanied by more androgynous fashions and shapes, from Twiggy to Kate Moss to Ally McBeal. 
Meanwhile, the proletariat classes were sitting around getting fat on cheap food, so plumpness was no longer a status symbol. The Duchess of Windsor's dictum, "You can never be too rich or too thin," became the norm on Park Avenue.
"When food is in short supply, the rich impress the poor by becoming fat," Dr. Brown said. "When food is plentiful and it's easy to become fat, the rich impress the poor by remaining thin. Being thin becomes a form of conspicuous consumption, as if to say, 'I'm so sure where my next meal is coming from that I don't need to store an extra gram of fat.' It's like really rich people who can walk around with no money in their pockets because they're so confident their needs will be met."
THE status benefits of being thin may help a Manhattan woman attract a rich mate, but the passion for thinness can also lead to eating disorders and infertility. "Skinniness is becoming what's known in evolutionary theory as a runaway process," Dr. Brown said. "That's a feature, like the huge horns on the extinct Irish elk, that might be beneficial in one context but keeps getting exaggerated until it actually risks the survival of the population."
Fat carries its own health risks, but the biggest danger comes from fat collected around the waist -- the beer gut that afflicts mainly men, not women. For women worried about flab on their hips and thighs, Dr. Brown has a Mother's Day gift.
"We are pathologizing women's bodies for no reason," he said. "There is no medical consequence of having subcutaneous fat on the lower body." It just means that you're capable of bearing a child, no matter how strange that seems to the islanders of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Shift in Technology Markets Is Helping I.B.M., Chief Says 

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Louis V. Gerstner Jr., I.B.M.'s chairman and chief executive, said yesterday that the company was benefiting from a new "golden age" at its research laboratories and from a shift in technology markets toward areas in which I.B.M. is especially strong. 
 In a standing-room-only address to more than 400 industry analysts in Manhattan, Mr. Gerstner repeated themes that he and other I.B.M. executives had sounded elsewhere in recent years. 
 He said that the Internet and e-business would continue to grow rapidly despite the bursting of the dot-com bubble. The result, he said, will be a tremendous demand for server computers, for the software known as middleware that knits Web-based activities together, and for new processors tailored to the needs of an increasingly diverse range of handheld wireless devices and electronic appliances. 
Above all else, Mr. Gerstner said, International Business Machines is betting heavily that a shortage of information technology workers will drive customers toward I.B.M.'s huge Global Services unit, which can either take over their computer operations through outsourcing agreements or provide consulting and technical help in integrating networks and new products. He endorsed estimates that the integration services market alone would grow to $250 billion in the next few years. 
The meeting was Mr. Gerstner's eighth annual spring briefing for analysts since he took over the reins at I.B.M. in 1993 and, according to some analysts, could well have been his last. Mr. Gerstner, 59, is widely expected to turn over the chief executive title to Samuel J. Palmisano, 49, I.B.M.'s president and chief operating officer, within the next year. But Mr. Gerstner sidestepped the succession issue when an analyst asked if the audience would be hearing from him next year. 
"We don't plan that far ahead at I.B.M.," said Mr. Gerstner with a laugh. 
He told the analysts that the companies that had focused on serious e-business investments rather than "putting up pretty Web sites" were enjoying "enormous benefits."
He said that I.B.M. itself saved $375 million last year by procuring 94 percent of the goods and services it needed electronically. The company also saved an estimated $350 million in training expenses while improving quality by using the Internet for many of its training and orientation courses, he said. 
But while Mr. Gerstner took obvious pleasure in reviewing I.B.M.'s achievements in recent years, he told the analysts that his most important message was that I.B.M. expected to increasingly become a services-driven company.
"When economic conditions drive businesses to be more efficient, services help them reduce costs," Mr. Gerstner said. "A lot of those offerings look pretty good right now."

HEADLINE: $200 Million Building Planned Along 12th Avenue by Rockrose 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
While most commercial landlords and tenants are waiting to see what happens with the city's economy, one developer is forging ahead with construction of a $200 million building in an industrial neighborhood along 12th Avenue in Manhattan, across the street from the passenger ship terminal.
 For the project, Rockrose Development has demolished a collection of six warehouses, garages and plumbing supply houses that sat on the two-acre parcel between 48th and 49th Streets. Rockrose plans to begin excavation and construction next week of an eight-story, 703,000-square-foot distribution center and telecommunications hotel. 
 H. Henry Elghanayan, chief executive of Rockrose Development, acknowledged that the project was a gamble, given that computer and Internet-related companies had been in a tailspin for months and the building was intended to house computers and other electronics for companies that use the Internet.
"Everybody's heading for the hills and we're going forward," Mr. Elghanayan said. "We're hoping that the market will turn around in the 18 to 20 months it takes to build. But we've got deep pockets and we can get through any downturn."
Rockrose, however, did sign a long-term lease recently with Federal Express, the package delivery company, to build a 260,000-square-foot distribution center on the first three floors of the building. It will be the company's sixth center in Manhattan and, according to real estate executives, it is still looking for another one.
The deal with Federal Express completed a three-year search by the company and its broker, Cushman & Wakefield, for an appropriate site. In 1999, the company opened negotiations with Rockrose, which began acquiring property on 12th Avenue, where it could build a wide building that was near major highways and still close to corporate customers.
The project will not be Rockrose's first gamble. In 1990, the developer built Carnegie Hall Tower, a 60-story office building on 57th Street, near Seventh Avenue, without a single tenant, just as a recession hit. Rockrose cut rents drastically and slowly filled the tower with entertainment companies and investment firms. It now gets some of the highest rents in Manhattan.
Rockrose is completing three residential projects in Manhattan. Recently, it was also chosen to develop seven buildings and more than 3,000 apartments at the Queens West complex on the waterfront in Long Island City.

HEADLINE: Pataki Courts Immigrants, but His Ally Is Seen as Their Foe 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 10 

 BODY:
Four weeks ago, Gov. George E. Pataki was in Puerto Rico, surrounded by Hispanic politicians from New York, sprinkling his remarks with Spanish, denouncing the Navy's bombing tests on the island of Vieques.
 This week, on a fund-raising trip in California, the governor was keeping different company. The honorary co-chairman of a fund-raiser for him Tuesday was Pete Wilson, the former governor of that state, most famously known for his efforts in 1994 to cut off state-financed services to illegal immigrants. 
 Mr. Wilson's stance earned him the enmity of Hispanic voters, by far the largest immigrant group in California, and it contributed to the Republicans' failure to hold on to the governor's seat. But as a former two-term governor of the nation's largest state, he can raise enormous sums of money for Governor Pataki, a fellow Republican. Mr. Wilson's track record, however, also offers the governor's opponents the chance to denounce him as guilty by association.
Governor Pataki, who is expected to run for a third term next year, has cast himself as an inclusive Republican. He has attached himself to issues like the Navy bombing on Vieques, and he has spoken out in favor of extending the deadline for immigrants to legalize their status. (Mr. Pataki opposed Proposition 187, the California measure denying public services to illegal immigrants.)
Today, his opponents did not pass up the chance to pounce. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democratic rival for the governor's seat, called Governor Pataki "a political Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," courting Latino voters with one hand and accepting Mr. Wilson's support with the other.
"He stands with one of the most anti-Latino officials in the nation," said Mr. Cuomo, whose own California fund-raisers last month were sponsored by movie industry executives like Norman Lear and Rob Reiner.
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, another Democratic contender, happened to be in California today for a fund-raiser given by Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco, and his campaign did not pass up the opportunity to criticize the governor either.
"Once again, George Pataki demonstrates that his move to the political center is nothing more than an attempt to woo gullible voters," Mr. McCall's campaign spokesman, Shawn Thompson, said in a statement. "Having a fund-raiser hosted by Pete Wilson shows George Pataki's true friends, his true colors and his true right-wing philosophy."
The governor's spokesman, Michael McKeon, shot back, saying, "This is the kind of mudslinging that won't stick, because the governor has a strong record at the state and national level speaking out on behalf of immigrants."
Also this afternoon, the state Republican and Democratic leaders squared off as though it were high campaign season. The chairwoman of the Democratic Party, Judith Hope, called a reporter to say that she found it astonishing that Governor Pataki chose Mr. Wilson to help in fund-raising. The Republican Party chairman, Alexander F. Treadwell, faxed a statement linking Mr. Cuomo to his father, the former governor Mario Cuomo, that said, "We know the devastation Mario Cuomo did to New York's economy." Governor Pataki spent three days this week in California -- a state that Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at the University of Southern California, calls "the A.T.M. for American politics." Back-to-back fund-raisers were held at private homes Tuesday night: a reception costing $1,000 a person, and a dinner, $2,500 a plate. Mr. Wilson did not attend the fund-raisers. 
If there are political costs to Governor Pataki for cozying up to Mr. Wilson, Ms. Jeffe said, it is probably too early to tell. "My guess is the closer you guys get to the election," she said, "the less close Pataki will be to Pete Wilson."

HEADLINE: ART IN REVIEW; 
Mel Rosenthal

BYLINE:  By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
Balch Institute for Ethnic Studies
18 South Seventh Street
Philadelphia
Through Aug. 3
 Photographer, teacher, scholar and social activist, Mel Rosenthal grew up in the South Bronx in the 1940's and 50's, studied at City College in the 1960's and learned photography in Africa while working for a Unesco-sponsored literacy program. 
 The freelance career that followed, now stretching into 40 years, has taken him to embattled territory around the world, including Nicaragua, Vietnam, Cuba and the South Bronx itself. He photographed the neighborhood intensively during its abject years in the 1970's and 80's, when it was being savagely kicked around by economics and politics. And his stirring book "In the South Bronx of America," published last year by Curbstone Press, has every mark of being a classic example of the art of documentary photography.
Mr. Rosenthal's most recent project, a series of photographs titled "Refuge: The Newest New Yorkers," is on view at the Balch Institute for Ethnic Studies in Philadelphia. The nearly 100 black-and-white pictures, with wall texts by Jack Salzman, include portraits of Tibetan monks, itinerant Haitian apple pickers, Cambodian teenagers and female shamans from Laos, all of whom work or live upstate, as well as Kurdish, Cuban and Soviet Jewish populations in New York City.
Hardship is certainly part of the story as Mr. Rosenthal tells it, but so is success. The American dream is still alive here; so are the conflicts it entails as contrasting cultures and values abruptly meet, and people struggle to adapt to a new present while maintaining a hold on what's treasurable in the past. The dynamic is endlessly fascinating, and Mr. Rosenthal is an alert, patient, receptive artist and observer.
Organized by the New York State Museum in Albany, the show appeared last summer in a much-reduced form at Ellis Island, which was symbolically the ideal place for it. At the Balch it has been expanded to its full, generous size. There's no question that the series should be preserved as a book. The exhibition will travel to the Visual Studies Workshop in Rochester (June 22 to Aug. 18). HOLLAND COTTER

HEADLINE: Metro Business Briefing Hotel Occupancy Shows Decline 

BYLINE:  By Joseph P. Fried (NYT)

 BODY:
 Hotel occupancy rates in New York City fell in the first quarter of this year from last year's record highs, and further declines are expected as the national economy continues to slow, according to figures made public yesterday. But at a luncheon to celebrate National Tourism Week, Cristyne F. Lategano-Nicholas, president of NYC & Company, the city's conventions and visitors bureau, said the bureau had already taken a cooling economy into account. 
She said the bureau saw no reason to change last December's projection of modest growth of 2 to 3 percent, to a record 39.4 million, in the number of travelers to the city this year compared with 2000. The occupancy figures, compiled by PKF Consulting, show a 73 percent occupancy rate in the first quarter of this year, down from 79.1 percent in the first quarter of 2000. An 81 percent occupancy rate was projected for all of 2001, compared with 84.6 percent last year and 81.2 percent in 1999. A spokeswoman for the bureau, Nell Barrett, noted that more than 3,000 rooms have been added in the city in the last year. Joseph P. Fried (NYT)

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Microsoft shakes up beleaguered San Francisco agencies by shifting its account for Ultimate TV.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THERE may be a shortage of jobs and clients in the San Francisco advertising market as a result of the dot-com meltdown. But there is no shortage of drama as evidenced by big changes that involve Microsoft and several local agencies.
 Microsoft is dismissing FCB Worldwide in San Francisco, which had served as the creative agency for Ultimate TV, the digital video recorder being introduced to compete against brands like TiVo and ReplayTV. Microsoft is hiring a San Francisco start-up shop, Venables/ Bell & Partners, to create campaigns for Ultimate TV with an annual budget estimated at $50 million. 
 Venables/Bell is being formed by three executives, two of whom worked until this week at another San Francisco agency, Goodby, Silverstein & Partners. But Goodby, Silverstein's top managers say they have no problem with the departures, though one of the executives had been designated part of the next generation of agency leaders.
Why the calm reaction? The executives could not have handled the Ultimate TV assignment and remained at Goodby, Silverstein because that agency works for TiVo. So the top managers at Goodby, Silverstein, owned by the Omnicom Group, are bidding a fond farewell to the departing executives, helping them by providing the start-up shop with office space and equipment.
The shifts are indicative of the rapid-fire series of changes that can take place when economic uncertainty clouds the advertising outlook. Nowhere is that more the case right now than San Francisco, where the dot-com boom of 1999 and 2000 has spiraled downward into a bust that has resulted in abrupt cutbacks, layoffs and closings.
"There is nothing ever in stone in advertising," said Rich Silverstein, co-chairman at Goodby, Silverstein. "Everything is constantly in flux in this nutty business. You just have to manage the flux."
Jeff Goodby, the other co-chairman, said that the departures of the executives -- Paul Venables, promoted in June 2000 to creative director and associate partner, and Greg Bell, group creative director -- were "disappointing."
"But it would be hypocritical for us to say a good creative team ought not to leave an agency to start another agency," he added, because he and Mr. Silverstein left Hal Riney & Partners in San Francisco in 1983 to start Goodby, Silverstein with a third partner, Andy Berlin.
"They have our blessing," Mr. Silverstein said. "Hal Riney gave it to us, and we give it to them."
Mr. Venables, 35, a copywriter, and Mr. Bell, 31, an art director, have a third partner, too. He is Bob Molineaux, 41, a management executive with whom they worked on various accounts at Goodby, Silverstein before Mr. Molineaux left to join another San Francisco agency, Citron Haligman Bedecarre, now part of AKQA. Mr. Venables and Mr. Bell will be co-creative directors at Venables/Bell and Mr. Molineaux will be president.
"The smart, savvy marketers scrutinize their advertising at a time like this and ask, 'Am I getting a return on my investment, or is what's on the air a financial drain?' " Mr. Venables said.
"We have a pretty good track record of making sure what's on the air is not a financial drain," he added. He and Mr. Bell are leaving Goodby, Silverstein after working together there on accounts like Discover Card, Netflix, SBC Communications and Sutter Home wine. Mr. Molineaux worked with them on SBC and Sutter Home.
"What we discovered working together, the three of us," said Mr. Molineaux, who since January has served as the managing director of the New York office of AKQA, "is that we were able to take difficult client situations and manage them where the outcome was better creative."
"In a bad economy, clients are very often looking to switch agencies," he added, "and they're looking for someone who thinks a little out of the box." Goodby, Silverstein is known for irreverent ads featuring characters like the Budweiser lizards and the E*Trade Group chimp as well as "Got milk?" and a new Hewlett-Packard campaign centered on employees.
Mr. Venables's promotion at Goodby, Silverstein elevated him into the ranks of the next generation along with Steve Simpson, creative director and partner. Other creative executives will now assume Mr. Venables's duties and work with Mr. Simpson, Mr. Goodby and Mr. Silverstein said.
The SBC connection is not only bringing together Mr. Venables, Mr. Bell and Mr. Molineaux, it is also bringing them their first client. The three worked with Bill Morgan, vice president for marketing at Ultimate TV, and Beth Kachellek, director for advertising and brand management at Ultimate TV, who are based in Mountain View, Calif., when those two executives were at SBC.
While the fact that Ultimate TV is leaving FCB San Francisco for a start-up shop is surprising, the leaving itself is less so. Trade publications have reported a rocky relationship between the two. That was demonstrated in March, when a television campaign for Ultimate TV was created not by FCB San Francisco but by Rodgers Townsend in St. Louis, which had originally been hired to handle brand identity work, not advertising.
The loss of the Ultimate TV creative account is another blow for FCB San Francisco, owned by True North Communications. It has lost other high-profile clients like Amazon.com and suffered layoffs after the Compaq Computer account was shifted to the FCB New York office.
Venables/Bell will handle creative and media planning for Ultimate TV. Media buying is handled by the Universal McCann division of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
In exchange for accepting Mr. Goodby and Mr. Silverstein's help, Mr. Venables and Mr. Molineaux said they promised not to hire staff members from Goodby, Silverstein. That's a sore point with Mr. Goodby and Mr. Silverstein, who often complain they have been raided too many times by former employees opening their own shops.
"They can pick from many trees, not one," Mr. Silverstein said, laughing.
Besides, Mr. Venables said, with all the laid-off advertising employees in San Francisco right now, "there's lots of good talent on the street."

To the Thinnest Of Applause, Europeans Cut Interest Rates

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: LEIPZIG, Germany, May 10 

 BODY:
Having insisted for months that Europe had no need to join the rest of the world in easing monetary policy, the European Central Bank unexpectedly shifted ground today and reduced its benchmark interest rate.
 The modest rate cut -- of one-quarter of a percentage point, to 4.5 percent -- appeared to reflect increasing concern that the American economic slowdown might indeed hurt the European economy more than originally thought. 
 But the move evoked criticism by economists, who accused the central bank of being contradictory and slow to respond. Far from comforting markets by providing easier money, they said, the bank had undermined its own credibility and provided new evidence of its shakiness in making decisions. 
The lack of steady leadership, and the increasing difficulty that central bankers from the 12-nation euro zone have had in reaching agreement, makes it less likely than before that Europe can step in as the engine of world economic growth if the American economic slowdown becomes protracted.
A month ago, the European Central Bank resisted pleas to emulate the Federal Reserve by reducing interest rates and giving European economies a boost. "I hear, but I do not listen," remarked Wim Duisenberg, the central bank's president, in his most concise articulation of such go-it-alone sentiment.
Today, Mr. Duisenberg acknowledged that little had changed since last month on either the prospects for economic growth or for inflation. The main piece of additional news, he said, had been that the money supply grew somewhat more slowly than previously thought.
To which, Adolf Rosenstock, an economist with Nomura International in London, remarked: "How much more contradictory can you be? What kind of monetary policy is it? You can't pin them down."
Thomas Mayer, a senior economist with the Goldman Sachs Group in Frankfurt, said the move vividly demonstrated the difficulty of the European Central Bank's governors in reaching agreement.
"The Federal Reserve surprises by making decisions earlier than people expect," Mr. Mayer said. "The E.C.B. surprises by making decisions later than people expect."
None of this was particularly good news for the common currency, the euro, which has lost nearly a quarter of its value against the dollar since 11 European nations adopted it in 1999. (The 12th euro zone member, Greece, joined in January.) After jumping briefly in European trading today when the interest rate cut was announced, the euro declined, settling in New York late in the day at 88.16 cents, down from 88.42 cents on Wednesday.
The European Central Bank's troubles stood in contrast to a smoother course at the Bank of England, which also lowered its key interest rate by a quarter-point today, to 5.25 percent. The British had signaled their intention well in advance.
Britain -- which has not adopted the euro and conducts its own monetary policy -- has had relative stability in the exchange value of the pound, which settled at $1.4233 today, as well as a rise in value against the euro. Still, the British economy may be more vulnerable to American economic weakness than Continental Europe's because American investment is higher there. British interest rates are now at their lowest since November 1999, but are the highest among the Group of Seven industrial nations.
In many ways, the European bank's timing could not have been worse. The bank disappointed the markets last month by refusing to reduce rates, maintaining that the dangers of inflation were too serious to be ignored. Since then, new data have heightened inflation worries and seemed to validate the bank's hawkish views. In Germany, which accounts for about a third of the euro zone's economic output, inflation reports from individual states last week suggested that prices were climbing at nearly 3 percent a year, higher than the central bank's target of 2 percent or less. 
Yet the most recent data on industrial production and factory orders, which dropped sharply in Germany, have confirmed widespread expectations of a modest slowdown. 
Most private economists, as well as those at the European Central Bank, still say that economic growth will be about 2.5 percent this year -- slower than in 2000, but not as slow as they expect in the United States.
So what has changed? At a news conference in Frankfurt today, Mr. Duisenberg said the money supply had climbed more slowly than thought as a result of statistical distortions. On top of that, he said, wage increases had continued to be moderate. 
Mr. Duisenberg sounded downright optimistic about inflation risks even though senior European Central Bank officials have been issuing a steady stream of warnings for the last several weeks. "It can now be concluded that there is no threat to price stability over the medium term," he said. "Wage moderation has so far been maintained for the euro area as a whole. This has been a very positive factor."
But economists' reactions to such explanations ranged from skepticism to scorn. "The forecasts for the next year did not change," said Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Research. "This was not news. This was something that everybody had known and that the E.C.B. could have known. I don't see any reason why they had to pick today to change policy."
Mr. Mayer of Goldman Sachs said that today's move demonstrated that the European Central Bank ultimately followed conventional wisdom, but took a long time to reach each new agreement.
In the last several weeks, the bank has come under strong pressure to relax monetary policy. Finance ministers from countries including Belgium and Austria have publicly called for rate cuts. The International Monetary Fund as well as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have also argued for an interest rate reduction.
But in cutting rates, after repeatedly saying that it would wait and see, the central bank seemed to be capitulating to pressure. That is not the kind of image that central banks want to cultivate, and it did nothing today to bolster confidence in the euro.
"The E.C.B. has always had a problem getting people to understand what it is doing," Mr. Mayer said "This is not going to help."
Mr. Duisenberg rejected such views. "New facts lead to new assessments," he said. "It has nothing to do with pressure."
Mr. Walter of Deutsche Bank argued that today's rate cut could in fact help slow economic growth because it was so modest that investors would almost certainly be betting on additional rate cuts in the months ahead.
"If there has been a new assessment," he said, "consumers may well delay their spending and businesses may delay investments because they are expecting rates to become even lower in the future."

Substantial Cutbacks For 2 Big Agencies

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
Two large agencies -- the United States division of Lowe Lintas & Partners Worldwide in New York and Temerlin McClain in Irving, Tex. -- are making significant cutbacks and staff reductions.
 Lowe Lintas, based in London and part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, is closing its San Francisco office, leaving the agency with only one office in the United States. 
 "The factors in this decision are twofold," said Gary Goldsmith, United States chairman and chief creative officer at Lowe Lintas, "the dramatically softening San Francisco-region advertising market and a radical reduction of advertising-related spending and viable new-business opportunities in that marketplace."
At its height, the Lowe Lintas San Francisco office, which opened in April 1997, had 60 employees and billings estimated at $150 million from clients like Eddie Bauer, InterNAP Network Services, Sun Microsystems and ZDNet. The agency closes with 27 employees and billings estimated at $15 million from clients like Disney Quest and Virgin Mobile USA.
Efforts are being made to find jobs for the remaining employees at other San Francisco agencies or other Interpublic agencies, said Michael Draznin, a spokesman for Lowe Lintas. He added that Buz Sawyer, president and general manager at the office, is looking at options inside and outside the Lowe Group and Interpublic.
Lowe Lintas closed its Chicago office 14 months ago after the largest account there, Ameritech, departed because of a merger. Last week, the New York office laid off 18 employees, or about 2.4 percent of the staff.
Temerlin McClain is laying off about 20 percent of its staff of 550 employees, said Dennis McClain, chief executive, because of the economic slowdown, a loss of accounts and the coming acquisition of its parent, True North Communications, by Interpublic. 
The estimated 102 employees who are being dismissed come from across the agency.

HEADLINE: Judge Blocks New Forest Protection Rules 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10 

 BODY:
A federal judge in Idaho blocked the Clinton administration's forest-protection plan today, saying that if the rules went into effect as scheduled on Saturday, they could cause "irreparable long-term harm" to local communities.
 The ruling by the judge, Edward J. Lodge of Federal District Court in Boise, abruptly halted a plan that would have put about a third of the national forests off limits to road building and most logging. After an internal review, the Bush administration said last week that it would carry out the rules but with major amendments, a plan that Judge Lodge rejected today as "a Band-Aid approach." 
 In ruling in favor of a challenge by the State of Idaho and Boise Cascade, the giant timber company, Judge Lodge recalled his own earlier scorching opinions in which he had accused the Clinton administration of drafting the rule without adequate attention to local concerns. 
In issuing a preliminary injunction, the judge sided with arguments by Idaho, Boise Cascade and other opponents, who say the restrictions could cause economic harm to the state and to the timber and mining industries. The plaintiffs argued that the administration had failed to meet its obligation under federal law to take those concerns into account. 
A Justice Department official said tonight that the administration had not decided whether to appeal the ruling. But environmental groups granted status as intervenors in the case said they would challenge the decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
They said that the Bush administration's defense of the Clinton plan had been only lukewarm and that its proposal to give local officials considerable power over road building restrictions could leave the plan essentially hollow.
The environmental lawyers said they saw no basis for the judge's finding that letting the rule take effect would cause harm.
But in his decision, Judge Lodge said, "Once something of this magnitude is set in motion, momentum is irresistible, options are closed and agency commitments, if not set in concrete, will be the subject of litigation for years to come."
In Idaho, Gov. Dirk Kempthorne said the decision had "affirmed what the State of Idaho has contended all along," that the decision-making process was flawed and that the policy could deny the state vital revenue from logging and crucial access to state lands. The governor said the decision would now allow local decision making "to be at the front end of any future planning process for our nation's forests."
The Bush administration has made clear that it shares Western concerns that the process used to shape the rules had trampled on local interests, but it also recognizes the broad public support for protecting forest areas. 
The environmentalists said that a failure by the Bush administration to offer a stronger defense of the Clinton rule before the Boise court appeared to have cleared the way for the injunction, perhaps intentionally. They said they feared that the administration would now use the ruling to justify its plan to put in rules that would allow local forest managers to amend or ignore broad forest protection regulations case by case.
In announcing that plan last week, Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman said the administration was trying to address concerns raised by Judge Lodge in earlier rulings.
Environmental groups have been skeptical of the idea that the administration's hands were tied.
"The Bush administration has made it clear that it's using this judge's opinion as a rationale for reopening and potentially gutting a hugely popular conservation measure," said Niel Lawrence, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "And until we can get the Ninth Circuit to rule on this, this will only add fuel to the fire for them." 
In a brief filed last Friday, Justice Department lawyers said the government opposed the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. But it was unclear whether the administration would decide to join the environmentalists in any appeal.
Administration officials said high-level meetings on that subject were scheduled for Friday.
To support his order, Judge Lodge cited what he called the Bush administration's "own admission" that its officials "share plaintiffs' concerns about the potential for irreparable harm in the long-term under the current rule."
He did not spell out what potential harm he believed might occur, but he cited warnings by the state and timber industry that the rule would restrict logging, energy development and other activities already planned for parts of the forest.
He also mentioned the plaintiffs' argument that if the rule remained in place, it would "cause a chilling effect that will preclude local Forest Service officials from planning future management activities." 
The rule, issued by the Clinton administration on Jan. 5, was developed over three years in which there were scores of public meetings and more than a million people commented on the plan to the Forest Service. Critics, led by Western states and the timber companies, argued all along that the outcome was preordained and noted that states and communities in the West were given no role in the decisionmaking.
Environmentalists have praised the Clinton rule as the most extensive land-conservation act in decades.
"Today's decision means the chainsaws can roar while the timber industry tries to dismantle a popular effort to protect our last wild forests," said Carl Pope, the executive director of the Sierra Club. 
Among those who have long criticized the Clinton rule, Senator Larry E. Craig, the Idaho Republican who heads the Senate forest subcommittee, had confidently predicted the ruling even before the judge issued his decision this afternoon.
"I do believe that President Clinton and his people intentionally attempted to step around the National Environmental Policy Act, and I believe the judge and I and others caught them in that," Mr. Craig said in a telephone interview. "And I don't believe that a flawed document that was designed in an illegal way should stand." 
Senator Frank H. Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who heads the Senate Energy Committee, said: "It is fully appropriate given the legal infirmities that the judge stopped this rule dead in its tracks. The ruling allows the Bush Administration to start with a clean slate and to make forest policy in a proper manner." 
Despite the injunction, environmentalists said the only place timber projects that would have been blocked under the Clinton plan are in a position to go forward in the near future would be in the Tongass National Forest of Alaska, the country's largest. But there, they noted, the proposed timber sales that may be affected have been blocked for now by a separate court injunction.
They said they would watch closely for signs that the administration is using the ruling to put in place policies very different from those envisioned by the Clinton administration. One decision could come later this month, when the White House will issue a report on energy that may call for new oil and gas exploration on public lands that the Clinton administration had been trying to put off limits.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "AFRICAN FORMS," Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through Aug. 8). This show forgoes the figurative sculptures and masks that made African art a foundation of Western modernism to concentrate on supposedly humbler stuff, objects of physical adornment and daily use. With some 400 objects created by 156 ethnic groups, it proceeds in clusters of related carved wood neck rests, stools and boxes; ivory hairpins and snuff bottles; all kinds of jewelry; baskets and ceramic vessels; and spoons, weapons and musical instruments. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50, students and 65+ (Roberta Smith).

* "BEAUTY, HONOR AND TRADITION: THE LEGACY OF PLAINS INDIAN SHIRTS," Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700 (through Nov. 4). To Plains Indians of the 18th and 19th centuries, magnificently decorated hide shirts were symbols of bravery earned only by the most courageous in battle. Obsessively fringed and embellished with porcupine quills, paint, ribbon, hair and, later, tight patterns of colored glass beads, the shirts took on the spirits of their owners and even today are made for wearing at powwows and in recognition of other accomplishments. Celebrating the power of this glory gear, almost 50 dazzlers in the museum's collection are on view, dating from about 1820 to the 1990's. Among the more fascinating examples are a brilliantly painted Crow shirt (1890) with beadwork in geometric patterns and frizzy fringes of dyed magenta and yellow hair and a Lakota shirt, circa 1890, that carries United States Army insignia, the American flag and stepped tepees topped by crosses, all worked in porcupine quills and metal beads. Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily; Thursdays to 8 p.m. Free. (Grace Glueck).

* "BITSTREAMS" AND "DATA DYNAMICS," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through June 10). Companion digital shows with a well-mannered, slightly dull air of decorous efficiency and cheerful modernity that encapsulates what you may regard as an ethos at large. Both affairs survey the new technological age in art, and there is no denying the inevitability of the big message here, which we discount at the risk of sheer stupidity: technology is changing how artists, especially young ones, make all types of art and, in turn, how we experience it. Still, the work produced needs to answer the old question: Does it move us? And there's the rub. A few artists, like Paul Pfeiffer and Jeremy Blake, stand out in "BitStreams." In "Data Dynamics," works like "Apartment" and "Netomat," metaphors for the Web as global unconscious, suggest that Internet art is at least becoming more like traditional media, whereby most but no longer all of what you see is unremarkable. Don't skip the sound section in "BitStreams," 25 audio artists working squarely in the tradition of musique concrete, a half-century-old movement but with new digital means replacing tape recorders. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays; Saturdays, Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8, students and 62+ (Michael Kimmelman).

* "WILLIAM BLAKE," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through June 24). A touching and beautiful show if you have a taste for Blake's art, which strives for ecstatic revelation on the level of his famous visions and rises to the heights of his verse, sometimes. From the Age of Aquarius to New Age, he has come to serve as the patron saint of flower children, Jungians, Freudians, occultists, spiritualists, nudists, unpublished authors, animal lovers, socialists and teenagers of the sort who read Hermann Hesse. By turning our attention to his laborious illustrations and watercolors, the exhibition compels us to think about him as a serious and original visual artist, which is to say as a more idiosyncratic and substantial figure than the cliches suggest. He truly believed that the world was ending and that he had been sent to set things right at the last minute. Whatever else he may or may not have been, Blake was the most genuine and uncompromising artist you can think of. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

"MARC CHAGALL: EARLY WORKS FROM RUSSIAN COLLECTIONS," Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Oct. 14). When Chagall returned to Russia in 1914 after four years in Paris, he intended to marry his beloved fiancee Bella Rosenfeld and then hurry back to the French capital. Instead World War I and the Russian Revolution kept him in his homeland for eight years, during which he did some of his greatest works. The 60 here, most being exhibited in the West for the first time, form a series of intense Chagallian doses rather than a comprehensive overview. They are accompanied by nine paintings by Chagall's first teacher, the sensitive realist Yehuda Pen. The show culminates in the seven large, deliriously inventive murals Chagall made for the Jewish State Chamber Theater in Moscow during three feverish months in 1920. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $4, students and 60+ (Roberta Smith)

* "KENNETH JOSEPHSON: A RETROSPECTIVE," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through May 27). The first full-scale career assessment for one of the earliest and most inventive explorers of photography's character and the issues of perception and representation that it raises. In the 1960's, when Mr. Josephson began commenting on it, the truthfulness of photography was still a myth with a powerful hold on the imagination. Best of all, his philosophizing is often served up with a generous portion of wit. Much of his work has never been exhibited, and he is not nearly as well known as he deserves to be. Hours and admission: See above (Vicki Goldberg).

* "VERMEER AND THE DELFT SCHOOL," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500 (through May 27). Genius does not flourish in a vacuum. That's the simple lesson vividly conveyed by this alternately tousled and crystalline exhibition. With 15 Vermeers -- nearly half his known paintings -- serving as ballast, this exhibition almost giddily spotlights a succession of artists, tracking the emergence of an increasingly effortless illusionism in Delft in the 1650's and 60's. Flower still lifes, whitewashed church interiors, townscapes and genre scenes by Pieter de Hooch, Carel Fabritius and Gerard Houckgeest are part of the mix, along with drawings and a breathtaking selection of small landscapes by artists you've never heard of. All this contextualizing sharpens one's sense of Vermeer's achievement, but it also spells out the milieu without which he would not have been Vermeer. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

Galleries: Uptown

BERND AND HILLA BECHER, "Photographs From the 1960's and 70's," Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677. (through May 25). This exhibition samples the early efforts of the German team that helped establish the camera's art-world credentials with rigorous black-and-white photographs of lime kilns, blast furnaces and water towers that capture the body industrial (Smith).

* LOUISE BOURGEOIS, "The Personages," C & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020 (through June 9). Bone-skinny, striking and each an individual, Ms. Bourgeois's 19 bronze "Personages" are enigmatic, people-size totems that stand in amiable camaraderie, like well-behaved guests at a cultural soiree. But their presence is insistent. Made from 1947 to 1953, and Surrealistic in origin, they greet the viewer at eye level, dispensing with the built-up bases that afflicted most earlier sculpture. Revisiting this powerful body of work strengthens awareness of the inspired personal vision with which Ms. Bourgeoise has enriched the universe of sculpture (Glueck).

KARA HAMMOND, Joseph Rickards, 1045 Madison Avenue, at 79th Street, (212) 924-0858 (through Wednesday). Five sweet, delicately made pencil drawings represent an assortment of technological yet oddly poetic objects: a blimp, an old radio tube, an oil-rig escape pod, a safe hanging by a rope and the strangely blossoming sphere of a nuclear bomb mushroom cloud. A four-foot-square painting of a space station interior suggests Ms. Hammond works best closer to miniature scale (Ken Johnson).

JIM PETERS, CDS, 76 East 79th Street, (212) 772-9555 (through May 19). Carnal desire animates deliberately grungy assemblages and collages in a show by an artist with a master's degree in nuclear engineering. The contrast between roughly built, crustily painted structural elements and the photographs of attractive naked women that they frame suggests a tension between raw actuality and idealizing fantasy. One senses an underlying anxiety, which might be worth making more visible (Johnson).

* "POP ART: THE JOHN AND KIMIKO POWERS COLLECTION," Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 77th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through June 30). With his Japanese-born wife, Kimiko, John Powers (1916-1999), a former president of the Prentice-Hall publishing company, gathered a big-bang collection of Pop art by the movement's star names. The 26 objects shown here, including works by Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Claes Oldenburg, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and James Rosenquist, are mostly from the 1960's, and they bring a whole era back into vivid focus. Collectors' collectors, the Powerses made the pursuit into an art of their own (Glueck).

REEVA POTOFF, "Zero Gravity," Kouros, 23 East 73rd Street, (212) 288-5888 (through May 31). A veteran installation artist here shows a series of analytic yet evocative, grid-based photographic collages. In each, the image of a female swimmer shot from behind and below water is mediated by a field of darkly translucent photographic squares. The effect is like a modern stained-glass window and almost mystically haunting (Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

* JOAN BROWN: "CATS AND DOGS," George Adams, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 644-5665 (through May 19). Anyone unfamiliar with Joan Brown (1938-1990) will find this selection of pictures with dogs or cats in them an excellent introduction to an exuberantly original painter. Not to be missed is the large 1969 diptych in which Rufus the dog observes the artist and her husband posed in formal evening wear under an arcade of trees with valentine-shaped clouds tumbling in the sky (Johnson).

CHARLES HARBUTT, "Dreams and Memories . . . ," Laurence Miller, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-3930 (through May 19). This small retrospective looks back on an admirable 40-year career in photojournalism. With affectionate warmth and great framing instincts, Mr. Harbutt captures moments of riveting narrative pregnancy. In a shot in Milan in 1970, for example, five businessmen gather on an astonishingly long modern stairway against a high wall splashed by sunlight; you feel an almost divine immanence (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

* GENE BEERY, Mitchell Algus, 25 Thompson Street, (212) 966-1758 (through May 19). The wordy sign paintings by this pioneering Conceptualist mischief-maker are funny and philosophically knotty. A recent work, "Essences Only," consists of a comically self-referential message hastily brushed in black paint on white canvas: "My life is too short to spend much time on formal painting art concerns. I am simply recording essences." Just so (Johnson).

"DANGER," Exit Art/The First World, 548 Broadway, between Prince and Spring Streets, (212) 966-7745 (through May 19). Little in this disappointing theme show seems truly dangerous and no clear thesis about danger in art emerges. A noisy machine by Robert Chambers shoots air in your face; amusing junk robots by Chico MacMurtrie dance and masturbate; Gregory Green has set up a consulate for a real nation he is trying to create on an unclaimed island; and elegant, emblematic photographs by Susan Seubert symbolize various phobias (Johnson).

ANTONIO FRASCONI, Sragow, 73 Spring Street, (212) 219-1793 (through May 19) and El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272 (through May 20). This eminent, socially engaged printmaker is showing rough expressionistic, politically charged woodcuts from the 1940's at Sragow. At El Museo del Barrio is a recent series of richly colored, textured and abstracted prints that illustrate Langston Hughes's poem "Let America Be America Again" (Johnson).

ROBERT RYMAN AND IAN WILSON, Peter Blum Gallery, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441 (through June 2). Bringing together examples of Mr. Ryman's stripped-down paintings and evidence from Mr. Wilson's various Conceptual Art activities, this exhibition tellingly contrasts different kinds of aesthetic purism (Smith).

VALTON TYLER, Phyllis Kind, 136 Greene Street, (212) 925-1200 (through June 30). The paintings by this self-taught Texan verge on a kind of surrealistic kitsch, but they are persuasively strange. At his best, in large, weirdly stylized landscapes Mr. Tyler accumulates simplified tubular and spiky forms into dense jungle scenes that have the Cubist palpability and otherworldly dreaminess of Henri Rousseau (Johnson).

STEPHEN WESTFALL, Lennon Weinberg Gallery, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 941-0012 (through June 2). In this quiet knockout of a show, Mondrianist grids and color blocks are once more infused with worldly reference and postmodern play while being extended on their own adamantly visual terms. Intimations of domestic interiors are among the new additions, along with doubled or widened grids that ante up to the usual jittery spatial contradictions. In all, the subtle yet marvelously optical jostling, something of a Westfall trademark, is increased almost to the point of breaking into dance (Smith).

Galleries: Chelsea

* ROBERT BARRY, "Early Works, 1966-73," Gasser & Grunert, 524 West 19th Street, (212) 807-9494 (through May 19). This beautifully installed exhibition presents classic works by a pioneer of dematerialized art. Mr. Barry's visually minimal, verbally paradoxical works operate like Zen koans to heighten awareness of the mystery of consciousness. One, penciled in fine block letters on the wall, reads, "All the things I know but of which I am not at the moment thinking -- 1:36 PM; June 15, 1969" (Johnson).

"HOME AND THE WORLD: AN EXPLORATION OF IDENTITY AT CROSSROADS," India Center of Art and Culture, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 462-4221 (through May 31). The center is a recently opened nonprofit space devoted equally to art, literature, music and film, and most of those media play some role in this group exhibition of contemporary artists of Indian descent (Holland Cotter).

MELISSA MEYER; ALEX STOLYAROV, Elizabeth Harris, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 463-9666 (through May 19). Ms. Meyer's loosely gridded, confidently improvised paintings exude a fine summery light. With wide brushes she layers loopy squiggles of color over radiant patchwork fields; the effect is rigorously economical yet hedonistically sumptuous. Mr. Stolyarov's compact, extremely thick, lusciously colored monochrome abstractions are like giant Chiclets (Johnson).

ESTER PARTEGAS, De Chiara/Stewart, 521 West 26th Street, (212) 967-6007 (through May 26). For her second New York solo, Ms. Partegas has installed rows of diminutive modern seats made of cardboard and other lightweight materials. Along with planters holding ferns made of silver cardboard, framed blank signboards on the wall and color-coordinated floor and wall paint, it all adds up to a toddler-scale airport waiting room. The spell is undermined by real stuff like luggage, fast food and magazines scattered around, but the magical miniaturism still prevails (Johnson).

FRAN SIEGEL: "INTERFERENCE," Margaret Thatcher Projects, 529 West 20th Street (212) 675-0222 (through May 26). Shimmering wall works of steel mesh backed by painted Plexiglas radiate pale, offbeat shades that resonate in the small space of this gallery. Ms. Siegel achieves her effects by painting on a Plexiglas panel, then covering the panel and its frame with a cover sheet of thin steel, punctuated by dots in random patterns. The color streams through the holes, shifting and changing with the angle at which the works are viewed. An extension of the painting is a row of light papier-mache balls suspended from the ceiling on nylon string, hovering just above the floor. The balls, each with a mirror under it, move and bobble in response to ambient air currents, again creating a shifting space and adding to the show's appeal (Glueck).

DOUG WADA, Dee/Glasoe, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 924-7545 (through May 26). This canny painter updates Jasper Johns with his deadpan fusion of Pop, trompe l'oeil realism and grid-based formalism. You might mistake a 6-by-10-foot canvas for a wall of green high school lockers; in two other works, plastic subway seats fitted perfectly into the rectangle of the picture have a startling palpability. Other subjects include a wire-mesh trash receptacle, stacks of rounded suitcases and an air-conditioner (Johnson).

Other Galleries

GLORIA KLEIN, "Paradise Found," Gallery Onetwentyeight, 128 Rivington Street, between Essex and Norfolk Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 674-0244 (through May 19). Ms. Klein's new drawings, displayed in a small back gallery, consist of odd-shaped interlocked geometric forms in colored pencil on paper. They suggest both exuberant jigsaw puzzles, every piece in place, and abstract woodland landscapes of lush green foliage, purple shadows and bursts of radiant light. Tabletop size, they were clearly created up-close and are meant for up-close viewing (Cotter).

LIZZIE SCOTT AND JOSH BLACKWELL, P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, entrance on East Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 228-4249 (through May 20). These two artists use fabric as a metaphor for ephemerality and as a source of unsuspected beauty. Using gouache, Mr. Blackwell replicates found patterns -- flowered furniture covering, the stripes in an American flag -- on paper and pins his versions to the original material. Ms. Scott, who stands out here, makes rubbings of tiled bathroom floors on pieces of fine silk, then trims the results with mother-of-pearl buttons and satin roses, creating what appear to be elegantly off-center cloaks. Lovely (Cotter).

"SCULPTURE," Flipside, 84 Withers Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 389-7108 (through May 27). Sculpture as intimate as drawing is the unstated theme. Mary Carlson's stoneware serpents and Julia Kunin's crystal octopuses hang on the wall, as do Janet Pihlblad's fragrant moss-covered window frames. Elana Herzog transforms the wall itself with stapled and torn cloth. Drew Shiflett's free-standing structures of paper and glue are like furniture made splinter by splinter. Matt Freedman offers a small panoramic view of the gallery within the gallery; at Five Myles, 558 St. John's Place in Crown Heights, (718) 783-4438, he has collaborated with neighborhood children on a wraparound mural of Prospect Park, up through May 19 (Cotter).

QIU ZHIJIE, Ethan Cohen Fine Arts, 37 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 625-1250 (through May 19). This young Beijing-based artist makes his New York debut with a show that plays with and extends classical forms. Calligraphic scrolls carry outtakes from the dictionary. On other scrolls, elements of ink-and-brush landscapes -- trees, figures, pavilions -- are cut loose from their original contexts. In a video the artist writes out Tang dynasty poems, but the tape is played backward so that he seems to be erasing them. He's moving in several directions at this point, but certain themes (cultural fragmentation, transience) and attitudes (brash Zen-style wit, nostalgia) are constants (Cotter).

Last Chance

* "ANOTHER, ONCE AGAIN, MANY TIMES MORE," Feature, 530 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 675-7772 (through tomorrow). This show of serial work has something for everybody, and possibly a little too much for some viewers. John Torreano covers the wall with bejeweled half-spheres, Lisa Beck with painted tondos, Nancy Shaver with stacked architectural outtakes and David Morreno with a suave pattern-painting titled "Door Knob Head: The Movie Sequence." Michael St. John edges into fraught terrain with a sculptural lineup of serial killers from horror films. Daniel Hesidence follows up with alarming paintings of bullet-strafed heads, all women. Howard Johnson is an island unto himself with thick collages made of ink drawings, reflective stickers, floor plans and G-strings, forming a grimy looking Insider-Outsider Art melange with lots of promise (Cotter).

"THE COS COB ART COLONY: IMPRESSIONISTS ON THE CONNECTICUT SHORE," National Academy of Design Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through Sunday). From 1890 to 1920, Cos Cob, Conn., was a hangout for American Impressionist painters, led by John H. Twachtman, J. Alden Weir, Childe Hassam and Theodore Robinson. Writers and journalists added to the scene's buzz. Though art talk and theorizing ran at fever pitch, in practice the Cos Cobbers put out a quiet, conservative brand of Impressionism that emphasized a bright palette, pastoral subjects and a concentration on what the novelist and critic William Dean Howells once called "the smiling aspects of life." Still, as a footnote to American art history, Cos Cob deserves recognition. Even though this is not the most urgent exhibition in town, it includes some lovely paintings, produced by the group's minor artists as well as its stars. Hours: Wednesdays and Thursdays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5 (Glueck).

* "ANDREAS GURSKY," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through Tuesday). The giant pictures in this midcareer retrospective of Mr. Gursky, the 46-year-old German photographer, are so eye-poppingly, drop-dead gorgeous that in this world, where no good turn goes unpunished, you may feel compelled to react with suspicion and reserve. But knee-jerk resistance at the sight of the nondescript global emblems of new capitalist sprawl that he photographs is short-circuited by sheer awe at the incredible, sublimely weird, almost erotic glamour he imparts to them. The work is instantly attractive to the point of alarm, which is the feeling of falling in love. You might as well give yourself over to it and worry about the consequences later. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; until 8:15 p.m. on Fridays. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

FARIBA HAJAMADI, Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 462-2668 (through tomorrow). This brainy, Iranian-born conceptualist uses photography to explore unspoken ideologies that drive Western museum practices. In six large, handsome, digitally manipulated views of museum exhibition spaces, Ms. Hajamadi gives her project an obliquely autobiographical spin by including obscure reflections of her own image and composing her own fictive installations of art and artifacts (Johnson).

* SIMON LEE AND CLAIRE LESTEVEN, Smack Mellon Studios, 56 Water Street, Brooklyn, (718) 834-8761 (through Sunday). In Mr. Lee's cinematic installation, a screen stretching across the darkened gallery is filled with luminous drifting images of animals, trees, houses and figures that appear to be under a microscope lens. They are all "live" projections of tiny plastic forms floating in a tank of eddying water. The results are a metaphor for the random flow of history, and a low-tech formal tour de force. In a separate solo show, Ms. Lesteven shows photographs and videos made with multi-aperture cyclindrical versions of a pinpoint camera, producing eerily distorted pictures of public spaces. Here, too, the means are straightforward, the ends evocative (Cotter).

* PAUL McCARTHY, New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Sunday). From his far-out position where the psychic security of Hollywood's packaging of sex and violence doesn't exist, Mr. McCarthy taps veins deep in the collective subconscious, well beyond where most shock artists have the audacity or intelligence to operate. He has been a cultish presence in Los Angeles for years, and his moment has finally come in New York. We see an artist of wild highs and lows, of black comedy, cheap jokes, unspeakable actions, dry formalism and some real fiascoes -- the mark of an artist risking failure, a good sign. There is something beyond mere Pop parody or social provocation in the work, something to do with deep private needs and desires, which we perceive secondhand as comic pathos. It is art as tough therapy, disturbingly honest. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, noon to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, artists, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

"WILLIAM TROST RICHARDS IN THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART," Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879 5500 (through Sunday). A 19th-century landscapist who worked in the tradition of the Hudson River School, Richards (1833-1905) made his mark as a painter of coastal scenes and as a watercolorist. The Met acquired a large trove of his watercolors in 1880 from the Rev. Elias Magoon, but let many of them go in 1929 when the Hudson River School was in disfavor. It has gradually been recouping, and although this show of oils, watercolors and drawings by no means provides a comprehensive view of Richards's career, it is a useful sketch of it from youth until shortly before his death. The White Mountains, the environs of Newport and scenes of the English coast were among his prime subjects, and one of the loveliest of the mountain scenes here is "Moonlight on Mount Lafayette" (1873), a poetic nighttime view of a lush, brook-crossed terrain. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).

HOUGHTON CRANFORD SMITH, "The Purist Landscapes," Richard York, 21 East 65th Street, (212) 772-9155 (through tomorrow). In Paris in the early 1930's, this American painter learned Purism, a variation on Cubism, from Amedee Ozenfant. Returning to New York, Smith combined idealizing simplification and finely textured paint in pastoral landscapes, producing images of New England hills or harbors or South American mountains that call to mind Grant Wood, Rockwell Kent and Charles Sheeler. But they also have their own slightly comical, slightly melancholy serenity (Johnson).

* "VAN GOGH'S POSTMAN: THE PORTRAITS OF JOSEPH ROULIN," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through Tuesday). This revelatory micro exhibition reunites five portraits of the postal worker Joseph Roulin, whom van Gogh met in Arles. The show affords an excellent opportunity to study the painter's craft as he processes a single motif through a series of approaches from painterly naturalism to richly patterned symbolism. It is fascinating as well to see the portraits in light of the biographical background. Roulin cared for van Gogh after the famous ear-cutting incident, and he grew in the artist's imagination from an amusing local character to a figure of Christ-like benevolence. Hours and admission: See above (Johnson).

GRAPHIC: Photos: Chagall's early years in Russia inspired "Dance," painted in 1920. ($; 2001 Artists Rights Society, New York/ADAGP, Paris); "Great American Nude No. 50," a 1963 work by Tom Wesselman, is from the John and Kimiko Powers collection at Gagosian uptown. (Gagosian Gallery)

HEADLINE: Productivity: An Exaggerated Boom May Soon Be a Bust 

BYLINE:  By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
PRODUCTIVITY is not what it was cracked up to be. And therein lies one of the great fallacies of the recent boom and bubble.
 Productivity -- at least as measured by the government -- zoomed in recent years, rising at a faster rate than at any time since the 1960's. That increase helped to persuade many economists that it was a new era, one in which old economic verities might not apply. 
 Rising productivity meant that the economy could grow rapidly without fear of inflation while the information technology revolution, in the year-old words of John T. Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems, enabled companies to "reduce costs, generate revenue in new ways, empower employees and citizens and provide the agility needed for the Internet economy's rapid pace."
Now productivity is falling, and Mr. Chambers is coping with a collapse in demand that he did not see coming and still cannot quite believe. This week he was still talking of Cisco returning to a 30 percent to 50 percent annual growth rate when the economy recovers. 
The reality of the productivity explosion was that it was concentrated in the information technology industry. Some of that rise was not real anyway, since the government's statistical adjustments probably exaggerated the improvements in computers. But the failure of the productivity measures to show big gains in other areas should have been telling. "If it was a real productivity miracle, how come we didn't see it in other places?" asked Greg Jensen, an analyst at Bridgewater Associates.
Nonetheless, it was believed to be real by the people that counted. It was that belief, says Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company, that led the Federal Reserve to back away from a pre-emptive tightening framework, in which rates were raised when the economy began to grow too fast.
There is no way to know just how much a tighter Fed would have been able to slow the expansion of the bubble, but it would have had some effect. Less money would have been wasted on unproductive investments, of which Cisco's $2.2 billion inventory write-down is but a small part. Think of the money invested in absurd dot-coms, as well as fiber optic lines that are installed but may never be used.
"Now we see a contraction of the ability of good companies to get money, because of all the money the bad companies sucked in," Mr. Jensen said. 
Instead, we must deal with the effects of a bust in capital investment, one that is likely to continue for some time. We will learn that productivity was probably really growing at a slower rate than we thought, and will continue to do so. That implies slower economic growth and lower multiples for earnings in the stock market.
There are historical precedents. In the 1920's and again in the 1950's and 1960's, productivity surged along with the stock market. "Productivity growth does not necessarily presage heaven on earth," James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, said. 
The last productivity boom came to an abrupt halt with the horrors of the 1970's, when high oil prices helped to choke off economic growth and slow investment. In the five years that ended with 1972, productivity rose 2.9 percent, very close to the level of the last five years. But by 1980, the five-year average was below 1 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average was below where it had been in 1966.
Productivity booms are not permanent things.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Cautions on F.D.I.C. 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today that policy makers should proceed with caution as they explore overhauling a Depression-era system that insures deposits in banks and savings and loan associations.
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has proposed some changes to the system, which was established in 1933. 
 Last month, the F.D.I.C. recommended to Congress that all banks pay for deposit insurance according to their risk of failure, and it proposed that the $100,000 limit on account coverage be pegged to inflation.
The insurance system and other federal programs that are intended to keep banks safe are often referred to as the safety net. Any changes to this safety net, Mr. Greenspan said, must be balanced against potential costs.
"I believe this means being very cautious about purposefully or inadvertently extending the scope and reach of the safety net," Mr. Greenspan said in a speech to a banking conference in Chicago.
Copies of his speech, which did not touch on interest rate policy or the state of the economy, were distributed in Washington.
The F.D.I.C. wants to end what it sees as a free ride for more than 900 banks and savings and loans that have the benefit of the insurance without paying premiums.
Current law prohibits the F.D.I.C. from collecting premiums from most institutions that have adequate capital and receive strong ratings from examiners. The F.D.I.C. wants a system in which every bank and savings and loan would contribute, with insurance premiums based on risk. If funds fell below a certain level, premiums would gradually be increased.

HEADLINE: Everyone Wants to Fix Rent Regulations. No One Knows How. 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Tenant groups seldom agree with landlord groups, but after the latest contortions on the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, the two sides have found common ground.
 Both sides complain that the rent regulation system is broken, and say it needs to be fixed. Some critics are even looking at the rent rules in neighboring suburbs and in New Jersey for pointers. 
 What has them so exercised is the drama that culminated at the board's session on Wednesday night. As the police barred news cameras and some citizens, the board convened with a new chairman and two other new members, all freshly minted appointees of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
Taking their seats for the first time, the newcomers promptly voted on increases for one million rent-stabilized apartments. The increases were 4 percent for one-year leases and 6 percent for two-year renewals, which were higher than the mayor had wanted. But that vote turned out to be a mistake. After a hasty recess, the board reversed itself and adopted 3 percent and 5 percent instead, as the mayor had urged. The majority did not debate or explain why it had approved those numbers.
"I'm glad Giuliani exercised the heavy hand he did and made the stumbles he did, with the comedy of three new people who didn't know what they were doing," said Michael McKee, associate director of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition. "The mayor has done us a big favor by turning a spotlight on this obscure board, which nobody understands, and the need to reform the process."
The landlords' chief spokesman, Joseph Strasburg, is equally vocal. "There used to be at least an attempt to come to a compromise that was somewhat fair, but the system is tainted now," said Mr. Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, representing 25,000 owners.
They are not the only ones who have been complaining.
The mayor himself had criticized the board's decision last year to adopt increases of 4 and 6 percent, 1 percentage point more than he wanted. So he replaced the board chairman, Edward S. Hochman, with a former mayoral aide, Steven Sinacori, and filled two other vacancies on the nine-member board with loyalists, including David Rubenstein, a deputy director in the budget office.
If nothing else, the board's vote on Wednesday showed how rent increases for regulated apartments are often governed by politics, and not necessarily by the cost of providing housing. But landlord and tenant groups disagree on what should be done to improve the process.
"I'd be the first to advocate the abolition of the board," Mr. Strasburg said. "Let's create a price index of landlord costs, and whatever the number is, they automatically get it."
Variations of that system are used in many of the 120 New Jersey municipalities that regulate rents for an estimated 1.3 million residents. Local councils and mayors usually decide the increases.
"Most use the Consumer Price Index or some formula using the C.P.I." said Nathan Slovin, executive vice president of the New Jersey Apartment Association, representing owners. Recent increases have been in the 3 percent range, he said. Few landlords apply for hardship increases, said Mitchell Kahn, vice president of the New Jersey Tenants Organization.
But New York tenant leaders are wary. "I'd be skeptical of going with a formula based solely on the landlord end, instead of an appointed board to protect people from unreasonable rents," said Kenneth Schaeffer, vice president of the Metropolitan Council on Housing.
In New York City, the board consults a landlord price index that tenant leaders argue is irrelevant. Rising oil prices, for example, can be partly offset by bulk purchases, by cutting back on heat or by adding insulation and taking other conservation steps.
Instead of focusing on prices, tenants say, regulators need to look at actual expenses and income. The board's own reports show that landlord profitability has risen to record levels as fewer and fewer apartments are governed by rent regulation. The advocates also say that regulators need to balance factors like limited tenant incomes and the housing shortage.
A different system applies in Nassau, Westchester and Rockland Counties, where nearly 70,000 apartments are regulated. To raise rents, landlords must submit income and expense declarations to the state, which computes averages to guide local rent boards.
As a result, the suburbs have had a slower rise in rents, Mr. McKee said. Last year, when the city's regulated rents rose 4 and 6 percent, the suburban increases ranged from 1.25 to 3 percent for one-year leases and from 2 to 3.75 percent for two-year renewals. Tenant groups are pushing for the city to follow that procedure.
But in other parts of the country, the trend has been toward having the free market govern rents. In California, a stronghold of rent regulation, a Republican-sponsored change in 1999 imposed a "decontrol-recontrol" policy that is also followed in much of New Jersey. Under that rule, a landlord may charge any rent when an apartment becomes vacant, but then regulation covers the new tenant for subsequent increases.
Some experts side with landlords in urging that rent regulations simply be eliminated, which, they argue, might actually benefit tenants. Eliminating rent regulation, they say, would spur the creation of new housing units, thereby increasing the supply of homes and putting downward pressure on rents.
A state referendum in Massachusetts a few years ago ended controls in Boston, Cambridge and Brookline. Arthur Zabarkes, former dean of the New York University Real Estate Institute, said: "As a market economist, I think regulation is a profoundly bad idea."
But tenant advocates say that past attempts to decrease rent protections have been disastrous for residents.
An author on rent controls, W. Dennis Keating, associate dean of urban affairs at Cleveland State University, said that whatever rules are devised, the factors are so complex that the best to be hoped for is only a "rough justice."

HEADLINE: CONGRESS ADOPTS BUDGET PROPOSAL WITH BIG TAX CUT 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10 

 BODY:
A budget plan close to what President Bush proposed won final Congressional approval today, clearing the way for the first big tax cut in 20 years.
 Some of that reduction will probably result in lower taxes this year, but how that will happen and how much taxpayers will gain this year are still to be debated. 
 The Senate adopted the budget plan, 53 to 47, with five Democrats voting for it and two Republicans against it. The House passed the measure on Wednesday, also on essentially a party-line vote. 
It allows $1.35 trillion in tax cuts over the next 11 years, slightly less than the $1.6 trillion the president sought, and it calls for nearly $2 trillion in federal spending in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, almost precisely what Mr. Bush proposed.
"Now that both the House and the Senate have acted, it's clear that the economic recovery package that the president has talked about is on the way," Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said. 
Leaders of the Senate Finance Committee said they expected the committee to approve a detailed tax-cut bill next week. Tax legislation has already passed the House, and Republicans hope to have a tax bill ready for the president's signature by Memorial Day.
No doubt remains that a large tax cut will be enacted this year or about what its main elements will be: an across-the-board reduction in income-tax rates, lower taxes for many married couples, an expanded tax credit for families with children and eventual repeal or lowering of the federal estate tax.
The only remaining questions are in the details, including exactly how much the top tax rate will be reduced and how quickly the lower rates will be put into effect.
The measure adopted today, called a budget resolution, is not legislation and does not require the president's signature. It is essentially a nonbinding planning tool that is supposed to set the boundaries for tax and spending legislation this year.
In recent years, Congress has ignored the budget resolution once it was adopted, and this pattern seems likely to be followed this year.
The measure, for instance, calls for a 4 percent increase in spending in the next fiscal year for all programs except interest payments on the debt and automatic benefits like Social Security and Medicare. Lawmakers from both parties agree that the 4 percent spending figure is certain to be exceeded, and Republicans are already talking about tax cuts beyond the $1.35 trillion.
The wording of the measure is intentionally vague in many places. For example, the resolution allows the Senate to interpret it as requiring a $100 billion tax reduction in this calendar year to stimulate the economy and the House to assume that the $100 billion in cuts can be spread over 11 years.
While the numbers and language in the budget resolution have little practical significance, the measure is very important politically.
Mr. Bush made it the first test of his ability to hold Republicans together and get his agenda through the closely divided Congress. He clearly passed the test.
And under budget rules, any tax cut that fits within the boundaries established by the resolution can be passed by a majority vote in the Senate after limited debate instead of facing the prospects of a filibuster requiring 60 votes to end. Because of strong Democratic opposition, a tax cut almost certainly could not get 60 votes in the Senate, which is divided 50-50 between the parties.
The five Democratic senators who voted for the plan were John B. Breaux of Louisiana, Max Baucus of Montana, Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Zell Miller and Max Cleland, both of Georgia.
Republicans are expecting them to cast the decisive votes again when the actual tax-cut legislation is before the Senate. But it is not clear whether Republicans will be able to rely on them on other issues as the year wears on.
The Republicans who voted against the budget plan were Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and James M. Jeffords of Vermont. They seem comfortable breaking party ranks and will probably be allies of the Democrats on issues like education and the environment.
Mr. Breaux was the power broker who delivered enough Democratic votes for the measure to be approved. Today, he told the Senate that the measure should be approved largely because the most objectionable aspects like the money for education were sure to be changed.
"This is an imperfect document," he declared. "But it is written on paper; it is not written in concrete."
For Republicans, in control of the White House and Congress this year for the first time in 50 years, the vote today was a milestone in advancing their principles of lower taxes and smaller government.
"Spending got out of hand in the last couple of years," said Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant Republican leader, and the budget measure allows taxpayers to "keep some of their own money."
"It doesn't just benefit the rich," Mr. Nickles said. "It benefits taxpayers."
Democrats who think otherwise, he added, are committing "class war demagoguery."
Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Budget Committee, put the Republican philosophy succinctly.
"This is a budget for prosperity now and prosperity in the future," Mr. Domenici said. "For America to prosper, we have to have low taxes."
The credit for the victory, he said, belongs to the president.
"You have made us change direction," he said, addressing Mr. Bush directly from the well of the Senate. "You have moved us in the direction of giving back taxes to the American people."
Democrats countered that the budget plan was dishonest and reckless. They accused Republicans of repeating the mistakes of 1981, Ronald Reagan's first year as president, when taxes were slashed, military spending was increased and the budget deficit mushroomed.
Using charts as visual aids, Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee, listed six reasons why he said the plan was disastrous.
In Mr. Conrad's view, the plan has insufficient money for education, allows unaffordable tax cuts, does not count the large increase in military spending Congress is sure to pass, raids the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, lowers spending for domestic needs and fails to set aside money for overhauling the Social Security and Medicare programs.
"This budget is unreal," he said. "This budget is irresponsible."

HEADLINE: Myanmar's Incorrigible Leaders 

 BODY:
A few months ago it looked as if the military junta in Myanmar might ease its repressive rule slightly. The regime was talking with the country's courageous pro-democracy leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and there even seemed to be a possibility that she would be liberated from the prolonged house arrest the government has enforced. But those hopes have all but vanished. If the Bush administration means to speak out against human rights abuses abroad and pressure governments to treat their citizens humanely, Myanmar would be a fine place to start. 
 The military leaders of Myanmar, formerly called Burma, are among the world's cruelest violators of human rights. The junta has tortured and executed political opponents, exploited forced labor and condoned a burgeoning traffic in heroin and amphetamines. In the clearest indication that the regime has little intention of reforming, the United Nations special envoy who acted as a catalyst for the talks between the government and Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has been denied permission to visit the country since January. Also, an anticipated release of political prisoners has failed to materialize, as has a pledge by the junta that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, would be allowed to resume activity. 
 Earlier this year the junta released 120 mostly youthful members of the party who had been imprisoned the previous year, but it is still believed to be holding as many as 1,700 political prisoners, including 35 people who were elected to Parliament in 1990. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's party won more than three-quarters of the seats in that election, but the junta annulled the results. 
The United States and the European Union have cooperated to isolate Myanmar, and in 1997 the Clinton administration banned new American investments there. But some Asian countries have been reluctant to join in sanctions. China, in particular, has helped sustain the junta with military aid. Regrettably, last month Japan broke ranks with a Western-led 12-year ban on non-humanitarian assistance to Myanmar by approving a $29 million grant for a hydroelectric dam. 
Last year the International Labor Organization, responding to concerns about forced labor, voted to urge governments and international donors to impose further sanctions on Myanmar. Washington should consider a ban on imports from that nation, including textiles. Myanmar is rapidly increasing apparel exports to the United States. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's allies have argued that the hard-currency earnings primarily benefit the military, not the laborers who make the garments. Washington should certainly be using its influence with Japan and other Asian countries to deter any further non-humanitarian assistance.

DOW CHEMICAL SAYS IT WILL INCREASE DIVIDEND 15.5%

BYLINE:  Dow Jones 

 BODY:
 The Dow Chemical Company said yesterday that it would increase its dividend 15.5 percent. 
A quarterly dividend of 33.5 cents, up from 29 cents, will be paid July 30 to shareholders of record as of June 29. Last month, Dow Chemical, based in Midland, Mich., reported a first-quarter loss of $685 million, or 76 cents a share, as higher energy costs and a slowing economy hurt chemical companies' profits. Excluding a $1.4 billion pretax charge related to its February acquisition of the Union Carbide Corporation, Dow would have earned 8 cents a share.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Japan Says The Economy Is Worsening

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 11 

 BODY:
The Japanese government lowered its assessment of the economy's health today for the fourth consecutive month, citing falling production, bloated inventories, declining prices and weak employment trends.
 The outlook underscores the significant economic challenges that face Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's new administration and suggests that the political challenges in devising a resolution to Japan's longstanding economic woes will be daunting. 
 "We're getting an intensification of a hard landing in Japan," said Jesper Koll, chief economist at Merrill Lynch here. 
On Thursday, the government reported that wholesale prices dropped 0.7 percent, the sharpest decline in 19 months, which suggests that deflation is quickening. Mr. Koizumi's advocacy of stringent structural reforms is only likely to exacerbate that.
"Economic conditions have weakened since April," said Heizo Takenaka, the new minister for economic policy.
The cabinet office blamed the deceleration in the United States economy for a loss in Japanese exports. It said that supplies of electronic components like semiconductors had risen and that industrial production was slowing in response.
Core machinery orders, a measure of capital spending, dropped 3.6 percent in March from the previous month, the government said today. Machinery orders for the first quarter were down 7 percent from the previous quarter, the first decrease in almost two years.
Overtime and job offers are also diminishing, factors that can be expected to deepen deflation. The government did not revise its expectations for consumer spending, which accounts for more than 60 percent of economic activity in Japan, but the prospect of weakening employment will almost certainly put a crimp in consumer purchasing power.
"It is difficult to expect that consumption will pick up the slack when capital spending falters," said Haruhito Arai, a cabinet office official.
The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recently warned that Japan was increasingly at risk of slipping into a downward economic spiral. The group, made up of 30 market-oriented nations, forecasts Japanese growth of 1 percent this year, although the government's official forecast stands at 1.7 percent.
Mr. Takenaka, the economic policy minister, has repeatedly said that the forecast is too optimistic, but he has yet to revise it. 
Still, Mr. Koll and other economists predict that the first-quarter gross domestic product figures, to be released next month, will be strong. The first quarter is traditionally a good one in Japan, and consumption in particular is expected to show strong gains, as buyers have hurried to replace old appliances before a new law took effect that made the disposal of such items expensive.

HEADLINE: A Match Not Made in Heaven; 
How a Rabbi's Foray Into Online Dating Ended Up in Court

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN 

 BODY:
Rabbi Shmuley Boteach just wanted to bring Jewish men and women together -- and if he could get rich in the Internet boom, all the better.
 So when Rabbi Boteach, the Hasidic author of "Kosher Sex" and "Dating Secrets of the Ten Commandments," was introduced early last year to the Israeli founders of an online dating venture that was about to go public, it seemed like a match made in heaven. 
 But like so many dates arranged by mating services, the rabbi's ended in bitter disappointment. Rather than serving as the well-paid matchmaker in chief for MatchNet.com, Rabbi Boteach -- who counts Michael Jackson as a friend (they were introduced by the spoon-bending psychic Uri Geller) and has had his Talmud-inspired writings serialized in Playboy -- is suing the company and its founders in federal court in Los Angeles for fraud and breach of contract.
His lawsuit is just a taste of the conflict that swirls around MatchNet. The intrigue stretches from Beverly Hills to Israel to the German stock market. The characters include a phone sex entrepreneur, the former convict who took control of his business and a disbarred lawyer obsessed with exposing the underbelly of the online dating industry. 
"It was a short, awful experience," Rabbi Boteach, 34, said recently of his dealings with the company.
That seems, roughly, to be the attitude of everyone involved. MatchNet moved in early March to dismiss Rabbi Boteach's lawsuit, denying all the accusations. Its chief executive, Joe Shapira, pledges to fight the case to a conclusion. 
"Most businessmen would settle these claims, but we're Israelis," said Mr. Shapira, who founded MatchNet in 1998 with a partner, Alon Carmel, now the company's president. "We want justice. I don't want to pay someone that I don't owe anything. I put my faith in the justice system."
The clash between odd bedfellows is a parable for the Internet bubble, when money lust seemed universal and newly minted companies were racing to lay claims to eyeballs and investors' dollars. 
And MatchNet, while no eBay or Amazon.com, is not a negligible presence in its corner of the Web. The company claims three million members around the world. One of its sites, Americansingles.com, is among the 10-most-visited Web dating sites, according to Jupiter Media Metrix. Jdate.com, MatchNet's Jewish dating site, says that one of every 10 Jewish singles in the United States uses it and that the site has been responsible for 300 marriages in its four years of operation.
But that is getting ahead of the story.
In March 2000, according to Rabbi Boteach's lawsuit, he entered into a written agreement with MatchNet to serve as its spokesman for three years, at an annual salary of $216,000. He was to receive 250,000 stock options in MatchNet, a British corporation with headquarters in Beverly Hills, Calif., that was preparing to sell stock on the Neuer Markt in Frankfurt, the German hub of the Internet boom.
There was also an understanding, the lawsuit says, that Rabbi Boteach would become part-owner of an affiliated company to develop and sell content related to relationships and spirituality, including a "loveprophet" Web site he had already developed.
Those promises, and others, were broken, the suit contends. It also accuses MatchNet of besmirching Rabbi Boteach's reputation -- and exaggerating its own popularity -- by wiring its dating Web sites to count as users people who were actually visiting pornographic sites. 
This last assertion, according to Rabbi Boteach, was based largely on information he received unsolicited from a stranger, Daniel Nicherie, the former convict in this yarn.
Last summer, at a lecture Rabbi Boteach was giving in Santa Monica, Calif., Mr. Nicherie introduced himself as an Israeli investment banker with information about MatchNet. Later, Mr. Nicherie told the rabbi that Mr. Carmel and Mr. Shapira were pornographers who had been sued nearly 40 times.
The latter was true, or close to it; individually, or together, the two men -- like many active business executives -- have been sued repeatedly over various financial disputes. The claim that they were pornographers is something that the men vociferously deny.
"I have never done anything that I cannot tell my children," Mr. Shapira said.
There was an unfortunate occasion when the pair's Israeli videocassette manufacturing company, Matrix Video Duplication, shipped copies of a program called "The Best Christmas Pageant Ever" recorded imperfectly over old sex tapes, with telltale scenes left behind. That was an aberration, Mr. Shapira said. "Matrix Video's main business was children's videos," he said. "We were working with Betty Boop, Dr. Seuss, Popeye." 
In any event, Mr. Nicherie did not volunteer to Rabbi Boteach details of his own resume, which included a conviction on federal bank fraud charges in 1994, followed by a year in prison. Nor did he tell Rabbi Boteach about the feud brewing between himself and another Israeli entrepreneur, Ami Shafrir, who played a critical role in MatchNet's early development.
When MatchNet's founders could not secure an arrangement with a bank to process credit card transactions for the company's Web sites, it used -- for what MatchNet's prospectus calls "a small fee" -- the account of a company jointly owned by Mr. Shafrir. Another of his companies was MatchNet's Internet service provider. And Mr. Shafrir and his wife, Sarit, were MatchNet's landlords in a granite- and glass-clad building on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills.
The heart of Mr. Shafrir's business empire was another company with headquarters in the Wilshire Boulevard building: Amtec Audiotext, an operator of telephone sex lines that he says generated revenue of $60 million in its best year, 1995.
Late in 1999, Mr. Nicherie happened into the Shafrirs' circle. About the same time -- and just months before the MatchNet stock offering on which Rabbi Boteach was counting for his Internet payday -- the Shafrirs' pending divorce, till then amicable, grew ugly. Mr. Nicherie took Mrs. Shafrir's side in the split, and the two men went to war.
In January 2000, Mr. Shafrir says, he was barred from the Wilshire Boulevard building by armed guards hired by his wife and Mr. Nicherie. Mrs. Shafrir took control of Amtec. Her husband says that she installed Mr. Nicherie at the head of the company; lawyers for Mr. Nicherie and Mrs. Shafrir, trying on his behalf to encourage a criminal investigation of Mr. Shafrir, told federal prosecutors the same thing, though they now say Mr. Nicherie was only a consultant.
This, roughly, is when the disbarred lawyer came into the picture. In the spring of 2000, Rabbi Boteach -- back home in Englewood, N.J., oblivious to the behind-the-scenes tumult at MatchNet -- received an e-mail message from the lawyer, Will Knedlik. Mr. Knedlik, who lives near Seattle, echoed Mr. Nicherie's accusations about pornography and added various financial high jinks to the catalog of MatchNet's supposed misconduct.
A onetime tax lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor of Washington State in the early 1970's, Mr. Knedlik is an alumnus -- and self-appointed scourge -- of the online dating industry. In 1999, his partners sold their stakes in a company that ran two dating sites to Mr. Carmel and Mr. Shapira, giving them the properties that would form the core of MatchNet. Mr. Knedlik voted against selling, demanded shares in MatchNet instead of cash and, and when Mr. Shapira and Mr. Carmel refused, sued the company in a Los Angeles court. Litigation over the matter is pending.
His tenacity in such fights is indisputable. He takes pride, for example, in the role he played a few years ago in pushing a Boston-based dating company called the Together Development Corporation into bankruptcy -- though that campaign was one of the episodes that led in January 2000 to his disbarment in Washington State. 
A court there ruled that his behavior in that case and others had included "bringing several frivolous claims; contacting represented parties directly; using litigation to embarrass, delay or burden third parties; and failing to diligently represent a client." Mr. Knedlik said his offense was "telling the truth."
A year ago, escalating his dispute with MatchNet's owners, he forged an alliance with Mr. Nicherie and Mrs. Shafrir. On June 26, the day before MatchNet was scheduled to sell shares on the Neuer Markt in Frankfurt, they forced the company into involuntary bankruptcy in Los Angeles. 
"They went from I.P.O. to bankruptcy in 24 minutes," Mr. Knedlik said recently, with more than a trace of glee. To get out, MatchNet placed $900,000 in escrow in the Los Angeles County Superior Court, where it remains today. The share sale proceeded on schedule in Germany, with the company selling three million shares at a little less than $8 each, raising $23.8 million.
Shortly after the stock sale, according to Rabbi Boteach's lawsuit, he was asked to relinquish his duties as MatchNet's primary spokesman. The rabbi was invited, the suit says, to stay on as spokesman for Jdate, but at a significantly lower salary. 
When he refused to renegotiate his deal with MatchNet's owners, Rabbi Boteach says, he was fired last September -- just before his stock options were going to vest. His lawsuit contends that MatchNet had used him to add "legitimacy" to its stock offering and never intended to make good on its promises.
Mr. Shapira said there was no ill will in MatchNet's dealings with the rabbi. "We employed him, it didn't work out; we paid him the last penny," he said. "I didn't marry the guy. I just employed him."
Amid a sea of dot-com failures, MatchNet has survived, bobbing along with investor sentiment. 
The shares jumped 13 percent in January when a German company that sells an audio version of the Bible issued a news release saying it would try to take over MatchNet; the offer never materialized. MatchNet rose 18 percent one day in March on a report that it expected to show a profit this year after acquiring a rival and doubling membership in its online services. Even so, the stock now trades for about $1.10. 
Mr. Knedlik spent five days in the Los Angeles County Jail last December after being held in civil contempt of court for ignoring a judge's order not to comment on the case. On March 12, he was sentenced to another 140 days in jail on the same ground and ordered to pay MatchNet $80,000 in damages. For now, Mr. Knedlik remains in the Seattle area; he said this week that he had not been served with any papers ordering him back to jail.
In February, Mr. Shafrir filed a federal racketeering lawsuit against Mr. Nicherie in federal court in Los Angeles. He claims that Mr. Nicherie has run Amtec into the ground.
Mr. Nicherie's lawyer, David A. Katz, responded, "We obviously strenuously disagree with that, and there is no factual basis for it."
As for Rabbi Boteach, he is still looking for ways to supplement his income. His latest book, "Why Can't I Fall in Love?," is due in stores from the HarperCollins division of the News Corporation on May 22. And he dreams of acquiring Jdate and going back into the Internet matchmaking business.
"Ideally, I'd love to get a group of investors and buy it," the rabbi said. "It would allow me to do what I love doing, and feed my family."

HEADLINE: Consumers Still Spending With Gusto 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Despite job cuts and constant reminders of a slowing economy, consumers have continued to spend with surprising resilience and may continue to do so, two reports suggested yesterday.
 Retail sales rose 0.8 percent in April, according to the Commerce Department, much more than forecast and the biggest gain in three months. The increase was led by automobiles, without which sales climbed 0.7 percent. 
 Also, a closely watched gauge of consumer sentiment rose unexpectedly, ending a long slide that began last year. 
Some economists said the data indicated that the Federal Reserve had accomplished its short-term goal of propping up consumer spending to carry the economy through its slowdown. But others said Americans had been acting on a blind faith, one that is slowly eroding in a manner that has tricked the economic barometers.
"The consumer is, I think, in somewhat slow-deterioration mode which doesn't show up month to month," said David Levy, vice chairman of the Levy Institute Forecasting Center in Mount Kisco, N.Y. "Consumers have an enormous pile of debt."
Many economists have predicted that soaring energy prices, slumping manufacturing, imploding demand for high-technology equipment, falling stock prices and bloated inventories would cause Americans to put off purchases and maybe even start saving some money.
Instead, they have continued to make purchases. The gain in consumer spending in April, which came after a 0.4 percent decrease in March, was paced by purchases of spring clothing, barbecue grills and gardening equipment. Americans also bought more cars and trucks, an increase of 1 percent in April after a 0.2 percent decline in March.
But some economists questioned the true strength of the numbers.
Some purchases were postponed because of an unseasonably cold and rainy March, they said, and the gain in spending on building materials and gardening supplies, 1.5 percent, was distorted by sales to construction companies and to people who got a late start on outdoor projects. And the surge in auto purchases, some economists suggested, came in part because of deep discounts from carmakers. Rising gasoline prices also increased the value of goods sold.
Despite those caveats, consumer confidence appeared to be rising. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, which has become more closely watched since Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, referred to consumer sentiment in testimony earlier this year, jumped to 92.6 in May from 88.4 in April. 
"It gives a sense that consumers are feeling a little more confident and quite willing to dip into their pockets," said Oscar E. Gonzalez, an economist at John Hancock Financial Services. While that feeling was part of what the Fed hoped to accomplish by cutting interest rates four times this year, "I think that capital spending is what Mr. Greenspan would like to see." The Fed is widely expected to cut rates again at its meeting next week.
Whether consumers can carry the economy until corporations regain their footing elicited some debate, but economists first questioned how confident consumers felt.
The Michigan report was an improvement over April's number, the worst since November 1995, when it was 88.2. In July, the index, which is based on a telephone survey of about 300 people, was 108.3. 
"I would describe the upturn as precarious, mostly grounded in hope rather than fact," said Jade Zelnick, chief economist at Greenwich Capital Markets. "Lower interest rates and higher stock prices are helping to boost optimism, particularly in high-income families. At the same time, two-thirds think the economy is still in decline."
More optimistic economists acknowledged that while the gains in confidence and spending might not be as strong as they appeared, they still provided a basis for growth later on. "The fact that consumption is holding up -- I'm not asking for it to have a boom -- sets a tone for a recovery in the second half," said Kathleen Stephansen, director of economic research for Credit Suisse First Boston.
The Labor Department also reported yesterday that wholesale prices for finished goods rose 0.3 percent in April after a 0.1 percent decline in March. The Producer Price Index soared 1.1 percent in January, and the more recent signs that inflation is under control have eased the Fed's path.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Shares Slip on Fears That Fed's Rate Cuts Will Soon End

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday after reports of unexpected strength in retail sales and consumer confidence convinced some investors that the Federal Reserve would not reduce interest rates as aggressively as expected.
 General Electric and Intel led the decline, while the New York Stock Exchange had its slowest day this year. All three major gauges had a losing week for the first time since April 6. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 89.13 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,821.31, led by I.B.M., after a Bear, Stearns analyst said the company's 30 percent rise in the last six weeks made further gains unlikely. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 9.51 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,245.67. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 21.43 points, or 1 percent, to 2,107.43.
For the week, the Nasdaq declined 3.8 percent, the S.& P. 500 fell 1.7 percent and the Dow dropped 1.2 percent.
The reports released yesterday that retail sales rose 0.8 percent in April and consumer confidence rose to its highest level in four months suggested that people are not feeling the pinch of a slowing economy and rising unemployment. That may persuade the Fed to hold off on additional rate cuts after a widely anticipated reduction next week.
"The primary concern is what do any new data mean" for future Fed actions, said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. Stocks' biggest gains this year were incited by surprise rate cuts on Jan. 3 and April 18.
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday on the stronger-than-expected economic reports. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 14/32, to 96 20/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.45 percent from 5.30 percent on Thursday. The 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 9/32, to 93 10/32. Its yield rose to 5.85 percent from 5.76 percent on Thursday.
Four stocks fell for every three that rose on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Some 894 million shares traded on the Big Board -- the fewest since Dec. 26.
I.B.M. fell $3.39, to $111.81, after Andrew J. Neff, a Bear Stearns analyst, said the stock might not gain much more this year. I.B.M.'s profit growth will be less robust in the second half of the year because earnings a year ago were so strong, said Mr. Neff, who cut his rating of the stock to attractive from buy.
I.B.M. executives met with analysts yesterday and did not offer any new financial forecasts.
Software stocks fell, making them the biggest drag on the S.& P. 500. Microsoft declined 60 cents, to $69.40; Oracle dropped 49 cents, to $15.90; and BMC Software slid $1.29, to $22.17.
Intel, the biggest semiconductor maker, lost $1.07, to $27.94. G.E., the largest company by market value, fell 82 cents, to $49.01.
American General, the life insurer, gained 48 cents, to $45.10. American International Group, the financial services concern, said yesterday that it would buy American General for about $23 billion in stock, or $46 a share. American International's offer topped a bid from Prudential P.L.C. of Britain. American International fell 90 cents, to $82.10.
PG&E, owner of the largest electric utility in California, rose $1.48, to $10.58, and Edison International, owner of the No. 2 utility in the state gained $1.30, to $10.21.
Gov. Gray Davis of California signed a bill on Thursday allowing the state to issue $13.4 billion in bonds to buy electricity. The state is buying power for the utilities, which have run up $14 billion in debt because wholesale power prices have outstripped the rates they can charge retail customers.
Schering-Plough rose $1.20, or 3.2 percent, to $38.30, after Business Week, citing an unidentified investment banker, said Merck had offered $91 billion in stock to buy Schering-Plough.
Schering-Plough had gained as much as 7.3 percent, but pared that gain after a Food and Drug Administration panel said the company's Claritin prescription allergy drug is safe enough to be sold over the counter. Insurers want the drug to be sold without a prescription, but Schering-Plough opposes the move.
World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc. gained $1.04, to $14.19, after it canceled the XFL football league less than a month after its first season ended. The W.W.F. said the league, which it co-owned with the NBC television network unit of General Electric, would have a loss of about $35 million.

HEADLINE: Top Executive Stepping Down At Audit Firm 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
James J. Schiro, the chief executive of the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, announced unexpectedly in Paris yesterday that he planned to step down as soon as a successor was found.
 Mr. Schiro did not offer a reason and was unavailable for comment, the firm said. 
 Mr. Schiro, 55, oversaw the merger of Price Waterhouse with Coopers & Lybrand in 1998, one of the biggest mergers in the professional services industry. More recently, he was instrumental in persuading accountants to negotiate new rules governing auditors' independence from their clients with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
However, Mr. Schiro presided over an embarrassing scandal involving the independence issue after the S.E.C. issued a report in January 2000 regarding the investments held by PricewaterhouseCoopers partners in companies that the firm was auditing. He also oversaw a failed attempt to sell the firm's consulting arm to Hewlett-Packard last fall, a deal that would have taken care of at least some independence concerns by separating consulting from auditing. 
The most recent bad news came last week when the firm announced a settlement of $51 million with shareholders of MicroStrategy who contended that the accounting firm conducted a flawed audit. And there is speculation in the industry that the economic slowdown has hurt the company's finances.
"There are problems inside this firm," said Arthur W. Bowman, editor of Bowman's Accounting Report. "They still haven't gotten it together" since the merger, he said.
No successor to Mr. Schiro is likely to be named for several months, the company said, because the partners will have to approve a new chief executive. Mr. Schiro was on a plane to New York yesterday and was unavailable for comment.
The announcement from Mr. Schiro surprised partners at PricewaterhouseCoopers, which held a meeting of a group of senior partners in Paris this week, said Peter Horowitz, a spokesman for the firm. But Mr. Horowitz said the firm's restructuring plan would not be affected by Mr. Schiro's departure.
"It puts nothing on hold," he said. Currently, he said, revenue is growing 8 percent to 10 percent, compared with 13 percent last year. The firm had revenue of $21.5 billion in 2000.
PricewaterhouseCoopers is still trying to sell or spin off its consulting arm, which announced layoffs of about 8 percent of its consultants in the United States last month.
"If there's a black mark on the Schiro legacy, it's the faltering strategy" to deal with the consulting business, Mr. Bowman said. 
Mr. Schiro's success, analysts say, resulted from his willingness to seek middle ground between accountants and the S.E.C. Arthur Levitt, the commission chairman in the Clinton administration, voiced concern about the independence of accountants who audit corporations' books.
The problem Mr. Levitt sought to address was the conflict of interest created by auditors' excessive involvement with clients. Accountants who hold stock in a client, for example, would be less likely to criticize that client because doing so would depress the stock's value.
Another concern involved accountants who also provided consulting services to clients. The concern is that an auditing firm, hoping to keep serving the client in both capacities, would be reluctant to criticize a company, especially for following advice given by the firm's own consultants.
The accounting industry generally opposed new regulations on auditor independence, but PricewaterhouseCoopers was one of a few firms that took a less combative approach.
"Where Schiro was important was, even though the rhetoric was so heated on both sides of the issue, he and the people at Ernst & Young were sensible enough to know that they had to find a middle ground," Mr. Bowman said. The move paid off because the rules that were ultimately adopted were relatively lenient, Mr. Bowman added.
"Both firms agreed that a compromise was in the best interests of everybody," said Philip A. Laskawy, chairman of Ernst & Young. He said that he and Mr. Schiro worked together to develop a compromise with the S.E.C. "The rule, even though it has its shortcomings over all, is a rule the profession can live with."
The issue of auditor independence was largely driven by reports that partners in PricewaterhouseCoopers owned stock in clients of the firm's audit services. The reports embarrassed the firm and led to investigations at other firms to determine whether accountants were violating independence rules.

HEADLINE: Panel Says 3 Allergy Drugs Should Be Sold Over the Counter 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
A proposal to make the three most popular and expensive allergy drugs available without a prescription won strong support yesterday from a government medical advisory panel.
 The panel voted overwhelmingly to advise the Food and Drug Administration that Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec were just as safe as many nonprescription allergy medications that have long been sold in drugstores and supermarkets. 
 The decision was a setback for the makers of the drugs, which advertise heavily and sell millions of pills for a total of $5 billion a year. It was a victory for the health insurance industry, which passes on a large portion of the cost to consumers and employers in insurance premiums and out-of-pocket payments. 
Surging use of effective but costly new drugs has been a primary cause of the double-digit rise in health care costs. 
Industry executives said they would pursue the fight over allergy drugs inside the Bush administration, which has not yet appointed a commissioner of the F.D.A. They said the issue was also likely to come up in Senate hearings when the president does appoint a commissioner.
"We are disappointed, but we are sure this is not a done deal," said Dr. Francois Nader, a senior vice president of Aventis S.A., which makes Allegra. "The next step is for the F.D.A. to look at all the reservations and comments presented by the panel" and witnesses. 
Dr. Robert Seidman, chief pharmacy officer of Wellpoint Health Networks, which brought the issue to the F.D.A., said the recommendations were "history making."
But Schering-Plough said in a statement that the panel's 19-to-4 vote on Claritin, its top-selling allergy drug, was "a nonbinding recommendation." The vote margin was similar for the other two drugs. Dr. Robert J. Spiegel, chief medical officer of Schering-Plough, said "the prescription status of these medications is necessary to protect and optimize public health."
Pfizer Inc., which makes Zyrtec, boycotted the meeting and refused to say why. "We are exploring our options," a Pfizer spokeswoman said last night.
The issue has provoked a battle with few heroes, said Ira A. Loss, an analyst with Washington Analysis, which monitors federal agencies for investors. "Wellpoint has a clear vested interest in getting the cost of the drugs off their books," he said. "The drug companies are against it. And the doctors don't like the idea that the number of office visits might fall. It's hard to find an honest broker in the whole deal."
Some panel members said that if approved for general sale, the drugs should carry warnings to elderly patients and parents of young children to consult a doctor about their use.
Critics of over-the-counter sales warned that symptoms associated with allergies might actually be asthma, a more serious condition that a doctor would recognize. But the manufacturers were unable to produce data showing that this confusion had caused widespread problems with the many nonprescription allergy drugs already in stores. 
Some panel members contended that the F.D.A. should review and re-evaluate the existing nonprescription drugs. But the drug companies found it difficult to argue that their products were not safe, with or without a prescription. If the safety of any drug was in doubt, federal officials told the panel, its approval for sale would be swiftly revoked. 
The manufacturers advertise that the three drugs are vastly superior to older remedies because they do not cause drowsiness. The companies spend millions of dollars each year to take their message directly to consumers. "All that direct-to-consumer advertising came back to bite them," said Barbara A. Ryan, a health care securities analyst at Deutsche Bank. 
Steve Francisco, a drug industry consultant, and editor of Switch, a newsletter, said Claritin accounted for 56 cents of Schering's earnings of $1.63 a share last year. "If they were forced to switch, that would go to 6 cents and there would be a huge hit in the price of the stock," he said. "It could result in a takeover."
The current price of Claritin is about $2.13 a pill, or $192 for 90 pills, in the United States. In Canada, where it is already available over the counter, it can be purchased for about 70 cents a pill before taxes.
Shares of Schering-Plough rose $1.20, to $38.30, yesterday after Business Week said that Merck & Company was seeking a merger. Both companies declined to discuss the report.
But most analysts said they doubted the F.D.A. had the legal authority to force the companies to change the status of the drugs. They expect the companies to defend their products in court, and the cases could last for years until the drugs lose the patent protection that makes their high prices possible.
Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, an economist who specializes in pharmaceutical issues at the University of Minnesota, said: "There are a lot of land mines in the politics of this. The law says the F.D.A. should give preference to making drugs over-the-counter products if they can be shown to be safe and appropriately used. But it has never been implemented that way. Selling over the counter has always been left to the discretion of the drug companies."
Proponents of the change pointed to Canada, Germany, Britain and other countries where Claritin has been sold without prescriptions for more than a decade at much lower prices. "Is the industry saying that American consumers are not as wise in using medicine as consumers in Canada or Mexico or England?" Dr. Schondelmeyer asked.

HEADLINE: FRIENDSHIP OF CONVENIENCE: A special report.; 
Pursuit of Cash and Influence Linked Torricelli and a Donor

BYLINE:  By TIM GOLDEN and DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: ENGLEWOOD, N.J. May 11

 BODY:
Even by the freewheeling standards of Washington fund-raising, Bob Torricelli and David Chang made the oddest of couples.
 Mr. Torricelli, the articulate, ambitious Democratic senator from New Jersey, prides himself on the sophisticated company he keeps. His supporters have included Calvin Klein and Donald Trump; Bianca Jagger was once his girlfriend. There is no way he would rather spend a Sunday morning, some of his aides say, than talking foreign policy on a television news program. 
 Mr. Chang, a Korean-American businessman, is known for dropping the names of famous people he has never met. He has enough difficulty with English that Mr. Torricelli complained he was unintelligible. His behavior is eccentric enough that his own lobbyists sometimes tried to shield him from government officials, lest he say something off-the-wall. 
Yet for several years in the late 1990's, Mr. Torricelli and Mr. Chang shared a close relationship, forged of Mr. Chang's need for political influence and Mr. Torricelli's need for political cash. They got together on weekends. They talked frequently on the telephone. They did each other favors.
Now, the nature of that relationship and the terms of those favors have emerged as central issues in a wide-ranging federal investigation into the activities of Senator Torricelli, some of his political supporters and a few current and former members of his staff.
A close examination of the ties between Mr. Torricelli and Mr. Chang, based on campaign documents, court filings and interviews, suggests that while they did share a kind of friendship, it was complex and contradictory -- and opportunistic even for a political world that has long anguished over the power of wealthy contributors.
Initially, people who know both men said, Mr. Torricelli treated Mr. Chang as a prize catch. During his 1996 campaign, he courted the businessman attentively, inviting him to high-profile fund-raising events and trying to help Mr. Chang with his most urgent business problem, a $71 million debt owed to him by the North Korean government. Hoping to win further help, Mr. Chang has told the authorities, he lavished the politician with gifts and cash.
Mr. Torricelli has denied doing anything illegal or improper in his contacts with Mr. Chang. But as the relationship wore on, Mr. Torricelli sometimes hid those contacts almost as a married man might hide a mistress, people involved in the case said.
While the senator's aides sometimes whispered about Mr. Chang, few ever met him or spoke to him. He and Mr. Torricelli generally met alone, according to Mr. Chang and some of his former employees, on weekends at the senator's Englewood home.
Mr. Torricelli continued to do political favors for Mr. Chang, acting as a reference with important business contacts and helping him to meet with Clinton administration officials. At times, though, Mr. Chang was told to contact Mr. Torricelli through a discreet back channel by sending unaddressed memorandums to the senator's former wife, Susan Holloway Torricelli, a political consultant who often works for him, one of Mr. Chang's former employees said.
As federal prosecutors pressed their case against Mr. Chang in 1999, Mr. Torricelli grew more careful still. According to Mr. Chang's account, Mr. Torricelli remained outwardly solicitous and even invited Mr. Chang to an intimate Thanksgiving dinner only weeks after Mr. Chang's offices were raided by federal agents.
At the same time, Mr. Torricelli kept a close watch on Mr. Chang's legal troubles, speaking frequently with a defense lawyer whom Mr. Chang said he hired at the senator's urging. According to Mr. Chang and two former associates, both Mr. Torricelli and the lawyer strongly discouraged him from cooperating with the government -- something both men now deny.
According to people involved in the federal investigation, prosecutors are focusing in large part on allegations that Mr. Torricelli took tens of thousands of dollars in unreported gifts and cash from Mr. Chang between 1996 and 1999. The prosecutors are also looking at Mr. Torricelli's efforts to help Mr. Chang with business deals, and at indications that the senator's supporters may have tried to thwart the inquiry.
Mr. Torricelli has not denied taking gifts or cash. Rather, he has said he never took "illegal" gifts, refusing to discuss specific allegations and attacking the credibility of Mr. Chang, who has been cooperating with prosecutors in return for leniency. Mr. Torricelli has also said pointedly that he once considered Mr. Chang a friend; federal laws that bar public officials from accepting expensive gifts make a partial exception for gifts received from personal friends.
But only a few months ago, Mr. Torricelli was still sometimes describing Mr. Chang as a supporter like so many others, a man he did not much help and never really knew. Mr. Torricelli said he was shocked when Mr. Chang pleaded guilty last June to making illegal campaign donations and obstructing justice and turned out to have wildly exaggerated his image as a dynamic global entrepreneur. But he was quick to suggest that people like David Chang were an occupational hazard of big-money politics.
"You end up meeting a group of people that, otherwise in your life, you'd never know, never want to know, never meet, and David Chang would go in that category," he told CNBC's Chris Matthews.
A lawyer for Mr. Torricelli, Ted Wells, would not discuss details of Mr. Torricelli's relationship with Mr. Chang yesterday, but said, "The assistance given David Chang was of the type commonly provided by members of Congress to their constituents."
A lawyer for Mr. Chang, Bradley D. Simon, declined to discuss his client's dealings with the senator, but he asserted in earlier comments that the senator's attacks on Mr. Chang were at odds with the relationship the men shared in the past.
"Bob Torricelli didn't seem to think David Chang was such a liar when he was taking his money," Mr. Simon said. "It is obviously in Torricelli's interest now to discredit David at any cost, but the truth of what happened is going to come out in due time."

An Unclear Beginning

Tracing the History Of a Relationship
In interviews and public statements, Mr. Torricelli and his aides have been vague about how he and Mr. Chang met, saying they probably contacted him after finding his name on a Democratic fund-raising list. But the detailed account that Mr. Chang has given to investigators, as well as other evidence, indicates that each man's agenda was clear from the start.
Throughout the early 1990's, Mr. Chang was a strong supporter of Republicans, and in 1991, he prevailed on the Bush administration to waive American trade sanctions so that he could sell grain to North Korea. 
The arrangement was at first profitable, but by 1994, Mr. Chang claimed to be owed some $71 million, records show. Eventually, he obtained a letter from North Korea assigning him about $15 million in assets frozen by the United States, one of his former associates said. But the Clinton administration was unmoved, saying the funds were not North Korea's to assign.
Mr. Chang said he sought help from one of his New Jersey lawyers, Berek P. Don, a former Bergen County Republican chairman. He said Mr. Don pointed him to Mr. Torricelli, then his local congressman and a ranking member of the House International Relations Committee.
By Mr. Chang's account, which one of Mr. Torricelli's lawyers disputed, Mr. Don introduced the two men in the summer of 1995 at the Hilton hotel in Fort Lee, N.J., which Mr. Chang bought two years earlier. Mr. Chang said he laid out his problem to Mr. Torricelli, who promised to try to help. But he said Mr. Torricelli asked for some help in return.
"Bob said, 'Can you help my campaign?' " one person familiar with Mr. Chang's account quoted him as telling investigators.
For Mr. Torricelli, the North Korean matter was a tricky one. He had made a name for himself, and attracted big political contributions, as the most visible Democratic advocate of economic sanctions against Cuba.
At the same time, he was preparing for what was expected to be an unusually tough Senate race. Mr. Chang, who claimed to be the son-in-law of powerful industrialists in Japan, seemed to have deep pockets and a willingness to help, aides to Mr. Torricelli said. 
On Sept. 22, 1995, the congressman wrote to North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations urging his government to pay up and offering to meet at any time. Mr. Torricelli did not wait to call in the chit: on Sept. 26, he sent a senior aide, Georgianna Evans, to meet with the businessman about being the host of a fund-raising event. Mr. Chang had asked to meet with Mr. Torricelli himself, but the congressman, who found Mr. Chang's English difficult to understand, demurred.
"Bob said: 'Why don't you have lunch with him? Maybe you can figure out what he's saying,' " recalled Ms. Evans, who left the campaign in a dispute soon thereafter.
Mr. Chang had no experience soliciting contributions, but agreed to try. On Dec. 14, he gathered a small group of employees and friends on the top floor of the Fort Lee Hilton. They had drinks, listened to remarks by Mr. Torricelli and wrote $21,000 in checks -- which Mr. Chang illegally reimbursed.
Mr. Torricelli's chief of staff, Eric B. Shuffler, said in an interview last year that while Mr. Chang was named to the campaign's finance committee, he was never in the "inner circle" of Mr. Torricelli's team. "Not in any way, shape or form anything close to that," he said. 
But other campaign staff members said Mr. Chang quickly emerged as a donor who got special attention. 
"Torricelli was always meeting with him or talking with him on the phone," said one former aide. "Torricelli was in with him deep." 
Internal campaign documents leave a similar impression. In a memorandum listing fund-raising events planned for the first four months of 1996, Mr. Chang is at the top, with a goal of $100,000. On a separate list of "non-event fund-raising" expected by March 31, Mr. Chang is listed second, at $50,000. On a third list that June, Mr. Chang is again at the top with a new goal of $60,000.
While Mr. Chang apparently never met those goals, he did spend lavishly on Mr. Torricelli's behalf.
In March, at what he said was Mr. Torricelli's request, Mr. Chang donated $20,000 to the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee and gave the campaign another $5,000 in checks written by some of his employees and associates. On July 18, Mr. Chang wrote an $11,000 check to the law firm of Berek Don, to reimburse checks written by employees of the firm and others. 
In early September, Mr. Torricelli also began flying around New Jersey on private planes that one of Mr. Chang's companies chartered for his campaign.

The Usual Bond

A Friend, Yes, But Not a Close One
As lawyers for Mr. Torricelli described his relationship with Mr. Chang in interviews earlier this year, it was the usual sort of bond between a politician and a supporter.
"They have had some social contact with each other," said one of those lawyers, Robert F. Bauer. "He has been to Bob Torricelli's house. He has had lunch with Bob Torricelli. He has had dinner with Bob Torricelli. It was not a profound social relationship. He was a friend. Was he one of Bob's closest friends? No."
But there is little question that Mr. Chang was a generous friend.
On July 15, 1996, Mr. Chang bought Mr. Torricelli an $8,100 Rolex watch, presenting it shortly after his election victory on Nov. 5, he has told investigators. A few weeks later, Mr. Chang has stated, he began making $9,000 in payments on a new Mercedes-Benz sedan that Mr. Torricelli had pointed out to him. Lawyers for Mr. Torricelli said he had not known about Mr. Chang's payments and ordered them refunded when he learned of them. Then he bought the car himself.
Former associates of Mr. Chang said the candidate led him to believe that his debt problem could be resolved after the election. Two longtime Torricelli supporters said that if he left that impression, he was probably stringing Mr. Chang along.
Mr. Torricelli was sworn in on Jan. 7, 1997, and soon after he became vice chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee -- a rare leadership position for a freshman.
Mr. Torricelli threw himself into the job, and according to several of Mr. Chang's associates, the businessman was occasionally along for the ride, attending big Democratic fund-raising events, sometimes sitting beside the senator.
Soon after Mr. Torricelli joined the campaign committee (he later became chairman), Mr. Chang donated $10,000 to the committee. Over the next two years, he donated nearly $200,000 more to Democratic party causes, either directly, through employees or through his companies.
In spring 1997, Mr. Chang has said, he had his favorite local tailor begin fitting Mr. Torricelli for the first of at least 10 off-the-rack Italian suits. He also said he bought jewelry for Judy D. Balaban, who was then Mr. Torricelli's girlfriend, and an Oriental rug and a large-screen television for Mr. Torricelli's home.
Not long thereafter, Mr. Chang told investigators, Mr. Torricelli called him on a cellular telephone from Lambertville, N.J., a small town on the Pennsylvania border that is a favorite of antique shoppers. The senator had found a 100-year-old grandfather clock that he loved, but it cost more than $4,000. Could his friend help? 
Mr. Chang said he gave Mr. Torricelli cash to cover the cost of the clock. 
Later that year, Mr. Chang has told investigators, he drove Mr. Torricelli into Manhattan to buy Ms. Balaban some earrings. According to two people familiar with Mr. Chang's account, he said Mr. Torricelli insisted on waiting in the car while Mr. Chang went into Tiffany & Company on Fifth Avenue. 
When Mr. Chang could not find the right earrings, the senator asked him to go back in and pick up a set of cuff links for him, these people said.
To what extent Mr. Torricelli reciprocated Mr. Chang's generosity is unclear. But Mr. Torricelli did vouch for Mr. Chang with other politicians.
In late spring 1998, when Mr. Chang approached President Clinton's friend Terry McAuliffe about working for him as a consultant, Mr. McAuliffe called Mr. Torricelli for a reference. "Bob said, 'He's a legitimate person, a legitimate businessman,' " Mr. McAuliffe recalled.
When it came to making contacts with the Clinton administration, former associates of Mr. Chang said, Mr. Torricelli was more circumspect.
In late 1997, at Mr. Torricelli's direction, one of Mr. Chang's former lawyers sent an unaddressed memorandum to the senator through his former wife, Susan Holloway Torricelli, seeking help in setting up a meeting with a senior State Department official, Stanley O. Roth.
In an interview, Mr. Roth said he had granted the meeting to associates of Mr. Chang who were seeking permission to organize zinc mining in North Korea as a way to recoup some of his debt. Mr. Roth also confirmed that he had done so after being contacted by Senator Torricelli or one of his aides, but that he would have granted the meeting anyway because "it sounded like an interesting idea."
Messages left for Ms. Torricelli yesterday asking for comment were not returned.

Growing Problems

Staying in Contact After a Subpoena
As Mr. Chang's legal problems grew more serious in early 1999, Mr. Torricelli remained in close touch. But he also became more discreet, Mr. Chang and some of his former associates said.
Mr. Chang received his first government subpoena on Jan. 23, 1997. At the time, court records show, federal prosecutors were looking into allegations of a fraudulent business deal involving Mr. Chang's former lawyer, Mr. Don.
According to Mr. Chang's account, he quickly told Mr. Torricelli about the January subpoena. But Mr. Torricelli became more involved in Mr. Chang's legal matters after a new federal grand jury was impaneled in Newark on Feb. 5, 1999, to continue the investigation into illegal donations to his campaign.
At a meeting at the Fort Lee Hilton that June, set up by Mr. Torricelli and one of his lawyers, Abbe D. Lowell, Mr. Chang sat down for the first time with the lawyer who would subsequently represent him, Michael Critchley.
On the advice of Mr. Critchley, who had been a Torricelli supporter and fund-raiser, Mr. Chang entered into a joint-defense agreement that called for him to share information about his case with the Torricelli campaign, people involved in the deal said. Another of Mr. Torricelli's lawyers, Mr. Bauer, also acknowledged that Mr. Torricelli spoke repeatedly to Mr. Critchley about Mr. Chang's case, but he described those conversations as entirely appropriate.
Over the next six months, the government's pressure on Mr. Chang rose steadily. People familiar with Mr. Chang's account said he told the authorities that both Mr. Critchley and Mr. Torricelli urged him not to cooperate with the government. Mr. Critchley dismissed that assertion.
"If I ever thought there was a conflict that would have prevented me from zealously representing my client as he instructed me," he said in an interview, referring to his prior relationship with Mr. Torricelli, "I would never have accepted the case." 
But according to two of Mr. Chang's former employees, he had told several of his associates that he wanted to fire Mr. Critchley because he felt that the lawyer was acting on Mr. Torricelli's behalf. One of the former employees said that on Friday, Dec. 10, 1999, after F.B.I. agents arrested the businessman, Mr. Torricelli repeatedly telephoned another of Mr. Chang's lawyers, urging thatMr. Critchley be kept on the case.
The following Monday, with Mr. Chang still in custody, Mr. Critchley announced to the court that his client had no incriminating information about Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Clinton, Mr. McAuliffe or any other politicians. But Mr. Chang dismissed Mr. Critchley the next day. When Mr. Torricelli learned of the firing, an aide said, he exploded in anger, slamming something against his office wall. 
Mr. Torricelli's lawyer, Mr. Wells, would not comment on this account.
At the suggestion of his next lawyer, Mr. Chang rehired Mr. Critchley early in 2000 to help prepare for trial. Not long thereafter, prosecutors tried to disqualify Mr. Critchley and his co-counsel on procedural grounds. In a sealed hearing that spring, a federal judge also emphasized to Mr. Chang that he needed to be fully aware of Mr. Critchley's prior relationship with Mr. Torricelli.
According to two people familiar with the case, Mr. Critchley remained on the case even though Mr. Chang stopped paying his monthly retainer in the fall 1999. Their association finally ended when Mr. Chang agreed to cooperate with the government.
Since last fall, Mr. Critchley has stood alone among nearly a dozen former lawyers for Mr. Chang in fighting a government subpoena for some of his records about the Chang case, even though Mr. Chang has waived the attorney-client privilege.
Mr. Critchley would not comment on the issue. But according to two people familiar with his motions, he has argued that he cannot disclose some information about the Chang case because of the joint-defense pact with Mr. Torricelli's campaign.

HEADLINE: Big Store, Seen as Interloper, Wins Over a Neighborhood 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

 BODY:
The floors were clean and shiny. The seafood counter was stocked with Alaskan snow crabs. A wide-screen television overhead offered cooking tips. Even Gertrud Wittingham, who had been dead set against the Pathmark supermarket, was singing its praises at the tomato sauce display.
 "There is nothing bad I can say," Mrs. Wittingham said the other day at the store in Springfield Gardens, Queens. "It has good sales, and it has enhanced the neighborhood." 
 More than a year after the Pathmark opened on the site of a former telephone company warehouse, the fiercely disputed grocery store has become a favorite shopping destination in southeast Queens. The largely middle-class communities near Kennedy International Airport had been without a major suburban-style supermarket for a quarter century. Pathmark says the 60,000-square-foot store is exceeding all earnings projections, drawing shoppers who had previously traveled to Nassau County for their groceries. 
But as in so many neighborhood disputes across the city, there were predictions of calamity during the decadelong struggle to get the Pathmark built. Now, the ubiquitous not-in-my-backyard refrain has been turned on its head. The neighborhood is enjoying the beginnings of a commercial renaissance, and the arrival of the supermarket is getting most of the credit.
"There were many people against it because we expected so many problems," said Mrs. Wittingham, a retired church secretary who has lived in Springfield Gardens for 32 years. "But none of it happened."
The fears were familiar ones, echoed over the years at public hearings and neighborhood meetings about other building projects from Harlem to Williamsburg, Brooklyn. There would be drug dealers roaming the parking lots, especially if the store was open around the clock. Traffic would grow intolerable. The shopping center would emerge as an island in a sea of retail failure. It was even suggested that Pathmark's merchandise would be second-rate because that part of Queens is mostly black.
The reality? The police report that crime is down 19 percent this year in the precinct that includes the 24-hour supermarket, which has its own security patrols. Traffic has increased, but road improvements made by the developer have kept it moving. A Burger King has opened across the street, and a Walgreens not far away. Behind the Pathmark, a Home Depot is going up.
Pathmark, at the intersection of Springfield and Merrick Boulevards, already has company in the shopping center it anchors: Party City, Radio Shack, Blockbuster, Payless Shoe Source and other businesses, including a bank and a health center. And a pharmacy in nearby Laurelton, whose owner had opposed the Pathmark, is doing well and has been sold to Duane Reade, another indication, some community leaders say, that things are getting better, not worse.
"A picture is worth a thousand words, and all we have to do is look at the community and see the magnificent progress," said the Rev. Edward Davis, the pastor at the Presbyterian Church of St. Albans, where many of the negotiations for the shopping center took place. "This has been a case of the survival of the fittest -- we started 12 years ago, I think -- but whatever you call what has occurred, it is progress." 
The developer and landlord of the supermarket, Joseph M. Mattone Sr., the chief executive of the Mattone Group, said that getting the shopping center built was grueling at times. "I attended meetings almost monthly for four or five years, and it nearly drove me nuts," Mr. Mattone said.
But answering questions and keeping residents involved, he said, were crucial to winning them over eventually, however grudgingly in some cases. The project, which Mr. Mattone described as "an unqualified success," has become so well known that the company is consulted about its experience in getting it built. Next month, Mr. Mattone said, he will speak about building in Queens at a real estate seminar at the Bernard M. Baruch College in Manhattan.
Enthusiasm for the supermarket has been so unbridled that many officials, from the City Council to the local community boards, have openly ignored a requirement imposed in 1995 that Pathmark set aside $400,000 to help small businesses cope with their big new competitor.
If there is any lingering controversy about the Pathmark -- aside from complaints that shoppers must make a 25-cent refundable deposit to get a shopping cart -- it is what should become of the development fund.
The provision was instrumental in quelling business opposition to the development, which some critics feared would hurt local merchants, especially some blacks, at a time when another high-profile Pathmark project, in East Harlem, had become entwined in racial politics.
In the end, the Springfield Gardens development pitted the City Council against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who said the $400,000 amounted to blackmail and vetoed construction because of it. The City Council overrode the veto, but nearly six years later, the committee meant to oversee the fund has yet to meet or collect any money.
According to a payment schedule in the legislation, $125,000 is overdue. The payments were supposed to start last year, with the first of 20 annual installments to be deposited in an interest-bearing account in the office of the city comptroller. The money is for projects like facade renovations and sidewalk improvements.
A spokesman for the comptroller's office, David Neustadt, said no account had been set up or requested. City officials acknowledged that Pathmark had not been approached about making good on the payments.
"No one has pressured Pathmark to come up with the money," said Yvonne Reddick, district manager of Community Board 12 in Queens, one of two community boards that include Springfield Gardens.
"Of course it is necessary," she said. "But it has not happened."
Some supporters of Pathmark say the payments were never a good idea but have been rendered especially irrelevant because the supermarket has done so much to revitalize the neighborhood. Local business leaders say there have been some unhappy merchants, but their numbers are small and there have been no reported instances of stores going out of business because of competition from the new development. 
Pathmark says it has been a good corporate citizen, making donations to Little League teams, churches, programs for the elderly and a fund for Christmas decorations in the nearby business district. Even the flowers on Springfield Boulevard have been planted and maintained with the help of the grocery store, said Harvey M. Gutman, Pathmark's senior vice president for retail development at the company's headquarters in Carteret, N.J.
"We are more than fulfilling our promises and the expectations of our customers and the local community," Mr. Gutman said.
The Queens Citizens Organization, a church-based advocacy group that was the first to approach Pathmark about building in southeast Queens, opposed the $400,000 requirement when it was brokered by Councilwoman Juanita E. Watkins, who represents Springfield Gardens. Now, with more than 275 people employed at the supermarket and scores more at the adjoining stores, the group suggests there is no point in revisiting the emotionally charged issue, said Mr. Davis, the Presbyterian pastor who was chairman of the organization's economic committee.
"We were happy that we were bringing in jobs and a meaningful commercial entity in the community," the pastor said.
But there are some local merchants who see things differently. Not far down the street from the Pathmark, Kamil Mohammed, who owns the Midway Deli and Grill, was arguing one day this week with a customer who complained that a can of corned beef cost more there than at Pathmark.
Mr. Mohammed said he spent much of his day trying to convince customers that "we are not robbing everybody." Not long ago, Mr. Mohammed said, he explained his predicament to one of his soft-drink suppliers. The salesman suggested that Mr. Mohammed buy his soft drinks at the Pathmark. Mr. Mohammed took the advice, and on a case of 24 cans of Pepsi, he said, he saves $2.99. He also discovered he could save money doing the same with tea bags and breakfast cereal.
"I don't know anything about this fund, but are you kidding? Of course I would want to take advantage of it," said Mr. Mohammed, who bought the business last year from a cousin and said it could use a face-lift. "The only thing that is keeping me going is the grill."
Inside the Pathmark, some shoppers said they sympathized with small merchants like Mr. Mohammed and suggested that Pathmark honor its agreement about the fund. Across the street, at Hopkins' Barber Shop, Neville Wallace, one of the barbers, said the Pathmark was good for most businesses because of the increased traffic on Merrick and Springfield Boulevards. But some other businesses, he said, have not been so lucky.
"The little guy always needs help," Mr. Wallace said. "Pathmark knew they were going to hurt the little guys when they came here, so they should help them now."
Ms. Watkins, the councilwoman who negotiated the development fund, said she remained committed to collecting the money, but she also suggested there was no hurry. Pathmark has turned out to be "community-friendly," she said. Even Ms. Watkins -- once one of the project's most consistent critics -- spends her grocery dollars there.
"We are not worried that Pathmark or that the money is going to run away," she said.

HEADLINE: Despite European Unity Efforts, to Most Workers There's No Country Like Home 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 11 

 BODY:
Three years ago, when Catalina Martinez was finishing her doctorate in economics at the University of Barcelona, she could not find work in Spain. So, with a British professor's help, she got a job in London. The next year she moved to Brussels. The year after that she arrived in Paris.
 For the young and the highly educated like Ms. Martinez, Europe's borders mean very little. Those people flit from city to city and discuss the relative attributes of Berlin, London and Paris much the way that New Yorkers might debate the benefits of choosing to live in Manhattan, Brooklyn or the suburbs. 
 But experts say that for the vast majority of Europeans, the treaties that guarantee them the right to work and live anywhere in the 15 countries of the European Union do not really mean much. 
Locked in by culture, language and a host of soft barriers like differences in the recognition of professional licensing, trouble transferring pension rights, access to public housing and varying tax codes, few Europeans are actually working outside their own countries in Europe.
On paper there are big incentives to move around in what European leaders envisaged as one huge market. Rates of unemployment vary widely in the European Union -- more than 14 percent in Spain, for instance, but less than 3 percent in the Netherlands, where the labor shortage is so severe that the government is sponsoring programs to get retirees back into the work force.
And still the unemployed are not flocking from, say, sunny Andalusia in southern Spain to the gray, rain-whipped shores of the North Sea in the Netherlands.
"For the tourist, there are no borders," said Catherine Wihtol de Wenden, the director of immigration research for the French Center for International Research. "But for the rest there has been much less mobility than we had expected. There are many, many things that keep people at home, and that is only changing very slowly."
In the 10 years since treaties were signed supposedly eliminating the barriers to free movement within the Union, only 2 percent of European Union citizens work in Europe outside their home countries. Surveys estimate that Americans move from state to state more than five times as often as European Union citizens change countries.
"In the U.S., the unemployed move to find jobs," said John Salt, a migration expert at University College in London. "But in Europe the unemployed tend not to move. In fact, you have a phenomenon where those who least need to move -- those on the high end -- are the ones who move the most."
Studies done for the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels have shown that the barriers to mobility are in fact numerous. 
Case studies showed that European Union citizens trying to get information about working in other countries often were shifted from pillar to post and tangled in slow-moving bureaucracies.
In one case, a German teacher who wanted to work in Austria was told that he could submit an application for recognition of his German credentials only after he had found a job. Of course, no school was ready to offer him a job until his credentials had been approved. He was also told that applications for recognition were allowed only once a year and if the deadline had passed, he had to wait until the next year.
A German pharmacist had to wait 18 months for approval of her qualifications in France, despite Union directives that provided for the automatic recognition of her license. 
A Spanish citizen with a German degree in architecture fared no better when he tried to go home. The Spanish authorities said they did not know what the equivalent of his diploma was, although it, too, was accounted for in a European Union directive.
Some experts say Europe's preoccupation with clamping down on illegal immigration has far overshadowed the attention paid to the difficulties citizens face when they want to move from country to country.
"The problems were identified years ago," said Dr. Joanna Apap, a research fellow with the Center for European Policy Studies, "but nothing has been done about them."
European Union officials say the issue is about to get the attention it deserves in part precisely because of the imbalance between areas of chronic labor shortage and those of high unemployment. Part of the problem is a mismatch of skills. But lack of mobility is worrying enough that the European Union is creating a high-level panel to study solutions.
Experts say there are few statistica about who is moving where and for what, though most believe that mobility is on the rise for the young and for high-ranking executives, both groups that tend to speak several languages and have often been educated in more than one country.
The estimates that are available suggest that a mere 0.4 percent of European Union citizens -- about 1.5 million people -- move country to country each year. In 1998, migration between states in the United States was 2.4 percent.
Attitudes about such movement vary widely within Europe. Citizens from the north seem most at ease, with migration from Germany and Denmark reaching about 1.2 percent a year.
In France, by contrast, that rate is below 0.2 percent, and some experts contend that French people who have worked abroad and other European Union citizens face a subtle bias.
"People who have not always followed the traditional path here can have problems," said Ms. Wihtol de Wenden. "There is always the idea that if you go elsewhere, it is because you were running from a problem, that you have an adventurous side and that you are not really serious. These ideas have to change but they have not yet."
Ms. Wihtol de Wenden said that at her university, Germans and Italians looking for jobs were likely to be considered after French applicants.
"We are not quite ready for this new life," she said. "We are used to working with our own."
Executive search firms say high-level European executives run into few technical difficulties in moving around. They find all sorts of ways to transfer their pensions and other benefits. 
In fact, few are strictly focused on Europe. Where they move and why has more to do with training and opportunity. They are just as likely to take a job in Hong Kong or the United States as they are to stay in Europe, although European Union citizenship can play a big part in what jobs they take. Many might like to work in the United States but find it easier to stay in Europe and avoid the struggle for visas.
Francesco Faiola would have preferred to go to America when he was starting out. But he found it much easier to be hired in Brussels. Now, at 32, he is a vice president of Moody's Investors Service in London, and at the end of the year he expects to move to Paris.
His moves have been easy, he says, though he has some concerns. He is anxious, for instance, about whether he and his Belgian wife will be able to get a mortgage from a French bank. "We are looking at building up a credit history that will be transferable," he said. "We could have a lot of problems with this."
But most of the difficulties of working in other European countries border on the comic. Mr. Faiola says that in Italy, for instance, offices are loud and there is lots of consultation. In Brussels he soon learned not to shout across the office.
"Whatever you say about the E.U. -- the one flag, the one currency, whatever -- we are still 15 different cultures," he said.
Once such adjustments are made, some wonder whether they will ever go back home. For Ms. Martinez, the issue would be finding the right job, which she does not expect to happen. 
"There is only one consulting company in Madrid that does what I am expert in," she said. "So there isn't much chance of me going back. Besides, I like Paris." But others, like Vania Schleef who also works for Moody's in London, believe that the process of working in several different countries with colleagues of all nationalities has changed them.
Ms. Schleef says she no longer feels at home when she goes back to Nice, where she was born. "When I go back, I don't quite fit in the picture anymore," she said. "They think I am a posh girl. And I don't think that is true, but I am not the same."

British Telecommunications Encounters Two Setbacks

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 11 

 BODY:
A day after British Telecommunications announced bold moves to cut its $43 billion in debt, the company sustained two surprising setbacks today. 
 A British regulator freed the company to sell its Yell directory services division, but imposed a cut in its advertising rates, possibly jeopardizing the sale or reducing the $4.2 billion price that British Telecom had hoped to get, executives close to the deal said. 
 And Moody's Investors Services lowered the company's credit rating by two notches, to Baa1 from A, adding as much as $42 million to its interest payments, according to a British Telecom spokeswoman. Moody's action followed a more modest rate cut by Standard & Poor's on Thursday. 
British Telecommunications said on Thursday that it would seek more than $8 billion from investors by selling them discounted new shares as part of a package of measures that included spinning off its wireless division and selling Yell. 
Two private equity groups, Apax Partners and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Inc., have been in talks about acquiring Yell in one of Europe's biggest leveraged buyouts, people close to the talks said earlier this month. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is also said to have had discussions.
Today, a British government competition regulator said that it approved the sale of Yell. But it did so on condition that the division hold increases in advertising rates at the level of inflation minus 6 percent. With British inflation running about 2 percent at an annual rate, that ruling, in effect, orders a 4 percent cut in advertising revenue. 
The regulator made its ruling ostensibly because Yell dominates the directory services market and could crush competition. Its nearest rival, Thomson Directories, has only a 15 percent market share, mainly in regional directories. Yell also owns the United States' biggest independent Yellow Pages business. Last year, the company had a profit of $:208 million ($295 million). The reduction in advertising rates could cut profits as much as 10 percent, some analysts said, making it a less attractive purchase. The sale is nonetheless expected to go ahead next week, according to executives close to the discussions, but the final price is not yet clear.
"The ruling will affect revenues of Yell and that could affect the sale of Yell," said Andrea Paradine, a spokeswoman for British Telecommunications. But, she said, the company was awaiting more details on the cuts sought by the regulator to work out the full implications for the sale of Yell. She indicated that the company was not abandoning the sale, arguing that with several unidentified suitors bidding, Yell was still seen as a valuable asset.
In the past, British Telecommunications has indicated it was interested in either spinning off or selling the business. The spokeswoman said the company was "very surprised, very disappointed" by Moody's downgrade. British Telecommunications had promised its investors that it would maintain an A grade rating by reducing its existing debt.

HEADLINE: Italy's Moment of Decision 

BYLINE:  By Alexander Stille; Alexander Stille is the author of "Excellent Cadavers: The Mafia and the Death of the First Italian Republic" and writes frequently about Italy.

 BODY:
The fact that Italy is about to elect its 59th government since World War II is regarded with almost complete indifference in the United States. Since the end of the cold war and the dissolution of the Italian Communist Party, Italy has virtually disappeared from the radar screen of American foreign policy. But the potential consequences of tomorrow's election are far more important than many realize.
 The hodgepodge center-right coalition that appears likely to emerge victorious includes a small neo-Fascist party of Mussolini nostalgists and a northern separatist party that routinely inveighs against immigrants, Muslims and homosexuals in phrases that Jorg Haider of Austria would not repeat in public. Paradoxically, the most measured member of the team is the "post-fascist" party, the National Alliance, which is anxious to appear as respectable as possible. 
 The real danger for democracy, however, is the coalition's leader, Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate who, since entering politics in 1994, has rewritten the rules of democratic governance in ways that could have serious repercussions well beyond Italy.
The problem is not Mr. Berlusconi's ideas -- a confusing but unremarkable set of proposals to lower taxes while raising retirement pensions and undertaking an ambitious public works program -- but the massive conflict between private and public interests he poses for Italy.
With a business empire estimated at $12 billion, Mr. Berlusconi is probably Italy's richest man; he is 14th wealthiest in the world, according to Forbes. More important, his key holdings are the three largest private television networks, which have an audience share of 45 percent. As prime minister, he would effectively control the three main public stations, giving him a hold on 90 percent of the television audience. He also owns the Mondadori publishing group, which controls a third of both the magazine and book markets; a championship soccer team; and a leading mutual fund company. He transferred ownership of one major daily newspaper to his brother; another is largely controlled by his wife.
Imagine that President George W. Bush owned CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, the Conde Nast publishing group, Fidelity Investments and the New York Yankees, and you begin to get an idea of the power Mr. Berlusconi wields. Mr. Berlusconi's television empire is now run by his children and, not coincidentally, he has received four times as much air time as has the center-left candidate, Francesco Rutelli, the former mayor of Rome. (The state networks have given each candidate equal time.) Moreover, Mr. Berlusconi's television networks are more openly partisan than any medium in the United States short of talk radio. The anchorman of one of Mr. Berlusconi's networks wept openly with joy when Mr. Berlusconi was elected prime minister in 1994 and vowed to leave the country if Mr. Berlusconi failed to win re-election in 1996 -- a promise he failed to keep.
The situation is greatly complicated by the fact that Mr. Berlusconi made his fortune during one of the most corrupt times in Italian history. He and his companies came under investigation after Italian magistrates started to investigate crimes of political corruption in the early 1990's. Various probes have turned up bribes, under-the-table payments to judges and politicians, illegal financing of political parties, off-shore dummy companies and tax evasion schemes. There are at least eight cases still open against Mr. Berlusconi.
Mr. Berlusconi's media empire has succeeded, in part, in portraying the Italian investigating magistrates as part of a Communist-inspired plot to destroy him politically. And his influence on the state media -- his own and allied parties partly administer the state networks, which run on a partisan spoils system -- has meant that he has never been forced to answer rigorous questioning on the investigations. (Italy's justice system is in genuine need of reform, but its rules should not be rewritten by one of its leading defendants, who has proposed placing prosecutors under executive control and eliminating crimes like false accounting. Mr. Berlusconi is himself under investigation for false accounting.)
Examining the charges against Mr. Berlusconi, The Economist concluded recently that he was "not fit to lead the government of any country, least of all one of the world's richest democracies."
Many Italians had hoped that their country's integration into Europe would reduce some of its anomalies. There is evidence that just the opposite is happening: Mr. Berlusconi is succeeding in exporting his conflicts of interest to Europe. He has major business alliances in Germany (with media giant Leo Kirch) and Spain, in both cases with ambitions to build pan-European companies large enough to counter American rivals in film and television production. Spanish prosecutors have uncovered evidence suggesting that Mr. Berlusconi used a series of front companies to gain more than his legal limit of a 25 percent share of Tele 5, a leading Spanish broadcaster, and evaded tens of millions of dollars in taxes.
These Spanish investigators have not been able to go further because Mr. Berlusconi enjoys immunity as a member of the European parliament -- and the Spanish government, allied politically with Mr. Berlusconi, has failed, for months, to forward prosecutors' request for a waiver of immunity on to Brussels.
The explosive mixture of unlimited money, media control and political power is a growing issue worldwide. Mr. Berlusconi has simply been the boldest figure in pushing the equation to its limits in a country with weak public institutions and little tradition of putting aside partisan differences for a larger good.
Members of the Bush administration acted commendably in selling off stock and private business holdings in order to remove any doubts about the propriety of their governance. Mr. Berlusconi claims he is in favor of anything American and announced this week that as prime minister he would hope to be America's "biggest friend and ally in Europe." So perhaps he might be persuaded that strict norms against mixing private and public power, like those widely accepted in the United States, might be best also for Italy. He has resolved to solve the conflict-of-interest problem in his first 100 days of office, but says in the same breath that it is "a false problem." He needs to be persuaded, should he be elected, that anything short of total divestment of all private holdings -- to a third party unconnected to him or his family -- places him outside the accepted norms of modern democracy.

HEADLINE: Gambling Industry Battles McCain Ban on College Bets 

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11 

 BODY:
Only weeks after he dealt a blow to the capital's money culture, Senator John McCain is facing the strong possibility of a defeat at the hands of a few well-heeled corporate lobbyists who want to kill his bill to outlaw betting on college sports.
 The gambling industry has waged an aggressive campaign, backed by more than $10 million in campaign contributions last year, to defeat Mr. McCain's effort to close a loophole: Federal law bans betting on college sports in every state except Nevada, where sports betting parlors handle millions of dollars a day in wagers on college and professional games. 
 Mr. McCain's bill was nearly derailed on May 3 when the Senate Commerce Committee narrowly defeated an amendment that would have kept the Nevada loophole open. The vote in the committee, which Mr. McCain heads, was 10 to 10, meaning the amendment failed. 
Among those voting for the amendment -- and against Mr. McCain -- was the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, who can control when, or if, the bill is taken up on the Senate floor.
The overall bill, which was sought by the National Collegiate Athletic Association and many prominent coaches and athletes, was approved by the committee on a voice vote and sent to the floor.
Mr. McCain has portrayed the fight over the gambling ban as additional proof of the need to restrain the influence of money in politics.
The McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill approved by the Senate last month would ban soft money, the unlimited contributions that can be made to political parties and campaign committees.
"We're up against millions and millions, and perhaps tens of millions, of dollars in campaign contributions," Senator McCain, an Arizona Republican, said in an interview about the gambling bill. "It's no more complicated than that. This is a graphic example of the influence of big money in American politics."
A study by Public Citizen, a research group that supports an overhaul of the campaign finance system, found that the gambling industry had given $3.9 million in soft money to the Republican and Democratic Parties last year, more than double its soft-money donations in 1996, the last presidential election year.
The industry's overall political contributions, including direct hard-money contributions to individual Congressional candidates, jumped to $10.7 million last year from $6.9 million in 1996, according to a study by the Center for Responsive Politics. It found that contributions last year were about evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, 52 percent to 48 percent respectively.
The gambling industry says Mr. McCain's bill would drive betting on college athletics out of the Las Vegas casinos, where it can be monitored by law enforcement agencies, and into the hands of illegal bookies.
Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., president of the American Gaming Association, the industry's trade association, said it was unfair to suggest that the industry's increased political donations explained the support it had received in trying to defeat the bill.
"It's just not the case that campaign contributions are doing the talking here," said Mr. Fahrenkopf, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee.
He noted that many other industries had also significantly increased their political contributions last year as a result of hotly contested races.
Mr. Fahrenkopf said that eliminating legal gambling in Nevada "would simply make things worse by driving this underground" while doing serious damage to the economy of Nevada. 
According to industry figures, casinos and other gambling outlets in Nevada took in about $2.3 billion in sports bets last year, with an estimated one-third of that on college games. Law enforcement agencies say that represents only a tiny fraction of all betting on college sports.
"Somewhere between 97 and 99 percent of all the gambling on sports is done illegally," said Senator John Ensign, Republican of Nevada. "To think that doing something about this tiny percentage in Nevada is going to do anything constructive is ludicrous."
The N.C.A.A., which has been overwhelmed by corruption scandals involving some of its members, has argued that legalized betting in Nevada encourages more corruption. 
"We think it's inappropriate to bet on the athletic success of young people, many of whom are teenagers," said Doris Dixon, the association's chief lobbyist in Washington.
In lobbying in support of Mr. McCain's bill, Ms. Dixon was reminded of the influence in Washington of the gambling industry. 
Because of its nonprofit status, the athletic association cannot make political contributions. So Ms. Dixon sought the help of seven consulting and lobbying firms to help her press her case; all turned her down, several citing a conflict of interest because they did other work for the casino industry.
"I've always believed that money was a big part of the industry's strategy that we had to work around," Ms. Dixon said. "I continue to believe that our voice will be heard above the money."

HEADLINE: Bush Says U.S. Will Give $200 Million to World AIDS Fund 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that the United States would contribute $200 million to a global fund to attack AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, but critics and some members of Congress said the initial donation was paltry.
 Mr. Bush made the announcement in the Rose Garden during a visit by Nigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo, and the secretary general of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, who has called for a global fund to raise $7 billion to $10 billion a year. 
 While Mr. Annan praised Mr. Bush's announcement as a first step, United Nations officials have made clear that they expect the United States, Japan and other wealthy countries to make far larger donations. 
"We must all show leadership and all share responsibility," Mr. Bush said, adding that the $200 million was an initial donation and that future contributions would depend on the success of the fund.
In making the announcement today, the United States becomes the first country to commit itself to the fund, and some outside experts praised Mr. Bush for acting quickly.
"This is a new approach," said Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for International Development at Harvard, who recently completed a study of why past AIDS efforts had fallen short. "Until now we've had 23 donor countries dealing with 49 sub-Saharan African countries, and that means more than 1,100 tedious, time-consuming negotiations. Now you have a chance for an organized, global attack on the problem, bringing real science to it."
Mr. Bush also used today's meeting to complain to Mr. Annan about the removal of the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
"The decision was an outrageous decision," Mr. Bush said. "To me it undermines the whole credibility of this commission -- to kick the United States off, one of the great bastions of human rights, and allow Sudan to be on. And I think most reasonable people in the world see it that way."
But Mr. Bush reaffirmed the commitment by the United States to pay its back dues to the United Nations, despite a vote in the House on Thursday to withhold $244 million if the United States does not regain its seat on the rights commission. And Mr. Bush's embrace of Mr. Annan's initiative on AIDS is itself indicative of Washington's reliance on the United Nations, even though the global program is conceived as a public-private partnership.
Mr. Bush made no reference today to another such partnership, the World Bank AIDS Trust fund, which Congress voted last year to help finance with a $150 million donation. President Clinton signed the law in August, but only about $20 million was actually appropriated.
"There is clearly not enough money going into any of this," said Representative Barbara Lee, a Democrat from California. "I think we should be putting up at least a billion dollars, at a minimum," she said. "That is the only way to challenge the international community to do even more."
Mr. Bush's budget, now before Congress, calls for $480 million for AIDS treatment here and abroad, an 8 percent increase from the current fiscal year. But some popular AIDS treatment programs, such as the $1.8 billion Ryan White project, will not be increased. Instead the administration is focusing on developing vaccines as part of a $2.5 billion AIDS research budget at the National Institutes of Health.
As Mr. Bush met today with Mr. Annan and President Obasanjo, there were small clusters of protesters outside the White House. 
Dr. Peter Lurie, the deputy director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, said in a statement that "even if every penny of this money went to AIDS, for the government of a country that produces 26 percent of the world's wealth to offer less than 10 percent of what U.N. AIDS experts say is needed to adequately respond to the epidemic is just miserly."
But a few months ago there was no discussion within the Bush camp of taking part in an international AIDS effort at all.
Mr. Bush sidestepped some of the more controversial issues relating to AIDS research, a topic that has not ranked high on the national Republican political agenda. But he said today that "prevention is indispensable to any strategy of controlling a pandemic such as we now face."
Mr. Annan was more specific, calling on countries around the world to find ways to care for 13 million children who have been made orphans by the spread of AIDS and "to ensure that people everywhere, particularly young people, know what to do to avoid infection."

HEADLINE: German Parliament Votes To Revamp Pension System 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 11 

 BODY:
After years of deadlock on the issue, Germany's Parliament passed a ground-breaking law today aimed at overhauling the country's extremely generous but financially strained retirement system.
 The new law tries to wean Germans from their almost total reliance on government pension programs that currently pay people 70 percent of their working income once they retire. The system has been an anchor to Germans, and most other European countries have similar systems. But all of these systems have been headed toward collapse, because the pool of younger workers paying in is being swamped by the retirees collecting from it. 
 The new law provides incentives for Germans to contribute some of their own money to private retirement accounts, similar to those that Americans and British have used for years. A separate law, passed earlier this year, will slightly reduce the level of government-paid pensions over the next 30 years. Though the pension revisions are modest, they nonetheless represent a political breakthrough that strikes at a central pillar of Europe's postwar social welfare system.
In what may be another sign of changing times, the lower house of Parliament also took an initial step toward approving a law that would allow prostitutes to collect social security and retirement benefits as well as to sue customers who refuse to pay.
The pension measure is a major victory for Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, leader of the center-left Social Democratic Party, who had to navigate past objections from traditionalists within his own party and dogged opposition from the center-right opposition, led by the Christian Democratic Union.
This was Mr. Schroder's second big economic reform aimed at reducing the scope of German government. Last year, he managed to push through a sweeping measure to reduce individual and corporate taxes.
For the past three months, the Christian Democrats had managed to block pension reform in the lower house, because they controlled just enough state governments to deprive Mr. Schroder and his coalition partners in the Green Party of a majority in that chamber. But Mr. Schroder succeeded in breaking the logjam by offering extra money to state governments and persuading Christian Democrats in a handful of major states to defy their national party.
Though neither the tax cuts nor the pension reform amount to radical changes, they represent a retreat from the comprehensive social programs and high taxes that have been a hallmark of European government for decades.
Today's vote highlighted the continued weakness of the once mighty Christian Democrats, who had controlled the German government for 16 years under the former chancellor, Helmut Kohl. Mr. Kohl's party, defeated by the Social Democrats in 1996, remains bogged down in a scandal over illegal political contributions that Mr. Kohl apparently collected and distributed through much of his last decade in office.
Even more frustrating for the Christian Democrats is the fact that, five years ago, their own plan for pension reform was blocked by Social Democrats in almost exactly the same manner as Christian Democrats were attempting today. Mr. Schroder broke the blockade by offering to give states an extra one billion marks, or about $440 million, by readjusting the complex division of tax revenue between federal and state governments.
The pension changes approved today are cautious. Tax incentives will be phased in to encourage people to invest money in private retirement accounts, but they will not be allowed to put aside more than 4 percent of their gross pay and this will only take effect gradually over the next six years.
To win support from Germany's powerful labor unions, government officials had to water down their plan for benefit reductions. Retirees will eventually be entitled to 67 percent of their working income, compared with 70 percent today, but they will have ample time to plan ahead: the reduction will not take full effect until 2030.

HEADLINE: An Unlikely Mexican Foreign Minister 

 BODY:
Jorge Castaneda, Mexico's new foreign minister, finds himself upbraided by Cuba and warmly received by the United States these days, a once unthinkable position for a onetime Communist supporter and critic of American foreign policy. But then it is equally improbable that Mr. Castaneda would become one of the main architects of a constructive new partnership between Mexico and the United States. Yet he has done just that, and the two nations are the better for it. 
 The son of another Mexican foreign minister and a graduate of Princeton and the Sorbonne who has taught at a number of American universities, Mr. Castaneda is at home both in Mexico and the United States. In the early 1990's Mr. Castaneda, a political scientist, was one of the most outspoken opponents of the North American Free Trade Agreement. His views by then had become more mainstream and he had renounced his earlier admiration of Fidel Castro, but he remained strongly wary of American intentions. In an influential 1993 book, "Utopia Unarmed," Mr. Castaneda called the idea of a hemispheric free-trade zone a "euphemism for the creation of a U.S. zone of economic influence." 
 Eight years later, as foreign minister, Mr. Castaneda is energetically working with Washington to create such a trading bloc. He is also working to help ease tensions over the drug trade and illegal immigration. 
Mr. Castaneda is not alone in his conversion. The growing economic interdependence brought on by Nafta, the rise in Mexican-American political power in this country and the end of one-party rule in Mexico have changed attitudes on both sides of the Rio Grande. 
To understand Mr. Castaneda's own evolution, it bears noting that he did not oppose Nafta because he felt globalization could be averted. He wrote extensively about the melding of cultures and interests before it became fashionable in Mexico to dwell on the exodus of people across the Rio Grande. He recognized that Mexico and the United States were becoming intertwined, but worried on what terms.
Vicente Fox, Mexico's president, has shared this concern since he ran for governor of the state of Guanajuato in 1995 and attacked the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, for failing to insist on development assistance as part of Nafta. Mr. Castaneda came to know Mr. Fox while trying to forge an alliance between Mr. Fox and the leftist opposition so a single candidate would run against the PRI. 
The effort foundered, but Mr. Castaneda concluded that Mr. Fox was the only viable opposition candidate, and one whose conservative thinking on issues was far more nuanced than he expected. Mr. Castaneda has since served as an influential political adviser to the president, most significantly in helping him develop a long-term vision of a Nafta modeled after the European Union, with its freedom of movement for labor and strong economic development programs. Americans will be seeing a lot of Mr. Castaneda in the months ahead. They should welcome him as a friend.

HEADLINE: Bush Says Tax Cut Is the Quickest Way to Help Consumers With Energy Costs 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that the surest and swiftest way to help Americans cope with rising gas and oil prices was to enact a sweeping tax cut, which he said would give them more money to pay for the increases.
 "If I had my way, I'd have it in place tomorrow, so that people would have money in their pockets to deal with high energy prices," Mr. Bush said at news conference in the White House. "The Congress needs to act." 
 Mr. Bush's comments came a day after the Senate, like the House, approved a budget plan that calls for $1.35 trillion in tax cuts over the next 11 years, and Mr. Bush sought to seize that momentum, urging both chambers of Congress to pass the tax cut itself before their Memorial Day recess.
Mr. Bush also sought to link his push for a tax cut to the nation's energy woes more strongly than ever before. He cited those woes as a rationale for a reduction in taxes, and he cited a tax cut as an answer to those woes.
After several weeks in which administration officials had cautioned Americans that there was little if anything that their energy policy, to be unveiled on Thursday, could do to help consumers in the short term, Mr. Bush today pitched his tax cut as, in fact, a ready-made remedy. And he did so at a time of growing worry among Republicans that rising gas and oil prices could seriously damage his presidency.
"Let me say it again, see if I can be more clear," the president said in response to one of many questions about other approaches to dealing with energy problems. "To the Congress, who is interested in helping consumers pay high gas prices: 'Pass the tax relief as quickly as possible.'
"We've set aside $100 billion to help consumers with high energy prices," Mr. Bush continued, referring to a part of the suggested tax cut that would be distributed among taxpayers this year. "That's the quickest way to help consumers. I am deeply concerned about consumers. I'm deeply concerned about high gas prices. To anybody who wants to figure out how to help the consumers, pass the tax relief package as quickly as possible."
Many low-income people, who are least able to afford a steep escalation in the cost of cooling their homes or filling their cars, would receive only modest amounts of money from the tax cut Mr. Bush has proposed. Beyond that, the poorest of these people, who pay no taxes, may not receive any financial relief at all from a tax cut.
But Mr. Bush and his advisers clearly craved an opportunity for the president to appear empathetic and in charge of the situation amid predictions by some analysts that the price of a gallon of gas could reach $3 this summer.
Today's news conference, which was almost 30 minutes long, was the third in the White House the president had held since his inauguration nearly four months ago.
Mr. Bush also wanted to claim victory for the Congressional passage of a budget plan with a tax cut only slightly smaller than the one he initially proposed. And he expressed support for Attorney General John Ashcroft's decision, announced shortly before Mr. Bush spoke, to delay until June 11 the planned execution of Timothy J. McVeigh.
"He is lucky to be an American," Mr. Bush said of Mr. McVeigh. "This is a country that will bend over backwards to make sure that his constitutional rights are guaranteed, as opposed to rushing his fate." 
The president added that the failure of F.B.I. officials to turn over documents to which Mr. McVeigh's defense lawyers were entitled had neither persuaded him that Mr. McVeigh was unjustly convicted nor shaken his faith in the fairness with which the death penalty is meted out. As the governor of Texas, Mr. Bush presided over more than 150 executions in six years.
Asked about the recent expulsion of the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Commission, Mr. Bush grew more animated than usual, his anger evident.
"The decision was an outrageous decision," he said. "To me it undermines the whole credibility of this commission."
Like Mr. Bush's two previous White House news conferences, this one was announced only shortly before it began, and Mr. Bush for a third time eschewed the formal trappings of the East Room for the less formal press briefing room. He seemed determined to maintain a jocular demeanor even about grave subjects, smiling and laughing for a moment before answering a question about a 4-month-old Palestinian baby killed by Israeli fire this week.
The issue he discussed most was energy, as he set the stage for his administration's announcement of its policy, one that will call for the construction of power plants and more oil and gas exploration on federal lands.
Many voters are concerned about the environmental repercussions of such measures, and Mr. Bush sought both to address those concerns and to assert that energy problems were long in the making and would be long in the solving.
"This is a situation that's been developing over the years, and it's going to take a while to correct," Mr. Bush said, presenting himself as the blunt bearer of mixed tidings and later adding, "I'm going to tell the truth when it comes to energy: that we have a serious problem, that we need to do a couple of things."
"We need to be more conservation-minded in America," he said. "But I'm also going to say, as plainly as I can, we won't conserve our way to energy independence. We must also increase supply."
Mr. Bush's discussion of the nation's energy problems in some ways mirrored his evaluations of the economy, in which he has gone out of his way to document that he inherited a troubling situation.
He said today that he hoped an economic recovery would be imminent, but that "there's no question that the minute I got elected, the storm clouds on the horizon were getting nearly directly overhead."

HEADLINE: More Tax-Cut Follies 

 BODY:
In the latest chapter of Washington's budget wars, a bipartisan group of senators on the Finance Committee yesterday put forward a tax cut designed to look more fair and digestible than the one advocated by President Bush. Their proposal for $1.35 trillion in tax cuts over 11 years does contain some elements more favorable to lower-income groups than earlier versions. But over all it amounts to another gross abdication of fiscal responsibility. The new tax-cut ideas actually underscore the lack of realism with which Congress has approached budget and tax matters this year. 
 The proposal was offered by Charles Grassley of Iowa and Max Baucus of Montana, the Finance Committee's chairman and ranking Democrat, where there has long been a tradition to approach tax matters in a bipartisan way. It improves the plan put forward by Mr. Bush and the conservative Republicans in the House in several ways. The top income tax rate would be lowered from its current level of 39.6 percent to 36 percent instead of the 33 percent that Mr. Bush wanted. More important, several provisions including a child tax credit and a credit for pension savings would be geared to low- and moderate-income families. 
 But the main problem with the Grassley-Baucus approach is that it would enact huge tax cuts whose cost is disguised because many of them would not take effect until years from now. For example, the measure would defer lowering taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers to 36 percent to 2007. It would gradually modify the estate tax downward for several years but not repeal it until 2011. This backloading disguises the fact that there will be no money to pay for the cuts when the bill falls due. With the Grassley-Baucus compromise, the tax-cut battle enters a new and contentious phase. Thanks to Mr. Bush, it is also a phase of confusion as to the rationale of the tax cut. The president keeps trying to justify an excessive, unaffordable tax cut with new arguments. First he said it was needed to revive the economy, a hollow assertion since most of the tax cut is to take effect years from now. Then he said it was to help Americans pay their credit card debt. Yesterday he said the tax cut would help Americans cope with higher gasoline prices. These are not policy pronouncements. They are desperate rationalizations.
The Senate must serve as a firewall to this nonsense. When the Grassley-Baucus tax cuts come before the full Finance Committee next week, and later before the Senate, reasonable Democrats and Republicans need to take a more rational approach. They should reject squandering the surplus with a tax giveaway to the richest taxpayers that does nothing for the economy. Then they can bring some rationality back to the spending side of the ledger as well. 
Even many of those who supported the budget resolution for the next fiscal year say that when it comes time to pass individual spending bills later in the year, they have no intention of respecting the restrictive spending ceilings they voted for. More money will have to be found for education, health, the environment, energy conservation and public safety than is in the budget that they passed. Once they confront that fact, they should reconsider this lopsided, backloaded and excessive tax cut.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Bush News Conference on Tax Relief, McVeigh and Energy 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:
 First, let me begin by talking about how pleased I am that a budget has been agreed upon. And it's now time for the Congress to act quickly. It's time for the Congress to pass meaningful, real tax reform. And I urge them to do so before Memorial Day. 
 The tax relief will be good for our economy. But tax relief is also a very important way to help deal with high energy prices. And so the Congress needs to act. I'm confident if they have the will to do so that they can, that they can get this done before Memorial Day. 
And, secondly, I believe strongly the attorney general made the right decision today. Any time we're preparing to carry out the death penalty we have a solemn obligation to make sure that the case has been handled in full accordance with all the guarantees of our Constitution. The very foundations of our democracy depend on our ability to assure our citizens that in all criminal cases, and especially in the death penalty, defendants have been treated fairly.
This decision is going to create some frustration amongst the people whose lives were destroyed and turned upside down by Mr. McVeigh. But it is very important for our country to make sure that in death penalty cases people are treated fairly.
I'll be glad to answer some questions. . . .

McVeigh Execution

QUESTION -- Attorney General Ashcroft, on the topic you were just talking about, said, "There is no doubt in my mind or anyone's mind about the guilt of Timothy McVeigh." As far as someone who has signed 152 death warrants in Texas, do you agree that there is no doubt that McVeigh is guilty? And, secondly, did Louis Freeh know about these documents when he tendered his resignation?

ANSWER -- Director Freeh never brought this up to me. I found out about this last evening. Now in my conversation with Mr. Freeh when he came and said he was leaving, the subject never came up. Secondly, Mr. McVeigh himself has admitted to the crime. Mr. McVeigh, as I recall, said he did it. And I take him for his word. . . .

Energy

Q. A lot of families are struggling to pay for gasoline at record prices. What can you do to help them in the short term? Will your energy report address that? And do you agree with your energy secretary that OPEC bears some responsibility for these prices?

A. The price of crude oil has got something to do with the price of gasoline but not nearly as much as the fact that we haven't built a refinery in years. What this nation needs to do is to build more refining capacity. And we're prepared to work with the industry to encourage capital development -- capital be deployed to develop more refining capacity. And that may require us to analyze all regulations that discourage development.
But the best way to make sure that people are able to deal with high energy prices is to cut taxes, is to get people more of their own money so they can meet the bills, so they can meet the high energy prices. . . .

Q. Your party in the past has argued in favor of either suspending or rolling back the federal gasoline tax. Will you consider doing either?
And, secondly, what would you say to American families who may pay as much as $3 at the pump this summer, at the same time the oil companies in this country are experiencing and enjoying record profits?

A. What I say is I worry about the fact that hardworking people are paying high prices at the pump. It concerns me a lot. And, therefore, the Congress needs to cut taxes as quickly as possible to give people money to be able to deal with this situation.
I also say we need to build more refining capacity. We need more supply. We need to meet -- meet the increasing demands with better supply. I'm optimistic in the long term, not only will we increase supplies but that our automobiles will become more technologically adept at dealing with the energy situation we have now. In other words, we'll have new types of automobiles. Hybrids. And in the energy plan I'm going to be discussing you'll see some incentives for hybrid automobiles.
But the quickest way to get money in people's pockets to deal with prices is tax relief. . . .

Q. Mr. President, are you really going to let Republicans and Congress go home for the next recess without some kind of other short-term relief? You know the Democrats are after you and the vice president, saying you're a couple of former oilmen protecting the industry. Would you at least support the Republican bill in the House which would ease some emission standards in California?

A. I'll listen to everybody's suggestions. But I want to remind the members of Congress, both Republican and Democrat, who -- all of us are concerned about high energy prices and prices at the gas pump being too high. Let's get the tax relief done and do it quickly. I hope there is no intention to delay. There needs to be money in the pockets of our consumers as quickly as possible. We've got the wherewithal to do so. But as to suggestions, I'm open-minded for any suggestion somebody may have.

Q. What about an emissions

A. I'll look at all options. But the clearest way to get things done quickly is tax relief. Now the American people have got to understand that this is a situation that's going to require some long-term planning to get the situation in hand for -- to have a stable future. There's no such thing as immediate supply. This is a situation that's been developing over the years, and it's going to take a while to correct. The quickest way to help people with their energy bills is tax relief. . . .

Death Penalty

Q. Fifty-one percent of the American people now, according to a recent poll, support a moratorium on executions. And support for the penalty in general has dropped considerably over the past couple of years. Does what happened in the McVeigh case, coupled with the more than 75 people now who've been released from death row when evidence of their actual innocence came to light, does all of that lead you to reflect at all on the fairness and accuracy of the death penalty and the way it's actually administered day to day?

A. Well, I am pleased to be able to report as for the first case that came to my desk at the federal government that our -- my administration has -- is going to take its time to make sure that justice has been administered fairly.

Q. But do you reflect at all on the general accuracy and fairness of the death penalty and the way it actually works day to day?

A. I was the governor of a state that had a death penalty and as far as I was concerned, I reviewed every case and I was confident that every person that had been put to death received full rights and was guilty of the crime charged.

Q. So no second thoughts about the death penalty?

A. Not as far as I'm concerned. So long as the system provides fairness. And today is an example of the system being fair. . . .

Q. Mr. President, there are a number of people, including Senator Leahy who was here today, who are suggesting that there needs to be much tighter oversight of the F.B.I. Aside from the McVeigh matter, there have been a number of things over the years -- the F.B.I. labs, the Hanssen case and a number of other things. Do you believe it's time for a more sweeping look at what is going on at the F.B.I.?

A. There are two looks at what's happening in the F.B.I. One, of course, is the commission that Louis Freeh put together headed by Judge Webster. I'm confident that that commission will take a full look at the proceedings within the F.B.I. as -- in regards to security matters. And secondly, the attorney general is going to be conducting an investigation as to why the documents were not given to Mr. McVeigh's lawyers. And I look forward to seeing what those findings reveal.

China

Q. Mr. President, what is your level of concern about U.S. citizens who are being held in China? And what are you doing for them?

A. We've sent clear signals to the Chinese that we expect our citizens that have been detained and/or citizens who've been detained with U.S. relatives that we expect them to be treated fairly and we'd like for them to have whatever due process the Chinese can offer. We have made our -- we have expressed our concerns.
Now, sometimes they listen, sometimes they don't. Our relations with China are relations that are going to be based upon a consistent message with the Chinese: one, we expect there to be trade and I hope there is trade, but, two, that we expect people to be treated fairly inside that country. And hopefully they'll respond. 

Energy

Q. You're developing closer relations with Nigeria, Mexico and Canada. Could you use your leverage with these countries to have them convince Saudi Arabia to open the spigots and provide more fuel?

A. The reason why we have a problem at the gas pump at this particular moment in history is because we haven't built any refining capacity. When you don't increase supplies of a commodity and demand continues to increase, the price is going to go up. And so our nation must expand refining capacity. And we've got to do that within our hemisphere. It's -- otherwise when you transport refined product from far distances it doesn't meet market tests. So we need more refining capacity.
I am working with Canada and Mexico to increase the supply, particularly of natural gas. We have a serious situation in the State of California, as you're very aware. We've been working with the officials of California to expedite the development of new electric generating capacity. We're also doing our part, as a good citizen, to reduce demand for electricity in peak hours. But the new plants that are being brought along -- being brought onstream in California are going to be driven by natural gas. And we need more natural gas to make sure there's fuel for those plants. 
And so I am working with Mexico and I am working with Canada to try to figure out ways for us to encourage exploration in our own neighborhood. I had a good discussion today with the president of Nigeria, who is talking about increasing their amount of production coming from Nigeria. That is positive news for U.S. consumers. The more supply on the market, the lower -- the less pressure there'll be on price.

Q. Given what's going on with the energy crisis and the difficulties in the economy, can you assure the American people at the start of your term that they'll be better off at the end of it than they are today? And if they're not, should they blame you?

A. Well, I certainly hope they're better off. There's no question that the minute I got elected the storm clouds on the horizon were getting nearly directly overhead. In other words, the economic news started to deteriorate. Now the truth of the matter is the market started to adjust March of last year. In other words, the so-called downturn has been in the making for a while.
I believe with good policy from the Fed, as well as good fiscal policy, that we can recover. That that robust growth we all hope for will come back. I wish I could tell you when. I'm not an economist. But if I were I'd probably say there's a 50 percent chance it would happen soon and 50 percent chance it wouldn't.

Q. And if it doesn't work out, does that mean it's not your fault?

A. Listen, presidents, whether things are good or bad, get the credit or blame. I understand that. But, I'm not really that concerned about standing in polls. I'm doing what I think is the right thing to do. And the right thing to do is to have proposed a tax relief package that is an integral part of a fiscal policy that makes sense. I proposed the plan. I campaigned on the plan. Many of you, the truth be known here, didn't actually think it was going to happen. Now there's a budget in place: $1.25 trillion of tax relief coupled with $100 billion of immediate stimulus. That's now available. If I had my way I'd have it in place tomorrow so that people would have money in their pockets to deal with high energy prices, so people would have money in their pockets to be able to plan for the future.
The Congress needs to act. I'm confident that that will help an economic recovery.

The F.B.I.

Q. Sir, how are the recent controversies in the F.B.I. affecting your search for a new director? And just what kind of person are you looking to head the F.B.I.?

A. Well, we've just started, Bob. I look forward to seeing what the Webster report says. I look forward to hearing what the attorney general says about the reason why Mr. McVeigh's attorneys did not get -- did not see certain documents. And I'm looking for somebody who will do a couple of things: one, enforce the law; two, keep morale high at the agency. Somebody who's a good manager. And somebody who can work with the attorney general and my administration.

Q. What's your timetable?

A. As soon as possible. I'm not sure what that means, though, to be perfectly frank with you. I mean we're beginning to look at different candidates and it's a -- obviously, it's a process that's going to take a while. Director Freeh assured me that the No. 2 person there could do a good job if we took us a while to find a replacement.

Q. Mr. President, some of those who have interviewed Tim McVeigh say that he will actually revel in what happened today, that ----

A. Really?

Q. ---- it'll be a sign of F.B.I. incompetence. What message should he take from this whole episode, in your mind?

A. He should say he's lucky to be in America, is what he ought to say. That this is a country who will bend over backwards to make sure that his constitutional rights are guaranteed. That as opposed to rushing his fate, that the attorney general, with my strong support, said we'd better make sure that all guarantees are fulfilled. Mr. McVeigh is lucky to be in a country like this. It's unfortunate that he would feel like reveling at all after what he supposedly has done.
There's a lot of people's lives he affected in an -- there's a lot of people in Oklahoma City -- I went to the memorial. I got to see the faces of people, the pictures of people whose lives were lost. I talked to relatives who still weep when they think about a relative. This isn't a time to revel. . . .

Q. Mr. President, is your confidence in the F.B.I. undermined by this episode?

A. I'm obviously concerned about an incident where documents have been misplaced. But I withhold judgment until I find out the full facts, to find out what the attorney general's investigation finds out.

Middle East

Q. Mr. President, you would not equate the baby that was killed in retaliatory Israeli fire in the Gaza Strip with a 13- and 14-year-old Jewish boy, one of them a U.S. citizen, who were tied up, beaten to death and mutilated near Tekoa, would you?

A. I was kind of smiling, sounded kind of like an editorial. But the death in the Middle East is abhorrent and our nation weeps when people lose their lives. And what we must do is work hard to break the cycle of violence. It's going to be very difficult for us to be able to bring people to the peace table so long as there's violence. And we'll continue to work to break the cycle of violence.

United Nations

Q. Did you speak to Secretary General Annan this morning about the United Nations vote to kick the U.S. off the Human Rights Commission, and if so, what did you tell him?

A. I did. I told him it was hard for me to envision a human rights commission without the United States on it and Sudan being on it, let me put it that way. We're off and Sudan is on. I'm not so sure -- you know, it sent an awfully, awfully strange signal to the world, it seems like to me. Yes?

Q. Did you or do you believe that some U.S. back dues to the United Nations should be withheld as a result of that vote, as some in Congress ----

A. I do not. I think we had made an agreement with the United Nations, an agreement that had been negotiated in good faith and I think we ought to pay our dues.
Having said that, the decision was an outrageous decision. To me it undermines the whole credibility of this commission, to kick the United States off, one of the great bastions of human rights, and allow Sudan to be on. And I think most reasonable people in the world see it that way. And -- but I did bring up the subject. Thank you for pinning me.

Q. Did he listen?

A. Oh, he listened carefully. . . .

Energy

Q. What would you tell an American citizen who is suspicious that your energy policy is going to benefit the oil industry because of your background and Vice President Cheney's background in the industry?

A. I would tell the American people I'm going to tell the truth when it comes to energy, that we have a serious problem, that we need to do a couple of things. One, we need to encourage the development of technologies to help us conserve. We need to be more conservation-minded in America. But I'm also going to say as plainly as I can, we won't conserve our way to energy independence. We must also increase supply. It's in the consumer's interest that we do so. The more supply there is relative to demand, the less the price will be. And I believe that we can have exploration and sound environmental policy go hand in hand.
The only thing I know to do, sir, is to tell the truth of the way I see it. And we can play like there's not an energy crisis or hope there's not a problem. There is a problem. And there's a problem that's going to confront this nation. And my job as the president is to take the problem on and propose the solutions I think necessary to solve the problem.
And again I repeat, it's a combination of good conservation and an increase in supplies. And I believe we can do both. And so I think most of the American people understand that.

HEADLINE: CELEBRATION; 
Santa Fe

BYLINE:  By Brad Leithauser; Brad Leithauser's most recent novel is "A Few Corrections" (Knopf).

 BODY:
Spanish settlers arrived in Santa Fe, now the capital of New Mexico, early in the 17th century. The city has flown the flags of Spain, Mexico, the United States, the Confederacy and the United States once more. It's a rich and mingled history, as befits a city that is older than Philadelphia or Boston or New York. And one that is -- in its explosive growth -- newer than they are.

THE MOOD
 Call it gallerification -- the transformation of what had been ordinary houses into galleries selling a diverse array of upscale art. In recent years, there can't be any place in the country where this metamorphosis has been going on more steadily and spiritedly than in Santa Fe. 
 The artwork you're most likely to notice, on first arriving in this rapidly growing but still compact city of roughly 70,000 people, is the eye-catching blue of turquoise jewelry, largely the work of American Indian artisans; you may soon start to wonder whether there are more turquoise necklaces on sale here than necks in the world on which to deposit them. It takes a few hours to begin to understand that the art available in this city has journeyed from all over the world to get here. That this is, for artists and artworks, a place of pilgrimage.
Artist-pilgrims have been searching it out for a long time. D. H. Lawrence and Georgia O'Keeffe are perhaps the most celebrated. His brief life reached an apotheosis here. (He wrote: "I think New Mexico was the greatest experience from the outside world that I have ever had.") Her endless life (or as close to endless as most of us can imagine; she lived to be 98) was largely devoted to the New Mexican landscape -- a devotion that the city of Santa Fe has reciprocated by building the splendid Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, holding the world's largest collection of her work.
For all of its explosive growth in recent years, Santa Fe still has a small-town, even rustic, atmosphere -- an impression enhanced by the snowcapped mountains in the clear-aired distance. As such, Santa Fe is one of those American towns -- like Provincetown, Mass., Key West, Fla., Telluride, Colo. -- that foster the happy fallacy that sizable subpopulations of the nation are professionally involved in the arts. Of all such places, Santa Fe may well be the least raffish. At least in the off-season, it's a town that goes to bed early, showing all the prudent reserve of a city of bankers and claims adjusters. In the historic center, a visitor searches in vain for tawdry traces of the hard-drinking, wild-womanizing, heavy-gambling cowboy town this once must have been. 
The city begins to make more sense once you realize that it has wed a passion for art to the pursuit of New Age spiritualism. If it's a place to shop for oil paintings, it's also a place to buy crystals and tarot cards, to investigate various schools of yoga and massage, to discover new ailments that require innovative new therapies. A city of artists? The chain-smoking, tubercular bohemians of popular imagination? It's as if they've traded in their cigarettes for aromatherapy vials, their wine for Perrier.
Most tourist brochures locate the city's heart in the Palace of the Governors, a k a "the oldest continuously occupied public building in the United States," originally built in 1610. (Santa Fe was founded around 1604, when wandering Spanish explorers, evidently giving up on their heavenly cities of gold, decided to settle for mere earthly beauty.) The low building occupies the north side of the central plaza; its long veranda is reserved for Indian artists selling jewelry, black Pueblo pottery and textiles. The Palace is chock-full of muskets and photographs and pre-Columbian sculpture -- all of it interesting, but for me less compelling than the exhibitions on display at the Museum of International Folk Art. This marvelous collection must be one of the greatest tributes to Anonymous ever constructed. The core of the museum is the Girard Wing, drawn from the collection of the architect and textile designer Alexander Girard. The core of his collection was toys, gathered from all over the world -- puppets and paper dolls and masks and miniature models. There are more than 10,000 objects in all, most of them assembled by artists who, it seems safe to say, were strikingly unsuicidal. The emphasis here is on merriment and mischief, brio and brightness. 

THE FOOD
 I live in Massachusetts, where a waitress once tried to warn me away from a dish she thought I might find too spicy because it had "a lot of cinnamon in it."
Our signature meal, the New England boiled dinner, comes from the Pilgrim days. It was originated by Puritan housewives as a quick, easy, reliable and economical means of eliminating most flavors from the family table. So it made a kind of defiant sense that I resolved, in Santa Fe, to operate on the bold, sinus-clearing principle that no meal should be eaten in which chili peppers didn't play a major and colorful role. 
I vowed to make no exception for breakfast, which you might suppose would have presented a problem but didn't. One day I had huevos rancheros (fried eggs on a corn tortilla, topped with a Christmassy blend of red and green chili sauces), and one day huevos Mexicanos (similar eggs, with a side order of spicy pork) and one day a breakfast burrito (scrambled eggs were in there somewhere, under a laval blanket of red chili sauce) and one day a couple of poached eggs on duck hash, under a jalapeno hollandaise. 
I needn't have worried about any shortage of peppers. They were ubiquitous and conspicuous. Red peppers -- as red a red as Nature has devised -- were gathered into necklacelike, leilike loops, which decorated restaurant walls and the doorways of storefronts. Rendered into plastic, they became refrigerator magnets in the cheaper souvenir shops; turned into glass, they became strings of lights -- just the thing for brightening up a sagging, despondent-looking cactus in the back of a margarita bar.
I came to Santa Fe looking for culinary heat, and found it. What I didn't expect to find, and found in abundance, was delicacy. At the restaurants I liked best -- Geronimo, the Anasazi, Fuego -- I was repeatedly struck by how prettily food was arranged on the plate, how subtly powerful flavors were blended. It made sense, I guess, that a city so devoted to art galleries would regularly turn food presentation into an art form. It was a chicken-or-the-egg situation. Had a penchant for visual art fostered a heightened appreciation of food, or had a heightened appreciation of food eventually led to a taste for all the objets d'art in the galleries along Canyon Road. Of course, the contented diner doesn't much care whether the chicken preceded the egg or vice versa, provided both are tasty. 
In Japan, where I once lived for three years, you constantly had the feeling that a process of culinary experimentation -- the evolution of some wild new "Pacific Rim" or "fusion" cuisine -- was occurring right before your eyes. So you accepted the occasional spectacular failure (the sweet pancake sandwich, the maraschino-cherry-topped pizza, the sugared omelet) as setbacks in a noble cause. In Santa Fe, likewise, you feel that serious chefs (who tend to be inveterate matchmakers) are busily setting out to marry off different cuisines: Spanish, Mexican, hints of Japanese and French -- while paying their respects to local produce and cooking. There's an on-the-range feeling to some of the meat available on the best menus (rabbit, duck, venison) and some of the accompaniments (Navajo flat bread, root vegetable ragout).
Admittedly, much of what has come to seem local to Santa Fe isn't really so. The limes in the ever-present margaritas, the rice in the staple beans-and-rice, the avocados in the guacamole -- none of these grow in the city's often frosty environs, nearly 7,000 feet above sea level. But it seems that all serious cuisines, however local in heart, are exotic in fact. Take a couple of specialties of the Geronimo restaurant, for example: grilled lobster with candied habanero peppers and tiny greens, or roasted veal tenderloin stuffed with sweet red chilies and foie gras. 
My personal pursuit of peppers came to a close when I discovered a menu that offered pumpkin-and-chili-pepper ice cream. I decided -- perhaps unwisely -- to pass that one up. Dessert? the waitress asked me. No thanks, I said. Just some coffee. Black. And a glass of water.

THE STYLE
To drive from Albuquerque into the historical heart of Santa Fe is to undergo an act of visual purification. The billboards melt away as you approach town -- they are restricted, I suppose -- and, as you get closer still, most of the garish colors dissolve into shades of brown. In the historic district, the palette is restricted by city ordinance to earth colors: terra cotta and maize, coffee and caramel, brick and mud. As the eye adjusts, the range of colors actually begins to seem quite broad, but never so variegated that you lose sight of a common parentage -- as though the whole town were ultimately sprung from adobe, or, back farther still, from the surrounding gold-brown mountains, in which, long before the Europeans arrived, the cliff dwellers made their hollowed-out homes. Human beings are rarely more ingenious than when devising spectacular ways to showcase their wealth, but the people of Santa Fe have banned many of the more ludicrous forms of ostentation. Dwellings in the historic district must conform to the city's architectural heritage. You won't find the hulking faux-Tudor manor, the elaborate faux-Italian villa, the gargantuan faux-antebellum Southern mansion. There's plenty of money here -- real estate prices have soared with the city's expansion -- but most of it is secreted away behind dun walls, low and unimposing facades. Even the chain stores have done a mostly successful job of blending into the architecture. Walking around Santa Fe on a sunny afternoon, you might almost succumb to the happy, restorative illusion that McDonald's, the Gap and Starbucks are not colossal, competition-swallowing international chains, but local concerns. I don't know if I've ever seen another town where the one-of-a-kind and the corporate franchise are so well blended. 
Or you might say that Santa Fe is a place where most of the incongruities are apt to be human rather than architectural. On a recent visit in March, with the sun out and temperatures in the 50's, I saw people dressed in hats and down jackets and others dressed in shorts. I also saw people dressed in down jackets and shorts -- seemingly a case of the upper torso not knowing what the lower torso was doing (perhaps not all that uncommon a condition). You enter a fancy bar and spot somebody wearing what formerly would have been considered work clothes -- boots, blue jeans, denim shirt and cowboy hat -- who is sipping an $11 glass of chardonnay. Not five minutes later, you step outside and spot a family who have clearly come from far away. A little boy is tugging resentfully on his father's arm. "But where are the cowboys?" he is asking with near-tearful indignation. And what you want to tell the boy is, "The cowboy's in that bar over there, drinking French wine and eating escargots." Actually, by drinking wine the cowboy may have been helping out with the water shortage. The town has grown too fast for available water reserves, precipitation has been down the last few years, the Santa Fe River looks less like a river than the runoff after somebody has washed his car, and meanwhile water-guzzling golf courses are going up in the desert. There's a faint sense of imperilment (a hint of wells and throats gone dry) in the city's prosperity -- as there is in cities lying on geological fault lines or on hurricane-visited coastlines. This is one of those places where the earth preaches a steady humility. 
"There may be trouble ahead," Irving Berlin advised us, and added, "Let's face the music and dance," which is what was going on the night I visited El Farol, a bar and restaurant that offers flamenco dancing and guitar. I sat beside a vast wall painting in which a grinning skeleton was doing a lusty pas de deux with a serpent-haired woman in a red dress. In my job as an English professor I often hear about Southern Gothic -- that world of the grotesque and bizarre brought so vividly to life by William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor -- but here was a reminder that Southern Gothic pales beside South-of-the-Border Gothic, with its annual Day of the Dead festivities, its skull-and-bones cakes and candies.
I left El Farol with guitar music thrumming pleasantly in my head. More pleasant still, it had begun to rain on this thirsty, thriving city. It had to be a heaven-sent message. This year, again, flowers would bloom in the desert.

BYLINE:  By Dorothy Gallagher; Dorothy Gallagher's most recent book is "How I Came Into My Inheritance: And Other True Stories."

 BODY:
 NICKEL AND DIMED
On (Not) Getting By in America.
By Barbara Ehrenreich.
221 pp. New York:
Metropolitan Books/
Henry Holt & Company. $23.
 In the good times of 1998, with the clock on welfare benefits running out, Barbara Ehrenreich had a question: How, she wondered, would the four million women (most with children) soon to be pushed off the rolls and into the labor market make their way on wages of $6 or $7 an hour -- an amount that it was universally agreed was not a living wage? 
Ehrenreich, who has a dozen books behind her dealing with the social and political hallmarks of our economic system, has here, with "Nickel and Dimed," followed in an honored journalistic tradition and written a valuable and illuminating book. Presenting herself as an unskilled worker, a homemaker needing to earn a living after divorce, she entered the low end of the labor market and spent one month in each of three different sections of the country. She looked for the best-paying unskilled job she could get, and hoped to earn enough money at it to pay her rent for a second month. "So," she writes, "this is not a story of some death-defying 'undercover' adventure. Almost anyone could do what I did -- look for jobs, work those jobs, try to make ends meet. In fact, millions of Americans do it every day, and with a lot less fanfare and dithering." 
Ehrenreich's first stop was her hometown of Key West. She figured that with a $7-an-hour job, and a place to rent costing no more than $500 a month, she would have $400 to $500 a month remaining to spend for food and gas. There were lots of want ads for service jobs in this resort area. Ehrenreich filled out about 20 applications for jobs at supermarkets and hotels. No one called her. So her first revelation was that the vaunted abundance of ads is not a reliable measure of available jobs but serves employers as an insurance policy against the high turnover in the low-wage work force. 
Ehrenreich finally got a job as a waitress at an inexpensive family restaurant. Her shift ran from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. Salary: $2.43 an hour plus tips. To find an affordable rent she had to move 30 miles out of town, a 45-minute commute on a crowded two-lane highway. How did her co-workers manage housing? One waitress shared a room in a $250-a-week flophouse; a cook shared a two-room apartment with three others; another worker lived in a van parked behind a shopping center.
"There are no secret economies that nourish the poor," Ehrenreich writes. "On the contrary there are a host of special costs. If you can't put up the two months' rent you need to secure an apartment, you end up paying through the nose for a room by the week. If you have only a room, with a hot plate at best, you can't save by cooking up huge lentil stews that can be frozen for the week ahead. You eat fast food or the hot dogs and Styrofoam cups of soup that can be microwaved at a convenience store." Without health insurance you risk a small cut becoming infected because you can afford neither a visit to the doctor nor antibiotics. 
In the summer tourist slump, Ehrenreich found that her income -- salary plus tips -- dropped from about $7 an hour to $5.15. At that rate the only way to pay her rent was to get a second job. So for a while she worked an 8 a.m.-to-2 p.m. shift at a second restaurant, then rushed to her regular shift at the first -- a 14-hour day of brutal physical work, as anyone who has waitressed for a living knows. With such a schedule she could not, of course, keep her decent housing so far from town. Ehrenreich's new home was an eight-foot-wide trailer parked among others in "a nest of crime and crack" where "desolation rules night and day. . . . There are not exactly people here but what amounts to canned labor, being preserved between shifts from the heat."
So much for waitressing in Florida. On to Maine and scrubbing floors. Despite plentiful ads for jobs, Portland turned out to be "just another $6-$7-an-hour town." Ehrenreich again took two jobs to make ends meet -- a weekend job in the Alzheimer's ward of a nursing home and a full-time job with a housecleaning service. 
At the Merry Maids, the economics were as follows: the customer pays $25 an hour per cleaning person to the service; the service pays $6.65 an hour to each cleaner. "How poor are they, my co-workers?" Ehrenreich asks. Half bags of corn chips for lunch; dizziness from malnutrition; an impacted wisdom tooth requiring frantic calls to find a free dental clinic; worries about makeshift child-care arrangements because a licensed day care center at $90 a week is beyond any cleaner's budget; no actual homelessness, no one sleeping in a car, but everyone crowded into housing with far too many others, family and strangers: signs "of real difficulty if not actual misery." 
And soon, even with two jobs and no children to support, Ehrenreich starts having money trouble. Housing is the killer. She foresees a weekend without food unless she can find charitable help. More than an hour on the phone with various charitable agencies (cost of calls, $2.80) nets her a severely restricted food voucher -- no fresh fruits or vegetables, chicken or cheese -- worth $7.02.
Minneapolis is Ehrenreich's last stop. In this city, as in the other two, finding affordable housing was a major problem. Across the nation the supply of apartments for low-income families is decreasing: 36 units available for every 100 families in need. Like many of the poor, Ehrenreich is reduced to an overpriced motel, more like a flophouse in terms of cleanliness and safety. Borderline homelessness is how she describes it. The old rule that one should pay no more than 30 percent of income for rent has become inoperative; for most poor renters, the figure is now more than 50 percent.
In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, where the "living wage" for a single parent and one child was calculated to be $11.77 an hour, Ehrenreich has a job at Wal-Mart paying $7 an hour. Many of her fellow workers, even those with working spouses, hold two jobs. 
In this way three months went by, and Ehrenreich's investigation was finished. What does she conclude? No surprises here. Even for a worker holding two jobs, wages are too low, housing costs too high for minimally decent survival. "In the rhetorical buildup to welfare reform, it was uniformly assumed that a job was the ticket out of poverty and that the only thing holding back welfare recipients was their reluctance to get out and get one." But if a living wage for one adult and two children is, according to the Economic Policy Institute, $30,000 a year, a total calculated to include no luxuries unless health insurance and licensed child care are considered luxuries, this amount will never be provided by the private sector to entry-level workers. 
"Most civilized nations," Ehrenreich writes, "compensate for the inadequacy of wages by providing relatively generous public services such as health insurance, free or subsidized child care, subsidized housing and effective public transportation." So what should we think about the fact that in America we are sending the poor out to make it on their own on little more than a quarter of a living wage? Shame, Ehrenreich suggests, might be an appropriate response.
Ehrenreich's picture of the working poor was taken during the best of times. Yet the comforting economic cliches offered by our pundits failed even under those boom conditions: a rising tide does not lift all boats; trickledown economics stops just south of the middle class. So much for tall theories. Now we have entered a downward slide, with all economic indicators pointing to the toilet.
We have Barbara Ehrenreich to thank for bringing us the news of America's working poor so clearly and directly, and conveying with it a deep moral outrage and a finely textured sense of lives as lived. As Michael Harrington was, she is now our premier reporter of the underside of capitalism.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; 
Mont Blanc Tunnel To Reopen, Carefully

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
BY September, the French and Italian governments plan to reopen the tunnel that pierces soaring Mont Blanc and connects France and Italy, two and a half years after a refrigerator truck burst into flames inside, setting off a conflagration that left 39 people dead.
 But the plan is running into a wall of opposition, especially on the French side, from an alliance of environmentalists concerned about the effects of truck traffic on Alpine landscapes and political leaders who argue that the tunnel traffic lowers the quality of life in their villages and harms the beauty that lies at the heart of the tourism industry nurturing their constituencies. 
 The decision to reopen the seven-mile tunnel, a favorite of tourists driving the Alpine routes from France and Switzerland to northern Italy, was largely the result of a compromise struck between the French and Italian governments at a recent summit. France agreed to press ahead with renovation work on its side of the tunnel in order to extract a commitment from Italy to support an ambitious project to dig a rail tunnel to connect Lyon in southeast-central France with Turin in northern Italy. Work is now progressing apace to complete restoration of the Mont Blanc tunnel, which was opened to traffic in 1965, and to introduce new safety features that will include enlarged refuge areas in the tunnel, improved warning systems and fewer trucks. 
The motivation for the governments to reopen the tunnel is clear: as Europe integrates its economies, the Alps have the effrontery to lie smack between several of the Continent's most economically dynamic regions, in northern Italy and southern France and Germany.
What complicates matters is that Europe, while a showcase for fast and comfortable passenger train service, limps far behind other industrial regions in handling rail freight. By the late 1990's, while rail's share of total freight movement in the United States was 41 percent, thanks to computerized systems and new technologies like intermodal transport that move containers by road and rail, in Europe it hovered at about 16 percent. And the trucks needed to make up the difference are the bane of tourists driving European highways.
By 1998, the most recent year for which full statistics are available, more than 160 million metric tons of freight crossed the Alps, two-thirds of it by truck. According to European Union projections, that traffic, barring dramatic change, will increase by 75 percent over the next 15 years. In 1998, 800,000 of the 2 million vehicles that used the Mont Blanc tunnel were trucks, hauling 13 million metric tons of goods -- French machinery for northern Italian factories, Italian clothing for French and German stores. 
To tackle this problem, European government leaders and railway planners are breaking up the old inefficient state rail monopolies and introducing new rail freight technology. In recent years, big new rail freight shuttles, hauling hundreds of truck-size containers, travel regularly between cities like Milan and Verona in northern Italy and northern European ports like Rotterdam and Hamburg. And they are trying to make the Alps more porous.
Indeed, the agreement by France and Italy to tunnel under the Alps in southeastern France, known as the Mont Cenis project for the mountain it will pierce with a 32 mile long tunnel, is only one of several major rail tunnel projects for the Alps that are in various stages of planning. Austria and Italy have been studying the possibility of drilling a 33-mile railway tunnel under the lofty Brenner Pass on Austria's frontier with Italy; in 1995, Switzerland approved the digging of two railway tunnels under the Alps, through the Gotthard and Lotschberg massifs, at a total cost of roughly $12 billion.
The idea is clear: by shifting freight from trucks to rail, European industry can relieve Alpine passages, like the Mont Blanc tunnel, which will then be able to accommodate passenger car traffic more easily and more safely. But the reality is trickier. The immense costs of the proposed tunnels make it hard for governments to raise the construction money needed. Moreover, environmental groups, arguing that rail tunnels will drag even more industrial traffic into the Alps, have been largely opposed. Then too, even when projects are approved, years pass before they are completed. The Mont Cenis tunnel, for instance, connecting southeastern France and northwestern Italy, is not expected to be operating before 2015.
All of this, of course, makes little impression on people in Alpine towns, like Chamonix on the French side, who discovered after the closing of the Mont Blanc tunnel just how peaceful life could be without the trucks. City officials there, who have always protested the heavy truck traffic, say they will seek court orders to block the tunnel's reopening, arguing that the tunnel is still vulnerable to disastrous fires without adequate means of evacuation.
Few give the court suits much chance of success, but local leaders remain adamant. 
"People around here don't want the trucks -- period," said Michel Charlet, the mayor of Chamonix. Xavier Chappaz, who heads an association of mountain guides in the Mont Blanc region, recently suggested, only half facetiously, that the tunnel could be reopened as a symbol of European unity, but only for pedestrians -- and maybe Rollerbladers.

HEADLINE: SUMMER FILMS/BACK TO THE FUTURE; 
New Apes, New Planet, Old Story: Simians Still Rule

BYLINE:  By BILL DESOWITZ; Bill Desowitz's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about the cinematographer Jack Cardiff.

 BODY:
WHEN "Planet of the Apes" first crash-landed in movie theaters in 1968, it was more than a popcorn picture or a sci-fi flick. Exploring such hot-button issues as civil rights, racial violence, the Cold War and Vietnam, it embodied the turbulence of the time -- a blunt reminder that in terms of "human" relations, we still had a lot of progress to make.
 It was light-years from that other 1968 landmark about evolution and exploration, "2001: A Space Odyssey." Where Stanley Kubrick's psychedelic mind trip reached for infinity and beyond with the grace of, well, "The Blue Danube," Franklin Schaffner's simian saga about an upside-down world where apes dominated humans aimed for the gut, with social satire and political allegory and the eerie punch of "The Twilight Zone." 
 But like "2001," "Planet of the Apes" struck a chord. At a time when science fiction barely had a box office pulse, it did blockbuster business ($32.5 million, or about $100 million when adjusted for inflation) and became a lucrative franchise for 20th Century Fox, spawning four sequels and two television series well into the mid-70's. "Planet of the Apes" proved that the genre could successfully engage filmgoers in a critique of American society and make them take a hard look at man's inhumanity to man and nature. 
And it did so in daring fashion, with the startling image of a half-naked and mute Charlton Heston being led around on a leash by a bunch of talking gorillas. This was no ordinary man they were ape-handling. This was Moses and Michelangelo and Ben-Hur. This was America's heroic icon of the 50's and 60's. If he couldn't free humanity and lead us to the Promised Land (or at least the film's Forbidden Zone), then nobody could.
Sure enough, when he finally regained his strength and voice midway through the film and shouted, "Get your stinking paws off me, you damn, dirty ape!" it was the rallying cry everyone was waiting for, including the compassionate chimpanzee, Zira, played by Kim Hunter. Now Mr. Heston was ready to stand up to Maurice Evans's holier-than-thou orangutan, Dr. Zaius, "the defender of the faith" and keeper of the terrible dark secret that eventually shocked all of us: that the planet of the apes was none other than our own Earth in the distant future, after a nuclear war had toppled us from the pinnacle of evolutionary development.
Among the many moviegoers who fell under the spell of the original "Planet of the Apes" was the adolescent Tim Burton. For one thing, Mr. Heston terrified him because of his intensity. For another, the premise was so weird and fascinating and absurd. When Mr. Burton was offered the chance to direct a new version of the film a couple of years ago, after Fox had spent 10 years, on and off, trying to develop the project with other directors (Oliver Stone, James Cameron and Chris Columbus among them), part of him wanted to turn it down. At the same time, Mr. Burton couldn't resist revisiting and reinventing the myth of humans and apes reversing roles. He accepted the assignment.
So how do you compete with a cult classic that has been spoofed twice on "The Simpsons"? We'll soon find out, because Mr. Burton's new version of "Planet of the Apes" opens on July 27.
One thing's for certain: Mr. Burton's "reimagining" will have little to do with the original. No Taylor, no Zira, no Zaius, no Cornelius (played by Roddy McDowell, the eventual star of the series) and no apocalyptic ending with Mr. Heston pounding his fists in the sand before a half-sunken Statue of Liberty. For that, at least, we can be thankful, because "Planet of the Apes" was a film uniquely tied to its time and wouldn't translate well into a conventional remake. Times have changed, movies have changed and audiences have changed.
In fact, the new film is closer in setting and philosophy to the original film's source, Pierre Boulle's novel "Monkey Planet," whose theme was less about humanity's misuse of technology than about its propensity for stagnation. In other words, humans could eventually be overtaken by another intelligent species. But it still came down to simians behaving more like Homo sapiens than humans do. Readers could see themselves in these talking apes, which is probably why the original film's producer, Arthur P. Jacobs, was so passionate about making it.
After being rejected by nearly every Hollywood studio throughout the 60's, he finally found a receptive ear in Richard Zanuck, who was then head of production at Fox. But Mr. Zanuck, like the other studio executives, feared that the sight of talking apes would generate howls of laughter from audiences. So he suggested that Mr. Jacobs film a five-minute screen test (at a cost of $5,000) to see if the initial ape makeup was convincing. It was, in a primitive sort of way.
But the apes in the new film hardly resemble their predecessors. Technological advances in makeup design have allowed Rick Baker to go way beyond John Chambers's ground-breaking, Oscar-winning work in the original film. Mr. Baker's creatures look and act more like real apes. They are faster, quicker and more powerful. And they run, jump and attack ferociously. They even move their mouths more freely. Yes, they still speak English and treat humans like animals, but this is a whole new adventure on a whole new planet. In fact, it's not Earth at all, but a parallel world that's darker and more primeval, with lush forests, treacherous jungles and Cubist-inspired architecture.
It is, in other words, a Tim Burton film. Mr. Burton, the director of "Edward Scissorhands," "Batman," "Ed Wood" and "Sleepy Hollow," is an old hand at bizarre reversals and the blurring of primitive and civilized behavior. "It's about apes and humans creating a new behavior," he said by telephone during a break from editing. "It's about how we perceive ourselves and how we perceive apes. They terrify us because they are so close to us and so far away."
Mr. Zanuck was seduced by the apes all over again. This time, he is the producer. When Fox came calling, he said, he couldn't resist, especially since it was an opportunity to work with Mr. Burton. "I always felt that that world set up in the original picture was left open for revisiting," Mr. Zanuck said by telephone. "In fact, several years ago, I inquired at Fox about making a new version, but they said it wasn't the right time."
The new film, with a script written by William Broyles Jr. and revised by Lawrence Konner and Mark D. Rosenthal, is like the ultimate episode of "Survivor." Humans on this side, apes on that side; may the best team win. The plot turns on an experimental space mission in 2029, as humans and genetically altered apes get lost in an electromagnetic storm. Mark Wahlberg plays the pilot who crash-lands on the planet of the apes, where he meets a chimpanzee human-rights activist played by Helena Bonham Carter.
AS you might expect in the age of can't-we-all-get-along, this ape world is more socially and professionally integrated, with less animosity among the species. The chimpanzees, however, clearly rule the planet, which would have delighted Zira and Cornelius (except for their mistreatment of humans, of course). The tyrannical chimpanzee general played by Tim Roth breaks all of the usual stereotypes associated with chimps. Volatile, unpredictable and lonely, he would have been a gorilla in the original film.
Credit Mr. Burton, who made his own study of ape behavior in preparing the film. "Part of the reason they have survived so long is that they are so strong," Mr. Burton said. "And the chimps aren't what you think at all. They can be scary. They may smile at you and look cute, but there is darker behavior beneath the surface."
In Mr. Burton's film, apes are a lot more cunning than civilized. And on this planet, where humans and apes compete in the wild, guess which species is more adaptable, more evolved? At least the indigenous humans can talk in this version, though instead of caged beasts they are now slaves and pets. 
What a time warp it has been for the 66-year-old Mr. Zanuck, who found himself on location again in Lake Powell, Ariz., where parts of the original film were shot. Only this time he won't need an approving preview audience in Phoenix to convince him that "Planet of the Apes" really works.

HEADLINE: MUSIC; 
When Ego Crushes All Before It

BYLINE:  By BERNARD HOLLAND 

 BODY:
WITH so many people talking about what American orchestras should look for in a music director, please note the fortuitous arrival of recorded material from Sergiu Celibidache. It tells us what we might try to avoid.
 The job in this country is famous for its multitasking: upholder of tradition, forger of the future, manager of fractious work forces, stage actor, glad-hander, fund-raiser. We have bright young men who make good music and interest musicians but who exhibit the stage presence of gym teachers. Then we have the Celibidaches, who cast their heavy spell on the musical public but who, on closer examination, evanesce into negligibility. 
 Celibidache (pronounced cheh-lee-bee-DAH-keh), played the theater of self-effacement to grandiose effect. He acted like no other musical actor before him. And no conductor contradicted loudly stated personal principles with more sublime presumption.
The packaging of a new boxed set from Deutsche Grammophon tells us most of what we need to know: "Celibidache" in large letters at the top; "Dvorak, Sibelius, Franck, Hindemith, Richard Strauss, Shostakovich" in significantly smaller type. At the bottom of the box's back cover in three languages: "The Celibidache Edition: The Recording Legacy of a Musical Genius."
Clearly this is the trickle-down theory of economics transferred to music. Heap riches of attention on the conductor's throne, and they will gradually descend on composers. Here was a man of enormous gifts pretty much destroyed by the monstrousness of his ego. Conducting offers enticements in that direction, but most practitioners have the sense of when to draw back.
Celibidache publicly rejected recorded performances, yet his recorded performances are everywhere. The nine CD's in that set and in another, devoted to Mozart and Bruckner, are by the Swedish Radio Symphony and the Stuttgart Radio Symphony: standard repertory pieces from concerts played some 20 to 30 years ago. The conductor, who died in 1996, once said that hearing electronically a concert that had already happened was like "sleeping with a picture of Marilyn Monroe." Yet these events took place with full knowledge that they would be transcribed and broadcast.
It was not the first time that Celibidachian word and deed had collided. Once, a reporter, suspicious of Celibidache's laments and regrets over a 1983 videotaping, went to the program's producers, who made clear that the conductor had meticulously and enthusiastically cooperated with all the retakes and lighting adjustments required.
Make no mistake. This was a man who could work wonders with second-class, or young and impressionable, orchestras. People still talk of his concerts with the Curtis Institute in the mid-1980's. The Swedish and German players perform on a relatively high level here.
Celibidache began conducting at the top, falling more or less into the top post at the Berlin Philharmonic, which he shared with Wilhelm Furtwangler from 1947 to 1952. His prosperity seems not to have suffered under the Nazis during the war years, but let us move on from that.
As Celibidache's career progressed, major orchestras had less and less to do with him. Deutsche Grammophon gives us an unintentional clue by including a recorded rehearsal in which the great man belabors a single phrase from Bruckner's Fifth Symphony for 17 minutes. Professional players despise conductors who talk, and one cannot picture any top orchestra in Britain or America putting up with the kind of bloviation exhibited here.
CELIBIDACHE'S frequent requests for 20 rehearsals might have had a ring of authenticity when he was dealing with semicompetent musicians. But 20 for the best professionals? Most great interpreters let performances happen as much as they impose their will on them.
The performances here are heavy with import. Mozart's "Haffner" Symphony opts for (and achieves) excitement over all else. The Stuttgart players are pushed to the wall by fast tempos, but there are listeners who will revel in the excitement. The opening tempo in Franck's Symphony takes "Lento" to its extreme, but it is very effectively done by the Swedish orchestra. The second movement's "Allegretto" is slowed almost to a funeral march. The finale, marked "Allegro non troppo," is off to the races.
Foremost in the listener's ear is the conductor. Celibidache claimed to be a servant of the composer's intentions, but he acts more like a decision maker working from compositorial suggestions. His portentous approach is not out of character in Sibelius's Second Symphony or in Hindemith's "Mathis der Maler," which here has a sense of leisure too often lost in current car-chase aesthetics.
Other items include Sibelius's Fifth, Shostakovich's Ninth and Bruckner's Third, Fourth and Fifth Symphonies, and Strauss's "Till Eugenspiegel" and "Don Juan." Celibidache's range, perhaps like that of his coterie of devotees, is not wide. When listeners know the notes by heart, it frees them to concentrate on crucial matters -- like conducting.
There are added issues running through these performances that go beyond good and bad interpretation: namely, not enough interpretation or, more often, too much. The present version of Dvorak's B minor Cello Concerto raises such questions. Jacqueline du Pre plays the solos with heart-stopping intensity and clean musical values, but add in Celibidache's oppressiveness, and what we hear is Dvorak's songful, lyrical, altogether lovely concerto crushed under the weight of its interpreters. Musicians who truly love music get out of its way.
Mr. Celibidache had a lifetime contract as music director of the Munich Philharmonic, and his work as an orchestra builder is recorded there in the near shambles he left behind for his successor, James Levine. American orchestras beware.

HEADLINE: BACKSLASH; 
Survivor: The New Economy

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL; Matt Richtel reports on technology for The Times. His column about living and working in the technology maelstrom appears the second Sunday of each month. E-mail: mrichtel@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
REALITY-BASED television shows are heavy with sexual themes and romance, with the action often set against exotic backdrops. It's captivating stuff, no doubt, but the formula is growing a bit tired.
 In order for reality TV to thrive, it needs new material, inspired by action found closer to home, and in a world filled with the elements of great television -- big money, power struggles and heated intellectual property disputes. 
 Yes, this is reality TV drawn from Silicon Valley. Real shows about real people, all watching their stocks tank. The lineup might look something like this:

TECH SUPPORT ISLAND -- On a tiny island, a man finds himself stranded with a laptop computer and an ample power supply. To walk away with a cool $1 million, all he has to do is install a new software upgrade. Fortunately, a crack seven-member technical support staff is marooned with him.
The man needs only to get the support staff's attention and to enlist its help in installing the software. Following is a sample of dialogue from the season opener. 
Man: "Excuse me, can I get some help with this upgrade?" 
Tech support staff member: "For technical assistance, press 1." 
Man: "Press 1? On what? You're standing in front of me!" 
Tech support staff member: "I'm going on break." 

REBOOT CAMP -- Eight people in their 50's try to log on to the Internet while their drill instructor, a tech-wise 10-year-old, yells at them. ("It's an internal modem, maggot! Now drop and give me 20!")

VIRTUAL REAL WORLD -- Silicon Valley's answer to MTV's "Real World" chronicles the daily adventures of six young people living under one roof in Palo Alto, Calif. The twist is that the residents are all electrical engineers. The fast-paced action centers on 20-somethings dealing with growing up, romance and taut, sexually charged discussions of the alternative minimum tax.
A synopsis of the first week: Noel calls a house meeting after someone spills a juice shake on his algorithm. Annie and Rick argue over the value of "X." Jay wants to use the garage for a keg party, but Andy wants to use it for a start-up. 

THE WALKER -- A team of nine strangers is assembled to track down one man. That man has been set down on one coast and is trying to cross the country, undetected. He is Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. The team is equipped with cellular phones, radio-tracking devices and the Consumer Price Index.
If Mr. Greenspan is not found, he wins a season-long reprieve from public scrutiny. If he is found, the team splits $1 million in Treasury bills, while Mr. Greenspan must announce a lowering of interest rates on national television and read excerpts from his diary. 

ULTIMATE POWER STRUGGLE -- Twelve Californians are locked in an opulent Silicon Valley mansion. At their disposal are the latest technology gadgets -- so advanced that they surpass anything at NASA's disposal. There are ultrafast computers, an electric toothbrush that doubles as a global positioning system, and a microwave oven that can receive e-mail messages. There is one catch: they have no electricity. The object is for the participants to figure out how to feed themselves, communicate with the outside world and elect a legislature with a clue.

CHAINS OF ANGST -- A die-hard user of a Macintosh and a die-hard user of a Windows-based PC are chained together. The room is empty except for two computers, one of each variety, at opposite ends. Each player must use his wile, zeal and muscle to drag his opponent to the computer with the preferred operating system. The winner is the first to log on. Nothing is at stake, but the winner can be completely secure in the notion that he has no life.
Next season: a 12-year-old video-game enthusiast is chained together with someone addicted to chocolate. 

LOW-COST-OVERSEAS-LABOR ISLAND -- Thousands of indigenous laborers, vying for H-1B visas to come to the United States, work in factories that make computer goods for distribution around the world. The big American companies that employ these contract workers do not pay benefits and provide wages far beneath the wages available in the United States. Shot on location in Taiwan.

MULTITASKING SURVIVOR -- Fifteen people race around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. As they drive, they must talk on cell phones and place day trades constantly. The object is to make the most money in the stock market while making the fewest number of pit stops (during which tires are changed, gas is replenished and hands-free headsets are returned for ones that actually work). All the cars are sport utility vehicles.

Englewood Seeks to Transform an Industrial Zone

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: ENGLEWOOD 

 BODY:
TUCKED in the far southwestern corner of this Bergen County community are 60 acres occupied by gas stations and businesses operating in low-slung distribution centers, factories and warehouses dating to the 1930's and 40's.
 The area is bounded by Route 4, Interstate 95 and the 147-acre Overpeck county golf course. And it is just two miles from the George Washington Bridge. 
 Hoping to capitalize on this location, Englewood officials declared two years ago that the site, just south of Route 4, was an area in need of redevelopment, with the goal of reshaping it into a new mixed-use neighborhood for their city of 30,000. Last month local leaders signed a letter of agreement with S. Hekemian Kasparian Troast L.L.C., a development company in Paramus, to help realize that goal. 
Envisioned is a $500 million plan, which still must secure all local and state approvals. It calls for 1.2 million square feet of offices in two 12-story buildings; two lodgings, one a full-service hotel with 300 rooms, the other an extended-stay hotel with 150 rooms; 346 rentals in eight four-story structures; and 142 condominium town houses. There would also be 90,000 square feet of retail space, 12 acres of open space and perhaps even a trolley station and light rail stop.
Under the plan, developed by LDR International Inc., an urban design firm in Columbia, Md., which also designed the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, the project would take shape in phases on the site from which the 30 property owners must be relocated. The area must also be examined for environmental considerations like wetlands and contaminants, which ultimately must be cleaned.
The pace of the development will depend on market conditions and demand, said Michael N. Kasparian, president of the development company. He said construction could begin by 2003, and the city is requiring that his company start 400,000 square feet of commercial space by 2004.
"Redevelopment is the future for many New Jersey communities," he said.
Englewood is among a growing list of municipalities with plans to reinvent large parts of their community; another is Harrison, with a $4 billion plan to reshape 275 acres of its Passaic River waterfront. But while most current plans deal with waterside properties, Englewood's 60-acre site is considered the largest inland redevelopment project in the state. It is also part of a larger redevelopment zone in the city, which includes nearly 100 more industrial acres on the north side of Route 4.
Such plans reflect the tenets of "smart growth" promoted by the state development and redevelopment plan, which steers growth to where roads and utilities exist and away from where they are missing. For most communities the goal is the same: bolster the economic base without impairing residents' quality of life. 
That is the case in Englewood where Mayor Paul T. Fader said homeowners bear the brunt of the tax burden. "To shift that burden, we need to increase the revenue from commercial and industrial properties," he said, adding that the 60-acre site "is underutilized."
And its redevelopment would be carried out without providing the developers tax abatements, added Douglas Bern, a City Council member.
Most residents welcome the promise of tax relief, but are wary of potential side effects, particularly traffic. Some businesses that would be relocated also have worries, including finding comparable properties elsewhere and being justly compensated. 
Two years ago residents opposed plans for a Home Depot on the north side of Route 4, contending it would, among other things, make traffic insufferable and hurt downtown merchants. The site for the unrealized store is in the 160-acre redevelopment zone.
Mayor Fader said the current plan focuses on what residents back then said they wanted -- office, hotel, housing and limited retail operations -- and meetings will be held to hear the public's reaction now. Estimates are that taxes from the area, when redeveloped, will rise to $5 million a year from $1.13 million, which "will help stabilize residential property taxes," he said.
While there will be additional traffic, Mr. Kasparian said improvements are planned that will help minimize the impact, including adding a Route 4 acceleration-deceleration lane into the site as well as a service road. An additional ramp off I-95 is also being explored. 
MR. BERN said a light rail link to the Hudson River waterfront would also help as would the mix of uses, which will provide opportunities for people to live and work in Englewood.
Donald Aronson, a former mayor and current head of the Englewood Chamber of Commerce, which sued to block the Home Depot project, said of the redevelopment, "It may be terrific for the city if it does exactly what it promises." Can that happen, he asked? The answer is, "I don't know."
He said he was concerned about the displacement of businesses, many of which have been in the area for 50 years and are third-generation, family-run companies. Some of the companies have formed Englewood South Tenants and Property Owners Association.
One organizer is Jeffrey L. Fisher, president of the Fisher Brothers Steel Corporation, which has been operating from its five-acre site on Nordhoff Place since the 1950's. Mr. Fisher, who is the third generation of his family to run the steel service and distribution company, said some properties had been excluded from the redevelopment and not everyone in the area had been properly notified of the plan. City officials said all parties had been notified.
A statement issued by the group listed a number of concerns. They range from why the area, which they say "is far from blighted" is part of a redevelopment plan meant to improve unproductive properties, to the loss of the 1,000 jobs they say the 65 existing businesses generate. While "some businesses may prosper," the statement said, "others will suffer undue hardship, be forced out of business or possibly into bankruptcy."
State law requires that property owners be paid a fair market price for their property as well as relocation expenses and dislocation benefits. But the law does not provide for the cost of "business interruption, extreme stress or old-fashioned aggravation," the group's statement said.
"Isn't there something wrong with a system that takes this number of people who are making a living and throws them out?" Mr. Fisher asked. "And if we must relocate, where are we to go?"
City officials said that most of the buildings are obsolete and that efforts to attract private investment were unsuccessful because no one wanted to be amid an industrial area. They also said the project's potential benefits outweighed the perceived negatives.
Some commercial brokers said the project's 1.2-million-square-foot office component is ambitious in light of a slowdown in the pace of leasing. "I question the timing," said Dennis Gralla, a vice president at the Paramus office of Alexander Summer/ Cresa, a commercial brokerage. He added that the project would be competing with established office hubs nearby, including Fort Lee, "where several blocks of space have hit the market." More is expected, he said, noting that the office vacancy rate in southeastern Bergen County is 13 percent, up from 3.2 percent a year ago.
Insignia/ESG, a brokerage in Saddle Brook, reports a similar rise. But Jeffrey Babikian, a senior managing director, said that while most of the vacant space was made up of blocks of 10,000 to 20,000 square feet, there is still a limited supply of larger blocks.
The competition in that size will also increase if other large proposed projects in the county, with a total of more than two million square feet, proceed. 
Mr. Kasparian, the developer, remains optimistic because, he said, "whatever sluggishness there is now, the fundamentals of the real estate market remain strong." Rents have not been set, but he said they would be on par with those for prime space, which is about $29 a square foot annually.
And his company, he added, could start first on the hotels or housing, which would also be competitively priced. He said the apartments, with 800 to 1,200 square feet, and the town houses, with 2,000 to 2,300 feet, would be designed to appeal to individuals or couples, rather than to families with children to lessen the impact on schools.
Recognizing the challenges ahead, Councilman Bern said, "We are listening to the public to arrive at an appropriate balance to move the plan to fruition."

HEADLINE: MEMO FROM HARTFORD; 
Well, At Least the Title Is Impressive

BYLINE:  By Paul Zielbauer; Paul Zielbauer is the Hartford bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
HELP WANTED
 Shrinking Northeastern city seeks energetic replacement for top city hall job. Successful candidate must enjoy receiving P/T salary for F/T work, political back-stabbings and frequent beatings in local press. Benefits include travel (citywide), important title (mayor) and free laser eye surgery. No experience necessary. 
 EOE except for Republicans.
That, in brief, is the job that Hartford's mayor, Mike Peters, will give up after eight years when he resigns later this year. Why he would voluntarily relinquish such a lofty political berth is anyone's guess.
For the first time since Lowell Weicker was governor, there will be serious competition for Hartford's top elected office, though only political adolescents and perhaps Bob Backlund would believe anyone but a hard-core Democrat has a chance of winning it. Whichever Dem that may be, however, he or she is hardly kicking down Mayor Mike's door. 
To the contrary, more than a week after Mr. Peters, 52, announced his forthcoming resignation and officially became a lame-duck incumbent, the campaign fax machines remain on standby, their spokesmen silent. No one has publicly declared an interest in being the city's next mayor. 
"There are a lot of difficult things you got to overcome," Mr. Peters said Tuesday, in a burst of understatement.
In Hartford, the mayor has no vote on the City Council, holds no power to hire or fire anyone other than his secretary and makes so little money -- $30,000, which is a shade more than double the state's minimum wage -- that only a handful of city residents qualified to hold the office have even considered running for it.
They know Mr. Peters inhabits what is called a "weak mayor's" job, a mostly ceremonial assignment with almost no direct authority over anything more important than the unfortunately named Hooker Day Parade and with daily duties that typically range from nothing to standing beside businessmen in suits, holding a gold-painted shovel.
And yet, Hartford's nascent candidates-in-hiding are out there. Most of them have received more media attention in absentia over the past 12 days than they have in the past two years. Two names in particular are heard most often. 
John Wardlaw, the decades-long executive director of the Hartford Housing Authority, has said he's too busy ridding Hartford of its crumbling public housing units and is all but not interested. As a respected leader of an important agency integral to the city's history and fabric, Mr. Wardlaw is seen as a formidable potential candidate. His days as a Boy Scout can't hurt either.
It is still early in the soon-to-be-post-Peters era, and Mr. Wardlaw's nondenial denial of interest in the job should not taken as his last word.
Eddie Perez, the executive director of the Southside Institutions Neighborhood Alliance, is young, ambitious and Puerto Rican, three helpful qualities for anyone wanting to improve a mostly Latino city with world-class economic and social problems. Out of public view, Mr. Perez, 43, who recently moved back to Hartford from suburban Bloomfield, has been noticeably taking his fellow Democrats' political temperatures to determine the strength of his candidacy.
There are other potential mayoral candidates, too, including one former mayor, Thirman L. Milner, one former city councilor and fire chief, John B. Stewart Jr., and, as a self-described last resort he-can't-find-anyone-better, one current Democratic Town chairman, Bob Jackson.
Though it's early intthe mayoral election year, Mr. Milner, whose served as mayor from 1981 to 1987, and Mr. Stewart, who became the city's first black fire chief in 1980, would have to be considered long-shot candidates. In a word, they are retreads, old-schoolers in leisure suits who are disruptions to Hartford's waxing notion that, for all the good Mr. Peters did for it, his departure offers this city a necessary segue to fresh-faced, next-generation candidates like Mr. Wardlaw and Mr. Perez, among others.
Moreover, everyone believes that two things will differentiate the Peters era in Hartford government from the next mayor's: a united City Council (for one) that will (for two) give the new mayor the official powers, the absence of which weighed heavily in Mr. Peters' decision not to run for a fifth term. 
The only way the new mayor will be effective, according to several prominent Hartford Democrats, is if he puts his own council together. Two City Council members, including Deputy Mayor Frances Sanchez, who helped scuttle a change to a strong-mayor form of government last year, said they won't run for another term. 
Their departure only makes room for more first-time councilors, which, regardless of who becomes mayor, are probably going to favor putting a strong-mayor referendum on the same city ballots as next year's governor's race. Last year, with Ms. Sanchez's support, the City Council voted against placing the strong-mayor question on November's presidential ballots, when the most residents would show up to vote on it. Instead, a special citywide vote was held in December, and though a huge majority voted for a strong mayor, not enough registered voters cast ballots to officially change anything, and the measure failed.
Of course, predicting who will run and what will happen inside Hartford's City Hall is like betting on which direction your goldfish will swim next. There are still more than four months before September's Democratic Party primary.
On May 2, Mr. Jackson, the Democratic town chairman, held a political open house at a local high school to give City Council candidates the chance to tell him why they deserved his considerable support. Mr. Jackson said 17 City Council candidates showed up and spoke. Nobody showed up to talk about being mayor. 
In his next open house, Mr. Jackson said he expected all the serious mayoral candidates to show up ready to discuss their specific vision for leading the city. 
"Why do you want to be mayor?" is the first question Mr. Jackson said he would ask prospective candidates, followed by "What are the skill sets you bring to the position? And how do you propose to use those to solve the top three problems the city of Hartford has?"
While the candidates are answering those questions, you just might find, over in the back row with his hand in a large bag of popcorn, Mayor Peters casually observing Hartford's new political theater. Who will replace him as his party's top fund-raiser, though, is a serious question for Democrats here.
On the first Tuesday in December, Mayor Mike will pull on his suit jacket, pack up his crossword puzzles and flip off the lights of his second-floor corner office for the last time. 
Save the tears, please. He has already gotten a few job offers from businesses in Hartford and one outfit in Washington, though not from the Federal government. "President Bush has not called," he said.
Most of the offers are from lobbyists or public-relations firms, places where Mayor Peter's affinity for vulgarisms would not work as well as they did from his big leather office chair. 
"I may end up driving a cab, for all I know," he said last week. From mayor to cabbie in eight years flat. Is this a great city or what?

HEADLINE: Fresh Air Fund Offers Lessons for 2 Families 

BYLINE:  By JUDY TONG 

 BODY:
WHEN Jim and Havilande Whitcomb of Southport first welcomed Quintasha Watson, 9, to their home as part of the Fresh Air Fund, they knew they and their three children, James, 12, Ashton, 10, and Christiana, 8, would also gain from the experience. But they also were about to be introduced to an understanding of prejudice.
 One day the oldest child, James, 12, heard a racist remark from a friend and asked his mother, Havilande, an interior designer with Beinfeld Wagner architects of South Norwalk, why someone would say something like that and what it meant. 
 "I'd never felt anything like that inside of me before," James said. "It's just the meanest thing you could ever do to somebody, to say something prejudiced." 
His parents said they believed that if James hadn't been close to Quintasha, the remark might have gone completely unnoticed by him. But, because of their relationship, Ms. Whitcomb said, when he overheard the remark, he felt it personally and became protective of someone he considers like a sister. She remembers him coming home confused and angry. It was completely new territory for him, and they had to sit down twice and have long discussions to work through it.
Obviously, the purpose of the program is to get the children out of the city and into a wonderful summer environment, Ms. Whitcomb said. But, it's also a chance for all four of the children to be prepared for life. When all four children grow older, they'll have to interact with people from different racial, cultural, and economic backgrounds.
"Hopefully, the program gives them a little window to different kinds of worlds," said Mr. Whitcomb, an investment banker for Shattuck Hammond Partners.
The Whitcombs had been back in the states for a year after living in London for seven. After reading an article in a newspaper, they decided to volunteer with the Fresh Air Fund. But the youngest of their three children, Christiana, was only a year-old at the time, and the program requires the youngest child to be at least 6. So they waited and when they could, they asked their friend, Lori Sprous, then the program's area coordinator, to help them.
The Fresh Air Fund provides more than 10,000 disadvantaged New York City children with free summer vacations annually. Since 1877, more than 1.7 million inner-city children have visited host families in small town communities or attended one of five Fresh Air camps in Fishkill, N.Y.
In July 1998, Quintasha Watson, then 6, arrived to spend two weeks in their home. This July will be the fourth summer she's visited. 
"I'm excited to go back and see their new pet," Quintasha said. "And, I'm looking forward to seeing Christiana and her birthday party."
Last summer, Quintasha and Christiana took acting lessons at a summer camp at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield. Drama class seemed a perfect fit for the two girls, who are very close. Christiana wants to be an actress when she gets older and Quintasha had always seemed to be a natural performer to the Whitcombs.
Quintasha's natural talents showed the very first summer at Christiana's sixth birthday party. It was a dress-up party, with clothes, shoes, bags and jewelry bought from Goodwill, and at the end she rallied a group of the girls together for an impromptu performance. As mothers arrived to pick up their daughters, Quintasha, Christiana and several other girls began a song and dance on the back porch, some of them even playing improvised instruments.
"We knew she was very talented from that moment," Mr. Whitcomb said. "She had that spark to her." 
At the end of the two weeks, the Whitcombs invited Quintasha's mother, Pamela, and her older brother, Jamal, 14, who also goes on Fresh Air Fund vacations, to Southport for the drama camp's last performance.
Pamela Watson, an administrative assistant at the Harlem Hospital, first heard about the program from an elderly woman she was working for as a home aide. Her son had been a Fresh Air Fund child, and she suggested enrolling Quintasha's older brother, Jamal.
When Quintasha and Jamal went away for the first time, Ms. Watson was anxious. After a suggestion from the elderly woman, she gave them both a special word -- a code. Then, if anything was wrong, all they had to do was say that word when they spoke on the phone, or write it on a postcard and send it to her. Then she would come for them.
The code word was never needed. Ms. Watson and the children can't even remember what the code is.
"It's hard when you first let your children go," Ms. Watson said. "But then, when they get where they're going, once you speak to the family and you speak to your child and your child is letting you know everything's okay, then it's a lot better.
"I spoke with Ms. Whitcomb the other night," Ms. Watson said. "I told her Quintasha needed help with reading. So, she said she was going to look into some programs that might be able help her out. They go way beyond just dealing with the two weeks for the summer. They contact us all throughout the winter. And, if there's anything we ever need any help with they always seem to be there."
Quintasha lists all the things she loves about visiting her Fresh Air family: learning to swim, waking up and playing right away, playing with the dog, Leopold, who reminds her of the dog she used to have but had to give up, even tidying up before going out.
"When I'm there, I'm happy all the time," she said.

HEADLINE: Southwest Flexes Muscles and Others Fall 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

DATELINE: ISLIP 

 BODY:
IN the airline industry it is called the "Southwest effect," an explosion in passenger traffic at formerly sleepy, out-of-the-way regional airports that predictably occurs when Southwest, the industry's wildly successful discount-fare giant, comes to town.
 But as recent passenger figures for Long Island MacArthur Airport are beginning to attest, there is another, less-publicized aspect of Southwest's dominating presence: A dwindling of competition that can spell a reduction of service as other airlines cut back or head for the exits. 
 In what industry experts said was a familiar pattern, the number of passengers flying Southwest between Islip and an array of domestic locations has been on the rise since the Dallas-based discounter set up shop in the New York market at Islip two years ago.
In March, the most recent month for which figures were available, Southwest carried 113,682 passengers to and from Islip, up from 82,955 a year earlier. 
Just as familiar a part of the pattern, the experts said, was an overall decrease in total passengers at Islip that followed the initial surge as other carriers, unable to compete with Southwest's bargain fares, began to lose business and retreat. Even as Southwest's numbers continued to climb, total passenger volume at Islip slipped in March to 175,801, down from 196,553 a year earlier.
Other factors including labor disputes, weather and a cooled national economy come into play in the fluctuating passenger numbers, and competitors are loath to admit that they blinked in the face of Southwest's challenge.
But with passengers voting with their feet, Southwest has quickly become the ten-ton gorilla, and flying the ticketless Southwest way -- with de rigueur pre-flight queuing to get first dibs on non-reserved seats and with meals and movies traded for peanuts and plastic-wrapped snacks -- is more and more the only way to fly into or out of Islip.
"They whip the other guys' butts," said Darryl Jenkins, director of the Aviation Institute at George Washington University. "We see that a lot with Southwest. If they are very, very successful in a market, they really kill everyone else."
In a paper last August, Mr. Jenkins predicted that Southwest would match Delta Airlines, a full-service goliath, as the country's largest domestic carrier within five years, and would thereafter overtake Delta.
Southwest and Delta are already grappling at Islip, and Southwest appears to be on top. Comair and Florida-bound Atlantic Southwest Airlines, wholly owned Delta subsidiaries, and Delta Express, Atlanta-based Delta's low-fare operating unit, all fly from Islip.
Recent numbers suggest Southwest is beginning to draw decisively ahead. In a comparison between the first three months of 2000 and 2001, Southwest passengers were up by more than 113,000 while combined totals for Atlantic Southeast, Comair and Delta Express were off by nearly 11,000.
With service overlaps, particularly on the well-worn routes from Islip to Florida cities serving the so-called polyester trade that has long been Islip's forte, fares are part of the reason.
The departure of Spirit Airlines in July ended service to Florida by a carrier that transported more than 40,000 passengers through the first four months of 2000.
Fort Lauderdale-based Spirit left Islip after Southwest commenced Florida service. But a Spirit spokeswoman, Lynne Koreman, said the airline's exit from Islip was not because of Southwest. "We had opportunities to add to our service at LaGuardia, so we consolidated our New York operations," Ms. Koreman said. "That was our real reason."
But while competitors at Islip put on a brave face publicly, an airline spokesman who spoke on the condition he and his company would not be named said Southwest was taking a heavy toll. "We are not unique in this," the spokesman said. "All the other airlines are facing it."
Southwest, already heavily in the Florida market, quickly took up the slack. The airline has announced it will begin new service between Islip and West Palm Beach on Sept. 12, adding to the 66 cities it currently flies to from Long Island. Southwest has also added flights to Providence.
Now Southwest would like to expand at Islip by building a new, four-gate terminal area and a new 2,400-space parking area. A Southwest spokeswoman, Christine Turneabe-Connelly, said the airline was in discussions with an architect and general contractor and negotiating with the town for a project that would cost about $42 million. Southwest would pay 90 percent of the cost and Islip would apply for federal financing to pay the remaining 10 percent, she said.
A group representing airport neighbors, Citizens for Enforcement of MacArthur Airport Controls, opposes the expansion and has urged the town supervisor, Pete McGowan, to block it. 
The group president, Deborah Slinkosky, said the plan appeared to be in a lengthy holding pattern. "Pete McGowan knows he'll be committing political suicide if he allows this to happen," she said.
Otherwise, it has been smooth sailing for Southwest.
US Airways, which made a run at Islip in the 1990s but pulled out its jets in 1997 as part of an overall restructuring, now offers service to Albany, Philadelphia and Boston on limited-seating prop jets. The company, which says it holds an untenable niche between major full-service airlines and discount carriers like Southwest, has staked its future on Justice Department approval of a merger with United Airlines. The implications of the merger, which Southwest opposes, are unclear for Islip.
Another Southwest competitor, Continental Express, a wholly owned subsidiary of Texas-based Continental Airlines, barely has a toe in at Islip. Twice-daily flights to Continental's Cleveland hub connect to Midwest and West Coast cities and elsewhere. There were no plans to expand.
A Continental spokeswoman, Julie Gardner, said her airline welcomed the Southwest challenge. "We have effectively competed head-to-head with Southwest for decades in Texas," she said. "Competition is what this industry is all about."
Ms. Turneabe-Connelly said the airline held fares down with 20-minute airport turnarounds, 10 minutes faster than the industry average, lower training and maintenance costs for a fleet made up exclusively of Boeing 737's, no-frills service and no assigned seating.
"As a company, everything we do is aimed at keeping our costs low," Ms. Turneabe-Connelly said. "But we don't purport to be all things to all people. Some travelers want their seats assigned and we can't be that way. That's not who we are. And we don't serve meals."
Ms. Turneabe-Connelly said Southwest believed competition was healthy for the flying public. "The more competition in any marketplace, the more choices a consumer has," she said. "It not only gives more travel options, but it tends to keep fares down."
Asked if there were any signs Southwest success at Islip had lessened competition there, she replied, "I haven't seen that. We hope that doesn't happen."

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC; 
Look to the Internet

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 A lot is happening in new classical music, but the economic and social realities that once fostered the performance of music in concert halls no longer support that system of distribution. Many Americans have never attended a live concert. 
What Virgil Thomson derisively called "canned music" has become the standard way in which nearly all of us hear music. 
 New audiences for contemporary music -- for all music -- can be built, but that will depend on changes in the dissemination of music, through ways suggested by Napster. I may not want to own the complete music of Conlon Nancarrow or Morton Feldman, but I would love to call them up over the Internet and have a chance to purchase pieces individually.
With listeners caught between formal (and inconvenient) concert halls and costly compact discs, it is no wonder that so few people are listening. Increase availability and let us listen at home. The future isn't in concert halls; it's on the Internet.

New Roc City Developer Has Plans for White Plains

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
AFTER a decade of store shutdowns in stretches of the once-thriving downtown area of White Plains, officials at City Hall and downtown property owners are welcoming plans by the developer Louis R. Cappelli to build a $250 million movie, residential and retail development where an abandoned Macy's department store now stands.
 City officials see the project providing new life in the downtown area, as well as new sales tax revenues for the city's coffers. 
 Business owners like Leon Silverman, the president of the Silverman Realty Group, which owns 300,000 square feet of retail space in 11 buildings downtown, are also eager for Mr. Cappelli to begin his project. Mr. Silverman, who now charges $15 to $20 a square foot annually for property he leases, predicts that with new activity downtown, real estate values will rise and he will be able to attract new tenants eager to be close to Mr. Cappelli's White Plains Town Center. 
But individual shopkeepers like Manny Polloni, who owns American Terrain, a sporting goods store on nearby Post Road, are not so sure that they will benefit from the project. Mr. Polloni is worried that yet another mall in a city where three malls have already siphoned off most of the retail business from the streets would mean even more competition for small business owners -- especially if the new stores duplicate the merchandise that existing businesses already offer. "It could cannibalize us," he said. "I hope Mr. Cappelli takes into consideration the shops that are already here and offers a complementary mix of retail."
The developer, who built New Roc City, the sports and entertainment complex in New Rochelle, revealed his latest plans to White Plains officials on April 24, after acquiring the property from the Manhattan developer Tishman Speyer Properties for $17 million. The plans for the 495,000-square-foot retail complex include a 3,500-seat multiscreen movie theater, a major clothing chain, a home improvement outlet, an electronics store and a Target discount store.
Mr. Cappelli, who acquired the Concord and Grossinger's hotel properties in the Catskills in 1999, also plans to build 500 apartments in two 18-story buildings in downtown White Plains on nearby E. J. Conroy Drive. Rents would range from $1,700 for a one-bedroom apartment to $2,400 for a two-bedroom unit. Bruce M. Berg, executive vice president of Cappelli Enterprises, said the company had received inquiries from interested rental apartment developers, lending credence to the notion that there is strong demand for high-end rental units in Westchester. 
Mr. Berg said the apartments, which would be within walking distance of the Metro-North train station, would appeal to career couples, single professionals and empty nesters. The commute to Grand Central Station is 33 minutes.
"Compared to rents in New York City, this would be a bargain," he noted.
MR. BERG observed that 500 apartments would "bring to White Plains 750 or more new residents with significant disposable income, who would generate all kinds of buying power." He also said that the downtown, which tends to be deserted after the office buildings empty out, would see new evening activity.
The project would also include a 2,038-space garage to replace an existing 1,045-space parking structure.
In addition, Cappelli Enterprises has begun talks to acquire other properties near the Macy's site, which is at Mamaroneck Avenue and Main Street. Among the properties is a Fleet Bank branch on Main Street, which may become part of the project. Mr. Berg said the company was in active negotiations with property owners and there were no plans at present to take any property by eminent domain, a legal tool sometimes employed in urban redevelopment projects.
Cappelli Enterprises is also in talks about purchasing a vacant former A&P store on Main Street, and the developer is seeking to acquire a Citibank branch on Main Street.
For the retailing portion of the current plan, Cappelli Enterprises is negotiating with two home-design chains: Expo Design Centers, a subsidiary of the Home Depot, and Sears Great Indoors, a home-design offshoot of the catalog giant, which has a department store across the street from Macy's on Main Street.
Two clothing chains, Gap and Old Navy, and two electronics chains, the Wiz and Circuit City Stores, have also made inquiries about locating in the Town Center.
All of the retail stores and restaurants on the main level of the four-level retail-entertainment center would have entrances to the street. The theater would be on the third floor.
Mr. Cappelli, who plans to start razing the 328,000-square-foot former Macy's store in August, expects to gain building approvals from the city within three months. After the demolition is carried out, the project would take 18 months to complete.
City officials have indicated that approvals will be granted quickly, especially because they are eager for the redevelopment of the downtown to begin. "Any delays on the city's part," Mr. Silverman warned, "could doom this project. The economy is favorable now to developers." 
Tishman Speyer had planned a similar complex on the site, but dropped its plans for a residential component. Then last September, it backed out of the deal altogether, when Loews Cineplex, the prospective theater manager, filed for bankruptcy, reflecting the industry's troubles after years of overbuilding large multiplexes. White Plains has been without a movie theater for 10 years, when a twin-screen theater at the Galleria mall shut down.
Cappelli Enterprises has talked with five movie exhibitors: Clearview Cinemas Inc., a unit of the Cablevision Systems Corporation, which has the Cinema 100 in Greenburgh and the Rye Ridge Twin in Rye Brook; National Amusements Inc., which operates multiplexes in Elmsford, Hawthorne and Yonkers; Regal Cinemas, which runs an 18-screen movie theater and IMAX theater in New Roc City; Muvico Theaters of Boca Raton, Fla.; and Star Theatres of Grand Rapids, Mich.
Thrilled that his city may once again be home to a movie theater -- but aware that roadblocks could still be erected -- Mayor Joseph M. Delphino said recently, "I won't be happy until I am served my first bag of popcorn."
To provide incentives for the developer, the city has agreed to spend $23 million for the new parking garage.
"That's a lot of money for a city like White Plains," said City Councilman William M. King. "I worry that we could give away the store."
Mr. King was concerned that the developer might raise the ante in the coming months. "It's not unheard of for developers to end up asking for more," he said. "An incentive package should never be so good that it depletes the city coffers and taxpayers have to make up the difference."
UNDER Tishman Speyer's proposal, which entailed a payment of $13 million by the city for the parking garage, the city would have seen a net gain of $40 million by the time a bond for the garage was paid off, said Eileen Earl, the White Plains budget director. The gain would have been realized through sales taxes generated from the project and new property taxes from the development.
Ms. Earl anticipates that under the Cappelli proposal, the net gain to the city after 25 years will be "at least as much and maybe more since there's more retail in the newest proposal."
Cappelli Enterprises is still negotiating with the city about the amount of payments it will make in lieu of property taxes.

HEADLINE: The Underbelly Of a City In Transition 

BYLINE:  By LINDA OCASIO 

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
SANDONNA BRYANT still bristles when she thinks of one former employer, who asked if she lived here because she wanted to. Yet today her pride in how Newark is newly regarded is tempered by her knowledge of how much still must be done.
 "The city turned a corner in that people are realizing its investment potential, both for commercial and housing development," said Ms. Bryant, who recently completed a five-year stint as coordinator for the Newark Community Development Network since 1996. "Unfortunately, there is resentment by long-term residents. They don't feel they are necessarily a part of the renaissance, because the focus is on downtown." 
 Ms. Bryant's sentiments are echoed by many who live and work in Newark. They can, of course, recite the litany of achievements in recent years: the opening of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the restoration and occupancy of several downtown office buildings, the return of the minor league Newark Bears baseball team and their new Riverfront Stadium. 
Even the streets are safer, the Newark Police Department says, noting that homicides, robberies and burglaries have declined by more than 50 percent since 1995.
Still, many of those improvements have had little effect on the city's poorest residents, insists Ms. Bryant and others who work in the city's social service agencies. Three decades of social upheaval -- race riots, drug dealing and muggings and carjackings -- have taken their toll. And while Newark's long-awaited revival has blossomed somewhat in recent years, most residents of this depleted industrial city live deep within the shadows of the arts center and baseball stadium.
For his part, Mayor Sharpe James takes issue with those who say that Newark's revival has been focused on downtown at the expense of the neighborhoods.
"That's false political rhetoric," Mr. James said in exasperation. "People always want to compare downtown to the neighborhoods, but that's completely false."
The city itself is divided into five wards: the North, home to most of the city's Hispanic population; the East, a bustling neighborhood of Portuguese and newcomer Brazilian groups; the West, which touches part of South Orange, and is home to working-class and low-income families; the South, once home to the middle-class Jewish community immortalized in Philip Roth's novels, now predominantly middle-class and working-class black families with many single-family homes. The Central Ward, where the riots erupted in 1967, destroying the Springfield Avenue shopping district, has seen many of its high-rise public housing buildings demolished, replaced by low-rise, mixed-income homes.
As for the mayor, he pointed out that many community development corporations, like New Community Corporation, received land, money or both from the city for neighborhood projects. As an example, he cited the city's partnership with New Community to build a $4.8 million community center on Hayes Street, although "our name doesn't appear anywhere."
In addition, the mayor said that the lion's share of the federal block grants that the city received went toward neighborhood housing, and that homeownership in the city rose to 26 percent today from 14 percent in 1986, the year he took office; nationwide, that rate is 49 percent.
Indeed, increasing homeownership has been part of the city's successful strategy to reduce crime, the mayor said. "You can't put a cop on every corner. The best cop is a homeowner. They won't tolerate nonsense in the neighborhood."
That is one point on which the Rev. William J. Linder, director of New Community Corporation, agrees with the mayor. "We're getting more home ownership in the city, and I think that will be a significant change agent," said Mr. Linder, who has been the pastor of St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church in the Central Ward for nearly 38 years.
He started New Community in 1968 to help the Central Ward recover from the devastation of the riots. Over four decades, he estimated that New Community had built about 3,000 housing units -- primarily rentals -- in the Central and West Wards, with more homes on the drawing board that would be for sale.
In addition, in 1982, after years of petitioning the city for a new supermarket, New Community decided to go into commercial development itself, and the result was a $19 million Pathmark Shopping Center that serves about 50,000 shoppers a week with a supermarket, doughnut shop, mailbox store and food court.
Yet Mr. Linder parts company with the mayor on the issue of the community center, which he said cost $2.6 million, half of which New Community put up when the city's original plan to convert a former bathhouse and pool into a center fell through.
"We made a commitment to run it," he said. "It's not the Sharpe James Community Center."
Mr. Linder said the surest sign of the city's failure to revitalize the neighborhoods was most apparent in the public schools, which have been run by the state since 1995. 
"It's more about power and control than it is about children," he said. With $1.5 billion in state funds coming into Newark for school construction, there has been "a frenzy for control," he said, citing April's school board elections, which saw three allies of the mayor win seats on a school board that is slowly being empowered once again under state guidelines. "Money gets everyone excited, but not the quality of education."
Ms. Bryant, the development coordinator, was born 30 years ago and reared on South 11th Street in the South Ward, attended the city's Science High School and went on to graduate from Yale University in 1993 before returning to Newark -- a decision that not everyone understands.
"I feel a lot of pride," she said of the city's renaissance.
But like others, she fears that the prosperity -- which was beginning to take shape downtown before the economy recently began slowing -- is for the most part not trickling down to the people who call Newark home, primarily those of color or who speak Spanish.
"I don't want to perpetuate that division, but that's how people feel, whether it's reality or perceived," she said. "They want parity and they want to see resources applied to the neighborhoods."
But the deputy mayor for housing and economic development, Alfred Faiella, said that 90 percent of federal block grants, which total about $11 million in Newark, go to community agencies.
On the other hand, private investment in the downtown area, which is closest to the East and North wards, is in the $200 million range, Mr. Faiella said -- half of which has gone toward construction of new office buildings, and half toward renovating existing structures.
Moreover, Ms. Bryant, like many others in the city, say they worry that the lack of regional planning to address problems in older outlying areas like Irvington and East Orange will undermine Newark's revival.
The deputy mayor also countered critics who said the city had done no planning with the neighboring communities. "We've taken a lead with regional planning involving transportation, highway and waterfront development," he said.
But the experts who monitor such activity say Newark has not done enough -- either locally or regionally.
"There hasn't been a lot of planning at all that considers how to build and sustain a community, how to make Newark livable long-term," said Baye Wilson, director of the New Jersey office of the Regional Planning Association. "That kind of planning demands open space, recreation space, housing that is built to scale, all of which is part of the fabric of a community." 
James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said in particular there had been "precious little" regional planning.
"Everyone is grappling for themselves," Mr. Hughes said. "New Jersey has a tradition of home-rule and lack of cooperation, but substantial competition."
Dennis Gale, director of the Joseph C. Cornwall Center for Metropolitan Studies at Rutgers in Newark, agreed. "Newark may have a regional approach when it comes to transportation, a 'benign issue,' " Mr. Gale said, "but when it comes to housing, crime and education, look out. Everyone wants home rule when those issues come up."
THE persistence of the drug trade is evident on street corners, where on some blocks new housing and drug dens are neighbors. One brazen dealer advertised "Cowboy Crack," with a spray-painted sign on the doors of a turquoise house at the end of Holland Street near Springfield Avenue in the Central Ward.
Many new homes in the Central and South Wards have elaborate gates on windows and doors, a testimony to residents' lingering fears for their safety. On one recent spring day, Fairmount Street at South Orange Avenue in the Central Ward, close to West Ward, was barricaded as part of a police strategy to stem drug traffic. In the Central Ward, the huge Stella Wright housing project awaits demolition, and looms behind a row of new townhouses like a bad dream that will not go away. 
According to figures compiled by the New Jersey State Police, Newark averaged more than 10,000 violent crimes a year from 1989 to 1995. By 1999, the number of murders, rapes and aggravated assaults had fallen below 5,000 a year. In January, the city trumpeted that its increase in crime for the year 2000 was the lowest since the agency has began reporting annual statistics 33 years ago. Rapes, assaults and robberies were down by more than 50 percent from 1995, and homicides were down 43 percent -- from 101 to 58 -- for the same period.
Corene Sampson 68, who has lived here since she arrived from Florida 1952, wonders if the renaissance will ever reach all of Newark's residents -- or simply benefit the outsiders who did not stick by Newark in the gloomy aftermath of the 1967 race riots.
Ms. Sampson said that although she can see some improvements from her house -- built by the Corinthian Housing Development Corp., one of the community development corporations spawned by area churches -- she still doesn't feel safe because of the drug dealing going on in the open in her neighborhood.
Long separated from her husband, Ms. Sampson has been living in the development since 1998 with her 14-year-old great-granddaughter. Her son died several years ago of pneumonia; her daughter and granddaughter have been incapacitated by chronic illnesses; she also has three other great-grandchildren.
Ms. Sampson said she was frustrated because there was no supermarket within walking distance. "So many things are supposed to be started, but it's not reaching people yet," she said.
Carol Williams, 40, who has lived in Newark since arriving here from Tacoma, Wash., as a small child, had her own definition of the word that now seems permanently affixed to Newark: "Renaissance -- it means to keep us out. You're building it up, but are you building it for us or our children? There's no way you can afford a townhouse on welfare."
For Ms. Williams, the struggle to raise her two daughters, ages 20 and 18, and a 16-year-old son, has been documented in the book "No Easy Walk: Newark, 1980-1993" (Temple University Press, 1994) by Helen M. Stummer, a photojournalist.
Ms. Sampson and Ms. Williams can both attest that any number of problems continue to bedevil the city. For instance, figures compiled by the Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University show that the city's unemployment rate is twice that of the state, and that one in four Newark residents earns less than a poverty-level income, and more than 40 percent of all low-income renters pay more than half their income in rent. 
While Newark, like many old Northeastern cities, has seen a major decline in its non-Hispanic English-speaking people in recent years, blacks have also left in large numbers.
From 1980 to 2000, the number of residents who considered themselves non-Hispanic white declined by 33,950, or nearly 50 percent. At the same time, the non-Hispanic black population decreased by 46,637, almost 25 percent.
Most of this decline occurred during the 1980's; what has helped stabilize the city's population has been an influx of Hispanics, who grew by more than 10,000 in the 1980's and by almost 9,000 in the 1990's. Put another way, in 1980 about one in five Newark residents was Hispanic, as against one in three today.
DEEP within the neighborhoods of Newark, no one is more vulnerable than the children. About 80 percent of the students in the Newark public schools, or 35,172 of them, receive a reduced or free breakfast and lunch at school, according to figures supplied to the school district and compiled in Newark Kids Count 2000, a report published annually by the Association for Children of New Jersey. The organization also found that Newark's infant mortality rate was double that of the state, and that preventative care for impoverished children remained an issue.
"Immunization rates are still near the bottom of the list, compared to other municipalities and states, lead poisoning is still a concern," said Gina Lucas, Newark outreach coordinator for the association. "I'm excited that there's more attention being paid to the city and more development going on, but we continue to be concerned about Newark's children, and the needs of children are not being met. We need to see these indicators improve. Until children and their families are thriving, I wouldn't call it a renaissance."
Nor are the adults -- particularly those without jobs -- having an easy time of it.
"We are seeing an increase in the number of working people seeking help, people coming in because they can't make rent," said Jeannette Page-Hawkins, executive director of Newark Emergency Services for Families. Indeed, a 1998 study by the Institute for Children and Poverty found that 44 percent of the homeless families in Newark were never on welfare. Newark Emergency Services, situated in the renovated Continental Ballroom building on Broad Street, serves about 45,000 people in Essex County with a homeless drop-in center, food vouchers and temporary assistance for rent, utility bills, child care and transportation. 
What surprised many experts, however, was the increase in the number of people with jobs who were still struggling to find affordable housing and pay their bills.
"No one foresaw the working poor," said Maria Vizcarrondo-DeSoto, president and chief executive of the United Way of Essex and West Hudson, who expressed concern about what would happen when those who had not found employment by the spring of 2002 were dropped from the rolls, as mandated by federal law. "We're waiting for the other shoe to drop. We may find ourselves in a major crisis."
Moroever, Ms. Vizcarrondo-DeSoto said that many residents lacked the technical skills for the jobs available, so that organizations "can't match families with the opportunities that are there."
To be sure, Newark's unemployment rate has fallen, though the numbers are still troubling: Last year, 8.1 percent of city residents -- or more than twice the state's overall unemployment rate of 3.8 percent -- who sought work could not find it. While the unemployment rate was much higher five years ago -- 12.9 percent -- the decline was caused by an increase in about 2,000 jobs coupled with a reduction of 3,800 in the number of residents considered to be in the job market.
As for the city's public schools, which have been under state control for nearly seven years, the dropout rate has hovered at 7 to 8 percent over the last five years, as against from 3 to 4 percent for the average high school in the state. At one high school, Weequahic in the South Ward, the drop-out rate was almost 14 percent last year, state figures show.
"It will take a number of generations to truly transform the schools," Ms. Vizcarrondo-DeSoto said.
Ms. Vizcarrondo-DeSoto was among 22 civic leaders on the 21st Century Task Force -- formed in 1997 to evaluate what steps were necessary to improve the city -- which last year recommended several steps to implement a far-reaching and enduring revival:
* Improve the city's image among nonresidents.
* Increase the city's role in, and contribution to, the regional economy.
* Improve the city's ailing public schools.
The recommendations included insuring that residents had access to the jobs generated by new investment in the city, especially in construction; cleaning up such eyesores as the abandoned Pabst/Hoffman bottling plant on South Orange Avenue; and establishing a citizens' panel to monitor school management and financial issues.
"We've got to find a way to strategically plan things," she said. "There's no regional approach to development, and when one group benefits, another group suffers."
She said she was particularly disturbed by the problems facing Orange, East Orange and Irvington. 
"They used to be the suburban connection, and those areas are now becoming blighted and depressed," she said, noting that Newark's progress may have an unintended "rippling effect" that simply relocates poverty. 
Despite the challenges, Ms. remains Vizcarrondo-DeSoto is optimistic.
"At this point, I'm encouraged," she said, making a point of crediting the work of such community-based organizations as New Community Corporation and La Casa de Don Pedro that were advocates for impoverished residents long before private investors jumped in. 
OVER the years, Gerard Joab has worked hand in hand with many of those groups as senior program director of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, which provides financial grants to such local organizations as La Casa de Don Pedro, the Corinthian Housing Development Corporation and the St. James Development Corporation, which build affordable housing -- notable for quality and affordability -- for renters and buyers.
Mr. Joab remembers that when he arrived here in 1986, "everyone cleared out after 5 p.m., but today it's changed. People are walking around and working late."
He also cited improved city services, especially the police. Still, he said he thought that there was too little planning going on to ensure that longtime, low-income residents were not priced out of their city. "A healthy neighborhood has a blend of mixed incomes," he said. 
Many nonprofit organizations depend on the city for at least some financial support, and the directors of those groups are cautious in their criticism of Newark and its main cheerleader, the mayor.
Mayor James "has been attentive and accessible to us, and certainly put up money for what we're doing," Mr. Joab said, "but in some cases the city didn't have the ability to move as quickly as we want."
Moving quickly -- to take advantage of the current momentum and attention being focused on Newark -- is important to Mr. Joab and others who have long waited for this moment. From his office in the North Ward, Raymond Ocasio, president of La Casa de Don Pedro, sees firsthand the influx of Ecuadorians, Dominicans, Mexicans and Peruvians.
In addition to building homes, La Casa offers an immigrant rights program, English classes, job referrals, nutrition information and child care. The new immigrants are joining the long-established Puerto Rican community and putting down their own stakes by opening restaurants, travel agencies, repair shops, beauty shops. He knows that there is still much to be done, but Mr. Ocasio compares Newark with Harlem, which is also attracting new investors and fresh excitement about its possibilities.
"Harlem is hot, and Harlem is still hell," he said. "You're always transitioning into something. Right now I believe we're on the upswing."

HEADLINE: BRIEFING: THE ECONOMY; 
TOURISM REVENUE

BYLINE:  By Karen DeMasters 

 BODY:
Tourists' spending in New Jersey increased last year by 7 percent over 1999, compared with an average increase of only 1 percent nationwide, according to a study released last week. 
Tourists spent $30 billion in New Jersey in 2000 by making 169.1 million trips to or within the state, an increase from the 166.9 million trips the previous year. Canadians accounted for the largest number of tourists from a foreign country with 710,000 trips.

HEADLINE: Fatter Horse Race Purses Are Good for the Economy 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In "They Subsidize Horses, Don't They?" (Soapbox, April 29), about state subsidies to purses at racetracks, Jon Shure doesn't seem to understand why the state of New Jersey decided to provide a financial boost to its horse racing industry at this time. 
 It was somewhat gratifying to read that he did recognize that the horse industry has a major, positive impact on the state's economy. The direct infusion of money from the state will obviously enable New Jersey racetracks to offer larger purses and keep pace with racetracks in other jurisdictions that have either done the same (Maryland) or have other financial tools that produce money for the tracks to raise purses (slot machines in Delaware and Ontario, Canada, and off-track and telephone-account wagering in New York and Pennsylvania). 
Parimutuel racetracks are only the tip of the iceberg. There are hundreds of thousands of acres of open farmland being preserved by horse farms and millions of dollars of tax revenue to the state from purchases of supplies and feed, not to mention the horses themselves.
This purse supplement is a much-needed boost for racing and for the state. It will pay for itself many times over and prove to be one of the best investments made in New Jersey. This is quite a bargain when one considers racing is not a high-cost franchise, and the residual effects help the economy.
The reason that the recent law was enacted is that New Jersey lawmakers have so far not been able to agree on legislation to adopt those other financial tools. If the state had enacted other laws that would create new revenue for horse racing, the purse supplements would not have been needed.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chrysler Sebring convertible; 
Like Summer, Sunny and Mild

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
A WARM Michigan spring prompted the early arrival of blooming flowers, budding trees and convertibles emerging from winter storage.
 Spring brings births, too, and there are some newborns in the convertible nursery, with other deliveries set for later this year and next. Several of these -- the 2002 Lexus SC 430 that recently went on sale, the reborn Ford Thunderbird coming this fall, a Cadillac roadster due in 2002 -- are on the pricey side. 
 But what about the masses? Shouldn't open-air motoring be available to those who weren't born into privilege or didn't bail out of dot-coms before the collapse? 
A few years ago, several convertibles were sold in America for less than $20,000, including the tiny Geo Metro, the appealing Toyota Paseo, the jaunty Honda del Sol, the economical Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire. Now, though, the least expensive convertibles are the $21,025 Volkswagen Cabrio, the $21,660 Mazda Miata and the $23,010 Ford Mustang.
There are also the $25,175 Chevrolet Camaro and the $26,050 Pontiac Firebird, but these dated cars will soon be phased out. The Toyota MR2 Spyder is great fun for two people, if they don't bring more than a change of underwear. The Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder will handle two more passengers -- if they are small and wiry. 
If you expect practicality with your sunshine, and your budget won't cover a Saab or a Volvo, your convertible choices are pretty much limited to the Toyota Camry Solara or the Chrysler Sebring. The Solara is a perfectly nice car, but its $25,550 base price gets you only a four-cylinder engine. (And good luck finding a car at that price.)
That leaves the Sebring, which comes with a V-6 and a lot of features for $24,995, as the convertible for all occasions. A stalwart of car-rental fleets in sunny vacation destinations like Hawaii, Florida and California, it is elegant enough to look at home in exclusive resorts, but lacks the pretensions of convertibles from importers like BMW, Jaguar and Mercedes.
Redesigned for the first time since it arrived in 1996 as the LeBaron's replacement, the 2001 Sebring still has everything that made it the nation's best-selling soft top. It is stylish -- even sexy, some might say. It has roomy, accessible accommodations for four adults. The trunk is generous, at least by convertible standards.
While the styling is new, the look is not terribly different from last year's model. A redesigned hood and deck lid put more edge into the wedge shape. Front-end changes, like an oval egg-crate grille, chrome moldings and a retro Chrysler badge set between chrome wings, give it a greater resemblance to other cars in the Chrysler family. The rear also incorporates the winged badge and chrome license-plate trim found on other Chryslers. The deck lid is better integrated into the design.
The interior also got a needed freshening. In back-to-back drives of 2000 and 2001 models around Detroit's suburbs, I was struck by how dated last year's car already felt, with its flat dashboard panels and materials that looked and felt cheap. The new Sebring has curved surfaces, better materials and touches of bright trim around the door handles and gauges. All this contributes to the look and feel of a more expensive car.
Two adults can truly sit comfortably in the rear seat. Getting back there is relatively easy, too, because the front shoulder belts are integrated into the seats, so they don't pose a barrier that you have to climb over or crawl under. And the integrated belts give the car a clean, uncluttered look when the top is down.
There are three versions: LX, LXi and Limited. All have more standard features this year, but side air bags are, unfortunately, still not available. The Limited comes only in royal blue with a matching top, plus a cream leather interior trimmed in blue. The look evokes fine European convertibles, like Aston Martins.
The most significant difference between the '00 and '01 Sebrings is the way they ride and drive, which is where engineers made the biggest changes. The convertible shares its underbody with the new Sebring and Dodge Stratus sedans, and it is built with those models in Michigan. (In contrast, the Sebring and Stratus coupes are stepsiblings of the Mitsubishi Eclipse and are built in a Mitsubishi plant in Illinois.) The '01 has a more solid body structure than before, and the greater rigidity was the first thing I noticed in moving from the old car to the new one. Like Jerry Lee Lewis, the 2000 model had a whole lotta shakin' goin' on.
Still, my '01 test car, an "inferno red" LX with a beige interior and a $26,280 sticker, had some mild jitters, too. The handling has been improved -- the suspension was revised, and larger wheels and tires were added -- but not as much I would have liked. Enthusiasts will be happier with the exceptionally solid BMW 325 convertible, but they will have to pay $10,000 more.
The new Sebring is markedly quieter inside. The power top is well insulated, and the glass back window comes with a defroster. One button lowers the top and all four side windows.
The '01 has also received a more refined engine. An aluminum 2.7-liter twin-cam V-6 replaces the 2.5-liter, single-cam unit of last year, providing a needed boost in power (to 200 horsepower, from 168) and torque (192 foot-pounds, from 170). Still, the Sebring won't set any speed records, even if it is named for the Florida racetrack. The fuel economy rating is slightly better: 20 m.p.g. in town and 28 on the highway.
The transmission is a four-speed automatic. An AutoStick shifter, which allows manual shifting without a clutch, is standard on the Limited, optional on the LXi.
All models get four-wheel disc brakes this year, but you still pay extra on the LX and LXi for an antilock system. The Limited comes with ABS Plus, a stability-control system that helps to keep the car from skidding out of control in sudden maneuvers.
Of course, drivers of this mild-mannered summer cruiser aren't likely to push its limits very often. The Sebring is more sunny than hot, and as casually stylish as a small but relaxing house on the beach.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK HARBOR; 
Think Parking Is Scarce? Pity the Poor Oil Tanker

BYLINE:  By ERIK BAARD 

 BODY:
New York City's time-honored way of greeting visitors -- sending them circling for parking -- can frustrate the most resourceful driver. But try cruising into town with a blocklong oil tanker or an aircraft carrier (Fleet Week starts on May 23) and you'll know how cramped this town really is.
 The parking jam in New York Harbor, a result of economic factors and cleaner local waters, extends to commercial and recreational vessels. 
 In January and February, typically the harbor's busiest months for commercial activity, requests by ships and barges for spots to anchor shot up 85 percent over the comparable 1999 period, said Lt. Michael Day, chief of the Coast Guard's waterways oversight branch for New York.
One reason is oil prices. The harbor is the largest American port for petroleum products, and many local refineries that hoped last autumn's high prices would soften by winter bought heating oil at the last minute.
But other goods are also arriving at record levels. "The amount of cargo coming in through here is projected to double by 2010 and more than quadruple by 2040," said Dan Maynard, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
And, as more ships come in, they must wait longer for the overwhelmed barge fleet to unload them, added Capt. Andrew McGovern, who guides ships into the harbor and is chairman of the harbor operations committee, an umbrella group. 
Commercial ships and barges can currently anchor in three areas of deep water near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, and two small, shallower areas, one surrounding Liberty Island and one near Ellis Island. Lieutenant Day says the Coast Guard plans to ease the anchorage squeeze by limiting the time ships can linger in the port and by nudging owners of smaller barges to use the shallower anchorages. To sweeten this medicine, the Coast Guard also wants to merge the two smaller anchorages, swallowing a 200-yard wide channel between them that is no longer much used.
As for recreational boats, the waiting list for slips at the 79th Street boat basin has surged 30 percent in six months. This has forced the city to limit stays and to expand its mooring field little by little into a Navy anchorage by the Upper West Side.
"The idea is that everyone who has a decent boat should have a place to tie up," said Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern. The city also has mooring fields in Brooklyn and Staten Island, and along with the Coast Guard is exploring other possible anchorages for pleasure boats. ERIK BAARD

When a Stamp Was 2 cents and Their Tuition Was Free

BYLINE:  By TARA BAHRAMPOUR 

 BODY:
Rebecca Abramson remembers well her first teaching assignment at Manual Training High School in Park Slope, Brooklyn. The year was 1931, and Ms. Abramson was 22, a freshly minted graduate of Hunter College. 
 On the first day, her students, big, hulking boys who played craps in the back of the classroom, told her they planned to leave school as soon as they could join the Navy. But within weeks, "the teach," as they called Ms. Abramson, had them quoting from "Macbeth" and offering commentary on his wife. 
 "They said, 'Ooh, what a dame!' she recalled. "They said, 'I wouldn't want to be her husband.' "
Ms. Abramson, 91, was one of 22 women celebrating the 70th reunion for Hunter College graduates at the Sheraton New York Hotel last weekend. They recalled when a postage stamp cost 2 cents and unemployed men sold apples on the street, but tuition at Hunter, all of whose students were women, was free. Many of the 800 who graduated in 1931 could not have attended otherwise. 
Many were daughters of immigrants, the first in their families to attend college. Many went on to professional careers as teachers, chemists, judges, musicians, statisticians and engineers. But for young women seeking work during the Depression, when unemployment hovered around 20 percent, the road was hard.
"No matter what job it was, you were overqualified and overeducated," said Rose Apfelberg, who became chief probation officer in Brooklyn Family Court. 
Sophie Bobb, a mathematics major, described an interview with "one man who said, 'If I were you, I'd look for a job elsewhere, because I don't think we'd hire a woman.' "
Like many classmates, the only job Ms. Bobb found after graduation was at Macy's. She later joined the Navy, finally getting work as a teacher after World War II.
Sometimes the biases ran closer to home. Mildred Cohn Primakoff, a chemistry major, recalled advice from her department chairman.
"He told us that he didn't think it was ladylike for us to become chemists," she said. "He wanted us all to become teachers of chemistry."
But Ms. Cohn Primakoff worked as a chemist and later became a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.
As the women exchanged stories, Dorothea E. Donaldson, a retired judge, asked: "Do you remember Annie Hickinbottom, the dean of the school? She used to say, 'If you tell a Hunter girl that she can't do something, she just takes away the T' " from can't.
That saying applied to deans too, Ms. Donaldson said. "She retired at 70 and got married." TARA BAHRAMPOUR

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on May 13 with an article in the Neighborhood Report pages about the 70th reunion of the Hunter College class of 1931 misidentified two members. The woman at the left was Tessie Karper, not Sophie Bobb. The woman at the center was Mollie Polinsky, not Rose Apfelberg. A classmate's letter dated May 17 pointed out the error; this correction was delayed by an editing lapse.

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS for MARTIN REYNOLDS; 
A Computer Price War Leaves Buyers Smiling

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
 PERSONAL-COMPUTER shoppers may not realize it, but they are benefiting from a price war among suppliers desperate for their business. Price cuts on PC's may seem like business as usual. After all, the PC industry routinely pares prices as components improve. But the new bargains also reflect a brawl unlike any the industry has seen. Martin Reynolds, an analyst at Gartner Dataquest in San Jose, Calif., spoke last Thursday about the causes and effects. BARNABY J. FEDER

Q. How did the PC price war begin?

A. We reached a situation where the market was saturated in 2000. People who needed computers had them. It might have begun in 1999, but it was masked by companies buying new computers to prepare for Y2K. Vendors are living on sales of replacements, at least in the United States. But that doesn't give you the kind of the growth these companies were used to. In the past, most price cuts came from falling prices for processors and other components. In addition, manufacturers have been narrowing profit margins for the last couple years. But when demand dried up last fall, the more aggressive manufacturers decided to try to gain market share by cutting prices to the bone. This is an all-out battle for market share.

Q. How far and how rapidly do you expect PC prices to drop this time?

A. They've gone about as far as they are going to. It will stay at $600 PC's at the low end of the business market for a while. At that level, even a $20 price cut can move markets. For a buyer purchasing thousands of machines, that's worth having. But it might also be enough to make a manufacturer walk away. It's hard though to really separate out how much of what we are calling a price war is margin cutting and how much is the normal downward trend in pricing. The average price has probably dropped about 20 percent, but what's more important on the business side is that purchasers are buying more of the cheapest machines, which have the narrowest profit margins. It hasn't bitten so deeply in the home segment. I.B.M. left a bit of space there when it exited the residential market last year. Prices actually rose early last year. The others didn't overbuild, so when Christmas was disappointing, there was less of an adjustment.

Q. How do PC price wars affect brand perception?

A. Compaq and H.-P. Hewlett-Packard are taking all of the oxygen out of the home market. These are fearsomely efficient companies. They've starved out the marginal suppliers in the stores. There was a real variety of manufacturers in the mid-90's that were viewed as acceptable brands. They're gone. Gateway and Apple are still somewhat viable because they have distinct markets. Gateway's stores give them good access to first-time buyers. Apple has a product line that appeals to the education segment. Apple is not as pricing-constrained as long as they offer distinguishable features. The growth days of 30 to 40 percent aren't going to come back. There won't be room for marginal players to get back in.

Q. Is this price war linked to pricing of other consumer electronics products?

A. Digital cameras and hand-helds like Palm have been good alternatives for consumer spending. They were very attractive when computers cost up to $2,000. But as the PC price drops, the others feel more competitive pressure. The slow sales of hand-helds this year are a function of the economy but also the aggressive pricing of the PC's.

Q. How do you expect the price war to end?

A. Someone is going to have to exit the market. But it will be a slow death requiring many quarters of punishment. Everyone is seeing how long they can hold their breath under water. It will probably be I.B.M., H.-P. or Compaq. Gateway has nowhere else to go, nor does Dell. The manufacturers have only got a few tens of dollars of profit in the box to start with. But it's hard to tell how much they are hurting. Some of them seem to be in the red now, but it could be supporting other parts of the business. So it's not just a question of getting out automatically making you more profitable.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Peter J. R. Trapp; 
Needham Growth Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
STORMY weather ahead? Peter J. R. Trapp, who runs the $170 million Needham Growth fund, has a full complement of foul-weather gear.
 Unlike most other fund managers, Mr. Trapp is permitted by the fund's charter to short stocks -- that is, to bet on price declines. The approach was especially profitable in April and May of last year, when technology stocks were being routed. He can also hedge his portfolio against falling prices with options and can retreat into cash when the stock market looks particularly dicey. 
 Cash now accounts for 25 percent of the fund's assets, a record high. Short positions are just 10 percent, mostly in health maintenance organizations, restaurants and a few technology companies, businesses that have been hurt by the economic slowdown. An additional 10 percent is hedged in other ways. "It's not a lot," Mr. Trapp said from his office in Midtown Manhattan, "because I think we're through the worst of the earnings season, and the market feels that it wants to continue lifting."
All the storm gear serves one purpose, he said: "We short stocks and hedge the portfolio as a way to offset risk and reduce volatility, especially in technology stocks. This fund can be run very conservatively."
Mr. Trapp's ability to maneuver through good and bad markets has served investors well. The fund returned 33.5 percent a year, on average, for the three years ended Thursday, compared with 9.2 percent for its midcap growth peers and 5.6 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc. It returned 7.6 percent for the 12 months ended Thursday, compared with a loss of 14.6 percent for its peer group and a loss of 8.2 percent for the S.& P. 500.
The investment style of Mr. Trapp, 55, can be described as growth at a reasonable price. He starts by searching among what he calls new-economy growth industries -- areas like health care, media, leisure, entertainment and technology.
The technology stake, at 57 percent of assets, is down from about 75 percent or 80 percent at the start of 2000. "We've been scaling back as the bear market hit," he said.
The 60 to 120 stocks in the fund are mostly American companies with market capitalizations of up to $1.5 billion or so. He first looks for companies whose multiples of price to earnings, or price to earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes and amortization, are no more than half of the companies' three-year earnings growth rates.
"We're not necessarily looking for low-priced stocks," Mr. Trapp said. "We're willing to buy a stock selling for a 20 multiple if we're convinced that it's a 40 percent grower."
TO kick the tires of companies, he gathers information from the 20 technology analysts employed by Needham Investment Management, the fund's investment adviser, as well as from Wall Street research and visits to companies.
Mr. Trapp estimates that he spends 30 percent or more of his time on the road. "I find that getting out and meeting management is absolutely the best way to get a handle on the company and its prospects," he said. "Especially in the small-cap area, you need to make sure that management is driven, has vision, is properly incentivized and can pass the 'sniff test.' "
He starts to consider selling a company when its price-to-earnings multiple equals its earnings growth rate, and generally starts trimming positions when the P/E ratio is 150 percent of that rate. Stocks are typically sold when the P/E reaches 200 percent.
The fund's turnover rate is high -- 145 percent in 2000 -- because of Mr. Trapp's short-selling, but he manages his sales with an eye on taxes. 
Mr. Trapp began buying shares of Legato Systems of Mountain View, Calif., in April 2000 at an average of $12 a share. The price of Legato, which makes storage-management software, became depressed in early 2000 after the company failed to meet earnings estimates because of what Mr. Trapp called "an overly aggressive sales force." The company named a new chief executive, David B. Wright, who restructured the sales force and hired new management.
"The key is that when you talk to everyone in Silicon Valley," Mr. Trapp said, "you find that people really like the product, even though Wall Street put the company in the doghouse for missing their numbers and for the management turnover." He called the company "a diamond in the rough" and projected that it would have a 30 percent annual earnings growth rate for the next three years.
He expects a stock price in the mid-30's by year-end. The shares now trade at $14.48.
Another favorite is Thermo Electron of Waltham, Mass. He began buying the stock in September 1999 at $16.50, saying it was "like a mutual fund of single-purpose specialty device and medical companies." At one point, the company owned as many as 25 other public companies, he said. 
"Wall Street likes things simple," he said. "It became so complicated that analysts drifted away and the stock price traded down to what we thought were unreasonably low levels." In the last year, he said, the company began selling noncore businesses and reorganizing into a unified operating company focusing on its optical, testing and medical device businesses. That ignited new interest on Wall Street. On Friday, the stock closed at $25.92.
Mr. Trapp began buying shares of Advanced Micro Devices, the maker of integrated circuits, at $9.25 in June 1999. The price was beaten down, he said, because of competition from Intel, a series of manufacturing problems and questions about management succession.
"We talked to semiconductor analysts and became convinced that the market was discounting the company almost as if it were going out of business," Mr. Trapp said. Instead, it hired new management and opened a new semiconductor plant. "Consequently, when chips became scarce and prices started increasing, they were perfectly positioned," he said. He expects earnings to increase at an average of 20 percent a year over the next three years. The shares now trade at $27.68.

As Power Prices Surge, Montana, Too, Asks Why

BYLINE:  By JIM ROBBINS 

DATELINE: BUTTE, Mont. 

 BODY:
THE last large-scale metal mine is silent in this city perched in the Rocky Mountains. The 170-ton, house-sized ore-hauling trucks, which once rumbled with loads 24 hours a day, have not fired up their engines since last summer. Nor have the conveyors, the crushers, the concentrators and the grinders. And most of the 320 workers who carved out a living extracting copper, molybdenum and silver from the 600-foot deep Continental Pit have scattered to other states and other jobs. 
 Montana Resources Inc., which owns the mine, has been out of affordable power for nine months. At the beginning of 2000, the mine was paying $26 a megawatt hour, up from $19 the year before. Last week, however, a megawatt hour cost $320. 
 While California has grabbed most of the national headlines for a power crisis caused by deregulation gone awry -- rolling blackouts resumed there last week -- another power deregulation crisis has been unfolding here in Montana. And in some ways, it is far more striking in its impact. While Californians may be somewhat protected from skyrocketing costs, Montanans are not. Paper companies, mines and other large industrial companies in Montana have been laying off workers because they cannot afford to pay their electric bills. Residents are expecting their household electric costs to as much as double by July 2002. 
A growing number of Montanans want to return to a time when their state, with its own sources of cheaply produced power, had some of the lowest electricity rates. Many residents are angry at the Legislature, which in their view deregulated the market solely at the behest of the Montana Power Company, once the state's dominant utility.
Under deregulation that took effect three years ago, Montana Power sold its hydroelectric and coal-fired generating plants to the PPL Corporation, the Allentown, Pa., company that sells power in 42 states and in Canada, England and Latin America. 
Like other owners of power generation sites, PPL has been profiting immensely under deregulation by charging rates based on the forces of supply and demand. Montana Power still distributes electric power around the state, but will soon be getting out of that business as well. 
The change has left large power consumers like Montana Resources scrambling to survive. They have scoured the region for affordable alternatives. They have asked PPL to make at least some cheaper electricity available but it is unclear if that will happen. And they have lobbied the Legislature to reregulate electrical power. 
"We've got to play all of our cards," said Greg Stricker, president of Montana Resources, as he gazed over the company's open mining pit and a giant statue of the Virgin Mary that sits high on a mountain above it. "We're faced with extinction." PPL, however, says it has no choice but to sell its power at market prices.
On a national scale, the plight of Montana, which has fewer than a million people, is not as visible as that of California, which has nearly 34 million. But Montana's experience shows what can happen when power prices spiral out of control and businesses and consumers are not protected.
Montana's power crisis is rooted in the history of the Montana Power Company. It was formed in 1912 by Anaconda Copper Mining to ensure power for Anaconda's extensive mining, milling and sawmill operations. Montana Power built hydroelectric dams on 11 rivers across the state, dams that still create power at low cost.
Anaconda was also accustomed to getting its own way. The company owned most of the state's daily newspapers until 1959 and wielded tremendous influence among elected officials. Anaconda, the historian Bernard DeVoto wrote, "maintained a more thorough-going ownership of Montana's wealth, government and inhabitants than any other corporation has ever been able to maintain in any other state." 
The Anaconda era ended in 1977 when the company was bought by Atlantic Richfield, the oil company that has since been acquired by BP P.L.C. ARCO closed the mines in 1980 and the smelter in 1983. Montana Power, which had become the state's regulated utility, outlived its creator.
By the mid-1990's, however, Montana Power was worrying about its own future. Power deregulation, a national trend, looked inevitable, and the company's big industrial customers were already shopping for sources of cheaper electricity.
So, trying to make a virtue of necessity, Montana Power began the process of getting out of the power business. It diversified, creating an Internet service provider called Touch America. It also began to push for power deregulation, saying it would result in lower costs and more customer choices. The company was hoping that deregulation would make itself attractive to investors and potential buyers.
A deregulation bill, the Electric Utility Restructuring and Customer Choice Act, was introduced in March 1997, when the legislative session was nearly over. Lawmakers, most of them farmers and ranchers and businessmen, approved it hastily.
To some critics of deregulation, the passage smacked of the era when Anaconda dictated what the Legislature should do. Ken Toole, a Democratic state senator and an opponent of the deregulation, called it a "steamroller with the mantra of free market." Montana Power disputed that interpretation. Jack Haffey, its president and chief operating officer, said, "it was not a bill pulled out of somebody's pocket and foisted on the public."
Still, Montana Power emerged with marketable power plants and its thriving Touch America business. The company sold its power plants to PPL, investing much of the proceeds in Touch America. Montana Power's shares, adjusted for an August 1999 split, soared to nearly $65 in March 2000 from less than $20 before deregulation. (The shares have since returned to a below-$20 range, closing on Friday at $16.48) Company insiders cashed in their stock options at the peak and some became rich.
And for a while, deregulation appeared to be working. Competition among power suppliers was pushing down the price of electricity. In January 1999, Montana Resources' power costs fell to $19 a megawatt hour from the regulated price of $30. 
But starting in June 2000, Mr. Stricker said, "the market started to go nuts." Rising demand, coupled with a lack of new supply, pushed up prices sharply. A megawatt hour spiked as high as $680 and then settled back into the $200-to-$400 range. Buyers of long-term contracts for electricity could get somewhat lower prices, ranging from $100 to $150, but even that was unaffordable for many. 
The region's power crisis has been aggravated recently by a drought that has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power generated. Steve Walsh, a Montana Resources spokesman, said the company's suppliers told it that rates could reach $1,000 a megawatt hour in the third quarter.
Montana's labor force, meanwhile, has suffered. Since last summer, according to the Montana affiliate of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., more than 1,000 workers have lost their jobs in layoffs caused by power price inflation. 
BUT the increased prices have been a boon to PPL. Last month, it reported its sixth consecutive quarter of record earnings. William F. Hecht, the chairman and chief executive, told the shareholders meeting on April 27 that "we are in the midst of the strongest growth period your company has ever known."
When the Montana Legislature convened this year, for the first time since power prices soared, it was besieged by worried citizens and businesses. Bills to change the law were introduced; one measure would have imposed a windfall-profits tax of 3,200 percent on power suppliers.
In the end, just one bill passed, supported by Montana Power and PPL, that shields both companies from most financial risk by giving them a right to recover costs they incur to find power for Montana consumers. In exchange for that protection, PPL tentatively agreed to sell 500 megawatts of power in Montana, up to two-thirds of what the state needs, at $40 a megawatt for five years, starting July 1. But the agreement could collapse -- Montana's Public Service Commission opposes it on grounds that power suppliers got too much. Bob Anderson, a Democratic member of the commission, said it looked as if the power suppliers had written the bill. 
Dan McCarthy, a spokesman for PPL, said it has done what it could for lower prices but had a "responsibility to our shareholders." And Ed Bartlett, who was Montana Power's chief lobbyist during its push for deregulation and is now Gov. Judy Martz's chief of staff, said many industrial consumers in the state "might be looking for a price of power that is just too low."
States in the Northwest that did not deregulate are now counting their blessings. On May 1 in Idaho, the state's Public Utilities Commission approved an increase in power rates. For large users, the cost of a megawatt hour will go to $41 from $29, to cover the 40 percent of its power that Idaho must buy on the market. That is a far cry from what Montana has been paying.
"That's what going to the market does for you," said Marsha Smith, a public utilities commissioner in Idaho. 
Throughout the Montana ordeal, Montana Power has said it has done nothing wrong, and has expressed optimism that the cost of power will fall eventually, as deregulation evolves. The current problem, Mr. Haffey said, "wasn't caused by deregulation," but rather by "a dysfunctional market."
Others, however, say the company and its influence over Montana lawmakers have created a mess in a state where power was once plentiful and eminently affordable. "Montana held the four aces of cheap power," said former United States Representative Pat Williams, a prominent critic of deregulation. "And a corporate-lackey legislature demanded a new deck of cards."

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the electrical power crisis in Montana reversed the closing dates of the mines and smelter once owned by Anaconda Copper Mining, which created the Montana Power Company. Atlantic Richfield, which acquired Anaconda in 1977, closed the company's smelter in 1980 and its mines in 1983.

HEADLINE: THE BUSINESS WORLD; 
Generating Much Heat But No Kazakh Profits

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: ALMATY, Kazakhstan 

 BODY:
NEARLY five years ago, when Kazakhstan was hailed as a new democracy with great potential wealth, an American energy company bought one of the world's largest coal-fired generating plants in the northern part of the country and started to modernize it.
 Today, some people in Kazakhstan are prospering from its oil resources, though the country's credentials as a democracy are in doubt. But the American multinational, the AES Corporation, is struggling to turn a profit on an investment of more than $200 million. 
 "It's a very tough operating environment, especially considering the low income of the general population and the regulators' desire to keep the rates low and ignore the needs of the company to invest in upgrading," Vitaly Lee, the AES country director, said in an interview in his office here. 
AES has plenty of experience in difficult environments. Much of the growth that turned the company into one of the largest independent energy providers has come in locales that others considered too risky, like Colombia, Tanzania and India. 
The challenges in Kazakhstan range from bartering with customers for goods like cars, eggs and vodka to trying to persuade people to pay for electricity. AES has also tried to persuade tightfisted regulators to raise rates and dodged constant demands for bribes, company officials and Western diplomats said.
Obstacles are common. The promise of riches from oil and gas resources attracted billions of dollars in foreign investment. But despite progress, Kazakhstan is far from developing a transparent, Western-style business climate.
"There are still some sticking points for foreign investors, and bribery is as big a problem as it ever was," said an American business executive, who insisted that his name not be used because Western companies signed an agreement with the government not to criticize it in the press.
Bribery is a widespread problem in the developing world. Central Asian nations fare poorly on the annual ranking of corrupt countries by Transparency International, an organization trying to fight corruption. 
In a widely publicized case, the United States Justice Department is investigating whether James Giffen, an American lawyer, transferred $30 million in commissions from foreign oil companies to bank accounts controlled by President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and other government officials.
Mr. Giffen, an adviser to Mr. Nazarbayev, has denied wrongdoing, and Kazakh officials have called the accusations false and malicious.
IN a lesser-known case that reflects many of the hazards of doing business here, prosecutors in Belgium and Switzerland are investigating $55 million paid to Kazakh business partners by Tractebel, the energy arm of the French conglomerate Suez. 
Tractebel's former chief executive acknowledged in a radio interview last year that he had authorized the payments as commissions to win projects in 1996 and 1997. A company spokesman said Tractebel was cooperating with the investigation, but declined to comment further.
The Tractebel case is interesting because the payments did not protect the company once it started providing electricity to Almaty, the country's largest city, and operating a 6,000-mile network of gas pipelines. 
"They gave a very large commission payment up front and didn't pay after that," Anthony Mansfield, a former Tractebel executive in Almaty, said in an interview. "The authorities made it virtually impossible for the company to operate."
Regulators refused requests to raise electricity rates. The regional governor, a self-described former boxer, said in a local TV interview that he had threatened to beat up a Tractebel official at a reception. At one point, Tractebel asked an international arbitration court to force regulators to increase the rates.
While the electricity business was losing money, Tractebel was making a profit transporting gas through the pipeline. But when it got rid of the local partners, Kazakh banks froze its accounts and the government started a public campaign against the company.
Mr. Nazarbayev criticized the company as not investing enough in Kazakhstan, and Tractebel soon began negotiations to withdraw from the country. Last December, it sold its holdings to a state-owned company for $100 million, about half the amount invested.
The president's criticism was part of a perceptible shift in attitude toward Western companies and governments evident in some Central Asian countries. A decade of assistance and investment has not produced prosperity, and there is growing impatience in some quarters. In Kazakhstan, for instance, Mr. Nazarbayev recently questioned some financial benefits accorded foreign companies, and government officials reacted sharply to the recent State Department human rights report, which was critical of Kazakhstan.
Martha Brill Olcott, an expert on the region at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Tractebel episode demonstrated the risks of doing business where laws were undeveloped and governments could be fickle.
"Payments get you in the door, but it doesn't create the business environment that a Western firm needs," she said in a telephone interview from Washington.
AES has yet to earn anything in Kazakhstan. When the company started selling electricity in northern Kazakhstan, even big commercial customers did not have the cash to pay. AES agreed to barter arrangements, trading electricity for cars used by its staff, rail transportation and, in some cases, vodka and other products that could be sold by middlemen.
"That was the only way to do business," Mr. Lee, a Kazakh national, said.
AES needed all the revenue it could muster. The huge coal-fired plant in Ekibastuz was only 16 years old, but the roof had fallen in, and the turbines were in poor shape. It was built to supply electricity to vast regions of the Soviet Union, but AES spent $90 million to approach 25 percent capacity.
The company also bought the rights to operate two thermal plants and four hydroelectric plants near Ust-Kamenogorsk, in eastern Kazakhstan. Mr. Lee said additional money had been invested there.
AES prides itself on providing clean, safe energy at reasonable prices. In Kazakhstan, it sells electricity for 0.6 cents a kilowatt hour, one of the lowest rates in the world. Still, Mr. Lee said, the company could not persuade regulators to let it raise rates and pass on to customers the cost of revenue-generating improvements like new meters.
Part of the problem is that customers are unaccustomed to paying for electricity.
"The mind-set in Kazakhstan is that electricity is a right, not a privilege that you have to pay for," a Western diplomat in Almaty said.
In Kazakhstan, the company has been criticized as not investing enough. "They have not fulfilled a series of conditions," Kanat Berentayev, a government economist, said in an interview.
Before increasing its investment substantially, AES officials said, the company needs the assurance of a better revenue stream. Still, Dennis W. Bakke, the company's chief executive, refused to complain about the business environment.
"I think Kazakhstan wants us, though it is not always easy to tell," Mr. Bakke said in a telephone interview from AES headquarters in Arlington, Va. "Business can be risky everywhere."

HEADLINE: 'Getting Amazoned,' And Other Fantasies; 
Eek! What Have E-Consultants Wrought?

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
JUST over a year ago, America's biggest, oldest, most prosperous corporations were about to be slaughtered by the dot-com insurgents.
 Retailers fantasized about trading acres of floor space for a slick Web site. Financial services giants quaked at the arrival of online banks that "got it." Media executives fretted that online newspapers and Internet broadcasters would arise from the ether to capture their audiences. Consultants everywhere were prophesying doom for the Fortune 500. 
 "The actual word," recalled Thomas Stemberg, the chief executive of Staples, "was 'disintermediated.' It meant you were going to be taken out of the equation." 
Mr. Stemberg is one of hundreds of executives at large, publicly held companies who spent millions of dollars over the last three years to fend off what now looks like a Nasdaq-fueled mass hallucination. Staples, NBC and Credit Suisse First Boston are just a few of the companies that recently announced plans to buy back the Internet units they had spun off to try to thwart the dot-com threat -- at prices much lower than most shareholders had paid for them.
The specter of "getting Amazoned," which justified many a spending spree in the name of warding off Web-based competitors, lost its zing as the shares of Amazon.com plummeted -- and as another online bookseller, Barnesandnoble.com, started taking some of its market share. Toys "R" Us, for example, has poured $260 million into Toysrus.com, according to regulatory filings, only to watch eToys, its online archrival, file for bankruptcy this year.
Hindsight in the wake of a 60 percent Nasdaq correction is easy, of course, and there has already been much finger-pointing amid the popped-com compulsion to explain a market bubble that, however briefly, valued Amazon over Barnes & Noble, eToys over Toys "R" Us and Palm Computing over its venerable parent, 3Com.
But if Wall Street analysts and venture capitalists are blamed for spinning unrealistic tales of dot-com success for investors, the most outspoken Internet boosters in corporate America were the strategy consultants who supplied the buzzwords and business rationales that seemed to justify what might otherwise have been dismissed as a market aberration.
In a raft of books, newsletters and seminars, supposedly impartial experts from consulting firms and academia extolled the virtues of entrepreneurialism among 20-somethings. They warned corporate managers of the disruptive power of technology, and urged them to embrace it. And many of them went on to reap extraordinary profits over the last few years, advising corporate clients to invest in online ventures that turned out to be largely unprofitable.
"The consultant fraternity was after everybody," said Brian T. Moynihan, executive vice president of FleetBoston Financial, who said he discarded most of the advice, although he paid for much of it. "They were all pushing that the Internet was going to change everything." 
The Internet missteps of many established companies, which emerged as winners in an ultimately not-so-epic battle, have largely been glossed over in the aftermath. But now, as corporate executives assess their own performance during the boom time -- or are forced to by shareholders -- many lament the expensive Internet advice that didn't pan out.
With big corporations trimming spending on Internet initiatives, and on the advisers who helped conceptualize them, the consultants may finally be asked to account for their previous miscalculations before being invited to submit new ones.
"It's the same story all over again with wireless," said Janey Place, an executive vice president at Mellon Financial, referring to recent admonitions that "mobile commerce" requires companies to make banking and other services available over wireless networks. "We've learned not to take some of these projections seriously."
Facing this increased skepticism, some consultants have turned openly apologetic. But others are unrepentant, and most, being consultants, are simply offering a new spin on the not-so-new economy.
"This was a tough way to learn important lessons," said Chunka Mui, co-author of "Unleashing the Killer App: Digital Strategies for Market Dominance," and chief innovation officer at the consulting firm DiamondCluster International. "Given what the markets have done, there's a risk that people will say we don't have to worry about this anymore, and I think that would be a fatal mistake. The real lesson here is to recognize that the technology itself is of a transformational nature."
BESIDES, some consultants note, managers are free to take or reject their advice as they please.
"I'm sure there's somebody out there who thinks they should blame the consultants," said Bob Gett, chief executive of Viant, a start-up consulting firm that specializes in technology strategy. "They may feel a little embarrassed about how enthusiastic they got about the digital imperative. But these are executives. They make their own decisions, and they live with the results."
Of course, the Internet strategies of many established companies were largely based on time-honored motives that require no consultation -- fear and greed. What may now look like excess spending on Internet operations was in many cases an effort to take advantage of inflated market valuations, executives said.
But continued confirmations, from a thriving consulting corps and a proliferation of business books -- with titles like "Leading the Revolution," by Gary Hamel; "Digital Capital," by Don Tapscott, et. al.; and "Living on the Fault Line" by Geoffrey A. Moore -- helped explain away nagging doubts about the notion that rules of business had fundamentally changed.
That axiom became part of the feedback loop that catapulted the valuation of Internet companies. That, in turn, convinced corporate managers that they needed to spend more to compete, according to experts in market psychology. 
"When the market goes up, people want a plausible story to explain why this is real," said Robert Shiller, the economist at Yale University who compared the Internet stock boom to a Ponzi scheme in one of the rare critical books about the phenomenon, "Irrational Exuberance" (Princeton University, 2000). "If a friend makes money and there's no story, that doesn't do it," he added. "The story is why the Ponzi scheme works."
Consultants, those shadowy figures who flit from client to client and who typically are blamed when managers look bad and ignored when they look good, tend to make the most money at times of great uncertainty -- when clients are more likely to seek guidance. This time, though, consultants may have known little more than the managers. 
In the heat of the bubble, firms like Razorfish and IXL, originally hired because their young programmers knew how to design Web sites, promoted themselves as strategy consultants. For several million dollars a pop, they told dozens of multinational corporations how to conduct business online. Many such "e-consultants" have made drastic cuts in staff recently as their share prices plunged more than 90 percent.
Still, even among the more august firms, the conventional consultant wisdom held that if established companies were to compete with the fast-moving visionaries in the parade of online banks and pet stores and office supply chains, they needed to move onto the Internet immediately. And they needed to set up separate divisions to do it, far away from the parent company that was enmeshed in its old analog culture.
But many companies that put those strategies to work have reversed course. "The major themes the management strategists were pushing were mistakes," said Michael Porter, a professor of business administration at Harvard, who, in a recent Harvard Business Review, lambasted popular Internet strategies espoused by high-profile consultants. "The real advantage established companies had was established brands, product lines, relationships. By setting up Internet operations as separate, they essentially walked away from those things."
That did not stop consultants of all stripes from charging fees as much as $600 an hour, or tens of millions of dollars over the course of a year, to conceptualize and carry out an Internet strategy for major corporations.
Robert Howe, chief executive of Scient, one of a group of new "e-consultants," certainly had a good year in 2000. Known for teaching his young staff to "accentuate the fear factor" with large clients by telling them, "You have money, but you don't have time," his salary and bonus came to $500,000 that year and his roughly 10 percent stake in the company at one point exceeded $500 million.
IN an industry where annual growth hovers around 20 percent, revenue rose by 60 percent a year from 1997 to 2000. Last year, Internet consulting alone brought in $10 billion in revenue for the top 10 consulting firms, and about 40 percent of their total earnings, according to Consulting Information Services, a research firm in Keene, N.H. 
Major consulting firms like Accenture and McKinsey also started venture capital groups, taking equity stakes in some of the "dot corps" that they helped get off the ground. "When consultants get into venture capital," said Tom Rodenhauser, president of Consulting Information, "you know things are good."
And in a measure of how lucrative it was to be a consultant, most everyone from 15-year-old Web site designers to journalists to technology companies like Cisco Systems began marketing themselves as one.
"Anyone who had an interest in making money tried to insert themselves into the gap created by where we were now and where we should be," recalled Josh Grotstein, who left his position as division executive for e-commerce programs at Citicorp last year to join Silicon Alley Seed Investors, a new venture capital firm. "Whoever they were, they all called us dinosaurs."
Not all the advice was bad, of course, and even some executives who were made queasy by the Internet roller coaster say that it was better to have taken the ride. Mr. Stemberg of Staples said the bright-colored decor and entrepreneurial spirit of Staples.com has had a beneficial effect on the entire company now that it is being reintegrated into the whole. Marty Yudkovitz, who is president of NBC's digital media division, described himself as a "bloodied optimist," whose company stands to profit from the lessons of Internet investments gone bad.
Still, many executives said they would welcome some self-reflection from their consultants as well.
With the benefit of hindsight, here is what some influential authors, professors and prominent consultants say about their Internet analyses.

CLAYTON M. CHRISTENSEN -- Professor of business administration, Harvard Business School.
Influential book: "Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail" (Harvard Business School Press, 1997).
Key concept: Disruptive technologies will topple incumbent companies unless an independent organization is created to address them.
Mr. Christensen wants to state for the record that the Internet is not necessarily a disruptive technology. He says that both the terms "disruptive" and "technology," which he put together to coin what became one of the era's most famous buzz-phrases and the rationale for its most popular strategy -- the Internet spinoff -- "may have been misleading."
Still, he stands firmly by his disconcerting thesis: that because dominant companies focus on products that earn the highest margins, they inevitably miss the opportunity to develop more convenient, less costly offerings that are initially less profitable. The blind spot is perilous, because those "disruptive technologies" can undermine the established way of doing business.
As prime evidence, his book explained how big mainframe computer companies like Digital Equipment lost out in the PC revolution. To avoid a similar fate, Mr. Christensen said, established corporations should set up independent organizations to handle disruptions.
Many readers assumed that the Internet fit the definition. Not necessarily so, Mr. Christensen says now, noting that the book did not address the Internet: "The misinterpretation is, 'anything that is different or radical, you better create a separate company,' and that's not true."
For discount brokers like Charles Schwab, the Internet was a "sustaining" technology, he said, because it let them perform their existing business more efficiently. Merrill Lynch, which has rolled out an online brokerage service of its own, is different, Mr. Christensen believes.
"Merrill Lynch over time, in their retail organization, will get killed, just like Digital, because they only implement to sustain their business and they haven't caught the disruptive wave," he said.
The difficulty, it seems, is in determining what is and is not "disruptive." And by the way, disruptions do not necessarily take the form of technology, he added. The use of the term came from his initial study of the rise of PC's, and he just kept using it.
"I never went back and said, 'I'm going to take the "technology" word out,' " Mr. Christensen recalled. "Similarly, the word 'disruptive' connotes in many people's minds a breakthrough, and that's confusing. I don't know what a better word would be. There are just so many prior connotations to too many words."

JOHN HAGEL III -- Chief strategy officer of 12 Entrepreneuring; former partner at McKinsey & Company.
Influential works: "Net Gain: Expanding Markets Through Virtual Communities," with Arthur G. Armstrong (Harvard Business School Press, 1997), and "Net Worth: Shaping Markets When Customers Make the Rules," with Marc Singer (Harvard Business School Press, 1999).
Key concept: Exploiting online communities and tailoring service offerings to consumers are key to making a profit on the Web.
Like many executives he advised as founder of the e-commerce practice at McKinsey, Mr. Hagel faced a paradox: the strategies that made the best business sense for the long term were being punished by the capital markets.
"I would be told in countless meetings: 'Your ideas sound very plausible, but I just spoke with the financial analyst or the funder or whatever and they're telling me something totally different. Who do I believe?' " Mr. Hagel recalled. "I should have been more forceful at that point and said, 'Well, the market's wrong.' "
In part because of market pressure, and in part because corporations resisted setting up Web communities because they did not want consumers saying bad things about their products, his ideas were rarely carried out fully, Mr. Hagel said. Almost none of the dozens of community-based Web sites made the leap from a social forum to a profitable one, which disappointed clients. "I put a lot of emphasis in the book on how hard this was," he said. "I hope the notion of the challenges was as strong as it needed to be."
His effort to convince suspicious corporate managers of the value of virtual operations tilted his advice too far in another direction, he said. "In consulting with clients," he recalled, "I probably underestimated the value of the physical assets that were already available to them." 
But he reserved some criticism for the managers. "I saw more and more people, and it wasn't just in the dot-com space but also in the large traditional company space, creating Internet initiatives not because they saw a general business value, but because they wanted to cash in quickly on what the market fad of the moment was," he said. "So I actually think some of the spin-outs were not about the belief that you had to spin out to create a viable business. It was a more base, material goal, and it has hurt them in the long term."

KEVIN KELLY -- Former editor, Wired magazine, and author, "New Rules for a New Economy" (Viking, 1998).
PETER SCHWARTZ -- Chairman, Global Business Network, and author, "The Long Boom" (Perseus, 1999), with Peter Leyden and Joel Hyatt.
Key concept: The network economy, the acceleration of technological innovation and rampant globalization are setting the stage for a 20- to 30-year period of global prosperity with new economic rules.
Mr. Kelly knows that people have soured on the once unassailable notion of a new economy. Just last summer, he made speaking appearances almost daily, explicating rules like "Feed the Web first," "Let go at the top" and the one that has given him the most grief lately, "Follow the free." Not any more.
As the executive editor of Wired from its inception in 1993 until 1999, Mr. Kelly was responsible for what seemed even then like an extreme form of technological optimism. Every month, the magazine promoted the notion that the world would be turned upside down -- fast.
He says he would not change a word of any of his rules. As for the failure of dozens of companies that gave products away: "I said you begin with the free," he explained. "The problem was, people haven't figured out what to charge for."
Wired's evangelization of everything new hit its peak with "The Long Boom," which started as a long cover article by Mr. Schwartz, Mr. Leyden and Mr. Hyatt, published in July 1997. Mr. Kelly came up with the article's title, and he said he still believes that a decades-long period of global prosperity has just begun.
So does Mr. Schwartz, who notes that there were 1,000 car companies in America in 1920, and five in 1930.
"That's when all the real growth happened," said Mr. Schwartz, unruffled by the recent downturn. "There will be another takeoff in about a year. It's actually going remarkably well." 

ROBERT HOWE -- chief executive, Scient.
Old key concept, 1998-2000: "The Scient approach," building complete e-businesses within a few months.
New key concept: to integrate the Internet into existing businesses.
If the problem with consultants is accountability -- they can always say a client did not follow their advice -- e-consultants like Scient are being taken to task more than most. Scient shares have dropped roughly 99 percent since their peak of $130 in March, 2000. Last month, the company said it would cut its work force.
Scient cultivated large companies as clients and became known for telling them that their time was more important than their money. "Now they all believe they have more time," Mr. Howe says.
He said several assumptions that drove his client strategy over the last three years "turned out to be slightly off, or more than slightly off."
"We always tried to talk about real business models with our clients," he said, "but it was just a time when everybody believed if you put something out on the Internet, people would come." Mr. Howe said Scient's clients were now more interested in integrating technology into their existing businesses.

PHILIP EVANS -- Senior vice president, Boston Consulting Group.
Influential work: "Blown to Bits: How the New Economics of Information Transforms Strategy," with Thomas S. Wurster (Harvard Business School Press, 1999).
Key concept: The Internet dispenses with the need for established middlemen, leveling the playing field for all competitors to vie for a direct relationship with the customer.
A couple of weeks ago, Mr. Evans said he received an e-mail message from the founder of Wine.com, Peter Granoff, one of the earliest sellers of wine online, and an example Mr. Evans has often used of how traditional retailers would be "disintermediated" by the Internet. Mr. Granoff's company, originally called Virtual Vineyards, was folding.
"Although we did not come right out and predict that Virtual Vineyards would be a big success, I think if I'm honest we thought they would," Mr. Evans said, "and obviously we're rather disappointed that they aren't."
"Blown to Bits" was written as a warning to traditional companies, and Mr. Evans says it should still be heeded. What he and others got wrong, he said, was the timing of the impending doom. "It's not a tidal wave that you can see coming and it's going to overwhelm you in a few hours," he said. "It's more like a tectonic force that will eventually cause an earthquake."
Mr. Evans does have some comfort, however cold, for those who rushed to meet the tidal wave on his advice: "Every revolution, whether political or economic, eats its own children," he said. "We shouldn't be surprised that when fundamental change occurs there is a tremendous amount of experimentation and most fails."
Besides, part of the reason that things look so rosy now for big corporations is that they did follow his advice, Mr. Evans said.
"The danger of a dot-com displacing General Electric or Wal-Mart or Citibank is much less than it looked like it was in the days when they were being very complacent," he said. "The risk is that they'll go back into complacency."
As for "Blown to Bits," "The title is now a little bit embarrassing," Mr. Evans said. "We shrug our shoulders and say, 'We didn't say who was going to get blown to bits.' "

CORPORATE STRATEGY SOURPUSS -- What e-business consultant Larry Downes called Michael Porter, the Harvard business school professor, in a recent column in The Industry Standard. Strictly, an old-style business strategist who doesn't take account of how the Internet requires companies to have flexible strategies that can change rapidly with the technology. DISINTERMEDIATED -- What happens to big traditional companies after the Internet cuts out the middleman and removes obstacles to the speedy flow of information and goods. FEAR FACTOR -- An emotion shared by corporate executives who think that they will look stupid because they don't understand technology. Commonly cited by consultants as a means of talking clients into paying high consulting fees. FIRST-MOVER ADVANTAGE -- The theory that being first on the Internet is all that matters, no matter how much money it takes or how bad the product or service is -- or the fact that switching allegiances was easier on the Internet than anywhere else, because clicking to another site is easy. GET BIG FAST -- The dominant business model (see above) of the Internet boom era. GREED -- Far more than any consulting jargon, what might have motivated corporate executives to invest in Internet businesses. INTERNET TIME -- The pace at which Internet businesses evolve, or devolve. Typically thought to be approximately seven times that of the off-line world. KNOWLEDGE GAP -- The yawning gulf between the stunning acumen of young Web designers and the total ignorance of Luddite executives with 30 years of management experience at traditional companies about how to do business online. NEW ECONOMY -- A world where information products have different properties than physical, Industrial Age products, so the rules of how to make and sell them must be different, too. WE'RE STILL IN THE EARLY INNINGS -- What consultants say now to bitter and disillusioned executives who have spent millions of dollars on failed Internet strategies.

Rudeness Awakens America

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS 

 BODY:
OVER the last decade, as the United States looked down from the peak of world power, its officials may have overlooked some currents rising below. While the demise of the Soviet system left only one superpower standing, it also freed scores of other nations from the gridlock of East-West confrontation, and they began to build new or stronger alliances outside Washington's reach.
 In the developing world, a bloc known as the G77 that now includes 133 African, Asian and Latin American countries can command a two-thirds majority in the United Nations. Across the Atlantic, the European Union has 15 members and will grow more. 
 Diplomats and American officials say it was these two groups, not normally allies, that came together for one startling moment to jolt the United States in the last week and a half, snatching away American seats on the United Nations Human Rights Commission and the International Narcotics Control Board in a secret vote in the Economic and Social Council.
The event symbolized a much larger phenomenon: the evolution of a whole new set of relationships between the United States and two emerging power blocs with strong interests of their own that may frequently come in conflict with American interests. Most of the world's nations may now be democratic to one degree or another, but that does not unite them. The challenge is to learn how to manage the differences and to separate the truly crucial ones -- over economic needs, peace, the environment, for example -- from irritants.
In this light, the sabotaging of American membership on the Human Rights Commission -- apparently an act of cumulative annoyance after years of American rejection of international agreements, the hounding from office of Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and Congressional blocking of dues that beggared the United Nations -- looks like overkill to many Americans. But it has also sounded an alarm.
"This is one of those seminal events -- like Zionism equals racism -- that is going to haunt us for a long time," said Richard N. Gardner, a Columbia University law professor who was in last year's American delegation to the General Assembly. The fear is that poisoned feelings on all sides could make it more difficult, as Israel-bashing did in the 1970's, for the United States to work with the United Nations on critical matters, like containing Iraq, for which Americans have needed the United Nations in the past.
The House of Representatives did strike back last week, voting to withhold $244 million in overdue payments to the United Nations, but paying a $582 million bill.
Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, President Ronald Reagan's United Nations ambassador and a frequent critic of the organization, nevertheless thinks Congress aimed at the wrong target. "Kofi Annan didn't cause our problems, and the U.N. secretariat didn't cause our problems," she said in an interview. "Withholding funds from the U.N., we don't really affect the people whom we would like to affect." Those responsible, she said, were the Europeans, who didn't relinquish a seat to America when there were four candidates for three slots on the Human Rights Commission, and apparently voted as a bloc for Austria, France and Sweden.
Since the end of the cold war, Dr. Kirkpatrick said, one of the most important changes in the world has been the consolidation of the European Union, and "with that has gone an increased influence of France, with its characteristic exclusiveness."
Among the developing nations, an Asian ambassador said, votes were cast against the United States for several reasons, including what many see as a paucity of American aid and opposition to American efforts to hold individual countries up to human-rights scrutiny, in particular China. Arthur C. I. Mbanefo, Nigeria's ambassador and last year's chairman of the G77. said poor countries were only flexing muscles in their national interests as Americans do.
Concerted attacks on the United States are, of course, nothing new in international bodies, but rarely have such strong efforts been made to exclude Americans from what they have come to consider their rightful place at a lot of tables.
In some ways, the global advance of democracy is part of the problem. In many more nations, public opinion matters, and television audiences can see -- and resent -- how their presidents are treated on visits to Washington or how Americans rank their concerns. So even if many countries now share an interest in advancing democratic principles, one Asian ambassador said, "no one has said we must vote for each other" when interests clash.
At Freedom House in New York, the president, Adrian Karatnycky, differed, saying it should be possible to build coalitions based on political and civil liberties and adding that there is a danger when "a bunch of countries are playing with these rather sacrosanct values to make other kinds of extraneous points." He dismissed European explanations that the Bush administration's rejection of the Kyoto treaty on global warming was reason enough to punish the United States. "If you link the Kyoto treaty to human rights, you're doing it to the detriment of both," he said.
MR. GARDNER and some foreign diplomats fault the American mission here for inept handling of the campaign for the Human Rights Commission seat. But Bill Richardson, chairman of Freedom House's board and a Clinton-era ambassador to the United Nations, pointed in an interview to other issues. He recommended courting the developing bloc, "perhaps by renewing our efforts to expand the Security Council to include them, and build coalitions" among its members when their interests clash with Europe's, as on trade and immigration.
In any event, he and other former American ambassadors to the United Nations seem in agreement that the worst message to send would be a threat of blackmail, as in the congressional demand that the United States be re-elected to the Human Rights Commission before final bills are paid. "It gives another tool to those who deprived us of the seat," Mr. Richardson said.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Then and Now; 
Allow Us to Demonstrate: Student Protest Comes of Age

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN

 BODY:
SINCE they finished finals at the end of April, Ben Royal and three fellow University of Michigan students have been driving around the Northeast in a green 1992 Toyota Corolla, trying to make a movement.
 They went to Pennsylvania State University, where death threats to black students recently inspired a sleep-in at the student center. They stopped at Brown University, where protesters outraged by an advertisement concerning reparations for slavery confiscated copies of the student paper and formed human chains to block its distribution. And they made several visits to Harvard, where 26 smelly students emerged Wednesday after a three-week sit-in over how much the nation's richest university pays its janitors. 
 Mr. Royal and his comrades, cell phones at their ears, are recruiting for a June conference on their Ann Arbor campus. They hope for attendance of 200 -- twice, they note, the number that gathered for the founding conference of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in 1960. 
There is a fine line between a march and a movement, and with students, in the glare of springtime, that line can be hard to see -- particularly in a culture that has become inured to the endless variations on chants that begin, "Hey hey, ho ho." There is, cynics will say, always a hardy band of leftists decrying something or other on every college campus, like background noise on the soundtrack of a liberal education. But if the activism of the late 1960's signified a more profound challenge to the fabric of society, today's demonstrations -- focused, tolerated and relentlessly coordinated -- may be more efficient at achieving their goals.
Student protest has a long history in Europe and Asia, dating at least to the 19th century. American campuses were slower to simmer, with the first sparks coming over economic issues in the 1930's and 1940's. It was only as universities opened up to a more diverse student body, in the 1960's, that a true student movement took hold, focused first on civil rights and then on the Vietnam War. A second generation arose in the 1980's, when students erected mock shantytowns and pushed many universities to divest themselves of their holdings in apartheid-era South Africa.
In both cases, the involvement of the young intellectual elite served to grab public attention. But the linkages between the student efforts and more established adult groups -- businesses and antiwar veterans, Democratic politicians and civil rights leaders -- were crucial to creating actual change.
"Students very often are the most publicized element, and very often they engage in the most dramatic actions because they are young and free and more ready to take risks because they are young and free," said Howard Zinn, the radical historian who visited the Harvard encampment several times. "If that movement doesn't go beyond students, then it doesn't go very far."
THE latest rumblings, dating back about five years, focus on economic justice and globalization, with a dash of environmentalism. Students have rallied against the use of sweatshop labor to make their sweatshirts; now, at Harvard and across the country, they are aligning with union organizers to call for a "living wage" for the universities' lowest-paid employees. Mr. Royal and his friends, meanwhile, are trying to defend affirmative action.
Students were a major element of the recent civil disobedience disrupting world trade meetings in Seattle and Quebec, and unions have also stepped up their organizing among professors, graduate students, and even undergraduates across the country. In both the actions on campuses and the highly publicized protests of globalization that have targeted political and diplomatic conferences, students have forged an unusually strong alliance with labor.
This new partnership comes in part from the increasing interest among union leaders in direct action, and labor has reached out to young people with programs like Union Summer, an echo of the 1964 Freedom Summer, with college students organizing workers this time instead of registering voters. It also reflects the outward-looking ideology of today's students, who are rallying for the rights of low-wage workers even though, with their expensive degrees, they are unlikely to confront such problems personally.
ELECTRONIC communication has also revolutionized the revolution. Organizers now coordinate activities through e-mail and Web sites; the Harvard protesters spent much of their time on cell phones, blitzing the media and urging celebrities to come to the daily noontime rallies outside the window (they also frequently called their parents and assured them they were all right).
Whether the series of campus demonstrations in recent years will escalate into a sort of third wave of student movement, on the order of antiwar or divestment, remains a question. Harvard did not yield to the students' demands to pay all workers at least $10.25 an hour, instead just naming a new committee to reconsider the question. Still, the high-profile action at the nation's most prestigious university has already spurred copycats at the University of Connecticut, and could prove a bellwether.
At the same time, where once student protests shook the nation to its core, they have now become common enough to feel like a springtime rite of passage, prompting yawns or dismissive contempt. In the 1960's, students were questioning the foundation of American society, protesting the very authority of the institutions that governed their lives. Today, the questions seem far narrower, the protests somehow safer.
When Students for a Democratic Society occupied administration buildings in the 1960's, the abiding image was of long-haired hippies smoking cigars with their feet propped on the university president's desk. This year, many students brought books and laptops into Massachusetts Hall so they wouldn't fall too far behind in their schoolwork. In 1969, during a demonstration against R.O.T.C. recruiting at Harvard, the police stormed University Hall and threw the students out after 24 hours; officers brought today's protesters deodorant and dinner.
And many student protests are about far less cosmic, more self-interested concerns, like the recent University of North Carolina march over budget cuts, or last weekend's demonstration at Boston University complaining that construction on a soccer field was a noisy disruption during exams.
Donald Kagan, a classics professor at Yale University, said that administrators -- many of whom came of age in the 60's, some through sit-ins -- have gotten soft, and that by failing to discipline students for acts of civil disobedience, are "miseducating them morally."
"In the real world, your acts have consequences," Professor Kagan said. "At Yale and Harvard, they don't. If you don't risk anything, it costs you nothing. You're not a hero, you're a bully."
THE cynics say that students protest in the spring because they prefer it to studying, that students protest because they have more time and less to lose, that rallies and demonstrations are like so many other extra-curricular activities.
But if they don't do it, who will?
"This is going to sound like what adults say when they're patronizing students, but when you're older, you're saddled with a lot of different responsibilities," said Ari Weisbard, a Harvard junior from Madison, Wis., who was among the sitters through Day 21. "You can't really throw everything aside for several weeks to devote to something important. It's not just that we're more idealistic because we haven't had as much world experience. It's that we have a real chance to act on our ideals."
Mr. Weisbard, whose father was among the protesters at Harvard in1969, acknowledged that skipping two and a half weeks of classes was unlikely to hurt his law school applications. The only homework he managed to get done inside was reading two chapters of a text titled "Political Equality," but he was able to get an extension on his philosophy paper until next week.
Then there's his social studies tutorial, a seminar called Community Organizing and Civic Democracy. He is hoping the professor will understand why he missed class, gathering primary research for his final paper.

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Whenever I read "Variety," I start having fantasies of inking a movie deal in the high six figures against the low seven figures.
 Whatever that means. 
 I have an idea for a futuristic political thriller science fiction space Western black comedy with a stylish film noir mood. Shades of "Blade Runner," "Galaxy Quest," "Fail-Safe," "On the Beach" and the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
Since it's inspired by the Bush administration, there isn't any sex. But the laser beam shootouts will make Jerry Bruckheimer drool. 
The year is 2007. "Bush Runner, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Shield" opens with an evocative, derivative shot of Oil Rig Earth, an industrial wasteland where the sun no longer shines, a bleak post-apocalyptic world filled with oil refinery towers belching fire, Reagan replicants and animoids (genetically engineered animals eating bioengineered food based on petroleum byproducts).
Because of the president's stunning success in enacting his first-term agenda -- unbreathable air, undrinkable water, uneatable food, unaffordable gas -- Earth is inhabited only by drilling, logging and mining personnel, androids and criminal dregs (a.k.a. pro-choice women and anyone who tried drugs but failed to get elected to high public office afterward).
The Democrats fled the planet before the last election when they realized, to their horror, that Al Gore had been right: Earth (and not just Florida) really was In the Balance. 
The White House has had to move Off-World, to a hermetically sealed oval capsule, the U.S.S. Robert Bork. Right now, the Bork is orbiting Io, the third moon of Jupiter, checking out Io's Intergalactic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling possibilities.
With all the anti-missile missiles, offensive weapons, satellite-attacking satellites and spy rockets (none of which work) that Dr. Strangerum, the defense secretary, has tossed into the sky, space is just as trashed as Earth.
Interior shot of Oval space lounge/ war room. Captain Dick and Dr. Strangerum are sitting in Jetsons spun-aluminum chairs, drinking Johnnie Walker Red and trying to keep their glasses from flying away as they determine the fate of the universe.
The Kid, bundled in a spacesuit, is outside playing catch with an asteroid.
Dr. Strangerum: "Look at Mars and tell me that there are no Reds! We picked up a secret transmission today from the Chinese space station on the Red Planet, Dick. The Chinese were bragging about how they tricked us into spending our economy dry on Star Wars by getting their Commie friends in North Korea to pretend they had a nuclear missile. The fools! It was we who tricked the North Koreans into deceiving the Chinese into believing that we believed the North Koreans had a missile when in fact it was the Russians who duped the Chinese and the North Koreans into thinking we believed that the North Koreans had a nuclear missile, which of course -- heh, heh! -- allowed us to trick Congress into giving $600 billion trillion more to our pals to make weapons."
Captain Dick: "Yup."
Dr. Strangerum sips Scotch: "Remember that report we commissioned from the Bland Corporation? Those Commies want our essence, Dick. They're plotting to drain us of our precious bodily fluids."
Junior chases his asteroid inside. "Is the Texas spaceball team here yet? I have to hand out the trophies!"
Dr. Strangerum continues: "It's time to start thinking big, Dick. I've got the blueprint for a galactic missile defense shield. We'll just say we need to protect ourselves from a sneak attack by a rogue galaxy. We can get our friends at TRW, Lockheed and General Dynamics, who have a joint headquarters on Uranus, to ring really big lasers around the Milky Way."
Junior's face lights up. "Who's passing out the Milky Ways?"
Dr. Strangerum: "Can you believe the Democrats are still tree-huggers, even with no trees? Gephardt's on Pluto ranting that we're the party of plutocrats just because we pipelined all our tax cuts right to the oil companies. And how about those beatnik Europeans on Neptune trying to rope us into another sissy treaty on galaxy warming? Those hootenanny, free-love hippies are still trying to ban land mines -- in space!"
Junior, squinting through a big telescope at a faraway planet, asks his elders: "What is that black spot on top of the gray marble?"
Captain Dick: "Alaska."

HEADLINE: Lost Capital Spending 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Have Rate Cuts Lost Their Magic?" (Economic View, April 29) said that a collapse in capital spending had contributed to the current downturn. 
 The fact is that as more and more capital spending is devoted to computers and software, fewer capital projects are justified in terms of shareholder value. 
Unlike classic plant-and-equipment projects, which create cash flows by enhancing revenue or cutting costs, computer projects are usually justified in qualitative terms -- vague, vogue concepts like "improved information."
The dot-com bubble was the product of irrational exhuberance. Will overemphasis on poorly justified investment in computers emerge as the next lesson?

Signs of Strength Fuel Rate-Cut Concerns

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
Worried about the uncertain direction of the economy and about how much further interest rates may fall, investors spent much of last week on the sidelines, awaiting this week's meeting of the Federal Reserve. 
 A rate cut is still expected, but robust retail sales and improving consumer confidence fed investor worries that this could be the last cut for a while. 
That feeling was reinforced by a report showing that productivity fell in the first quarter, driving up labor costs. 
 Financial stocks were hit hard after analysts warned that the weakened economy could cause consumer credit defaults to rise.
 Technology stocks fared even worse, with the Nasdaq falling to 2,107.43, down 84.1 points, or 3.8 percent. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended at 1,245.67, down 20.94, or 1.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrials also slipped, finishing at 10,821.31, down 129.93, or 1.2 percent. 
 In the bond market, corporations took advantage of low interest rates to issue a mountain of debt. Those moves, coupled with the concerns about rate cuts, undermined Treasury prices. The yield on the 10-year note jumped to 5.45 percent from 5.20 percent the previous week. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

HEADLINE: Fear and Poverty Sicken Many Migrant Workers in U.S. 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: CUTLER, Calif. 

 BODY:
Francisco Plaza, a 35-year-old farm worker from Mexico, made a rare visit to a doctor last year after he suddenly lost a lot of weight. The doctor told him that he had diabetes and ordered him to take two medications that cost $134 a month.
 But Mr. Plaza, who prunes fruit trees for $6.25 an hour, often skips his medicine, saying he cannot afford it after paying for food and rent. 
 "Some months he doesn't get much work, so it's hard to afford," his wife, Rosalva, said at their modest home in this Central Valley farm town. "When he doesn't work, he doesn't buy his medicine."
Mr. Plaza, who has lived in the United States for four years, is in the same bind as many other Mexican farm workers who live more or less permanently in the United States. While federal clinics for migrants are supposed to serve all indigent farm workers, illegal immigrants shun them because they do not qualify for state Medicaid coverage and fear discovery of their illegal status. (Almost half of the migrant farm workers are in the country illegally.) Farm workers often do not see doctors until their condition is so dire that they must go to emergency rooms, which are not permitted to turn them away.
"A situation we see every day is a terrible diabetic who can't afford the $200 a month for medicine, and that person ends up with renal failure," Dr. Oscar Sablan, who runs a clinic for farm workers in Firebaugh, Calif., said. "Then they're able to get a state health insurance card and dialysis. That's $1 million a year." 
Diabetes, high blood pressure and anemia occur at higher rates among California's 700,000 immigrant farm workers, mainly from Mexico, than among Americans, and the workers' health worsens the longer they stay in the United States.
A study to be released this month found that poor diet and infrequent visits to doctors make the health of longtime migrant farm workers considerably worse than that of those who have just arrived, even after accounting for differences in age.
Preliminary findings by the California Policy Research Center in Berkeley indicate that illegal immigrant farm workers, newly arrived from Mexico, have far lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure and less obesity than do farm workers who have lived here legally for a while. 
"It's an appalling picture," said Robert K. Ross, president of the California Endowment, a foundation specializing in health issues. "These are people who help keep food prices low for American families, and I have a hard time figuring out why their health status should be so poor."
Many things complicate the farm workers' health, including unfamiliarity with American medicine and a lack of exercise in the long stretches they are unemployed. A poor diet is a key to their high rates of diabetes, high blood pressure and anemia, researchers say, and it gets worse as the migrants combine American fast food with the staples of tacos and refried beans. Other factors are the lack of money and insurance.
A study released last November found that the women, 36 percent of the migrants, were far more likely than the men to visit doctors, largely because pregnant farm workers, even illegal immigrants, qualify for state health insurance. Indigent men here illegally do not qualify except for medical emergencies. The median income of the 971 farm workers in the November study, sponsored by the California Endowment, was less than $10,000 a year.
Many growers acknowledge that their workers' health is substandard, but they blame an inferior health system in Mexico and the failure of the workers to take care of themselves. Many growers say they cannot afford to provide insurance.
But many growers agree with advocates for the workers that the federal system of community and migrant health clinics is inadequate.
"The situation is harder because there aren't enough health professionals in many of these rural areas," Don Dressler, president of insurance services for the Western Growers Association, said.
These concerns have made an impression on the Bush administration, which has proposed a 10 percent, or $124 million, increase next year for the nation's 3,400 community health clinics, including its 400 migrant health clinics. Advocates for the workers applaud that, but are unhappy that Mr. Bush has proposed reducing money to train doctors in underserved rural areas.
Farm owners say they want laws that will make it easier to provide discounted health insurance through grower associations for documented and undocumented workers alike.
And like many farm workers, growers favor having more government-sponsored mobile health clinics visit farms. For many farm workers, simply getting to a clinic is an obstacle -- the clinics are often far away, the workers generally do not own cars, and buses rarely run between farm communities.
Don Villarejo, founder of the California Institute of Rural Studies, which conducted the November study, said the state, growers and workers should contribute to a health program. He proposes assessing a few cents per bushel of produce to help finance the program.
"For another nickel a head of lettuce, we could raise wages by 40 percent and provide health insurance," he said. 
Yovana Cisneros Espindola, 23, the wife of an undocumented farm worker from Mexico, was fortunate, because of her pregnancy, to have state health insurance last year when she suffered her first multiple sclerosis attack, which temporarily blinded her. Her child was born last November, and she no longer has insurance and cannot afford the pills needed to slow the advance of the disease. They cost $10,000 a year.
Rosalinda Avitia, a worker with Catholic Charities, wrote to the Biogen pharmaceutical company, which agreed to give Ms. Cisneros the medication for three months and to consider renewing the gift. 
Ms. Cisneros's husband, Francisco, hardly ever sees a doctor.
"It's too expensive," Mr. Cisneros said at their dark, crowded apartment in Visalia, Calif. "Even if I have a bad fever, I go to work anyway. If I miss work to go to a doctor, how am I going to pay for food for my family?"

HEADLINE: Lessons in Democracy, and Politics, in a Former Soviet Land 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: ALMATY, Kazakhstan 

 BODY:
When the history of Kazakhstan's stuttering transition from Soviet domination to independence is written, a snapshot of 19 people in the snow outside Parliament in the capital, Astana, may occupy an important place. 
 The picture commemorated something of a remarkable moment in this country, where Parliament is widely regarded as a rubber stamp. The lower house had just rejected a bill that the president was pushing and that would have benefited his daughter's news media empire. The picture, taken in February, showed smiling people fresh from successful lobbying of the legislators. 
 "For the first time, our efforts were reaching Parliament members," said Pasha Lobachev, who runs an organization for young people here. "It was amazing to see them pay attention and repeat our position in debates. We asked them to listen, and they did."
In the 10 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Western governments and private groups have lavished assistance on the former republics to help them along the road to democracy. The United States Agency for International Development spent $539 million worldwide in fiscal year 2000 to promote democracy. 
Kazakhstan, the largest and wealthiest of the former republics in Central Asia, has received $32 million from A.I.D. in the last decade, along with substantial sums from private organizations. The money has financed many private groups. 
The results have been mixed. After early signs of democracy, the government of President Nursultan Nazarbayev has taken an autocratic turn. Meanwhile, others here raise doubts about how effective the various visiting consultants and strategists have been in imparting democracy, noting that they may have been too theoretical and cautious. 
The campaign against the proposed law to restrict the news media could have gone the same way. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe provided $10,000, and Internews and the National Democratic Institute, both American groups financed by the Agency for International Development, provided technical advice. But what seemed to make the difference this time was that the campaign dealt with a single issue and was run by local people.
"We helped find some good people and gave them advice, but they mobilized hundreds of people in their communities to try to fix their own problem," said Eric Kessler, the representative here of the National Democratic Institute.
Some of the same organizations had joined efforts in November to defeat legislation some feared would weaken local governments. That victory had emboldened university students, who demanded better textbooks and instruction and heated classrooms.
To fight the news media law, a dozen organizations from across Kazakhstan joined together. The common element was concern that the proposed restrictions on the press and limits on Russian-language television broadcasts would restrict access to outside information and hurt local television stations, which depend on Russian-language broadcasts for revenue.
The groups gathered 45,000 signatures on petitions. They persuaded several local television stations to black out transmissions for a day to emphasize what viewers could expect if Russian-language programs were limited.
Finally, the campaign's leaders went to Astana to meet legislators. The aim was to provide members of Parliament with a rare chance to hear what constituents thought.
After the lower house responded by rebuffing the government, Mr. Lobachev returned to a hero's welcome in Almaty. His telephone rang constantly with congratulations. Then the inevitable occurred. Mr. Nazarbayev spoke out in favor of the news media law. When it was resubmitted, the lower house passed it overwhelmingly, though the upper house has not acted yet.
The community groups responded with another first. They obtained the record of the vote and telephoned legislators, demanding to know why they had abandoned their constituents. The legislators were stunned. Never before had the public known how they voted. Some actually thought votes were secret. The community groups vowed to publicize the votes before the next election and to get voting tallies on other issues.
The backlash came in April. Mr. Lobachev and others were visited by the tax police and called in for questioning by prosecutors. Suggestions were made about the legality of accepting foreign financing. The police seized files and computers and made veiled threats.
Mr. Lobachev said that he did not view the bill's passage as a loss and that he would not be intimidated. Pulling out the photograph of himself and his comrades outside Parliament, he said, "It's the beginning."

HEADLINE: In Ruin, Symbols on a Stone Hint at a Lost Asian Culture 

BYLINE:  By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
In an unexpected benefit of the cold war's end, Russian and American archaeologists say they have discovered an ancient civilization that thrived in Central Asia more than 4,000 years ago, before being lost in the sweep of history.
 The people of that area, the archaeologists say, built oasis settlements with imposing mud-brick buildings and fortifications. They herded sheep and goats and grew wheat and barley in irrigated fields. They had bronze axes, fine ceramics, alabaster and bone carvings and jewelry of gold and semiprecious stones. They left luxury goods in the graves of an elite class. 
 The accomplishments of those unknown people in what are now the republics of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan began to emerge over several decades of excavations by archaeologists of the Soviet Union, who worked diligently but in academic silence behind closed borders. The surprising scope of society suggested a stage of social and economic development generally regarded as civilization. All that seemed lacking was evidence of number or writing systems. 
With the end of the cold war, American archaeologists have joined the Russians in exploring the region, and now they are reporting that they have found inscriptions showing that these people may have indeed had writing, or at least were experimenting with a form of proto-writing around 2300 B.C.
"We are rewriting all the history books about the ancient world because of the new political order in our own time," Dr. Fredrik T. Hiebert, a University of Pennsylvania archaeologist involved in the excavation, said in an interview last week.
In the most recent and provocative discovery, Dr. Hiebert uncovered a small stone object engraved with four or five red-colored symbols or letters that apparently bear no resemblance to any other writing system of the time. Other scholars agreed that the symbols seemed to be unlike contemporary scripts in Mesopotamia, Iran or the Indus River valley. 
Dr. Hiebert made the discovery last summer in ruins at Annau, a site near the border with Iran and only eight miles from the Turkmenistan capital, Ashgabat. He described the findings a week ago at a symposium at Penn and yesterday at a conference on language and archaeology at Harvard.
"You can say we have discovered a new ancient civilization," Dr. Hiebert said. At the same time, the pyramids of Egypt had been standing for three centuries, power in the Tigris and Euphrates valley was shifting from Sumer to Babylon and the Chinese had yet to develop writing.
Dr. Victor H. Mair, a specialist in ancient Asian languages and cultures at Penn, who was not on the research team, said of the inscription, "I definitely think that's writing."
Dr. Mair added that the discovery of ruins of an advanced culture in a region "where there was thought to be just space and emptiness fills an enormous gap" in terms of trade and cultural exchange across Asia in antiquity. It suggested that people in Asia more than 4,000 years ago were not as isolated as once supposed, he said, but probably had continentwide connections.
The dozens of settlement ruins of the newfound civilization stretch east from Annau across the Kara-Kum desert into Uzbekistan and perhaps the northern part of Afghanistan. It is an area 300 to 400 miles long and 50 miles wide. Since no one knows who the people were or what they called themselves, archaeologists have given the culture the prosaic name of the Bactria Margiana Archaeology Complex, or BMAC (pronounced BEE-mack), after the ancient Greek names of two regions it encompasses.
Long after the ruins were buried in sand, the area was traversed by the legendary Silk Road, the caravan route linking China and the Mediterranean lands from the second century B.C. to the 16th century A.D. The oases that served as way stations for rest and resupply on the Silk Road also supported the BMAC civilization, which presumably was trading far and wide over some kind of ancestral Bronze Age Silk Road.
Dr. Carl Lambert-Karlovsky, a Harvard archaeologist, questioned whether the symbols on the artifact represented true writing. But he said that Dr. Hiebert's discovery "falls into place with other research showing that this culture was working out some sort of communication system, though it never reached the level of complexity in writing as its neighbors did."
Until the waning days of the Soviet Union, foreign scholars knew almost nothing of the nature and extent of the BMAC culture. Reports of findings were confined to Soviet journals.
In the post-cold-war openness, Russian archaeologists are eagerly sharing their knowledge and inviting collaboration with Westerners. Dr. Hiebert plans to return to Annau, possibly next month, for further excavations to be financed in part by the National Geographic Society.
Dr. Victor Sarianidi of the Institute of Archaeology in Moscow found a distinctive architectural pattern in many of the ruins. The buildings at each site appeared to be erected in one burst of construction according to the design of a single architect. The largest buildings were like huge apartment complexes, each bigger than a football field and divided into dozens and dozens of rooms. They were surrounded by multiple mud-brick walls, some as much as 10 feet thick. Beyond lay traces of agricultural fields.
In the 1990's, Dr. Hiebert began digging slowly to deeper, and therefore earlier, levels of occupation. He was rewarded last June while excavating beneath a room in what appeared to be an administrative building at Annau. That was where he found the carved symbols on a piece of shiny black jet stone, a type of coal, less than one inch to a side.
Archaeologists believe that it was a stamp seal, commonly used in ancient commerce to mark containers by their contents and ownership. The site also contained many lumps of clay that were used to seal vessels or parcels.
Scientists analyzing charcoal found with the artifacts dated the material at 2300 B.C., before the larger settlements were built. American radiocarbon dates have established that the BMAC culture was present in Central Asia from 2200 B.C. to 1800 or 1700 B.C. Russian research generally underestimated the culture's antiquity by about 500 years.
Back at Penn, Dr. Hiebert showed the symbols to colleagues, and they were stumped. They said the symbols were unlike the Mesopotamian cuneiform script, generally regarded as the earliest writing system, or the proto-Elamite writing on the Iranian plateau.
Dr. Gregory L. Possehl, a specialist in Indus archaeology at Penn, said the artifact's shape was wrong for an Indus stamp seal and only one sign could possibly be construed as related to Indus script. 
"It looks as if it is some kind of writing," Dr. Possehl said last week. "It is unique, as far as I can tell."
Dr. Mair assured Dr. Hiebert that the symbols were not Chinese, if the artifact is as early as has been dated. Chinese writing is thought not to have begun until hundreds of years later.
Whatever its origins, Dr. Mair said, the type of symbols and the small number of strokes used to create each one "makes me think the writing system is already fairly abstract, not pictographic."
Dr. Hiebert is not so sure. He cautioned that there was insufficient evidence to determine if this was an evolved writing system, or if these people had become aware of the existence of writing elsewhere and were experimenting on a system of their own. He speculated that the engraved stamp included a prefix symbol, a marker to designate the category of the word to follow, that preceded four symbols for the word or words. These could stand for the name of a commodity and its owner.
The only other example of possible writing by the BMAC people was reported two years ago by Dr. I. S. Klochkov of the Institute of Archaeology in St. Petersburg. He found a pot shard in the ruins at Gonur with what appeared to be four letters of writing in an unknown script and language. Other Russian research has turned up evidence that people of the BMAC culture made notations in pottery and clay.
Scholars have many questions about the new ancient civilization, mainly about where the people came from, what influence they had on their times and what happened to them.
Dr. Hiebert thinks that the culture emerged near Annau, in the foothills along the Iran-Turkmenistan frontier, where there is evidence of earlier villages. Dr. Sarianidi contends that the culture's roots lie in Turkey. Other scholars point to evidence showing that they might have migrated from the north.
The BMAC culture's decline is equally mysterious. "Why that happens remains unclear," said Dr. Lambert-Kovalsky of Harvard. "The architectural signatures, their fortified buildings, disappear after a few hundred years. Most of the luxury materials disappear. There is a diminution of complexity. Perhaps people revert to smaller settlements, or they leave and are absorbed in other cultures."
But for a while, in a land and a time unsuspected by archaeologists until recently, a civilization flourished and then vanished, leaving crumbling walls of mud brick and some cryptic symbols on a tiny piece of stone.

HEADLINE: How Open to Immigrants Should Germany Be? An Uneasy Country's Debate Deepens 

BYLINE:  By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, May 12 

 BODY:
With 7.3 million foreigners, or 9 percent of the population, Germany has the highest proportion of immigrants of any of the major European powers. But this presence makes many Germans uneasy and the country is now plunged once more into an intense debate about how open it should be. 
 The Christian Democrats this week opened a debate that is certain to be central to next year's election. "Germany is not a classic country of immigration, and because of its history, geography and economic conditions, it cannot be one," the party said in a new policy paper. 
 It did not define what classic means here -- although party officials say it is a reference to countries, like the United States, that were formed by immigration. But even that statement is a departure from the party's long-held position under the former chancellor, Helmut Kohl, that Germany was not a land of immigration -- classic or otherwise.
The Christian Democrats, trying to put pressure on the governing Social Democrats, who have not yet clarified their position, suggested for the first time that annual quotas for the admission of foreigners needed in the job market should be set, but insisted that all foreigners must adhere to "the values of our Christian culture." 
Dropping its explosive call last year for foreigners to accept a German leitkultur, or guiding culture, but retaining the gist of that appeal, the party said adherence to German norms and the avoidance of "parallel societies" was essential. The very mention of the word multiculturalism at Christian Democrats meetings these days tends to provoke hoots of disdain. 
"Our Christian culture, marked by Christianity, ancient philosophy, humanism, Roman law and the Enlightenment, must be accepted," the Christian Democrats said. "That does not mean abandonment of particular religious and cultural practices, but acceptance of our values and organization for living together." 
The party's statement -- its platform on immigration for the 2002 elections -- comes as a commission appointed by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder and including representatives of most political parties is preparing to issue its report this summer. In effect, the Christian Democrats are trying to pre-empt the chancellor's initiative. 
By far the largest single group of immigrants in Germany are Turks, who first came as "guest workers" more than 30 years ago and now number more than 2 million, or more than all the foreigners in Germany from European Union countries put together. Because they are overwhelmingly Islamic, the Turks tend to regard calls for adherence to Christian norms as a provocation. 
Several factors have brought the immigration issue to the center of debate. The first is a surge in the number of asylum seekers in the first three months of this year. They totaled 21,042, or 11.2 percent more than in the same period last year.
In all, between 1990 and 2000, Germany took in close to 2 million asylum seekers, far more than any other European state. Although many of them subsequently returned to their homelands, the high number has focused attention on the fact that trying to close the door to other forms of immigration only encourages would-be immigrants to seek asylum as their only recourse. 
The second factor is that the German birth rate, as elsewhere in Europe, is low, and several projections suggest that the country's population could fall to about 60 million by 2050 from the current 82 million if it does not accept immigrants.
A third factor, with the economy slowing again, is the growing awareness that unless Germany aggressively joins the global competition for talent that characterizes the information economy, the country will be at a constant disadvantage. "We need the best minds," Wolfgang Bosbach, the deputy leader of the Christian Democratic group in Parliament, said today.
But along with the awareness of the apparent need for some immigration -- expressed in the new proposal for bringing in the qualified through quotas -- a strong current of suspicion of, or outright hostility to, foreigners persists. 
The Christian Democrats proposed that all foreigners be obliged to take "integration courses" for which they would have to bear part of the cost. These courses would involve not only learning the German language but also German values and habits. 
Those completing the course should be rewarded by seeing their work and other permits extended, while those who refused should see their papers canceled or curtailed, the party said. 
It also proposed that current laws allowing foreign children up to age 16 to be reunited with their parents in Germany should be changed. Instead, only children up to age 10 would be admitted.
Party officials explained that the change was intended to ensure that Turkish parents in Germany did not send children, particularly girls, back to Turkey to be educated, before bringing them back to Germany. The proposal was also intended to ensure that any foreign child received some German schooling.
The Christian Democrats have made much of the fact that during the last two decades the number of foreigners has shot up to more than seven million from about four million, but the number at work has largely stagnated. As a result the burden placed on Germany's social security system -- through the payment of unemployment and other benefits -- has greatly increased. 
"Foreigners account for 9 percent of the population but 22.4 percent of social assistance," the party said. 
Mr. Schroder, while changing the law to make it easier for foreigners to obtain German nationality, has been guarded about what sort of immigration policy the country now needs, in part because he knows that a liberal policy would meet resistance in his own party.
Only his coalition partners, the Greens, have been forthright in calling for large-scale immigration. The Christian Democrats now hope that their adoption of a clear position will provoke further tensions on this issue within the governing coalition.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY; 
Lemieux Worn Down By Grind Of Playoffs

BYLINE:  By LIZ ROBBINS 

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., May 12 

 BODY:
Mario Lemieux had slept for 13 hours preparing for tonight's game, from 8 p.m. Friday to 9 this morning.
 He had hoped it would be enough to loosen his leaden legs and reduce his sleep deficit. But less than 48 hours after their Game 7 overtime triumph against Buffalo that sent them into the Eastern Conference finals against the Devils, the Penguins and Lemieux, their reinvented superstar, were still reeling from its effects. 
 Lemieux, who came into the game leading the Penguins and tied for the league lead in playoff points with 14, did not have a shot on goal in the Devils' 3-1 victory tonight in Game 1 of the series. The blank space in the box score painted the story for the Penguins. 
Shadowed by the Devils' fierce center Bobby Holik, shut down by defensemen Scott Stevens and Ken Daneyko, and slowed by weary legs, Lemieux struggled along with his teammates.
Lemieux said he feared this kind of performance might happen.
"Obviously, it was a very emotional series against Buffalo and to win in overtime and not getting much rest, I think it showed in the third period," Lemieux said. "It really takes a lot out of you."
The Penguins outshot the Devils, 7-3, in the first period, but the Devils took 18 shots to Pittsburgh's 8 the rest of the way. Still, the Penguins trailed by only 2-1 in the third period, but had little energy to recover.
"I thought we played pretty good in the first period," said Jaromir Jagr, who had just one shot. "After that, we were done."
Some of the Penguins refused to blame fatigue.
"No one wants to use the excuse that we were tired," wing Kevin Stevens said.
"That wasn't a factor for us," defenseman Andrew Ference said.
But Lemieux believed it was obvious.
Lemieux, the Penguins' owner and chief executive officer, came out of retirement on Dec. 27 to rejoin the team he left after the 1996-97 season. At 35, he reported that his previously ailing back has been feeling terrific, "the best it has been in 15 years."
But the fatigue caught up to him in the third game of the semifinals against Buffalo, when he said he did not have the same jump he had in the first series against Washington.
"The playoffs are grueling," he said. "You are not going to feel great the whole time."
The Penguins may have suffered from sleep deprivation and a natural deflation after losing the momentum in the second period, but the Devils' physical approach stymied Lemieux. In three regular-season games against the Devils, Lemieux scored just one goal and had one assist. 
"Mario's a big guy," Stevens said. "They played physical on him and that's the only way to stop him."
Penguins Coach Ivan Hlinka said: "I think they are concentrated on him every time he has the puck. They are right on him. They made it hard for him and they made some great plays."
By the third period, Lemieux appeared frustrated, taking quick slashes at Devils players.
"It's always frustrating when you're not winning," he said. "Any time you're not up to par, it's easier to defend against us. We've lost some games in the playoffs before and we've been able to bounce back. I think we sat back a little too much; we didn't force their defensemen as much as we did in the second and first and they got a lot more shots because of that.
"It just seems that's the way we've been playoffs: we have one great period and it changes. That's something we have to talk about, especially in between periods."
The Penguins went back to Pittsburgh after tonight's game and were required to pay $10,000 to the league for that privilege. The team will return Monday in preparation for Game 2 on Tuesday. Lemieux joked that the return trip was for Mother's Day, but the idea was for the Penguins to relax, at least for a day. "You are just going to get your rest when you can and hopefully feel good by the next game," Lemieux said, adding, "Anytime you sleep in your own bed, it's good."

HEADLINE: Secretive Agents Of Real Estate; 
A Dearth of Shared Listings Makes Home-Hunting Hard

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR

 BODY:
In most American cities, real estate agents pool their listings into one database that lets buyers and renters find out about all available properties, easing the ordeal of hunting for a place to live.
 But New York is not most American cities. Where else are there legions of adults who do not know how to drive, but consider jaywalking to be a cherished right? Where else was it illegal until only recently to install a disposal in the kitchen sink? Where else do cooperative apartments outnumber condominiums? Where else do cooperative apartments even exist? 
 So it should come as no surprise that residential real estate plays by its own rules in New York and that efforts to create a multiple-listing service, as the commonly used system is known, have failed.
Because there is no multiple-listing service, buyers and renters in New York have a hard time getting a good idea of what is truly available and what the going rates really are in a given neighborhood. Instead, they must rely on news reports, classified ads and anecdotal information from friends and agents. The properties of sellers, who want to garner the best possible price, get less exposure. 
The latest attempt to simplify the search for housing, prompted by consumer interest and technological advances, was led by a band of brokers who created a listings database and set up a public Web site. But they were unable to agree with the large firms like Douglas Elliman and the Corcoran Group, which are a part of Manhattan's real estate oligopoly and have no economic stake in sharing all their listings with smaller competitors -- or for that matter with consumers.
"There may be segmentation in the market, less information-sharing and more confusion for consumers in Manhattan real estate, but large brokers here have never been penalized for not having a multiple-listing service," said Marc M. Goloven, the senior regional economist at J. P. Morgan Chase, who is convinced that apartment hunting will not be made easier anytime soon because of economic conditions unique to the New York market.
Manhattan's real estate market has been as anachronistic as ever in recent years, and the debates here over whether to create a multiple-listing service have hardly changed since the Baltimore Board of Realtors created the nation's first computerized system of sharing in 1972. 
Typically computerized and, in many cases, available on the Internet, a multiple-listing service, or M.L.S., for brokers includes virtually all of its participants' sales listings. Members pay fees to join and must do business with any buyer's agent who indicates interest. By making listings public, a listing service gives consumers a fast, sweeping survey of prices and properties.
Other cities, including San Francisco, Washington and Los Angeles, have adopted multiple-listing services and say that they are pleased with the results. Brokers in those places say that their markets are less confusing for buyers and renters, and that it is much easier for agents to quickly close deals. 
But there are financial and other reasons that have led many Manhattan brokers to resist an M.L.S., Mr. Goloven said.
The form of home ownership in Manhattan fosters less sharing among real estate brokers. While other markets are dominated by condominiums and single-family homes, nearly 80 percent of Manhattan's owner-occupied housing units are in cooperative buildings, where residents own shares of the properties and resident boards have almost total control over which potential buyers will be let in.
The difficulty of navigating the co-op approval process -- in which boards can reject people not only for financial reasons, but also for social ones -- gives an advantage to larger established firms that have experience with the ordeal. Small firms often say they are shut out of the lucrative co-op business because large firms do not share listings.
"Often we never find out about many expensive listings," said Jean Kingman, the owner of Kingman Associates, a small downtown firm with a handful of agents. 
Most firms do share some listings with competitors through faxes, newspaper advertisements and their own Web sites. But brokers who help sell expensive co-ops, like Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Associates, a medium-size firm, argue against sharing some listings with inexperienced agents who they say could easily ruin a Manhattan co-op deal. 
"My concern is just that I would like to be able to make my own judgment as opposed to being obliged de facto to work with anyone who has the $120 to join the organization," said Mr. Peters, an on-again, off-again supporter of a Manhattan multiple-listing service. "The problem with the co-op process is that it is nondemocratic and you need to know that you have the right broker and the right buyer. If that makes me an elitist, I am an elitist."
Another problem is that in markets with multiple-listing services, agents say they sell most homes to buyers represented by agents from another broker. That means the two firms must split the commission paid by the seller, a reasonable compromise since listing services tend to increase the volume of deals.
But in Manhattan, where prices are high, large firms representing sellers have a strong incentive to hoard listings and find buyers on their own, rather than splitting the usual 6 percent commission with a competitor. It is easier for large firms, which are more prevalent in Manhattan than elsewhere, to easily match buyers and sellers without sharing. For example, Corcoran represents both the buyer and the seller in 65 percent of its deals. "If you do multiple million-dollar deals and do not have to share the commissions, you are not doing that bad," said LaLa Wang, president of MLX.com, an Internet firm that charges fees for access to Manhattan listings.
The idea of bringing a multiple-listing service to Manhattan gained momentum in recent years in part because of brokers' fears of Internet companies like Ms. Wang's and the Goldman Sachs-backed CityRealty .com, which posts apartment listings and offers discounted commissions. NYCRealty.com, another Internet firm, was closing 10 deals a month in 2000 and offering discounted commissions of 2 to 4 percent.
"Our biggest fear was that some third party with deep pockets was going to come in and collect all of our listings and take our business away," said Scott Durkin, the chief operating officer at Corcoran.
Barbara Corcoran, the founder and chairwoman of Corcoran, began holding secret meetings in 1999 in her Madison Avenue offices, where she was able to persuade executives at two other large firms, Douglas Elliman and Halstead Property, to join an effort to fight the Internet companies by creating a industrywide public Web site and an M.L.S for brokers only.
Together, the three firms control about half of the $8.4 billion residential real estate market in Manhattan.
But unlike most multiple-listing services, which are run by nonprofit corporations or local real estate boards, this one was to be owned by Elliman and Corcoran. The large firms said they saw ownership as a way to make up for the money they expected to lose by sharing.
That plan, announced last July, was met with skepticism by smaller brokers. Less than 10 weeks later, about 100 of those brokers and one large firm, Brown Harris Stevens, started their own public Web site. But days after that site, called www.nymls.com, started, the two groups of firms were able to chisel out an agreement to work together, during a marathon meeting. 
"The industry, from the buyer's view and the seller's view, and from our own very selfish view as real estate brokers, has been changed," Ms. Corcoran said at a news conference at the end of October in the Real Estate Board of New York's crowded basement, where 118 firms publicly committed to joining forces on the public Web site and to begin working on a listing service for brokers
But six months later, despite the promises, very little has changed for consumers, and on May 2, the group's board voted unanimously to abandon the nymls.com effort.
Some brokers believe that they will have to take another crack at a listing service because of a plan by New York Times Digital, the Internet division of The New York Times Company, to use nymls.com's old software company, Gabriels.net, to revamp its online classifieds section.
Brokers for both sides say the main sources of contention were the same old economics of the market -- large and high-end firms did not want to share listings or commissions. What had changed, according to the brokers, is that many Internet companies that were once feared had faded away or had stopped offering discounts.
Ms. Kingman of Kingman Associates, who had proposed starting a separate real estate association for small firms, says that the real losers are consumers. "Sellers lose because they want to get the best price through their property getting the widest exposure, and the buyers lose because it would make agents more efficient," she said. "The large firms are the only ones who think there isn't anything to lose."
But Mr. Durkin of Corcoran said the current economics of Manhattan real estate makes a multiple-listing service seem untenable -- at least anytime soon. 
"Given our size and the fact that we are able to sell more than half of our exclusive listings between two Corcoran agents, why would we bring in an extra set of rules and regulations of a multiple-listing service when our firm already acts as one?" he asked. "There is no economic benefit."

HEADLINE: Race? Ethnic Group? A Census Debate 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 According to Orlando Patterson ("Race by the Numbers," Op-Ed, May 8), the Census Bureau has created a false impression by counting as "Hispanics" millions of people who are really white. He calls Hispanics a "sociologically meaningless collection of peoples from Latin America and Spain." 
But this category is no less meaningful than the United States' traditional "races" of "black" and "white" -- all are social fictions that have real consequences when individuals and institutions treat them as real. 
 Hispanics themselves are helping make this category meaningful by developing social and economic institutions like Spanish-language media, Latino coalitions and caucuses and business enterprises.
The growth of a self-defined Hispanic population, united by a common linguistic heritage regardless of skin color, challenges our stultifying racial dichotomy, and creates a few more degrees of freedom of self-definition for all of us.

HEADLINE: At Annual Meetings Around the World, the Shots Aren't Heard 

BYLINE:  By MARK A. STEIN 

 BODY:
SHAREHOLDERS who turned up for the annual meeting of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold this month in Wilmington, Del., never had a chance to hear James R. Moffett, the chief executive, discuss the company's performance or a proposal, from a fellow stockholder, to change the way board members are elected. Mr. Moffett didn't bother to show up. Neither did any other director. 
 A few days earlier, investors trekking to Irkutsk in Siberia for the annual meeting of IrkutskEnergo, Russia's second-largest electric utility, got a different surprise: They found that two gatherings had been scheduled for the same day, one by the company and the other by renegade shareholders seeking to take it over. Despite a flurry of bans issued by a furious federal government, the rogue meeting went ahead, giving the plotting shareholders control over the company. 
 As much as the global competition for capital has homogenized the way companies in various countries conduct business -- from how they keep their books to when they introduce products -- some things have not changed. One is the distinct cultural differences found at annual meetings, where shareholders ostensibly exert control over the companies they own. Another is that, no matter the national characteristics of these annual meetings, investors rarely succeed at changing the minds of management.
German companies treat their shareholders to mini-Oktoberfests every April, serving up sausages by the ton and beer by the barrel to the thousands who show up to address -- or dress down -- executives who are inaccessible the remainder of the year; the meetings stretch for hours.
American companies, which used to offer similar perks, have long since cut back, partly to save money, partly to discourage attendance. Most now limit their largess to airline-style snacks or trinkets stamped with the corporate logo; many meetings last minutes, not hours.
In Japan, meanwhile, four-fifths of public companies meet on the same day each year, to limit the ability of shareholders who want to ask embarrassing questions to attend more than one such gathering. The practice frustrates both ordinary shareholders and a subset unique to Japan -- its curiously high-profile corporate extortionists, the sokaiya, who threaten to talk about the sexual proclivities of executives unless their companies hand over cash "gifts."
More than a decade after shareholder activists began stirring things up in the United States, the trend -- following American capital -- has spread overseas, making annual meetings rowdier in many places. But investor activists still dismiss these gatherings, and the booty that companies hand out, as little more than the bread and circuses that Juvenal satirized in ancient Rome: a distraction from the real business at hand. After filling up at the buffet, investors can say whatever they want, but corporate leaders still do whatever they want, particularly overseas.
"When it comes down to real matters like disclosure of executive salaries, companies are still not forthcoming," said Stanley Dubiel, head of the global department at Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory firm in Rockville, Md., that is owned by Thomson Financial Services. "There's a lot of talk about transparency and disclosure, but there is some reluctance to be the first to step out."
This year, with economies slowing and profits plummeting, investors are even more intent on demanding accountability. But as reports from around the world show, they are not always successful.

HEADLINE: VICARIOUS CONSUMPTION; 
Boots Made for Walking On Pennsylvania Avenue

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
TAIWAN'S president, Chen Shui-bian, would seem to have enough on his plate these days, what with the governments of China and the United States playing a game of superpower chicken in the skies above his island. But as Mr. Chen plans a quick stop in the United States next month, a visit certain to inflame the Chinese, he has already outlined a major priority of the trip.
He wants to buy a pair of cowboy boots.
 And he is not alone. 
 The cowboy boot, that pointy-toed icon that country singer Jerry Jeff Walker immortalized as "manly footwear," is almost trendy. For some people, especially here in Texas, it has never gone out of style. And there was, of course, that period of mechanical bull-induced insanity that swept the nation after "Urban Cowboy." 
But now the industry is benefiting from some high-profile product placement, courtesy of President Bush.
"He is really helping the western wear and boot business, like his dad," former President George Bush, said Rocky Carroll, a custom boot maker here, speaking of "43" and "41," as the current and former commanders in chief have taken to calling each other. "Since he became president, more doctors, more lawyers and a lot of the Secret Service are wearing them."
The statistics to measure a "Bush bump" in boot sales are hard to find, because there is no association that tracks the sales of only the cowboy variety. Boots are a niche within the larger footwear industry. And custom boots are a niche within the niche. Lisa Lankes, a spokeswoman for Justin Brands, which owns lines like Justin Boots and Tony Lama, estimated that two million pairs are sold annually, roughly three-quarters of them in the Southwest. Justin Brands is a unit of Justin Industries of Fort Worth.
But people in the industry agree that sales are picking up, and, equally important, that there is a buzz about boots these days. "Boots never go away," Ms. Lankes said. "We're starting to see some interest in high fashion that will ultimately trickle down and hit the mainstream."
The runway show that signaled the return of the boot was staged in January at what was otherwise known as the presidential inauguration. At the Black Tie and Boots Inaugural Ball, sponsored by his fellow Texans, Mr. Bush was joined by Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and the state's two senators, Kay Bailey Hutchison and Phil Gramm. 
There, for the world to see, particularly the cameras, they hitched up pants legs (and a skirt) to reveal four sets of custom cowboy boots, each pair made by Mr. Carroll. Had the models not all been Republicans, the late President Lyndon B. Johnson probably would have smiled at the unabashed Texas-ness of the moment. Mr. Bush's pair, sewn from black eel skin, was embossed with the blue presidential seal, in case anyone forgot the reason for the party.
"Tom DeLay, who was on the stage and the only one wearing blue jeans, said, 'Rocky, I need some boots,' " Mr. Carroll recalled. (Mr. DeLay, the majority whip of the House of Representatives, suffers no shortage of boots; he and a fellow Texan, Dick Armey, the majority leader, are members of the Congressional Boot Caucus, a group whose sole membership requirement seems to be wearing cowboy boots.)
Mr. Carroll, 63, is the unofficial boot maker to the president, whichever president happens to be in office. By his count, he has made customized boots for the last six, back to Gerald Ford. Mr. Carroll still keeps the "lasts," or the molds he carved to match the shape of each presidential foot, in case he needs to make another pair. Mr. Carroll says he has made 56 pairs for former President Bush and 25 pairs for the man who defeated him, Bill Clinton. He said that Mr. Clinton had the biggest foot, 13D, and that Jimmy Carter had the smallest, 9D.
There is no traditional career path toward becoming the presidential boot maker. Mr. Carroll got the job by giving them free boots. "I never charge a president," he said. "I just feel honored to do it."
Besides, he added, "I really couldn't even pay for the advertising I get out of this."
Ronald Reagan became curious enough about Mr. Carroll that he requested an audience. "He called me and invited me to the White House because he wanted to meet his boot maker," Mr. Carroll said. "When the White House operator called me, I said, 'What did I do?' "
Mr. Carroll said he once met Mr. Reagan at an airport in Texas. "I said, 'Mr. President, where are your boots?' " Mr. Carroll recalled. "He said, 'Oh, my gosh, Nancy dressed me, and I'm in Texas and I'm wearing shoes.' "
The world headquarters of Mr. Carroll's boot empire is a dumpy building in North Houston known as RJ's Boot Company. A quarter-inch of dust clings to the motionless ceiling fan, and a pile of junk covered by a plastic tarpaulin sits in the floor space that could be called the showroom. There are stray skins from alligators, ostriches and eels, and the air smells like leather and polish. The only hints of grandeur are the signed presidential photographs on the wall.
"If the Statue of Liberty needed boots, she'd probably get them from Rocky Carroll," said Bill Sturgis, 52, an oil-and-gas auctioneer who visited the shop recently. Mr. Sturgis owns 13 pairs of Rocky Carroll boots and credits them for easing his back problems so that he can stand all day for his job. Another customer claims that his boots cured him of polio, although the jury is apparently still out on male pattern baldness.
Many Texas men, of course, are more loyal to their boot maker than to their first wives. The Wheeler Boot Company in Houston celebrated its 40th anniversary in October, thanks to customers like Glenn Lilie, who owns 46 pairs of custom Wheeler Boots. (To his credit, Mr. Lilie has been married to his first and only wife for 36 years.) 
"If I was having a bad day, since I don't drink, I'd go and spend two hours on a pair of cowboy boots and get it out of my system," said Mr. Lilie, 59, the chief executive of the CPI Group, an oil-field services company in Houston. "They're unique, if you design your own pair. There's a multitude of toe styles, a multitude of colors. Jiminy Christmas, it's way beyond your basic black and brown."
Mr. Carroll, who made his first pair of boots at the age of 6 and is the son of a boot maker, could not agree more. To honor the economic summit held in Houston in 1990, he made a commemorative boot on which he stitched the flags of the seven major industrialized nations. 
Cowboy boots can display school mascots, company logos, the state flag of Texas and just about anything else. He stitched "QE2" on a pair for Queen Elizabeth because there was not enough room for the entire name. He also has a pair of boots on display in Mr. Reagan's presidential library. Even Pope John Paul II was given a pair.
MR. CARROLL usually spends a few days making a pair of boots, but he says that in an emergency, he can rush out a pair in eight hours. His prices begin at $295, he said, and top out at $40,000, which is what he charged Elizabeth Taylor for a diamond-crusted pair.
According to "Art of the Boot" by Tyler Beard (Gibbs Smith, 1999), a glossy coffee-table book for the true bootist, the Mona Lisa of custom boots is the pair known as the Tony Lama "El Rey III." Made with black alligator and English calf, inlaid with 24-karat gold and encrusted with 384 diamonds and rubies, the boots are valued at $50,000. Both the El Rey and the El Rey II pair were stolen during traveling exhibitions, so the El Rey III pair has constant security. Custom boot makers say boots like these take months to create.
Eventually, the day may come when a president must muster on without a pair of Rocky Carroll boots. Mr. Carroll says he is considering selling his company. Of course, he also says he is planning to clear away that pile of junk under the tarp in his shop -- and his customers know that he has been saying that for 10 years.

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
Silicon Alley's Philosopher-Prince

BYLINE:  By LYNNLEY BROWNING 

 BODY:
TALK is Omar Wasow's stock in trade.
 As a hip visionary for the digital era, Mr. Wasow appears three mornings a week on WNBC-TV in New York. Dressed in Gucci suits, his hair in dreadlocks, he offers viewers dulcet-toned ruminations on technology. He is also an Internet pundit for MSNBC, the NBC "Today" show and "Oprah," where last year he taught Oprah Winfrey how to surf the World Wide Web. And he is in demand as a speaker at technology conferences with titles like "Applied Brilliance" -- a recent gathering in Sedona, Ariz., of architects and interior designers. 
 Mr. Wasow, 30, also runs BlackPlanet.com, a Web site with more than 2.5 million registered users, more than any competitor. BlackPlanet.com invites blacks to engage in frank discussions of issues from ebonics to the latest D'Angelo album. The Web site reflects Mr. Wasow's belief that digital discussion groups and e-mail, now the most popular tool on the Internet, promote ethnic bonds among Internet users.
In its nearly two years of existence, BlackPlanet.com has yet to make money. But Mr. Wasow is out to demonstrate that the ephemeral voices of online ethnic communities can make for a profitable business. According to Mr. Wasow, who grew up in in a multi-ethnic family (his father is of German Jewish heritage, and his mother is African-American), "Our company is built around the idea that ethnic identity is a useful organizing principle for people."
Started in 1999 by Community Connect Inc. of New York, a builder of community Web sites, BlackPlanet.com features message boards, instant messaging, chat rooms, news and e-mail, and lets members create personal Web pages. All of it is free. The message boards focus on politics, history, pop culture and lifestyle topics. One forum discusses reparations by insurers that overcharged black consumers; another looks into the personal politics of interracial dating. 
The privately held site, based in Silicon Alley in Manhattan, operates on part of the $20 million that Community Connect has raised from venture capitalists and private investors, including Sandler Capital Management of New York and Robert Goldhammer, a retired vice chairman of the former Kidder Peabody.
BlackPlanet.com also gets advertising revenue from corporations like Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft. Despite the dot-com downturn, which has scared off many Web advertisers, BlackPlanet.com expects revenue to increase 80 percent this year, to more than $12 million, mostly on new ads and on sponsorships that offer exclusive advertising rights to high-profile areas of the site. Mr. Wasow, whose job is to manage BlackPlanet.com and its 15 staff members, attract advertisers and devise new ideas, said the company could be profitable by early next year.
But industry analysts, and even the Web site's investors, are skeptical.
"From a business perspective, they're doomed," said Ekaterina O. Walsh, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. When asked if online communities could profit, Mr. Goldhammer praised Mr. Wasow's sales skills with corporate advertisers but replied, "Who knows?"
Ms. Walsh asserted that people deep in digital conversation were unlikely to click on ads. She said the company would need to charge subscription fees -- a hard sell to consumers who are accustomed to free service. And grouping consumers by ethnicity, rather than through categories like gardening, is ineffective, she added.
None of that sways Mr. Wasow, who has a reputation as a sort of philosopher-prince of the digital age. Last year, People magazine named him the "Sexiest Internet Entrepreneur." 
"The best the Web has to offer is community-driven," Mr. Wasow said. He sees the community principle at work in such varied places as eBay, the online auction site, and even Google, the search engine that ranks results according to their popularity among users, he said.
Such musings have gained Mr. Wasow a following. "Omar Wasow is one of the most thoughtful theoreticians on the Internet today," said Henry Louis Gates Jr., a professor of African-American studies at Harvard University, and the creator of Africana.com, a Web site he sold to AOL Time Warner. Steve Jurvetson, a prominent venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, called Mr. Wasow "very kind, smart and empathetic."
But Mr. Wasow acknowledged that competitors like BET.com and BlackVoices.com had sometimes lured advertising from his company. And he said the financial troubles of online communities like iVillage.com, a Web site aimed at women, had hurt his efforts to woo more advertisers.
Still, some companies see potential rewards in marketing to online ethnic communities like BlackPlanet.com.
In February, Time magazine used the site to begin its first Web-based marketing effort aimed at black consumers. It offers articles, like profiles of prominent African-American leaders, from its 50-year-old archive, and free trial subscriptions to BlackPlanet.com members.
"We see an opportunity to reach the African-American marketplace," said Brian D. Wolfe, director of consumer marketing at Time. But, he added, "it's an experiment for us." BooksOnline.com, part of a joint venture of AOL Time Warner and Bertelsmann, agreed last month to sponsor the books area of BlackPlanet.com. BooksOnline will contribute interviews with authors and first chapters of new works, and will feature articles on literature with African-American themes, said Seth Radwell, the president and chief executive of BooksOnline.com.
Despite those deals, Mr. Wasow said, he does not want to rely only on advertising. Last month, BlackPlanet.com started a fee-based dating service, where members can pay up to $19.99 a month to screen other members. Mr. Wasow said he might also expand his site into a minority job-recruitment bank that corporations could use for a fee. And BlackPlanet.com may start an advertising consulting agency for companies trying to reach minority consumers on the Web. 
Mr. Wasow, whose father is an economist and whose mother is an education fund-raiser, displayed an early passion for technology. Growing up in Manhattan and Brooklyn in the 1980's, he frequented a club for Macintosh enthusiasts. In 1993, after studying race and ethnicity at Stanford University, he founded New York Online, a company that designed Web sites for Consumer Reports, Vibe and The New Yorker. 
"It was bleed into a hard drive in your living room, live on rice and beans and pray the next dollar comes in," Mr. Wasow recalled. He ran the money-losing enterprise from his Brooklyn apartment and financed it through credit cards, friends and family. He closed the company after Community Connect wooed him to start BlackPlanet.com.
Mr. Wasow expressed scorn for executives who hyped the Internet, only to flee when the technology-stock bubble burst last year.
"Those who are still in this business are here because they have a passion for these technologies and their possibilities," he said. "It's back to living on a dollar and a dream."

Nation in a Jam

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
When asked whether Americans should make any changes in their lifestyle to address energy problems, Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, waxed eloquent: "The American way of life is a blessed one. We have a bounty of resources in this country. What we need to do is make certain that we're able to get those resources . . . into the hands of consumers so they can make the choices that they want to make as they live their lives day to day." 
 So now we know how they're going to play it. Over the next few months Dick Cheney and friends will insist that their conservation-is-for-wimps energy policy isn't about defending business interests; it's about freedom -- and anyone who disagrees is an elitist who doesn't trust Americans to make their own choices. 
 But you don't have to be an elitist to think that the nation has lately been making some bad choices about energy use, and about lifestyles more generally. Why? Because the choices we make don't reflect the true costs of our actions. 
Consider, for example, the problem of traffic congestion.
Last week's Urban Mobility Report by the Texas Transportation Institute got a lot of well-deserved press attention. The report showed that it's not our imagination: traffic really has gotten much worse over the last few years. What it didn't say, but clearly implied, was that there is a growing disconnect between private incentives and public consequences.
When you or I decide to drive during "congested time" -- what we used to call "rush hour," but which now lasts about six hours every day -- we make that congestion a bit worse, and thereby impose a cost on all the other people who are trying to get somewhere. (And they do the same to us -- we are all both perpetrators and victims.) That's a very real cost, in time and money; but it's a cost we as individuals don't take into account.
How big is this hidden cost? I've made some rough calculations for greater Atlanta, which has come to epitomize urban sprawl. In 1999, the average Atlanta resident lost 53 hours to traffic delays, compared with only 25 hours as recently as 1992. Over all, traffic congestion cost Atlanta $2.6 billion in 1999; had delays been no worse than in 1992, that cost would have been $1.4 billion less. 
Why did Atlanta's traffic get so much worse? The main answer is that despite billions spent on highway construction, the roads have been clogged with ever more cars: between 1992 and 1999 vehicle registrations rose by 550,000. Not all of those vehicles were used during congested periods; I would guess that an extra 400,000 cars were actually driven during peak times. Those 400,000 cars were responsible for the extra congestion cost.
Do the arithmetic and you find that each individual's decision to commute by car in Atlanta imposes congestion costs of $3,500 per year, or $14 per workday, on other people. These are costs over and above the costs actually paid by the driver himself -- that is, they are costs that drivers don't take into account. And this number does not take into account environmental impacts (air quality in Atlanta is steadily deteriorating).
Suppose for a moment that anyone who chose to commute by car in Atlanta actually had to pay $14 per day for the privilege. No doubt some people would still choose to live in distant suburbs and drive long distances -- and that would be their right. But as it stands, driving in Atlanta -- and to a lesser degree in every other American metropolitan area -- is in effect heavily subsidized, because people don't have to pay for the costs they impose on others.
Which brings us back to the administration's energy policy.
George W. Bush, according to Mr. Fleischer, "believes that the American people are very wise and that, given the right incentives, they will . . . make their own right determinations about how much they can conserve. . . ." Unctuousness aside, he has a point. Right now, however, our system doesn't give people the right incentives. So you might imagine that an administration seriously concerned about the nation's future would give a high priority to getting those incentives right -- to making Americans take into account the costs their actions impose on other Americans. 
Oh, never mind. Cost -- economic and environmental -- is no object when you're defending a blessed lifestyle, especially if it means burning more fossil fuels.

HEADLINE: At Annual Meetings Around the World, the Shots Aren't Heard; 
Haute Cuisine But Little Drama

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: France 

 BODY:
French shareholder meetings, traditionally listless rubber-stamp affairs, have occasionally grown livelier in recent years as activist shareholders, often spurred by American financiers, have taken to challenging management on questions of strategy, executive appointments and corporate governance.
But last month in Paris, the Vivendi Environnement meeting, in a vast, opulent hall under the courtyard of the Louvre, beneath the glass pyramid that is now the museum's entrance, had none of this.
 The company, a water utility and builder, made a profit of 615 million euros, or $538.7 million, last year, compared with a pro forma loss of 42 million euros a year earlier, before it was spun off by Vivendi Universal, the media conglomerate with interests ranging from advertising agencies to Universal Studios. And Henri Proglio, the chief executive of Vivendi Environnement, said that despite economic slowdowns in the United States, Europe and Asia, his company expects sales to grow at least 10 percent annually in the next three years. 
 After brushing aside a shareholder's inquiry about a police investigation of a former chief executive -- a not-uncommon event these days in France -- the board called for a vote on several issues, including an employee stock-purchase plan, and received almost 100 percent of the vote.
Aside from a few financial analysts and institutional shareholders, most of the 2,200 people at the meeting were retirees, including former employees.
The pinnacle of most French company assemblies remains the buffet, and Vivendi Environnement did not disappoint. Four chefs in towering toques sliced fish and meat as hors d'oeuvres while bartenders filled glasses with Pommery Champagne, a rich red 1996 Chateau Tourteau Chollet from Graves in the Bordeaux region, J & B Scotch whiskey and, for more sober investors, Perrier water.
French companies have always been generous with shareholders at meetings. A business magazine here recently reckoned that the Champagne given to shareholders at the annual meeting last year of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the luxury goods group, was worth 45 times the dividend the company paid.

HEADLINE: Panel Seeks New Cigarette Tax And Limits on Tobacco Industry 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12 

 BODY:
The federal tax on cigarettes should increase by 17 cents a pack to pay tobacco farmers to stop growing the crop, and the government should have the power to regulate tobacco products, a presidential commission recommends.
 The White House said President Bush would study the report, scheduled to be released on Monday. 
 Created in September by President Bill Clinton, the 10-member commission of farmers, health advocates and economic experts explored ways to protect the public from smoking hazards and to give tobacco growers an economic incentive to switch crops. 
The 17-cent increase in the current 34-cent a pack tax would raise $3.4 billion annually for a buyout of the tobacco-quota system, based on estimated yearly cigarette sales of 20.2 billion packs, according to the report.
The tax rose by 10 cents a pack in 2000 and is to climb by an additional nickel a pack next year.
The commission estimated the cost of the buyout at $16 billion over five years if three-quarters of tobacco farmers stopped growing the crop. After five years, dollars from the higher tax should pay for smoking cessation programs and other public health initiatives, the report recommended.
Quotas are allotments dictating how much tobacco farmers can grow. The commission proposes to replace that system with production licenses, which, unlike quotas, could not be rented to other farmers.
Ending that practice would put tobacco production in the hands of only active growers and lower production costs for many farmers, the report said.
Tobacco farmers in recent years have experienced steep cuts in the amount of tobacco they can grow, the result of declining cigarette sales and an increased reliance on cheaper tobacco from oversees.
The commission also urged giving the Food and Drug Administration more authority over the tobacco industry. The agency, the report said, should be able to regulate advertising that might reach teenagers and force tobacco companies to remove harmful or addictive substances such as nicotine from cigarettes.
The F.D.A. asserted jurisdiction over tobacco and sought to crack down on cigarette sales to minors in 1996, but the Supreme Court last year ruled the agency needed Congressional approval.
M. Cass Wheeler, a commission member and chief executive of the American Heart Association, said he hoped the recommendations would be used "as a road map for passing legislation."
A White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said Mr. Bush "recognizes youth smoking is a particularly serious public health issue, and the president believes strongly that we should focus on cracking down on youth or teen smoking."
A spokesman for the nation's largest cigarette maker, Philip Morris Inc., declined to comment, saying the company had not seen the report.

HEADLINE: ENERGY INDUSTRY RAISES PRODUCTION AT A RECORD PACE 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN and JEFF GERTH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12 

 BODY:
The energy industry is drilling for natural gas, building gas pipelines and constructing power plants at an unprecedented pace as companies respond to high energy prices by significantly increasing investment.
 The intense activity comes as President Bush prepares to unveil a national strategy to address what he has called an energy crisis. The policy is expected to emphasize streamlining of regulations, many of them intended to protect the environment, that Bush administration officials say have caused an alarming gap in energy supplies. 
 Vice President Dick Cheney, who leads the task force charged with drafting the energy plan, has cited a litany of statistics -- a shortage of refineries, power plants, natural gas pipelines and other energy resources and infrastructure -- to warn of a trend toward supply shortages. The solution, he says, is urgent government action. 
But the latest statistics from government and industry analysts show the energy industry shifting into high gear, investing heavily in areas that were seen as unattractive just a few years ago.
Thus even before the government has eased any regulations, even as high energy prices create a sense of crisis in Washington, the investment boom promises a cyclical increase in supplies that is expected to stabilize or reduce prices in coming months, many industry executives and private analysts say.
"Prices go up and we start drilling," says Jerry Jordan, whose company in Columbus, Ohio, plans to dig 10 to 20 natural gas wells this year. Washington has a role to play, Mr. Jordan said, in opening restricted land for gas exploration down the road. For now, he says, there is plenty of natural gas available and "we're going to get it to the market."
Big oil companies plan to invest about $41 billion to expand natural gas supplies this year, while new drilling rigs in operation have hit an all-time high of 955. That is indicative of what is going on broadly in the industry.
Power companies, reacting to high electricity prices in California and elsewhere, plan to add 90,000 megawatts of electricity generating capacity in the next 18 months, one industry estimate says. That is nearly one-fourth of what the Department of Energy says is needed to meet growth in demand through 2020.
Rising natural gas demand has prompted companies to build transportation pipelines at a frenzied pace. The federal Energy Information Administration says 1,895 miles of new pipelines were added last year. It expects companies to complete 4,300 miles this year and 4,650 miles next year, record increases in capacity.
President Bush said on Friday that gasoline prices were high because refineries, which administration officials said had been hobbled by environmental laws, could not increase output. "The reason why we have problems at the gas pump is that we have not built any more refineries," Mr. Bush said.
While some experts agree with Mr. Bush, others on Wall Street see it differently. Several investment analysts last week downgraded the stocks of leading refining companies because they have produced so much gasoline recently, possibly sending prices south by midsummer.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney have often cited high prices as evidence that industry cannot meet demand because regulations make it too hard to increase supply. Industry officials have applauded the focus on streamlining regulations that they consider costly to comply with. But many acknowledge that those complaints have little to do with the price of gas today.
The reality of energy markets has gotten lost "in the politics of the moment," says Ken Cohen, vice president for public affairs of the Exxon Mobil Corporation in Irving, Tex. The company would like to see environmental regulations become more predictable, he said. "But the market isn't broken. If you let the markets work, the markets will clear," or meet demand.
Jay Hakes, who until recently was director of the Energy Information Administration in Washington, said that the recent surge in activity by energy companies shows that there is no chronic supply deficit. 
The problem, Mr. Hakes said, is not that energy companies cannot respond to demand, but that newly deregulated energy companies, denied the certainty of earning a return on investments that state and federal regulators once provided, tend to respond all too rapidly. 
Oil, gas, pipeline and utility companies shelved investment plans and shuttered operations when energy prices slumped in the 1990's. Demand growth accelerated by the late 1990's, prompting companies to embark on a fresh investment binge that is starting to close the gap today.
"Washington seems bereft of solutions to the real energy problem," Mr. Hakes said. "Deregulation cut the fat out of the system, and left people vulnerable to very volatile markets."
Mr. Hakes said that the government's toughest task is finding a way to buffer the swings between surplus and scarcity. He said such policies might use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to reduce oil market gyrations. Another possible role for the government would be to offer refiners and electricity providers a tax incentive to build extra capacity that could come on line when supplies are short.
To date, the Bush administration has argued strongly against market intervention, especially when it comes to deregulated electricity and natural gas prices.
"My own view is that the great strength of the American economy is the extent to which we've sort of led the charge on deregulation," Mr. Cheney said in a recent interview. "Over time we'll have much sounder policy if we let the market work."
Yet while the Bush team rules out any action on prices, it treats supply shortages as a national emergency requiring prompt attention. It was a failure of government policy, especially the spread of environmental restrictions, that has left Americans vulnerable to what "Californians are experiencing now, or worse," Mr. Cheney said late last month.
Industry executives have been pressing for years to get relief from environmental laws -- most notably the Clean Air Act and land use restrictions. But such regulations are viewed by many executives as nuisances rather than as barriers to meeting demand.
Refineries have to satisfy dozens of fuel-grade standards that states set to meet federal pollution-control goals, impinging on economies of scale. Environmental laws and "Nimby" attitudes -- "not in my backyard" -- also make it difficult to build a new refinery, although no companies in recent years have tried to do so. But the bigger headache for the industry is fierce competition that keeps profit margins thin.
"Our margins are not wide enough to justify building new refineries. When we need to expand, we do it at existing sites," said Gene Edwards, senior vice president of Valero Energy of San Antonio, one of the nation's largest independent refiners. He said the company planned to add enough capacity at existing plants to increase its output of 750,000 barrels of gasoline a day by 90,000 barrels a day.
In natural gas, many Democrats agree with the Bush administration that some restricted land should be opened to exploration to increase reserves and tame prices, which spiked last year. But many in the industry say it was economics, not regulatory restraints, that led to the recent shortage.
Prices were so low in the 1990's that many companies left the business. Demand crept up as power plants began using natural gas, which burns relatively cleanly, to produce electricity. The industry has since struggled to fill orders, though the recent surge in drilling suggests it is catching up.
The long-term picture looks brighter, even without Washington's help. Late last year, as natural gas prices moved toward record highs, major producers on Alaska's North Slope -- BP Amoco, Exxon Mobil and Phillips Petroleum -- announced plans to build a multibillion-dollar pipeline to the lower 48 states. The companies control tens of trillions of cubic feet of natural gas in Alaska, but never tapped it because building a pipeline seemed foolhardy when prices were so low.
Electricity followed a similar trajectory. Generators in California and elsewhere did not build many power plants in the 1990's. Chris Seiple, who follows generating companies for RDI Consulting, in Boulder, Colo., attributes that to a hangover from a 1980's building boom, and uncertainty surrounding deregulation.
With no incentives from Washington, power companies have responded readily to higher prices. They are now finishing work on power plants that will add 92,000 megawatts to the nation's capacity by next year, enough to power 90 million homes. That is more than they built in the last decade -- and enough that Mr. Seiple predicts a new bust will follow the current boom.

HEADLINE: Cheney Ever More Powerful As Crucial Link to Congress 

BYLINE:  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12 

 BODY:
A dozen House Republicans from California were seething when they met with Vice President Dick Cheney last week to discuss the state's power crisis. 
 Angry that Gray Davis, the state's Democratic governor, was trying to pin the blame for the problem on Republicans, the lawmakers urged the White House to fire back. Mr. Cheney, a former House leader, listened patiently as the lawmakers encouraged him and the White House to attack Mr. Davis, before tersely cutting off the clamor. 
 "It's not part of the White House strategy and it won't be," Representative George P. Radanovich recalled Mr. Cheney saying. 
As quickly as he silenced talk of one option, he rekindled discussion of others. Legislators asked Mr. Cheney if the government could tell its offices in California to conserve energy. A few days later, it was done: Mr. Bush ordered federal offices in the state to lower their thermostats.
"You talk to Dick Cheney and things happen, and he doesn't necessarily take credit," said Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader. "There is a connection between going to Dick Cheney and getting action." 
More than any vice president before him, Mr. Cheney has emerged as a supreme power broker within the Bush administration and between the White House and Capitol Hill. It is a role Mr. Bush planned for Mr. Cheney, the 60-year-old former secretary of defense and White House chief of staff with impeccable conservative credentials, when he picked him as his political partner. But Mr. Cheney has proved to be even more influential than was imagined during the campaign. 
As President Bush's consigliere, Mr. Cheney helps connect the dots for the administration as he zigzags all day long from hot-button issue to high-level meeting, discreetly imparting advice whenever his boss asks or needs to know. 
Behind the scenes, Mr. Cheney urged Mr. Bush to follow up quickly and unequivocally on his campaign pledge to build an expansive missile defense system. Last week, Mr. Bush gave that commitment in a major speech. 
Last month, when the White House sought to avert a divisive Republican Senate primary in Minnesota that could upset plans to challenge Senator Paul Wellstone, a Democrat, Mr. Cheney was asked to intervene. Shortly after the vice president called, one of the contenders, Tim Pawlenty, the majority leader of the Minnesota House, abandoned the race.
"Because of the way the vice president operates, in a rather low-profile way, I think his influence oftentimes is substantially underestimated," said Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho. "His fingerprints are everywhere."
Mr. Craig credited Mr. Cheney with helping win Senate approval on Thursday for a budget plan close to what President Bush had proposed, clearing the way for the first big tax cut in two decades. 
On the eve of the vote, Mr. Cheney called a handful of senators, including Max Baucus of Montana, one of five Democrats who eventually backed the plan.
In interviews and in recent television talk show appearances, Mr. Cheney has sought to paint a more prosaic picture of his work.
"When you're in one of these jobs, there's the perception from the outside that you're powerful," he told CNN's Larry King. "On the inside, you're not sure of the leverage you're connected to anything. I mean, you deal with difficult problems, try to move the Congress, shape public opinion, deal with a difficult situation -- and it's usually three yards in a cloud of dust. There aren't very many home runs in this business." 
It is a business that begins every morning at 8 in the Oval Office, where Mr. Cheney sits down for coffee with the president to review world affairs and the day's agenda. Most days, the two men seem tethered at the hip. 
When Mr. Bush meets separately each week with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, Mr. Cheney is there. When Mr. Bush has his weekly economic and domestic policy briefings, Mr. Cheney sits in. When Mr. Bush meets foreign leaders and dignitaries, Mr. Cheney is usually by his side. 
Mr. Cheney also meets weekly for lunch with Mr. Powell, Mr. Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser. "He has excellent judgment," Ms. Rice said. She said she especially valued Mr. Cheney's advice on the Middle East, a region he has known well since the Persian Gulf war.
This operating style, critics say, makes Mr. Bush a figurehead and Mr. Cheney the real man in charge. That is a perception the vice president rejects. 
"I see him several times a day, but that's what the president wanted when he asked me to be his running mate," Mr. Cheney said in a television interview last month. "We work very closely together. But he's very much the C.E.O. of the operation. He runs the show, and I do whatever he wants me to do." 
This week, Mr. Cheney is getting ready to release a far-reaching energy report that was drafted by an interagency task force he led. Even though the report is expected to call for more oil and gas drilling, Mr. Cheney insists it will be balanced. 
"The idea that somehow only the energy industry has access just simply isn't true," Mr. Cheney said in an interview. "We'll make decisions on what we think makes sound public policy." 
In the coming weeks, Mr. Cheney will turn to overseeing an anti terrorism commission that will try to make one cohesive unit of the sprawl of agencies responsible for responding to acts of terrorism. And he will probably help reconcile the Pentagon's request for billions of extra dollars with fiscal restraints imposed by the White House budget office. 
White House aides say Mr. Bush entrusts the vice president with so much not only because of Mr. Cheney's experience and judgment, but also because he has no presidential ambitions of his own. 
"The vice president is ready to be president but he is not looking to be president," said Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff. "The vice president is on the president's team, and everyone who works for the vice president is on the president's team. That's a big change. With Reagan-Bush and Clinton-Gore, the reality is they had political interests that were sometimes not converging." 
When he is not tackling issues at the White House, Mr. Cheney dashes quietly around Capitol Hill, where he responds to the questions, travails and ideas of countless Republican lawmakers in the House and Senate as he tries to push Mr. Bush's agenda. Senate Republicans call him the 51st senator, and Mr. Cheney responds in kind by attending their weekly policy lunches.
But Democrats have complained that Mr. Cheney has ignored their views and has conducted his energy review largely in secret. Mr. Cheney has accepted an invitation to join Senate Democrats for lunch this Tuesday, and some of his aides are bracing for a contentious meeting. 
In the House -- where Mr. Cheney is most comfortable -- he attends Republican leadership meetings and holds court in an office just steps from the House floor, which Speaker J. Dennis Hastert cleared especially for him. 
But his involvement on the Hill goes far beyond meetings with leaders. In his quest to create a broad coalition for Mr. Bush's agenda, Mr. Cheney carves out time for just about any lawmaker who requests a meeting. And he is direct in a way many politicians are not. 
"There is no deviousness or hidden agenda," said Senator Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican and a friend of Mr. Cheney's. "What it is, is what it is. There is no wiggle-waggling around."
It is a care-and-feeding strategy with Congress that has gone a long way to win over lawmakers, who are often looking as much for an influential ear to bend as for results. "When I convey my views to the vice president, it's equivalent virtually to the president," said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. 
The scene at the Senate Republicans' weekly luncheon last Tuesday illustrated how Mr. Cheney operates. The vice president sat at a table with seven senators, and throughout the meal lawmakers drifted over, dropped off notes or papers, and whispered requests about personnel, policy or legislation. He jotted it all down on a notepad. 
After the Senate lunch, Mr. Cheney spent a half hour with a half-dozen House Republican moderates, who have been critical of the administration's environmental policies and have expressed alarm at reports that Mr. Cheney's energy review will give short shrift to conservation. 
The legislators seemed as impressed by the vice president's accessibility as they were by his promises to promote conservation and renewable energy sources. "This is the third or fourth time we've sat down with Dick Cheney since January," said Representative Wayne T. Gilchrest, a Maryland Republican whose district includes Chesapeake Bay. "I didn't talk to Al Gore more than once in eight years, and that was for barely 45 seconds." 
During the debate over the budget resolution in the Senate, Mr. Cheney practically camped out near the Senate floor, where he tried to persuade reluctant Republicans to vote for Mr. Bush's tax cut and helped soothe jittery nerves. When he was hungry, he ate in the Senate dining room. In the end, he cast two tie-breaking votes. 
Mr. Cheney is not one for grand entrances -- unlike former Vice President Al Gore, who often descended on Capitol Hill in a flurry of blaring sirens. His small motorcade stops at traffic lights on his orders.
He has reduced his security detail to attract less attention. The sergeant-at-arms of the Senate, who is typically charged with walking vice presidents around the Capitol, has been relieved of that duty. 
"He seems to be everywhere, but in an understated way," said Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona. 
But is Mr. Cheney -- a man who has had four heart attacks over the last two and a half decades -- cramming too much into each workday? 
In March, he complained of mild chest pains, and doctors found that one of the arteries in his heart had become partly clogged again. They reopened the stent in the artery. Two days later, he was hustling from meeting to meeting. This week he acknowledged that he might have to return for another minor procedure someday. 
But Mr. Cheney has tried to blunt people's fears by following doctors' orders. He works out for 30 minutes nearly every morning on an exercise machine, eats healthier foods and has lost 20 pounds since last fall. 
"There is a danger that he could be spread too thin," said Senator Roberts, comparing Mr. Cheney to Marshal Matt Dillon, the television western hero everyone always turned to to head up a posse. "I don't know how many posses he can lead. I suppose that's a worry."

HEADLINE: Drug Labs in Valley Hideouts Feed Nation's Habit 

BYLINE:  By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: MADERA, Calif., May 12 

 BODY:
Along the country roads off Highway 99, it is plain to see why the Central Valley calls itself the nation's fruit basket. Rising from some of the richest soil in the world, disciplined rows of fig and almond trees give way to orange and lemon groves, cherry orchards and bushy lettuce and cabbage plants, as far as the eye can see.
 But hidden away on this soil, in abandoned barns and falling-down farmhouses, hundreds, if not thousands, of laboratories are churning out illegal methamphetamine, the highly addictive stimulant that Barry R. McCaffrey, the former federal drug czar, has called "the worst drug that has ever hit America." 
 As a result, methamphetamine is likely to be one of the biggest challenges for President Bush's newly nominated drug czar, John P. Walters, and the man Mr. Bush selected to run the Drug Enforcement Administration, Representative Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas. 
In the last few years, the Central Valley, particularly its heartland, has become so inundated with methamphetamine laboratories -- many of them run by Mexican crime families -- that the Drug Enforcement Administration has labeled it a "source nation" for the drug. The valley's only competition, federal authorities say, is Southeast Asia, which produces and distributes the drug in pill form, mainly to Europe. Here the drug is produced as a powder, which users snort, inject or even slip into their coffee.
"It's been growing tremendously in the last five or six years," said Joe Keefe, chief of operations at the drug agency. "In 1996, we looked at methamphetamine trafficking by the Mexican nationals and had 60 investigations. In the last couple of months, we had over 800." The organizations have also expanded their marketing all over the country, he said, such that methamphetamine produced in California can be bought on the street in Portland, Me. 
Other states, particularly Washington, Missouri and Iowa, also have significant problems with methamphetamine laboratories, but 97 percent of the "superlabs" that can be traced to Mexican drug operations are in California, law enforcement officials say. The state produces 80 percent of the drug found in this country, the officials say, 60 percent of it in the pastoral towns of the Central Valley stretching from Bakersfield to Sacramento.
Government officials consider methamphetamine the fastest-growing illegal drug in this country, in Canada and in parts of Europe, feeding an epidemic of addiction that they say rivals that of heroin and cocaine over the past few decades.
But the impact is felt acutely here as the clandestine laboratories poison the Central Valley's soil with byproducts and tax the combined resources of special squads from dozens of law enforcement agencies. Officials have also expressed particular concerns about children who live in or near the laboratories and are exposed to dangerous fumes. 
In the last decade, officials say, methamphetamine production has surged in the state as a whole and in the Central Valley in particular. In 1999, 261 laboratories were seized in 9 of the valley's 17 counties, triple the 73 seized seven years before. 
But the cartels, officials say, see the raids simply as the price of business. When a laboratory is raided or found accidentally -- sometimes when the cooks blow up the building they are in -- the operation simply finds another barn or house.
This makes the operations particularly hard to break, said William Ruzzamenti, a special agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration and director of the Central Valley High Intensity Drug-Trafficking Area program. The Central Valley program, which began in January 2000, operates four task forces from more than 50 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies that comb the valley for the laboratories.
They are relentlessly busy. Central Valley's methamphetamine task forces and other law enforcement agencies crack five laboratories a day in California. The amount they seize is only about a tenth of the methamphetamine produced, officials estimate. 
The drug cartels out-finance the antidrug efforts many times over. The Central Valley task forces, for instance, receive $2.5 million a year in federal aid to fight the producers.
"We keep busting them," Mr. Ruzzamenti said. "But they keep setting up shop."
Methamphetamine, widely known as meth, crank and crystal, was once produced and sold solely by outlaw motorcycle gangs, drug officials say. In the 1960's and 70's, the gangs cooked the product in remote outposts in the California desert and distributed it themselves. Then, in the early 90's, as crack waned, Mexican crime families, primarily from Michoacan, who had been trafficking in cocaine from Colombia, discovered that they could make more money by creating their own product, which they would not have to smuggle to the United States.
In places like San Diego, San Bernardino, Riverside and Los Angeles Counties, they began setting up the superlabs -- those that produce at least 10 pounds a day, unlike the smaller, amateur laboratories run by drug users. 
But aggressive law enforcement efforts began putting a crimp in the superlabs, and about four years ago, officials say, the cartels began moving operations north to the San Joaquin Valley, the wide-open section of the Central Valley.
Law enforcement officials say that shaking the superlab operations is particularly hard in the Central Valley because its vast, unpopulated stretches and ready access to interstate roads make it easy to hide and transport methamphetamine. Also, the valley's chronic high-unemployment rate makes recruiting workers, ignorant of the deadly risks of producing the drug, as easy as selling lemonade on a hot day.
"One of the tragedies of this business is that the crime families consider the work force a renewable resource," Mr. Ruzzamenti said. "When the workers get too sick from all the chemicals they've been ingesting to keep going, they just bring over or recruit others."
Any unassuming building can be a methamphetamine laboratory producing up to 100 pounds per 24-hour cooking cycle. Robert Pennal, commander of the Fresno Anti-Meth Task Force -- which covers three of the most active counties, Madera, Fresno and Merced -- has learned to look at every building in the middle of a field with a suspicious eye.
"They love buildings deep in a field, where they can look out and see who's coming," said Mr. Pennal, on a recent tour of Merced County. Last year, the task force raided 56 laboratories, 36 in Merced alone. And the majority, Mr. Pennal said, were superlabs run by Mexican syndicates. 
To demonstrate the ordinariness of a superlab, Mr. Pennal drove to one his task force raided more than a year ago. The farmer who owns the land was unaware of the site until it was raided and was still awaiting word from the county health department on when he could tear the building down. But when Mr. Pennal pulled up to the property, he discovered new trash bags full of the ingredients used to produce methamphetamine, from gloves to denatured alcohol to Coleman cooking fuel. 
The abandoned farmhouse had once again been used to produce the drug, perhaps even the day before.
Superlab operators will rent a farmhouse and work on the property for as long as a year without the farmer who owns the property even realizing it, Mr. Pennal said. The cartels either pay off a farm worker to act as a lookout or rent the farm worker's house as a laboratory, paying the worker to keep quiet.
Earlier this month, an almond and fig farmer in Madera County stumbled onto a laboratory in an abandoned house on his 600-acre farm. "I noticed the windows were boarded from the inside, so I just went inside," said the farmer, who refused to give his name for fear of retaliation from the cartels.
What he found was a laboratory in midcook, capable of producing 40 pounds of methamphetamine a day. The drug is immediately cut once, often twice, for a yield of perhaps 80 to 120 pounds. On the street, its value would be $1 million to $2 million, depending on where it was sold. (Wholesale prices run from $4,500 to $8,000 a pound in California, $15,000 to $20,000 a pound on the East Coast, Mr. Pennal said.) The drug costs $1,300 to $1,800 a pound to produce, including labor and raw ingredients, an unpalatable assortment that can include crushed diet pills, nasal decongestants, even antifreeze. 
Two people were arrested that day -- a farm worker who lived next door in worker barracks who was suspected of having been hired to keep quiet and watch the laboratory, and a suspected laboratory employee found on the premises.
But just to remove the materials and catalog them took dozens of special agents, many of them outfitted with thousands of dollars worth of protective equipment. The ground around the Madera farm laboratory was white with the residue of methamphetamine byproducts. 
"The farming situation being what it's been the last couple of years," said the farmer, "we're most worried about the hazardous materials and what it's going to do to the farm. If it costs a lot to clean, we just might give up the farm."
Officials say the laboratories create up to 10 pounds of waste for every pound of the drug. With an estimated output of well over 100,000 pounds a year, that means a million pounds of waste is being produced, including chemicals like red phosphorous, hydrochloric acid and hydriodic acid. One of the most dangerous byproducts is phosphine, which scientists say is so toxic only a few molecules can be deadly. 
When a laboratory is found, the state hires waste cleanup companies to remove the materials inside (at a cost to taxpayers of approximately $10 million a year). But the cost of cleaning contaminated soil and groundwater is the property owner's burden. More and more, said John Anderson, the sheriff of Madera County, where about a dozen superlabs were found last year, owners are abandoning their properties. 
"One farmer was hit with a $600,000 cleanup bill and he let the farm go for back taxes," Mr. Anderson said. "Now the county has to foot the cleanup costs."
There are other costs as well. Child protection agencies here, flooded with cases of neglect and abuse, trace the majority of the cases to parents who use methamphetamine, which causes paranoia and violent outbursts in some users. In addition, the Central Valley task forces recently began testing children they find in or near methamphetamine laboratories, because fumes produced in the cooking of the drug can destroy lung tissue and induce chemical pneumonia. Every single child, said Mr. Ruzzamenti, the drug enforcement director, has tested positive for methamphetamine or a toxic byproducts.
"Methamphetamine is the most significant drug threat in this district," said John Vincent, the United States attorney for the Eastern District, which covers the Central Valley. "About 75 percent of the drug cases that we bring annually are methamphetamine cases."
The penalties for methamphetamine production are high. Possession of 500 grams, just over a pound, commands a minimum mandatory sentence of 10 years in prison, and the higher the amount, the higher the sentence. A production line worker in a superlab -- which employ five to six workers and a foreman -- is liable on conviction to be sentenced to 30 years to life in prison.
But Mr. Vincent noted that most raids resulted in arrests of low-level workers -- the renewable resources -- and left the source untouched. "It is difficult to work your way up the chain for two reasons," he said. "Lab workers are kept ignorant and they fear retaliation."

HEADLINE: U.S. Nurtures Growing Bond With India On Defense 

BYLINE:  By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 12 

 BODY:
Unlike most of the world, India has reacted positively, if somewhat ambiguously, to President Bush's proposal for a missile defense, and in response the Bush administration is continuing the warming trend in American-Indian relations that began under Bill Clinton.
 On the third anniversary of India's nuclear tests, which led the United States to impose sanctions on India, Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage said here on Friday that the United States was worried about Pakistan's development of a nuclear arsenal, but he did not mention a paired worry about India's own nuclear capacity. 
 India, the world's largest democracy and the dominant power in South Asia, has long sought to be treated distinctly from its subcontinental rival, Pakistan, ruled by the military since late 1999, and to win legitimacy for its decision to develop what it calls "a minimum nuclear deterrent." 
Pakistan has been troubled by the friendliness developing between the United States and India, and today Gen. Pervez Musharraf -- perhaps stung by Mr. Armitage's remarks -- reacted coolly to Mr. Bush's proposed defense plan.
Asked about Mr. Bush's proposal, the general was quoted by Pakistan's official news agency as saying that the government opposed "any action that re-initiates a nuclear and missile race." His remarks came in the midst of Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's visit to Pakistan. Military experts say China has provided Pakistan with nuclear technology in the past, and China sees Mr. Bush's missile defense proposal as a challenge to the effectiveness of its nuclear force.
After India conducted nuclear tests in 1998, Pakistan responded with its own tests. Both were roundly condemned at the time.
So Mr. Armitage's comments in New Delhi were music to the Indian government. It was also pleasing to India that the United States was consulting Indian leaders about America's nuclear policies -- given the United States' vehement criticism of India's nuclear tests.
At a news conference after meeting with Indian officials, Mr. Armitage said Mr. Bush's missile defense program was aimed at offering protection from states like Libya, Iraq and North Korea. While he did not explicitly include Pakistan, he did say that American concerns about Pakistan were well known.
American officials have long fretted about Pakistan's political instability and deep economic problems, as well as the growing assertiveness of Islamic fundamentalists there.
On Mr. Bush's proposed nuclear policies, India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, said he welcomed Mr. Bush's decision to step away from the development of offensive nuclear weapons -- and pointedly reiterated India's need for its own nuclear deterrent.
India has been lavish in its praise for Mr. Bush's plan to make deep cuts in America's nuclear arsenal, but it has been less explicit about its position on the missile defense itself, which other countries worry would encourage a new arms race and destabilize the global strategic balance.
According to Indian officials, President Bush has accepted an invitation to visit India, though no date has been set.

HEADLINE: To Ease the Pain Of the Farmers 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Bit by Bit, Tiny Morland, Kan., Fades Away" (front page, May 10): The rural economy, and that of towns like Morland, is in a decades-long tailspin due in large part to low farm prices -- market prices well below the farmers' cost of production. Independent farmers, the base of rural American towns, are being pushed off their land because farm receipts will not cover expenses. 
Grain prices are at their lowest level in more than three decades.
 The root of this crisis is clear: a failed federal farm policy that has abandoned independent farmers in favor of a food production system controlled by giant multinational agribusiness corporations. 
 Congress must address this issue head on by passing a new farm bill that supports a price in the grain market for independent farmers and not a windfall for agribusiness giants.

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
For consumer goods producers, it is not so bad to be behind bars.

BYLINE:  By Pamela LiCalzi O'Connell 

 BODY:
MORE than 1.3 million inmates were under the jurisdiction of state and Federal prison authorities in 1999, according to the Justice Department. During the 12-month period ended June 30, 1999, the Federal prison population rose 9.9 percent, the largest yearly gain ever reported. The incarceration rate has tripled since 1980.
 To some, these figures are a national embarrassment. To others, they represent a marketing opportunity. Particularly in consumer electronics. 
 Take headphones. They are a ubiquitous feature of prison life, given the potential for conflict over noise and music preferences. Indeed, headphones are required by some corrections departments and are popular items in commissaries and mail-order catalogs that sell directly to inmates. 
In the last 10 years, the Koss Corporation, a maker of headphones, has become a leading supplier of "listening accessories" to the prison market. Koss learned, however, that not just any headphone is a good fit behind bars. The product has to be customized: the ear cups and housing must be transparent or "clear," so drugs cannot be stashed inside. The headband must be plastic, with no metal springs, so a knife cannot be fashioned from it. The cord has to be a bit weaker than usual so it can't be used as a garrote, for permanently silencing a guard or cellmate.
Koss also developed simpler packaging and adjusted its warranty policy for this market. "Our lifetime warranty was really being abused by the customers in prison," said John Koss Jr., vice president for sales at the Milwaukee-based company. "On the advice of our distributors, we have now reduced that warranty on our clear products to 90 days."
Outside prison, Koss is second only to Sony in retail stereo headphones, with a market share of 28 percent, according to the research firm NPD Intelect, and had overall sales of $34.8 million last year. It entered the prison market by chance when it was asked to bid on a contract for "ear bud" personal listening devices at one prison. Now, according to Mr. Koss, its line of inmate headphones represents more than $1 million in sales annually.
Although Koss is not the only company that aims at the large and growing incarcerated population, it is one of the few companies willing to talk about how it markets to the segment. "This business is very quiet, very tight-lipped," Mr. Koss said. "We sell through a group of closely held companies that specialize in getting merchandise into the prison stores. This is a lucrative business -- both for the manufacturers and the distributors -- so there's a reluctance to talk about it for fear of attracting competition."
One of Koss's distributors confirmed that assessment.
"We don't like exposure," said Tom Thomas, president of Union Supply. The company, based in Rancho Dominguez, Calif., distributes items to prison commissaries and also offers a catalog of more than 5,000 items for direct sale. "This is really a closed market," Mr. Thomas said. "Once you get in and get a contract, it's hard to dislodge someone." 
There is another reason for secrecy: politics. Much of the public and most lawmakers dislike the idea that prisons are stocked with consumer electronics items, or that prisoners have access to presumed amenities of any kind. In response to such sentiment, Congress is considering legislation that would prohibit use of federal money for things like cable television, martial arts training and weight-lifting equipment in penitentiaries. Many corrections officials disagree, since offering -- or withholding -- such items or activities can be useful in managing the prison population.
Statistics on commissary sales of nonfood items are hard to come by. The Federal Bureau of Prisons, the Justice Department and the American Correctional Association were unable to supply numbers. But one thing is undisputed: It is a severely fragmented market. 
"Prison shops are run differently state by state, even prison by prison," said Michael Dallaire, the executive director of Correctional Health Care Consultants in Forestdale, Mass. Mr. Dallaire monitors the prison market closely and assists people entering the health care segment. "Many times, what's sold depends on the level of security and is at the warden's discretion," he added.
One commonality is a movement toward clear products. "Clear is growing nationwide; it's a contraband issue," Mr. Thomas explained. "Clear TV's, hot pots, shavers -- any product that is allowed into an inmate's personal possession -- all the way down to clear trash cans."
Zenith Electronics has manufactured a TV set with a clear polystyrene cabinet for four years. "Everyone in this area knows the story about the guard uniform that got smuggled into a prison in a TV," said Nancy Langendorf, national sales manager for Zenith's government and special markets group. "As a result, some states only allow clear TV's now." Other requirements include, of course, an earphone jack, as well as a list of no-nos: antenna, flip-down door and remote (it could be turned into a bomb detonator). 
Zenith's "prison TV" (as it is called within the company, now owned by LG Electronics of South Korea) is oddly attractive, with its minimalist translucent casing, and its appeal has extended beyond the prison population. The unit has caught the eye of some retailers and proved popular with children. "As a result, we've developed some nonprison models with translucent colors, similar to the iMac," Ms. Langendorf said, referring to Apple Computer's translucent machines. 
There is an almost endless demand for new items, because inmates possess an uncanny ability to alter products in unexpected ways -- and rarely for the greater good. "It's amazing what they can do to even simple items, electronic ones in particular," says David Blackburn, executive assistant to the warden at the Federal Correctional Facility in Lompoc, Calif. "That's the key when any new item is made available: Can this be altered and become a threat to security?"
Certainly, mail-order distributors to the market have to take extra precautions. "We don't hire just anyone off the street, in case they have relatives in prison," Mr. Thomas said. "And at the end of every day, we make sure that everyone involved in packing and shipping hands in their Exacto blades. We can't have something like that accidentally shipped behind bars."
Still, although the prison market is difficult to crack, "considering the demographics," he said, "it's worth it."

HEADLINE: Lincoln Center Considers a Dome and More to Enliven Its Central Plaza 

BYLINE:  By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
Is Lincoln Center planning a coverup? 
 Officials aren't talking, but arts groups say they expect to be briefed tomorrow on a proposal to enclose the complex's central plaza under some kind of dome or other covering. The design envisions a profusion of new restaurants and other sheltered amenities to reinvigorate Lincoln Center's 40-year-old campus, which is showing its age. 
 At this point, say people who have heard about the option, it is only an idea, conceived as part of a master plan for the refurbishment of the center that is expected to take about 10 years and to cost $1.5 billion, of which New York City has pledged to contribute $240 million. 
In an interview on Friday, Gordon J. Davis, president of Lincoln Center, said that planners "were asked to think on a whole range of ideas and not to censor themselves -- that's the kind of process we're in."
So, a dome?
"They've recruited a large array of consultants to investigate one of the most beloved and complicated spaces in America," said Mr. Davis. 
Dome?
"I'm not going to tell you," he said.
In interviews last week, executives of several of Lincoln Center's constituent arts organizations mentioned the enclosure proposal as one of the more dramatic elements of the emerging master plan, which is supposed to be completed this summer. To be adopted, the plan must be approved by all 11 participating arts organizations, including Lincoln Center itself and constituent groups like the New York Philharmonic, the New York City Ballet and the Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Opera.
One executive said the enclosure proposal, which would cover the area between Avery Fisher Hall, the Met Opera and the New York State Theater, was sure to be vigorously debated but that he was keeping an open mind. "I would like to see the dome before going on record as saying we don't need it," he said. Another said he had heard discussion of a dome patterned after the soft, billowing transparent roof that encloses the British Museum in London, part of a $145 million project finished last year. 
Rebecca Robertson, executive director of the Lincoln Center Constituent Development Project, the corporation in charge of the rebuilding, declined to say whether a dome was under consideration. "We're thinking about a lot of things," she said. There are no schematics or other sketches for display, she added. Marshall Rose, chairman of the development project, was away on business and could not be reached for comment. 
The operating heads of the 11 participating organizations -- the Metropolitan Opera rejoined the development project on May 3 after a four-month breach -- have been called to a meeting tomorrow at Lincoln Center that is billed as a "working session on public spaces and ancillary facilities."
At the meeting, some of those invited said, the two firms selected as the master planning team for the project, Cooper Robertson & Partners and Beyer Blinder Belle, are expected to brief participants on proposals for the common areas of the campus, including the possible enclosure. Plans for individual projects like reconstruction of Avery Fisher Hall would be taken up later.
Discussion of the shared spaces around the 18-acre campus, including the central fountain plaza, connecting walkways and Damrosch Park, is likely to touch on issues like the "hostile walls" that some believe separate Lincoln Center from the community and like the complex's unshaded stone plazas, which some see as forbidding.
One of the most contentious issues is expected to be a new home for City Opera, which now shares the State Theater with the City Ballet. The hall was built for dance, with acoustics designed to deaden footfalls -- unsuitable for the opera's vocal and instrumental demands. But the opera is contractually bound to occupy the hall, or guarantee occupancy, until 2014.
Paul Kellogg, artistic and general director of City Opera, said the company had a $50 million pledge for a new home from a former chairman and major benefactor, Robert W. Wilson, and that Lincoln Center's fiscal sharing formula promised the opera $24 million in city contributions. Mr. Kellogg also said that studies by Lincoln Center had shown that a new opera house would be economically feasible and that the opera's obligations to the State Theater could be assumed by other bookings. 
City Opera had a particularly strong year, he said, with 84 percent of the seats sold and a balanced budget for the sixth straight year. In addition, he said, the company signed five- and four-year contracts with the American Guild of Musical Artists and Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians. 
As for where a new opera house would go, Mr. Kellogg said he did not want to talk about sites while discussions were continuing. The Metropolitan Opera has gone on record opposing any new buildings in Damrosch Park south of the Met. Other arts executives said that possible locations for a new opera house included sites on the Fordham University campus on Lincoln Center's southern boundary at 62nd Street and at Martin Luther King Jr. High School on Amsterdam Avenue at 65th Street, which would have to be demolished. The site of the American Red Cross building at Amsterdam and 66th Street was considered but is too small, executives said.
Dome or no dome, the debate over a new Lincoln Center can hardly prove more divisive than the original discussions in the 1950's. No fewer than 1,000 site plans were considered before one was chosen. When the plan was finally completed, a budget cut sliced the size of some buildings by 25 percent, famously with a carving knife applied to clay models of the structures.

Stock Rally in April Left Many Hedge Funds Behind
For many individual investors, the Federal Reserve's surprise rate cut last month and the rally in stocks was welcome news after a prolonged drought. But many hedge fund managers were betting on continued market declines and badly trailed the broader market.
 Hedge funds are designed to weather bear markets, in part by selling short, which involves borrowing shares from a broker and betting that they will decline in value. Short selling, though, did not help in April, and many hedge funds also lagged because they had stashed away a lot of cash. Page C7.

Next Leap in Making Computer Chips
The makers of computer chips are preparing for the first radical change in production techniques since the mid-1990's. The change involves increasing the size of the round silicon wafers from which chips are culled. Instead of the current standard diameter of 200 millimeters (about 8 inches), chip makers are moving toward wafers of 300 millimeters (roughly 12 inches), above. The larger wafers can yield more than twice as many chips, which can cut down on manufacturing costs. C6.

Behind Bars, a Market for Goods
Inmates of prisons are a niche market for consumer electronics companies that are willing to comply with certain regulations.

HEADLINE: Many Hedge Funds Stumble on Wrong Side of Market Surge 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
The wizards of Wall Street had a bad spell in April.
 The market went up. 
 For mom-and-pop investors, the Federal Reserve's surprise rate cut and the rally in stocks were welcome news after a prolonged drought. But many hedge fund managers, Wall Street's exclusive star investors, were betting on continued market declines, and badly trailed the broader market in April as it surged. 
For all investors, this year has been as tough to navigate as last year, with some dramatic surges offsetting prolonged downturns. 
"The term 'March Madness' generally refers to college basketball's annual ritual," Lawrence A. Bowman, chief executive of Bowman Capital Management of San Mateo, Calif., wrote in a letter to his investors in March. "However, during the last two years the market has suffered its own kind of madness." He added, "The market's schizophrenia is not expected to end soon."
The firm's Bowman Technology fund fell 6.3 percent in April, leaving the fund down 20.2 percent through the first four months of the year after half a decade of top returns. In the wake of the decline, Mr. Bowman's chief partner, John Hurley, is considering leaving the firm.
Another top technology hedge fund manager, Daniel C. Benton, also had troubles in April but has profited over all this year. Mr. Benton's Pequot Technology fund, despite losing 5.9 percent in April, is up 5.3 percent through the first four months of the year, compared with the 14.3 percent decline of the Nasdaq composite index over the same period.
By and large, hedge funds have done well during the bear market because many are meant to weather such conditions. Such funds cater to the rich and to institutional nest eggs like college endowments, often require at least $1 million as a minimum investment and charge fees considerably higher than the average mutual fund available to the general public.
As part of their strategy, many hedge funds sell stock short, betting their borrowed shares will decline so they can buy them at a more favorable price. During the bear market, short-selling generally helped. Last year, the average hedge fund was up 7.9 percent, according to the Hennessee Group, a hedge fund consulting firm, in contrast to the 9.4 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. Hedge funds continued to outpace the market in the first quarter.
Short-selling, though, did not help in April, and many hedge funds also lagged because they had stashed away large amounts in cash. As the S.& P. 500 gained 7.6 percent, the average hedge fund rose 1.6 percent.
"It's a whipsaw," said Greg Newton, president of M.A.R./Hedge, a hedge fund industry tracking firm. "When the Fed pulls a number like that and the market reacts the way it does, people who have made money on the short side give some back."
During the bull market, hedge funds focused on technology proliferated. The likes of Mr. Bowman and Mr. Benton replaced George Soros and Julian Robertson as top hedge fund masters. Both men ran macro funds, which make big bets on the direction of global stock, bond, currency and commodity markets.
Such funds fell out of favor at the end of the decade. Pequot Capital Management of Westport, Conn., the largest hedge fund manager, is being split by its chief partners, Mr. Benton and Arthur Samberg, into two groups, each with about $8 billion.
Moore Capital Management of New York, the second largest, with $8 billion to $9 billion in assets, according to industry experts, has persevered. The firm's performance has been flat this year.
Hedge funds typically charge at least a 1 percent annual fee and 20 percent of profit for their services. But some of the technology funds that cropped up in the bull market are doing little better, if not worse, than technology mutual funds. Silicon Capital Partners, a hedge fund run by Firsthand Capital Management of Denver, has lost 31.1 percent this year through the end of April. That is worse than the performance of the Firsthand Technology Value fund, the firm's mutual fund flagship, which fell 29.4 percent over the same time period. Firsthand declined to comment.
Many of the technology hedge funds of the Affiliated Managers Group, a Boston investment firm, have also wilted. Three of its Essex hedge funds fell at least 31 percent in the first four months of the year, according to Zurich Capital Markets.
As such funds flag, more conservative funds are becoming popular. Some, including Och-Ziff Capital Management of New York, profit through arbitrage, which exploits price differences of similar securities, like a stock and its options.
"We've been seeing a lot of money in the last six months to a year going into arbitrage strategies," said William Lawrence, chief executive of Meridian Capital Partners, an Albany firm that invests in hedge funds. Though arbitrage has its own pitfalls, such funds generally seek steady returns that neither soar in bull markets nor sink in bear markets.
"The market," Mr. Lawrence added, "has moved from one of greed to one of fear."

HEADLINE: The Paper Chase; 
Why Newspapers And Newsprint Makers Are at War

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
A gang of street toughs? That hardly seems an apt description of the pinstriped publishers of American newspapers or of the no-nonsense executives of newsprint manufacturers. But these two groups, whose profits come out of each other's hides, have been flashing economic switchblades at each other in an old-fashioned rumble unlike any seen the last decade.
 After decades of peaceful coexistence, the people who make paper and the people who use it to transmit news and advertising grew crotchety with each other in the 1990's. Newsprint prices became more volatile. Each swing left one side or the other feeling abused. 
 Still, it has been years since the relationship was as highly charged as it has been this year. The producers, their numbers reduced and their power increased, have tried to make publishers pay more for paper than at any time in the last five years -- $660 a ton. Publishers, reeling from double-digit declines in ad revenue and using about 9 percent less paper than they did a year ago, are angry and are determined to resist. 
The resolution of this bitter pricing tussle will be felt on the balance sheets of United States newspaper companies for months. More money for paper means less money for other things, like gathering news or paying dividends or both. And if, thanks to three years of widespread consolidation in the paper industry, the balance of power has decisively shifted to the producers, publishers' profit margins could be nicked for years to come.
"This is an intense street brawl," said Mark Wilde, a newsprint analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. "It's a huge game of chicken." 
Publishers who spoke off the record agreed; publishers who spoke on the record had a milder view, as did one top newsprint executive. "I don't sense any throwing down the gauntlet," said Arnold M. Nemirow, chief executive of Bowater, the No. 2 North American producer.
Both sides are fighting for their bottom lines. Newsprint represents about 20 percent of a newspaper's cost, so even a 4 percent increase in the cost of newsprint shaves profit margins at companies like Gannett, the Tribune Company, Knight Ridder and The New York Times.
But simply making a profit has been a struggle for newsprint manufacturers. During most of the 1990's -- with the noticeable exception of 1995 and 1996 -- many newsprint manufacturers' revenues failed to cover their cost of capital, energy and labor, according to several forest products analysts.
According to the industry newsletter Reel Time, "in early 1997 the top three producers controlled about 31 percent of North American capacity." After two current deals are final, the three top producers will control about 60 percent. The top three now are Abitibi-Consolidated, based in Montreal; Bowater, based in Greenville, S.C.; and Norske Skog of Canada, based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Of the 12 million metric tons bought by United States publishers last year, Abitibi produced 2.8 million tons, and Bowater slightly less. Four years ago, six companies controlled the capacity now handled by Abitibi, Mr. Wilde said.
The total North American market was 13.2 million metric tons last year, according to the Pulp and Paper Products Council of Canada.
Just as two decades of consolidation in the newspaper business, which gave leverage to companies like Gannett and Knight Ridder, unnerved the producers, the quick consolidation of suppliers has the publishers on edge. 
Other factors play into the tension. For instance, Abitibi's chief executive, John W. Weaver, is the survivor of a bitter boardroom coup attempt and has told investors that his company can make price increases stick.
Stephen Atkinson, a forest products analyst with the Canadian firm of Nesbitt Burns, said last week: "The publishers in the United States, like Gannett and Knight Ridder, are used to taking a baseball bat to the producers. Now they realize that the producers have a baseball bat, too. You have a showdown at high noon."
The first signs of the new edge in the relationship came last fall when the producers, flush from a spate of consolidations, announced a March 1 price increase, which was to be their fourth in 18 months. But by March, ads were disappearing and newspapers were consuming about 10 percent less paper than they did in 2000.
One side seemed to blink late last month: First Bowater, then Abitibi, announced $25 cuts in their proposed $50-a-ton price increases. Even so, publishers find it hard to pay more for a commodity when demand is dropping. They feel a price cut, not a smaller price increase, is in order.
Since the rollback, tensions have eased a little, while the sides continue to test each other's mettle.
Publishers are accumulating a war chest of one-ton, chest-high rolls of paper, the better to refuse to buy the higher-priced newsprint.
The producers, meanwhile, have had sudden urges to clean, repair, revamp and otherwise temporarily shut their mills for a week or three, idling hundreds of workers and reducing the total supply more than 100,000 metric tons. Call it supply-side economics.
In fact, the economics of the newsprint industry has sometimes raised legal eyebrows. In February 2000, the Justice Department began an investigation of possible collusion on newsprint prices; a spokeswoman said last week that the matter was still open but would not comment further. Some publishers recently hired a Nashville lawyer to look into the recent price increases, according to two publishers briefed on the situation. The lawyer, Alan Marx, had no comment. Newsprint executives consistently deny any collusion.
Speculation about the legacy of this confrontation has consumed both camps. One thing, however, is clear. In the sanitized age of the Internet, the sometimes smelly, energy-guzzling process of mashing and cooking wood chips and rolling and hauling huge rolls of paper takes the newspaper industry back to its 19th-century manufacturing roots.
Once, producers and publishers were more friendly. A lighthearted history published by Reel Time said that for half a century, until 1982, prices "just kept pace with costs." Then came the wave of newspaper consolidations. Newsprint orders from companies like Gannett, Knight Ridder and the Tribune Company grew so big that those companies had increasing leverage to cut deals and choose from among the many small mills. 
The producers, meanwhile, are always trying to recoup their heavy investment in machinery. As Mr. Wilde, the analyst, said, "Those costs don't change, whether you make a little paper or a lot of paper." Mills ran night and day to maximize profit.
Then prices dropped below the break-even point as supply outran demand. From 1992 to 1994, newsprint stayed below $500 a ton. Then it soared: up $100 from October 1994 to April 1995. Up $50 more that May. By October 1995, the cost was $740, nearly 50 percent higher than in the year before.
The price spike added to the profit pressure on newspapers. Times Mirror closed down New York Newsday in 1995. Nips and tucks were taken in other news budgets. Resentment and suspicion built among newspaper executives, who wondered how the price could go up so far so fast.
By 2000, publishers had cut the dimensions of their newspapers by an inch or more, saving tons of newsprint. Newsprint prices had been depressed for a couple of years. But power was swinging the producers' way. Abitibi merged with Stone-Consolidated in 1997, then, in a surprise, swallowed Donohue, the highly profitable No. 3 producer, last year.
The cultures did not mesh. The depressed price of Abitibi's stock led to a boardroom coup. Mr. Weaver prevailed and promised his supporters increasing profits and more efficient operations. Price increases, he said, would stick. Newsprint prices, at $510 when the year began, were $610 when it ended.
But neither Mr. Weaver nor Mr. Nemirow, the chief executive of Bowater, foresaw the ad decline.
As the New Year brought bad economic tidings, newspaper executives built up newsprint supplies. According to the Newspaper Association of America, United States newsprint consumption in the first two months of 2001 dropped 7.8 percent from the period in 2000 and close to 10 percent in March. Yet the publishers did not cut their orders. The one-ton rolls, once used to print the ads of dot-com ghosts, were stockpiled.
As the March 1 date of the price increase neared, some big publishers had close to a 50-day supply of newsprint. Russians, South Koreans and newsprint hedgers like Enron Industrial Markets were offering cheaper paper. One publisher after another told suppliers that they would not be taking delivery on some or all of their March orders, which were down more than 13 percent industrywide from the previous March.
After their customers lobbed those grenades into the producers' $660-a-ton plans, Abitibi and Bowater returned fire. Each announced that their mills would take downtime, cutting capacity at Abitibi by 50,000 metric tons and 60,000 at Bowater. Greg Davis, president of Local 5-899 of the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers in Calhoun, Tenn., said he took a week's enforced vacation, with hundreds of his members at Bowater's Calhoun plant.
Three weeks ago, Bowater, followed by Abitibi, rolled back $25 of the price increase. Less than a week later, at a Toronto publishers' meeting, sales representatives and buyers met to work out hedging agreements, giving buyers protection if prices rose quickly and offering sellers protection if they dropped.
A price drop is what some industry analysts now expect. Ross Hay-Roe of Equity Research Associates last week predicted a $100 drop in newsprint prices and a 13 percent year-over-year decline in United States demand for the rest of 2001.
Mr. Weaver could not be reached for comment. Mr. Nemirow, his counterpart at Bowater, said last week that he thought the $25 increase would hold and that the industries' relations were smooth, The $25 increase, he said, was generally accepted. "We certainly discussed it with our marketplace," he said. "Our sense is that they expect what we've done."
It is hard to find a publisher who agrees. Jay Smith, the president of Cox Newspapers, said he did not know if the price would hold. "Anyone who is living by the ad dollar is feeling the ad recession," he said.
Robert M. Jelenic, chief executive of Journal Register, which publishes 22 daily papers including The New Haven Register, said no increase would stick. "I can't see how it can," he said.

HEADLINE: It's Not the Economy, Stupid, in Japan 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 12 

 BODY:
When Jun ichiro Koizumi became prime minister, much of Japan braced itself for the kind of sweeping economic change hinted at by a politician whose motto has been "structural reform with no sacred cows."
 But in his first weeks in office, Mr. Koizumi has focused his zeal for reform not on the debt and overregulation that have dulled Japan's economic performance for years, but on the country's long-sacrosanct Constitution. 
 Hardly a day goes by when Mr. Koizumi does not invoke the need to revise the document, which was written by the United States in 1946 during its postwar occupation of Japan. And the two areas he has singled out for change go to the heart of Japan's modern identity as a parliamentary democracy and country that forswears war forever. 
His top priority is the creation of a more presidential system with direct elections of the prime minister. Some say it is little wonder he has chosen that popular goal, since he enjoys an 80 percent personal approval rating but belongs to a political party that shares little of his enthusiasm for painful economic transformation.
It is far less clear why he has selected his other constitutional aim, of letting Japan legally field an army. Popular opposition to the idea is vast -- nearly as great as his own popular support.
In a similar break with custom that hints at a revival of nationalism, Mr. Koizumi has said he will visit a monument to Japan's war dead on the country's memorial day, Aug. 15. 
The Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo honors several so-called Class A war criminals who were convicted and executed after Japan's defeat in World War II, and for that reason sitting prime ministers have seldom visited the shrine.
According to a recent nationwide opinion poll by the newspaper Asahi Shimbun, 74 percent of the respondents said they wanted Japan to retain the famous Article 9 of its Constitution, which says the country will "forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation."
"I believe that Article 9 should not be revised," said Tomoko Oshita, a Tokyo civil servant, in a typical comment. "We must avoid war at any cost, and I cannot see any reason for revising it. It feels as if Japan is heading again toward the right."
Mr. Koizumi has himself acknowledged that changing Article 9 is impossible in the short term. And his party's main coalition partner, the Buddhist-affiliated New Komeito, expresses formidable opposition the the idea. Consequently, many political analysts are asking why the prime minister would choose to waste political capital on such a thorny issue.
The most skeptical interpretations say Mr. Koizumi is talking about the Constitution because spelling out painful economic changes would probably damage his popularity before parliamentary elections in July, which could determine his survival as prime minister. 
A constitutional debate is a cost-free way of keeping alive his reformist image.
"What kind of energy will be devoted to economic matters, versus these kinds of constitutional matters?" asked Takeshi Sasaki, a political scientist and president of Tokyo University. "This is a big choice for the prime minister. The constitutional matters could be taken up as a way of postponing the economic matters, which require unpopular measures."
Others say the explanation may lie in the complicated calculations of Japan's coalition-based politics. Support for Mr. Koizumi may be strong with the public for now, but enthusiasm for his economic agenda is said to be extremely weak within his governing Liberal Democratic Party.
Seen in this light, the frequent mention of a desire to revise Article 9, like the pledge to visit the shrine, is a tranquilizing sop to the party's conservative mainstream.
The political risk is that even if turning Japan's so-called Self-Defense Force into a formal army is not in the cards anytime soon, the mere proposal raises immediate problems with Mr. Koizumi's pacifist coalition partner, the New Komeito, without whose support the Liberal Democrats would be unable to govern.
Mr. Koizumi's far more popular suggestion that Japan introduce a system of direct election of the prime minister could provide a solution.
Most constitutional experts oppose the idea of direct election of the prime minister, saying it would be inherently incompatible with the parliamentary system. 
"There has been no bold or imaginative leadership," said Shinji Kitaoka, a political scientist at Tokyo University," adding that the lack "is obviously inappropriate at a time of global competition."
"This is not the solution," he said, "but the Japanese want change because they are left with the impression that they have very mediocre leaders."
Perhaps more important from Mr. Koizumi's perspective, Japan's largest opposition group, the Democratic Party, enthusiastically supports the direct election idea and, moreover, is far more supportive of the prime minister's economic reforms than his own Liberal Democratic Party.
According to this interpretation, Japan may be moving toward a wholesale realignment of its political parties under Mr. Koizumi, one that could see not only the reconfiguration of alliances, but also the birth of whole new parties.
In an interview this week, Mr. Koizumi's most influential economic adviser, Heizo Takenaka, hinted as much, saying that "another round of political reform could be required" before economic reform could begin in earnest.

HEADLINE: A BROAD ALLIANCE TRIES TO HEAD OFF CUTS IN MEDICARE 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13 

 BODY:
Elected officials, hospital administrators, doctors and union leaders across the country are seeking to reverse a new Medicare policy that they say will slash billions of dollars from the health care industry and force cutbacks in critical hospital services.
 Nationwide, hospitals will lose roughly $1.6 billion annually once the new Medicare cuts are in place, by October 2002, according to industry officials. The bulk of the cuts will directly affect the nation's teaching hospitals, many of them in New York and other cities, including Boston, Philadelphia, Houston, Atlanta, Pittsburgh and Baltimore. They are likely to result in more crowded clinics and emergency rooms as well as higher charges to private insurers and to patients themselves. 
 Members of Congress and industry officials say the cuts could be averted if Congress and the Bush administration eliminate two cost-cutting measures enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to reduce the size of Medicare, the health care program for the elderly. But that could face stiff resistance, since Congressional leaders may be reluctant to undermine savings expected from those provisions of the act. 
The lobbying effort has taken on a heightened sense of urgency as many interest groups scramble to claim a portion of the federal budget surplus. "We recognize that some of the budget surplus will go for tax cuts and education and defense," said Dan Sisto, president of the Healthcare Association of New York State. "But health care must be an equivalent national priority now that the surplus is being divided up."
The 1997 Balanced Budget Act called for reducing projected spending on Medicare by $115 billion by 2003. But hospital and elected officials point out that in reality, the rate reductions have already totaled more than $200 billion.
As a result, they say, the federal government should provide hospitals with relief from upcoming cuts at a time when the profit margins of many hospitals are slim and their budgets still highly dependent on Medicare payments. Such payments, on average, make up about one-third of the money that hospitals in New York State take in each year, according to the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade group.
Kenneth E. Raske, the association's president, noted that in New York alone, hospitals have already shouldered $2.2 billion in Medicare cuts under the act. Several hospital administrators in New York City warned that the new cuts -- roughly $200 million a year beginning next year -- will cause severe cutbacks in services to patients and will make it extremely difficult to meet the demands that union leaders are expected to make in contract negotiations that begin later this month.
"We are on a collision course," Mr. Raske said. "It's like two freight trains coming at each other."
New York's hospitals are not completely without blame, however. Managed care companies and government officials have long complained that the state's hospital industry is still very inefficient and that hospital executives are too quick to rely on the federal and state governments to bail them out.
The Brooklyn Hospital Center will be among those hard hit by the new round of Medicare cuts, losing more than $2.2 million from its annual budget, which is $290 million this year. Most of the losses are likely to be felt by the primary care clinics that the hospital runs throughout Brooklyn and that register some 20,000 visits a year, said the hospital's president, Frederick D. Alley. "You know where these people will end up," Mr. Alley said. "They will end up in my emergency room, where I'm already crowded and backed up."
Peter A. Kelly, the chief executive of the company that runs Beth Israel Medical Center, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center and the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary in Manhattan, as well as Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn, said further Medicare funding losses could mean staff reductions across the board, from primary care programs to inpatient critical care units. "We've all gone as far as we can in terms of reductions that will not impact critical care," Mr. Kelly said. 'Now we are at the point where we'll have to take a hard look at the services we provide."
At Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, the president, Dr. Spencer Foreman, said the new Medicare cuts would total $10 million a year and force the hospital to lay off 200 to 225 people in departments ranging from the emergency room to the intensive care unit.
"We have always, to the extent possible, tried to stay away from the clinical areas," Dr. Foreman said, referring to cutbacks. "There's just no way to do that now."
Dennis Rivera, leader of 1199, the union representing tens of thousands of New York hospital workers, made it clear he would seek wage increases in the upcoming negotiations, even as he acknowledged that the new federal cuts will make an already difficult situation worse.
He said he would do his part to see to it that the new Medicare cuts are eliminated. "It is important that the health care delivery system not be maintained on the backs of thousands of low-paid health care workers," Mr. Rivera said.
One of the two cuts applies to additional payments that teaching hospitals have long received to compensate them for the specialized, high-cost care they provide, like cancer therapies, burn treatment and cardiac care. When that cut is completely phased in by the end of next year, teaching hospitals across the country will lose nearly $735 million annually, including $130 million to New York's teaching hospitals, according to the Greater New York Hospital Association. 
The other cost-cutting measure imposes a cap on a payment that hospitals have long received to help them keep up with inflation. The new policy requires the Health Care Financing Administration to determine the rate of inflation for hospitals and subtract half a percentage point to arrive at the inflation reimbursement rate.
Nationwide, the change in the reimbursement formula, which takes effect Oct. 1, will cost hospitals $420 million this year and roughly $850 million in 2002, the Greater New York Hospital Association projected. By 2005, the cut will total $933 million annually. New York hospitals stand to lose $36 million annually starting later this year, growing to nearly $80 million annually by next year.
The spectre of the cuts has brought together a cast of strange political bedfellows in Washington. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson, a Republican from Texas, introduced a bill that would reverse the new cuts and that was quickly endorsed by several Democratic senators, including Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, as well as several Republican senators, including Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, Jesse A. Helms of North Carolina and Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas.
In releasing her bill, Ms. Hutchinson voiced particular concern over the effect the new cuts would have on teaching hospitals. "These teaching institutions are not only educating and training the next generation of physicians and other health care professionals, but in many communities, they are the primary providers of medical services to the poor and indigent," she said. "Our society cannot afford to shortchange them."
It is not clear, though, what the bill's fate will be in either the Senate or the House, largely because Congressional leaders are preoccupied with other matters, including reaching a compromise between the tax cut measures passed in each house. 
The uncertainty has prompted a strong bipartisan effort by New York's Congressional delegation to stave off further Medicare reductions. Mrs. Clinton said that reversing the cuts is one of her biggest priorities but warned that little money might be left for that because of the size of the final tax cut. "The hospitals are in trouble," she said. "We're going to have to come up with some money."
Representative Thomas M. Reynolds, a Republican from western New York, said that Democrats and Republicans share an interest that transcends party affiliation when it comes to stopping further Medicare cuts. We're going to fight to get it done," he said.

HEADLINE: Far From Dead, Subsidies Fuel Big Farms 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: DALHART, Tex. 

 BODY:
By any measure, Lanny Bezner is a successful family farmer. His eldest son, John, rides herd over his cattle, spread out on pastureland from here to nearby New Mexico. A younger son, Brian, looks after the farm's heavily irrigated cornfields, with help from the husband of Mr. Bezner's daughter, Virginia. As a Texas patriarch, Mr. Bezner rigorously sticks to the principle that economy of scale is the only way to survive in modern farming. The bigger the farm, the better likelihood of turning a profit, he says. 
 By buying adjacent fields, he has expanded his cropland from its original 700 acres to more than 8,000. In five years he has doubled his grazing land by leasing 90,000 acres of pasture. He owns a fleet of tractors and heavy farm equipment; he fills their tanks with fuel from his own gas pumps. He dries and stores his harvest in his own imposing grain elevators, which hold more than a million bushels of corn. 
 Surveying the farm that he carved out in the Panhandle landscape of dry mesquite and sagebrush, Mr. Bezner says the key to his family's prosperity is federal farm subsidies. 
"We're successful primarily because of government help," said Mr. Bezner, 59, an entomologist who grew up on a farm outside Amarillo.
Although Mr. Bezner hesitated to discuss the size of those subsidies (and refused to divulge how much he makes without federal help, or what his expenses are), government documents show that in the last four years of the 1990's, he received $1.38 million in direct federal payments.
Most remarkably, Mr. Bezner and the other big farmers here in Hartley County and across the country received those record-breaking payments in an era when farm subsidies were slated for extinction.
Under the Freedom to Farm Act of 1996, swept up in the language of the Republican revolution under Speaker Newt Gingrich, farmers who planted row crops -- corn, wheat, soybeans, rice or cotton -- were freed from government production controls. In exchange for being able to plant what they wanted, they were told, they would have their subsidies gradually phased out. 
While farmers embraced their new freedom to decide what to plant, they balked at accepting the rigors of the free market. When prices for their crops held stagnant and their costs rose, farmers lobbied Congress for "emergency" payments.
Their friends in Congress relented. Instead of diminishing, the subsidies have nearly tripled with steep emergency payments that reached $22 billion last year, according to Keith Collins, the top economist at the Agriculture Department. 
Supporters of farm subsidies, which were enacted in the Depression, argue that they are needed to save the family farm. But government documents indicate that the prime beneficiaries hardly fit the image of small, hardscrabble farmers. Because eligibility is based on acreage planted with subsidized crops in the past, the farmers who have the biggest spreads benefit the most, according to the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit advocacy organization that obtained government records of farm subsidies through the Freedom of Information Act.
"The data shows that government subsidies are tilting the playing field in favor of the largest farms," said Clark Williams-Derry, the senior analyst at the Environmental Working Group who created a national database of subsidies.
Mr. Bezner, who saw his direct federal payments balloon from $164,621 in 1996 to $741,839 in 1999, is one of the elite 10 percent of American farmers who receive 61 percent of the billions of dollars the program distributes. The subsidies have been a chief source of capital for large operators to expand their holdings, often by buying out their smaller neighbors.
And unlike other federal entitlement programs, farm subsidies have no requirements of income, assets or debts.

Friends in High Places
 As Congress considers reauthorizing the Freedom to Farm Act, lawmakers have already made one fundamental decision: they will keep the subsidies. The phaseouts are a thing of the past.
The cost, and the fact that the money goes mostly to a select few, will be at the crux of the debate over how to reshape subsidies.
"The cost of this program is astonishing," Mr. Collins said. "Any person engaged in small business in America would be amazed looking at this. Their jaws would drop at the money farmers receive."
Mr. Bezner makes no apologies for accepting the money. To his mind, government subsidies help the American consumer by making sure grocery stores are stocked with inexpensive food.
"That government money is keeping cheap cereal on the shelves in New York City," he said.
And no one expects farmers to lose their subsidies -- not with the friends they have in Congress.
The top leaders of both parties represent farm states that rely on subsidies. In the Senate, the majority leader is from Mississippi and the minority leader from South Dakota. In the House, the speaker is from Illinois and the minority leader from Missouri. The relevant committees are headed by representatives from farm states; the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee is Representative Larry Combest, a Republican who represents Mr. Bezner's district in the northern plains of Texas.
"Look at the Nasdaq: those companies are going out of business and we don't open up the Treasury to them," Mr. Collins said. "But Congress chose not to let farmers bear that kind of pain."
Like their counterparts in Hartley County, large farmers around the country have complained to Congress that Freedom to Farm is not working because their crops are selling at the same low prices their grandfathers' crops fetched 40 years ago. 
When lawmakers passed the act in 1996, they approved generous subsidies for the first two years in order to give farmers a cushion to prepare for their independence. But when the world market pushed prices down, farmers asked for emergency payments. 
In 1998, Congress approved additional money, adding 50 percent to the core subsidy payments. In 1999 and 2000, the lawmakers doubled the core payments. This month, with the strong backing of the White House, Congress added $5.5 billion to next year's budget blueprint to cover potential emergencies. 
The concentration of payments will remain the same: the wheat-growing plains states from the Texas Panhandle through North Dakota; the Corn Belt across the Midwest; and the rice and cotton states of the Mississippi Valley from Missouri through Louisiana. 
While there are other subsidy programs, like those for dairy farmers and sugar producers, the row-crop payments are by far the biggest. Ranchers, and farmers who produce fruits and vegetables, receive virtually nothing from this program.
Representative Combest said he had concluded that the subsidy system should remain intact. His one minor proposal is to cut subsidies when farmers receive higher prices for their crops -- what he calls a "countercyclical" approach.

Who Benefits?
 Even though President Bush has promised to eliminate what he calls corporate welfare, Mr. Combest and some Republican leaders see no contradiction between the farm payments and Republican free-market orthodoxy. They contend that the subsidy is meant to help the consumer, not the farmer.
"The consuming public has been the beneficiary of this program that gives money to farmers to produce low-price commodities," Mr. Combest said in an interview. "We don't want to become as dependent on foreign food as foreign oil."
Those emotional appeals fall flat with his counterpart, Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Republican from Indiana who is chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. 
"Let's not make a mistake that these subsidies are pro-consumer; they are pro-producer," Senator Lugar said in an interview. "There would be extraordinarily adequate supplies of food in America if you had no control and no subsidies."
Senator Lugar said he wanted a revised farm policy to provide more money to conserve land, improve rural communities and help farmers who are not doing well. 
He also said he was under no illusion about the effect of the multibillion-dollar payments.
"The rhetoric of failing farms doesn't always match the reality, because large commercial farmers are doing well with their subsidies; their land values have gone up and so have land rents," Mr. Lugar said.
Eight percent of the country's farms produce 72 percent of the country's harvest. Most of the rest of the two million American farmers earn their incomes from jobs off the land.
Instead, Senator Lugar said, these crop subsidies are a direct transfer of taxpayers' money to rural landowners. "Is the American public willing to spend money each year and every year providing a transfer payment from the taxpayers to the agricultural sector?" he asked. "And how much -- 5 billion, 10 billion, 15 billion?"
What no lawmaker is expected to do is ask farmers to prove they need the subsidies. 
"This is not meant to be a welfare program, and it won't be -- not if I have anything to do with it," Representative Combest said.
Agriculture economists say such an argument misses the point.
"In our food stamp program we means-test the working poor with strict requirements, but we ask nothing of farmers," said Mr. Collins, the Agriculture Department economist, who called the subsidies "an income supplement from the government."

Where the Money Goes
 Even in Mr. Combest's Congressional district, where federal subsidies make up more than one-third of the total farm income, Hartley County holds a special place. The top 10 percent of the county's subsidy recipients were paid an average $396,131 from 1996 to 1999 -- more than double the national average. 
And in the pecking order, Lanny Bezner ranks third. Two other Hartley County farmers received more money: John Cover, whose subsidies totaled $2.3 million over that period, and Carl Kupyer, who received $1.9 million. 
With subsidies of that size, those families rank among the top 10 recipients in Texas and the top 100 in the country. 
Yet the Kupyer family considers the subsidies barely large enough to keep it in business, according to J. C. Kupyer, who works with his father, Carl.
"We do make a living as farmers," J. C. Kupyer said. "But actually it would be hard to farm without subsidies."
For three generations the Kupyers have been adding to their property, building their farm from less than 700 acres to a 16,000-acre spread that they now own free and clear. Yet with spiraling energy costs, Mr. Kupyer said, the family would sell the farm if someone offered to buy it.
Mr. Cover refused to discuss his subsidies.
Andy Michael, the Hartley County commissioner and a rancher, said he discounted many complaints from big farmers like Mr. Kupyer. In his view, farmers complain to cover up how much money they are receiving from the government.
"The farmers are very closemouthed about getting help from the government -- they never, never talk about it," Mr. Michael said. "Farmers work the system. There's no system for us to work."
In the last five years, he said, the classic divide between farmers and ranchers, exploited in generations of cowboy movies, has gotten worse, because farmers are receiving bigger subsidy checks while ranchers get nothing. 
"Any time I'm around farmers they say farming doesn't pay, but then they go out and buy those $150,000 tractors with their government checks," Mr. Michael said. "When times are tough for us, the rancher just tightens his belt."
Business is good for Mr. Michael and many other farmers and ranchers in Dalhart, a town of more than 7,000 people midway between Dallas and Denver. Local farm equipment dealers report that despite the downturn in crop prices, their sales of tractors and other equipment are among the best in the country.
At the John Deere dealership, farmers have spent $13 million to $21 million on agricultural equipment every year since Freedom to Farm was enacted. "This is one of Deere's strongest markets," said Mark Miller, finance manager at the Dalhart dealership. 
Ralph Link is a Hartley County farmer who cannot afford new tractors. He works his 845-acre spread himself with used equipment and received $173,787 in subsidies the first four years of Freedom to Farm. 
But unlike his neighbors with larger farms, Mr. Link has nothing but praise for the prosperity that comes with federal checks. With his new freedom, Mr. Link has been able to take advantage of the region's shift toward agribusiness and plant all his cropland in corn, selling it to one of the huge cattle feedlots. 
In bad times, he says, the checks provide a safety net. In good times, like the current season, the subsidies will provide him with a good profit -- this season, he says, it will be 18 percent.
"The government payments are bigger since Freedom to Farm, so I don't understand why you wouldn't like it," Mr. Link said. "Things couldn't be better."

HEADLINE: Blackout Plans of Little Help In California's Energy Crisis 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: IRVINE, Calif., May 13 

 BODY:
This spotless city of 148,000 people an hour's drive south of Los Angeles is the largest planned community in the country, with a web of freeways feeding autos into neat patterns of eight-lane boulevards that, on normal days, are almost a balletic composition in traffic management.
 But last week the picture was a little different. Irvine's broad avenues had been transformed into a knot of eight-lane parking lots by a rolling power blackout, just the first of what experts predict will be dozens this summer because of California's power shortages. The hundreds of computer-operated traffic lights here were blank witnesses to the morass, as were the city's police officers, who arrived at some major intersections only to watch helplessly until the electricity was switched back on an hour later. 
 Charles Brobeck, the chief of police, explained the one-sided arithmetic he was up against. Irvine has 279 signal intersections and only 160 officers on the police force, with only a portion of them on duty at one time. As a result, he said, "we're too badly outnumbered to do much," in spite of hundreds of hours spent planning for the blackouts.
"When we get notice that these things are coming it's like being told that in 10 minutes there's an asteroid that's going to hit us," Chief Brobeck said. "We know it's five million miles from earth, and it's going to hit, but we're not quite sure when or exactly where."
Last week gave just a hint of the improvisational tap dances local governments are going to have to do all summer to cope with the rolling blackouts. Municipalities across the state, the principal lines of defense against chaos, have spent the last several months meticulously planning what they can plan. That has meant crash energy conservation programs and steps to ensure that critical services like the police and fire departments and computer centers remain in operation at all times.
But local officials said there was precious little their governments could do beyond that during the predictably unpredictable but brief blackouts, usually an hour long. 
Southern California's experience with earthquakes and wildfires has helped instill a sense of preparedness, but only to a degree. Because the patchworklike blackouts are short-lived and require pinpoint actions rather than wide-scale mobilization, officials said, they are fundamentally more challenging.
The incidents last week offered two perfect examples, said Ronald Mohr, an energy analyst with the Los Angeles County government.
On Tuesday, he had just minutes' notice that blocks of the county's power system were about to be blacked out by the local utility, Southern California Edison, except he was not sure which blocks, or for precisely how long, or exactly when it would happen. 
He had seconds to notify the most important of the county government's 87,000 employees, but without using telephones, because that would take too long, as he had discovered on previous blackouts, and without sending too many e-mail messages at once, because that would cause the system to crash.
And then there was Wednesday. Again, Mr. Mohr received notice of imminent blackouts from Southern California Edison, bringing another round of frantic measures, except this time it turned out to be a false alarm.
"My entire life has been turned upside down," Mr. Mohr said. He explained that taking part in energy policy had been such a ponderously slow process in the past that it could take him four days to prepare a short letter.
"We've been working 14-, 16-hour days." he said. "My boss just missed his anniversary. The main thing is that before, with emergency procedures, you knew the rules. Everything was stable. You took a manual off a shelf. There is no manual for a one-hour blackout."
Traffic may be the worst problem in the blackouts. For instance, in Ventura, just north of here, the streets immediately came close to gridlock on Tuesday, and officials could only counsel patience.
"We just leave the intersections dark," said Ronald Calkins, director of the city's Department of Public Works. "The motorists just have to know that they are supposed to treat it as a four-way stop. We thought about using portable stop signs, but it takes too long. By the time you get the stuff out the lights are back on."
In Irvine, there were three fender benders during Tuesday's blackout; in Santa Monica, one car was rammed so hard at an intersection that it flipped over.
Eileen Salmon, Irvine's emergency coordinator, said the best that could be done, once care is taken to make sure essential services keep running, was to communicate, but even doing that can be problematic. Ms. Salmon said that last Tuesday she received several false alarms before the blackouts, making her responses something of a guessing game.
She said most city operations were just told to wait out the blackouts. Schools, she said, do nothing special; and city employees just take a break for the most part.
Allison Hart, the Irvine city manager, said the lack of specific advance information from Southern California Edison was another problem.
The utilities have said that they do not identify which areas will lose power in advance because of concerns that criminals might take advantage of the situation by looting or breaking into buildings.
"If you think the possibility of looting or something is worse than the devastating economic uncertainty of being hit by unpredictable rolling blackouts in the sixth-largest economy in the world, I just think you're wrong," Ms. Hart said, adding that business groups have said they would prefer more notice as well.
The municipalities usually have backup diesel generators at critical sites, but even using those can pose difficulties. Many city officials said that as they get warnings that power is running short, they are inclined to fire up their generators early so that important facilities will never lose electricity.
But state air quality rules restrict how long the cities can operate the generators, usually to 200 hours a year. If the generators are left running an hour or two every time there is a warning, as happened on Wednesday, the officials fear they will waste precious operating time.
Mr. Mohr said that perhaps the greatest trial would be keeping municipal employees alert in a summer when emergency warnings would be the norm. Already, he said, officials are struggling against complacency.
"Please don't let a lazy or indifferent attitude develop due to the false predictions," Mr. Mohr pleaded in a mass e-mail message sent after Wednesday's near miss.
Then he added, "This will be the last message tonight, unless conditions deteriorate."

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about California cities' planning for brief blackouts misstated the location of Ventura. It is about 100 miles northwest of Irvine, not "just north."

HEADLINE: Visions of Olympic Glory; 
Bid for 2012 Games Raises Grandiose Images and Critics' Eyebrows

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
The Olympics aren't only about harmony among nations, transcendent sportsmanship, urban image-building and all that happy-face multinational blah blah blah. In New York City, the really cool idea is to leave a legacy. 
 In revivalist presentations to community planning boards, political leaders and corporate funders, the missionaries of NYC 2012 -- the committee guiding New York's bid to be host to the Summer Games -- are preaching renewal for a city wise enough to use the manna of Olympic bucks to permanently transform the Big Apple. 
 They present the Olympics as the Subway Series, Op Sail, New York City Marathon, Millennium Eve and United States Open rolled into one. They conjure up a self-supporting Olympics as a sort of Works Progress Administration that would revitalize the Brooklyn and Queens waterfront and restore the East River as a major transportation artery. 
They say the Games would mean the construction of beautifully equipped facilities encouraging recreation in the five boroughs; the rebuilding of long-deteriorated athletic fields, gyms and parks; and the initiation of neighborhood revivals that would in turn spur economic development. 
A $1 billion Olympic donation to the city's infrastructure and economy would leave a legacy, they say, long outlasting the rosy glow of an event that after it ends on Aug. 12, 2012, may be remembered as the largest Games in history. 
Some of the grandiose visions are revealed in the before-and-after images of planned Olympic venues that accompany this article. Such brainstorms are but a small part of the city's 700-page formal bid to hold the 2012 Games, which will be submitted to the United States Olympic Committee on June 1. 
"Yes, the Olympics would be a magnificent celebration of the essence of New York, but the Olympic deadline would also give us the opportunity to get things done that we might not otherwise have the political will to accomplish," said Daniel L. Doctoroff, president of NYC 2012, the group backed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and, intermittently, by Gov. George E. Pataki when the project seems linked to the expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. 
Mr. Doctoroff and his staff conjure a seductive vision of "17 days of Olympic glory." On July 27, 2012, the opening ceremonies are to be preceded by the arrival of the largest flotilla of tall ships ever, culminating in laser shows and the greatest fireworks display in the nation's history. This would mark the kickoff of a parallel Cultural Olympiad intended to fill the city's arts venues. The next dawn would reveal a city alive with banners, fireboats spraying multicolored plumes of water, taxis showing Olympic colors and subway trains shrink-wrapped with Olympic images. 
Athletes from more than 200 countries would be deliriously embraced by their nations' own ethnic communities in a city in which 40 percent of the population is foreign born, where more than 140 languages are spoken and where students from no fewer than 186 of the 199 nations represented in the 2000 Games now attend New York's schools. 
All that said, this kind of unbridled boosterism is a fat target for skepticism. "I'm not necessarily against the Olympics," said Claire Shulman, the Queens borough president, "but New York City needs the Olympics like a hole in the head." She laughed. "Maybe the Olympics needs us more than we need them." 
Putting aside any lingering odor from Olympic committee scandal, the Games pose a giant iffiness factor. The United States Olympic Committee won't even select its candidate until 2002 from a field that also includes Cincinnati, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Tampa and Washington/Baltimore. 
All those bids could go toes-up on July 13, when the International Olympic Committee picks the site of the 2008 Summer Games. A designation for Beijing (the bookies' front-runner) or Paris (the runner-up) gives New York a chance, but the selection of Toronto would preclude the return of the Olympics to North America in 2012, experts say. 
If Toronto is not selected, the 2012 plan is likely to reverberate at meetings of community boards and neighborhood groups for a very long time. Already, the two most important planned projects -- the new stadium and the Olympic village -- have provoked opposition. 
The new bid favors what it calls the Hudson Yards development, an 86,000-seat retractable-domed stadium to be built south of the Javits Convention Center, along with an Olympic Square Park-cum-hotel-and-office mall. NYC 2012 insists that flexible seating in the stadium could be converted into a 75,000-seat palace for the New York Jets, or into additional Javits Center exhibition space. (Critics raise eyebrows and mutter the words Rube Goldberg.) The plan also calls for the extension of the Javits Center north to 41st Street. Spectators would travel there on a new No. 7 subway line spur from 42nd Street to the stadium.
But since many facilities will be built by, or ultimately turned over to, private interests, critics see aspects of the 2012 bid as a profit-churning ploy by private real estate developers. And some residents and community leaders in South Hell's Kitchen oppose the pollution and gridlock that Jets games -- or other mass events -- could engender, and say the Olympic committee never consulted them in making its plans. Mr. Doctoroff has denied the accusation, saying, "We have changed our plans to reflect" community input.
Just to obscure the Olympic vision further, the mayoral term of Mr. Giuliani expires at the end of this year. Future support for the 2012 bid is, therefore, a roll of the dice. A survey of four Democratic mayoral candidates shows that all support the notion of bringing the Olympics to New York -- though some have caveats -- but they differ on many details. (For example, Public Advocate Mark Green and the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, favor an Olympic stadium in Queens.)
Critics also worry about Olympic gridlock, but the 2012 proselytizers contend that congestion will be eased by the "Olympic X," two intersecting transportation axes for athletes along an east-west rail corridor that serves sites from the New Jersey Meadowlands to Long Island. High-speed Olympic ferries would also ply the Harlem and East Rivers to Staten Island, linking competition sites. 
NYC 2012 has raised $7.25 million for the organizing effort thus far, and claims that the Games themselves would be privately financed. It estimates that in 2012 dollars, they would cost $2.2 billion to run, with an additional $1.2 billion to build or refurbish sports facilities. NYC 2012 said the costs would be covered by revenue from ticket sales, sponsorships, licensing agreements and world television and cable rights. 
Mr. Doctoroff said that more than $1 billion in transportation construction costs could be offset by the increase in the city's tax revenue from the land developed on the West Side. Privately, state and city officials worry that they will be stuck with a portion of the cost of the Games and the transportation. They raise the spectral nightmare of the 1976 Montreal Games, the debacle that produced a $1 billion deficit. 
But history shows that a tightly run Olympics need not be glued to the public trough. In 1984, the first privately financed Games produced a surplus of $232.5 million in Los Angeles. The city inherited a swimming stadium and velodrome, and scored face lifts for the Rose Bowl, Forum and Anaheim Convention Center. 
And although they were chided for rampant commercialism, the only other privately financed Olympics, the $1.7 billion 1996 Atlanta Games, are being trumpeted as a model for New York's 2012 dreams. Their organizers say they produced a surplus of several million dollars, though Atlanta's still-active Olympic naysayers charge that taxpayers are absorbing hidden costs.
But unlike Atlanta, New York has nothing to prove. "We don't need an Olympics to feel good about ourselves, because we are already a world-class city," said Alexander Garvin, a city planning commissioner who is also a Yale professor and planning director for NYC 2012.
"The bar is higher for us," he said. "We want to create the best Olympics ever. And we want to do things in New York that people have been dreaming about for a long time."

Farms Are Getting Bigger And So Are Their Subsidies
Big farms, the ones that farmers say are most likely to be profitable, have been receiving record-breaking payments from the federal government in an era when farm subsidies were slated for extinction. But instead of being phased out by Congress, the subsidies have soared, with steep emergency payments that reached $22 billion last year, an Agriculture Department economist said. A1

Rolling With the Blackouts
Municipal officials in California say they have done what they can to ensure that essential services keep running in rolling blackouts, but some problems, like gridlock, are beyond their control. "When we get notice that these things are coming it's like being told that in 10 minutes there's an asteroid that's going to hit us," a police chief said. A1

Reins on the Economy
The decisions corporate executives make are turning out to have more power to affect the economy than the Federal Reserve chairman's control over interest rates. And for now, the executives are pulling back. "We may well escape with no recession," an economist said, "but we are likely to have a long period -- a year or more -- of weak economic growth and rising unemployment." A1

HEADLINE: Intel Hones Larger Wafer for a Cheaper Chip 

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: HILLSBORO, Ore., May 11 

 BODY:
In a few weeks, a 26,000-pound machine will begin shooting ions into silicon wafers like lightning bolts, one process in hundreds that silicon must undergo during its transformation into a computer chip.
 The immense machine, called an implanter, will be a small piece of the Intel Corporation's newest semiconductor factory here, scheduled to begin mass production early next year. But today, a dozen technicians, shrouded in white protective suits from head to foot, swarmed around and inside the machine, painstakingly piecing it together. 
 "This is how you spend $7.5 billion in capital," Gerald Marcyk, Intel's director of component research, said after a rare tour of the new factory, 14 miles west of Portland. That is how much Intel estimates it will spend this year on capital expenses, in addition to $4.2 billion in research and development. 
Similar scenes of ambitious construction will be played out in semiconductor plants throughout the world in the new few years, as chip makers prepare for the first radical change in production techniques since the mid-1990's.
The change in processing technology involves increasing the size of the round silicon wafers from which chips are culled. Instead of the current standard diameter of 200 millimeters (about 8 inches, the size of a salad plate), chip makers are moving toward wafers of 300 millimeters (roughly 12 inches). The larger wafers can yield more than twice as many chips, achieving an economy of scale that Intel says will save 30 percent in manufacturing costs for each wafer.
Engineers have worked to enlarge wafers since the 1960's, when chips were cut from pieces of silicon the size of quarters. As the wafer size increases, so does the difficulty of getting perfect chips from that wafer every time, and so does the ability of equipment makers to design tools to handle the wafers. As a result, tool makers can charge tremendous amounts for customized machines.
With the entry of Intel, the world's largest chip maker, into the 300-millimeter market, the changeover to the new process is sure to accelerate. I.B.M. led the industry by developing the 200-millimeter wafers in 1994, much as Intel led the 150-millimeter transition a decade before. Each company learned its lesson, choosing to let others take the development lead that time and remain close behind. I.B.M. is building a $2.5 billion 300-millimeter plant in East Fishkill, N.Y., that is expected to be in full production by 2003, a year after Intel's.
"The company that drives the move to a new wafer size ends up paying the bill for much of the tooling development; then the rest of the industry benefits from it," an I.B.M. spokesman, William O'Leary, said.
This time, Intel and I.B.M. left the trailblazing role to Semiconductor300, a joint venture between Motorola and Infineon Technologies,the semiconductor unit of Siemens. In 1999, the venture. financed by the German government, became the first to produce working memory chips from 300-millimeter wafers and sold them in small numbers.
Dr. Ulrich Schumacher, Infineon's president and chief executive, said he welcomed Intel's entrance into 300-millimeter wafer production because it could be expected to force more equipment makers to build appropriate tools, driving prices down. "This is a very important push for equipment suppliers," he said, "because now it is not only just Infineon and Motorola, but also the mighty Intel."
Today, more than two dozen 300-millimeter plants are under construction around the world. In the first three months of this year, chip makers undertook 300-millimeter development projects worth $35 billion in construction and equipment, according to Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International, a trade group for tool makers.
But only Semiconductor300, the joint venture, and TaiwanSemiconductor have put 300-millimeter-produced chips on the market. With demand slumping in many segments of the industry, chip makers are gambling that sales will improve by the time the plants are ready. A factory can cost billions of dollars to maintain, even when running below full capacity.
Intel has warned that its famously high profit margins will suffer in coming months, as demand for its semiconductors remains weak. But Intel executives remain bullish on their long-term potential. The factory here produced a limited number of its first working microprocessors on the new wafer size in March. The chips were the world's first to feature the next generation of 0.13-micron circuit lines, which allows Intel to cram more transistors onto each chip. Intel says the combination of the two technologies will quadruple production efficiency.
Even while construction continues, the factory here is already preparing for the drive to full-scale production. As technicians assembled the implanter in one bay, an automated trolley system in the next bay whisked a wafer across the ceiling, then lowered it to a tool where workers awaited its arrival. The tool deposited oxides onto the 300-millimeter wafer, then sent it along to the next step.
"From a long-term perspective," said Mark Edelstone, managing director of semiconductor research for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, after touring the factory, "there's no question now about Intel's core competency. It raises the bar significantly for everyone else."

HEADLINE: Zimbabwe's Spreading Misery 

BYLINE:  By Robert I. Rotberg; Robert I. Rotberg is director of the Program on Intrastate Conflict at Harvard's Kennedy School and president of the World Peace Foundation.

 BODY:
The economic and political cancer of President Robert G. Mugabe's regime in Zimbabwe now promises to spread to South Africa -- and so endanger the continent. Zimbabwe's man-made tragedy desperately threatens all its neighbors, and deeply compromises American attempts to help Africa help itself. President Mugabe's paramilitary troops have brutalized and killed opponents; assaulted lawyers, human rights activists and democratic reformers; and invaded factories and universities as well as farms. Washington, London and Pretoria must act together to end this lawlessness before it undermines the entire region.
 Mr. Mugabe turned recklessly violent when the Movement for Democratic Change challenged his 20-year omnipotence. The months before last June's parliamentary elections were rife with intimidation; Mr. Mugabe's paramilitaries killed many opposition activists. The Movement for Democratic Change still won 57 seats in the 150-seat parliament. Before the election, Mr. Mugabe had controlled all but three seats. 
 In reaction, Mr. Mugabe and his associates have ignored rulings by the Supreme Court and forced the chief justice to resign, illegally occupied hundreds of (white-run) farms, killed prominent farmers and their supporters, closed radio stations, bombed the only independent daily newspaper, arrested leading opposition figures, legislated to prevent the Movement for Democratic Change from receiving funds from abroad, and rebuffed Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations, the president of Nigeria, and the British and American governments.
As a result of these and other developments to its north, South Africa has seen its own currency depreciated, its economic growth compromised and its race relations, especially in the white farming sector, endangered. Mr. Mugabe has repeatedly snubbed President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa.
Nearly a million immigrants have walked into South Africa from Zimbabwe -- an exodus that endangers South Africa's economic future. President Mbeki fears the spread of Zimbabwe's violence to his own country.
Mr. Mugabe hopes to destroy the opposition in advance of next year's presidential election. Only Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change is a credible challenger. "I am firmly asserting to you," Mr. Mugabe told a rally in April, "that there will never come a day when the M.D.C. will rule this country -- never, ever."
The intimidation has escalated in part because serious shortages of wheat and maize -- Zimbabwean dietary staples -- are expected later this year. Zimbabwe has had virtually no foreign exchange since September, and production of its biggest exports, tobacco and gold, has shrunk considerably. A trickle of petroleum and electric power continues to arrive from South Africa. Zimbabweans now experience long lines for gasoline and frequent brownouts. Inflation has soared, the currency has lost much of its value against other currencies, gross domestic product has fallen 10 percent, unemployment has reached 60 percent, tourism has declined by more than half, and hospitals and schools barely function. Twenty-five percent of all adults are infected with H.I.V.
Life in Zimbabwe is increasingly brutish and short, and most of the responsibility lies with Mr. Mugabe. Washington and Pretoria cannot wait until after next year's election to act, hoping that Zimbabwe will save itself. Mr. Mugabe will not let a free election occur.
Constructive engagement can no longer curb Mr. Mugabe's assaults on Zimbabweans or his flouting of international norms. Pretoria has shown new signs of alarm since South African-owned businesses were attacked last month. South Africa should now stop supplying fuel.
Most Western donors, including the International Monetary Fund, have already frozen aid, and many charitable organizations have abandoned their operations -- not least because of attacks by paramilitaries. Washington should refuse visas to Zimbabwean officials and their relatives and work further to isolate Zimbabwe until Mr. Mugabe stops oppressing his people and restores the rule of law.

HEADLINE: Dick Cheney, Energy Czar 

 BODY:
Soaring gasoline prices have landed President Bush in the middle of a political storm, and to some extent he has only himself to blame. Mr. Bush did not cause gas prices to rise, any more than President Bill Clinton did when prices jumped above $2 a gallon last summer. As with Mr. Clinton, there is little he can do in the short term to bring prices down. However, he set himself up, but good, for the lashing he is getting from the Democrats.
 First, he instructed Vice President Dick Cheney, a fellow oilman, to develop a national energy strategy, thus adding to Mr. Cheney's growing portfolio of important tasks. Mr. Cheney then plunged into three months of secret meetings reminiscent of Hillary Clinton's closed-door plotting on health care, and embarked on a series of tough-guy speeches in which he derided conservationists as virtuous wimps and said that only a strategy weighted toward extraction could meet the nation's energy needs. Add to all this the oil industry's huge contributions to Mr. Bush's campaign, and it has not been difficult for the Democrats to portray the president as a captive of big oil and an enemy of the little guy at the pump. 
 One ironic element here is that Americans might not be nearly as traumatized by gas prices if Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney had not spent so much time scaring them about the country's energy future. Mr. Bush is constantly engaging in careless talk about how "we're running out of energy," while Mr. Cheney has been forecasting a bleak future unless we start punching holes in the Arctic tundra and building 1,300 power plants. Little wonder, then, that when a spike in gas prices occurred, some people saw it as confirmation of the very apocalypse the Bush team has been predicting.
In addition, the administration seems to have largely ignored the curative forces of the marketplace, which even now may be working to increase supplies and stabilize prices of both natural gas and gasoline. The rise in natural gas prices over the last few years, for example, has more than tripled the number of drilling rigs in operation, and this in turn is likely to alleviate the shortages that underlie the administration's calls for urgent government action.
Market forces also explain the recent spike in prices at the gas pump. Mr. Cheney attributes the spike to industry's failure to build any new refineries for 25 years. A more important reason is industry's failure to anticipate changes in American buying habits. When Americans were buying smaller, more fuel-efficient cars in the 1970's and 80's, oil refining became a depressed business, and refiners made only incremental additions to capacity. When Americans turned to S.U.V.'s and other gas-guzzlers in the 90's, refiners were caught short.
Expanding refining capacity and upgrading pipelines will, in time, get more gasoline to market and help lower prices at the pump. But the larger, more important lesson from the current spike in gasoline prices is that conservation and efficiency -- the very responses Mr. Cheney has dismissed -- are in fact vital components of any rational strategy aimed at bringing supply and demand into better balance and thus moderating prices. 
In recent days, Mr. Cheney has been softening his tone a bit, and on CNN last Tuesday he sounded as if he had been up all night reading Al Gore's "Earth in the Balance." He asked the various combatants in the debate to stop stereotyping one another. He all but conceded that improved efficiency had been the cornerstone of America's energy successes since the gasoline shortages of the early 1970's, noting that the American economy had managed to grow fivefold with only a 25 percent increase in energy. He spoke glowingly of how new technologies had made it possible to produce more energy with less pollution. He said the administration would offer tax incentives for renewable energy sources and more fuel-efficient cars, and would at least examine the idea of strengthening fuel economy standards for cars and trucks.
But Mr. Cheney's basic message remained the same. The country, he continued to insist, is in the grips of an energy shortage, and the only sure way to address it is to move aggressively to increase supplies of oil and natural gas, remove impediments to the increased burning of coal and build new infrastructure, including refineries, pipelines and electrical transmission lines. If that is the main message of Mr. Bush's forthcoming energy plan, then the lesson of the current gasoline shortage, that conservation has to be a prominent part of any new policy, will have been missed.

HEADLINE: Support for Development, but Maybe Not a Stadium 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Standing before a nascent business coalition in a private dining room at the Regency Hotel last month, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani held aloft Tommy Trout, a beautifully mounted 13-inch animated fish.
 He had outlined the economic benefits of rezoning the far West Side of Manhattan for commercial development, expanding the city's convention center, relocating Madison Square Garden and building a retractable-domed stadium that could be home to the Jets, the Olympics and the Final Four college basketball tournament. 
 As the mayor pushed a button, Tommy Trout danced on his board and began singing "Joy to the World." The mayor's point was not to showcase the song by Three Dog Night. He was declaring that while spawning fish in the Hudson River may have stopped the Westway highway project in the 1980's, they would not get in the way of creating what he called the sports capital of the nation. 
But, besides Tommy Trout, there were two striking things about that breakfast. 
The first was the unmistakable absence of anyone from Gov. George E. Pataki's office, raising serious questions about the viability of the mayor's plan. 
The second was that even the people who were invited to speak in support of the plan did not seem to be singing from the mayor's stadium song book. Many of them do seem to hope that the public discussion will enable at least some of the other things to get done.
Since the governor controls the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and the rail yards where the billion-dollar domed stadium would be built, the state is an essential player. Presumably, Mr. Pataki would also be the one to establish the kind of public authority that might be necessary to transform the low-slung neighborhood, south of 42nd Street and west of Ninth Avenue.
"There were none of the key guys from the state," said Betsy Gotbaum, the former president of the New-York Historical Society and a candidate for public advocate, who was among the four dozen hoteliers, developers and cultural leaders at the breakfast, which was sponsored by the Hudson Yards Coalition. "They have to be a partner in this, so it was a little bit confusing." 
State officials say they are often left scratching their heads, since they would have to be financial partners in virtually every one of the projects discussed at the breakfast but are rarely party to the discussions. The officials added that they had little enthusiasm for a battle with the local community over an expensive West Side stadium. 
"We're always interested in what's going on if people want to inform us," said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the state's economic development agency. "I'd imagine if they want to develop state property, they'll contact us. Sure, there have been discussions, but there are no definitive plans."
The mayor and the governor have long been at odds over the development of the West Side. While Mr. Pataki has advocated an expansion of the Javits Center, Mr. Giuliani has refused to go along unless the plans include a sports stadium. 
The breakfast, which was described to a reporter by three people who were there, was only the latest drumbeat for billions of dollars in projects proposed for the working-class and industrial neighborhood now regarded by developers and city officials as Manhattan's last frontier. Tomorrow, the mayor is holding a reception at Gracie Mansion for corporate supporters of the effort to bring the Olympics to New York City in 2012 and build an Olympic stadium over the rail yards.
In any event, the mayor's vision for the West Side did get a warm reception at the breakfast, which was put together by the co-chairmen of the coalition: Jonathan Tisch, chief executive of Loews Hotels, and Lewis Rudin, the developer, as well as Peter Ward, who heads the Hotel Trades Council. 
But that did not mean that everyone embraced a stadium. Instead, the speeches illustrated the difficulty in cobbling together a coalition when disparate interests like elements of a plan, but not necessarily the whole package. 
In his introductory remarks, Mr. Tisch said the cornerstone of the coalition's effort was the expansion of the Javits Center, which would help attract larger conventions, raise hotel occupancy rates and bolster the city's economy.
Mr. Tisch was followed by Daniel L. Doctoroff, president of NYC 2012, the group leading New York's bid for the Olympics. He said the effort was not about travel and tourism, but the future of the city. He said an Olympic stadium over the rail yards, combined with a larger Javits Center and an expansion of the subway lines, would provide a lasting legacy and spur the development of office towers, housing and restaurants.
Then it was Mayor Giuliani's turn. He talked about how a stadium and an expanded convention center would bring jobs and prosperity to the city. But in the end, he said the effort was all about sports, and making the West Side the city's sports capital, much as Lincoln Center is the cultural center.
Mr. Rudin, a developer active in civic affairs, and Bernard Mendik, chairman of the Real Estate Board, have endorsed the Olympic bid and the other projects. 
But many developers are focused less on stadiums and more on the proposed rezoning of the far West Side, which would allow for large office towers and condominiums.
"There is a need to develop that area," said Douglas Durst, whose family owns many skyscrapers in Midtown. "Throwing in a stadium makes it that much more difficult."
And Jerry I. Speyer, an owner of Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building and a part owner of the Yankees, was highly critical of plans to build a stadium at the coalition's first meeting on Dec. 11. 
Two people who were at that December meeting said Mr. Speyer chastised the participants, saying that few of them cared about a stadium other than how it would help them expand the convention center. They said Mr. Speyer then recounted how he had told the Yankees to give up on the West Side site because it would take 10 or 15 years to get done, because of community opposition, potential lawsuits and environmental regulations.
Two top advisers to the governor shared the developers' skepticism, though they said that Mr. Pataki would not publicly oppose a stadium. "They're tilting at windmills," said one adviser.
Sandy Lindenbaum, a dean of New York's real estate lawyers who attended the breakfast, said he had been helping to develop the zoning and financing package for the Olympic bid. But, he added, "It's designed to work with or without a stadium and the Javits expansion."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Merrill Lynch, a Wall Street institution, distills its image down to its signature bull.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
MERRILL LYNCH has turned bearish on "bullish."
 Relax. Merrill Lynch & Company is not turning its back on decades of marketing communications centered on the bull, the traditional symbol for optimism on Wall Street. It's just that, well, ever since the stock markets began sinking last year, it just didn't seem appropriate for Merrill Lynch to focus its estimated $150 million in annual advertising on campaigns carrying the theme "Be bullish." 
 So in a corporate campaign scheduled to begin this week in many countries, the New York office of J. Walter Thompson, a division of the WPP Group that has been Merrill's agency since 1998, is pitch-switching for the second time in two years. Out goes "Be bullish," which succeeded "Human achievement" in early 2000, and in comes "Ask Merrill."
Ask Merrill? Ask Merrill if she wants to go to the prom? Ask Merrill if she remembered to turn off the iron before she left the house? Ask Merrill what it was like to write for David Letterman?
No, actually, it's more like "Ask, and it will be given you," an implied invitation to try Merrill Lynch's services, whether you are an investor, an entrepreneur or an acquisitive tycoon. After all, doesn't another Bible passage go, "Ye have not, because ye ask not"? 
" 'Ask Merrill' is a bold promise, because it says 'If you ask us, we will deliver,' " said Madeline A. Weinstein, senior vice president and director for corporate marketing at Merrill Lynch in New York.
"It's very easy to look at 'Be bullish' as a market call, but it was never intended to be," she added. "The 'Be bullish' campaign was primarily focused on our optimism," derived from "our belief in our capabilities, our expertise."
The replacement of "Be bullish" with "Ask Merrill" was foreshadowed by the introduction of a Web site that included the phrase in its address, promoting the Unlimited Advantage brokerage account. The change is intended as a reminder "of the lessons of the last several months about the importance of expertise, the importance of advice," Ms. Weinstein said.
"We thought long and hard about making this change because 'Be bullish' is a phrase we own," she added. "But ultimately, we decided that when you're selecting a financial institution, it's more about organizational capability and intelligence than optimism."
The bull symbol, a stylized drawing of the animal, will remain a central element of the campaign.
"As long as you put the icon in the ad, they read it as Merrill Lynch," said Dan O'Donnell, executive vice president and global business director at Thompson New York. The symbol will appear at the bottom of print advertisements as a signature and as the sole image on billboards.
"Merrill Lynch is always bullish and always will be bullish," said Charles V. Mangano, first vice president and senior director for brand management at Merrill Lynch, who serves as chief marketing officer. "That's our DNA as a brand."
"The objective here is to show the depth and breadth of the brand," he added, "to show how we put our intelligence to work for clients."
So the first ad asks rhetorically, "Why ask Merrill?," then replies: " 'Ask Merrill' is an invitation. An invitation to tap into this vast network of financial knowledge. To ask us about the things that can make your life, your business, or both, a little richer. Having asked Merrill Lynch, you can be confident you've done your level best to secure the most informed answers to your questions great and small. So ask away."
Subsequent print ads are terser. Each poses a financial problem like "You have a brilliant five-year plan. You have one year," or "You're an investor in Dubai. You're a start-up in Dublin. You need to get together." A diagonal line of type extends from the problem to the bull logo, suggesting Merrill Lynch is the solution.
The recent churn in Merrill Lynch ad themes -- "Human achievement" ran from March 1999 to the arrival of "Be bullish," which now disappears after less than 16 months -- contrasts with the consistency the company showed previously. For instance, "The difference is Merrill Lynch" ran from 1993 to 1999. But in a crowded, competitive category like financial services, why would one risk confusing potential customers?
The theme change is actually "smart," Mr. O'Donnell said, because "right now, more than ever, people are saying: 'Where do I go? What do I do next?' They're looking for a good night's sleep. And Merrill Lynch is a great port in a storm. "
If Merrill Lynch continued to proclaim "Be bullish," he added, consumers would "take it as a sound bite and say: 'You've got to be kidding me. Why would I do that?' "
The print ads start appearing tomorrow in newspapers and magazines in Britain, Germany and the United States as well as in international publications like The Economist and The Financial Times. They will be joined by ads for specific operations like investment banking and brokerage services.
Asked if there will be television commercials, Mr. Mangano replied, "We're looking at that right now for the fall," adding that the private client group is running TV spots.
It's no secret that Merrill Lynch and its rivals are cutting ad budgets in the face of an economic slowdown and the pessimism pervasive among investors as a result of the dot-com meltdown. For example, Merrill Lynch has stopped spending to promote its retail operations in Japan.
Still, by the time 2001 is over, the company expects to have spent the $150 million it spent last year, give or take $10 million. The spending patterns, however, will be different.
For the corporate campaign, Mr. Mangano said, about 50 percent of the spending will be overseas, adding, "In the past, if it was 10 percent, that was a lot."
In introducing "Ask Merrill," Merrill Lynch and Thompson join a lengthy list of Madison Avenue askmasters. Packard automobiles were sold with the slogan "Ask the man who owns one," which was later borrowed and adapted by American Suzuki as "Ask anyone who owns one."
Pennzoil was "the 'ask-for' motor oil." And for Sweet Caporal cigarettes, American Tobacco used the theme "Ask Dad, he knows"; a sign bearing those words is glimpsed in the film "It's a Wonderful Life."
Hmmmm. Maybe Merrill Lynch can finance a remake with a new script about George Bailey the investment banker.

HEADLINE: Wary Spending By Companies Cools Economy 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
People hang on Alan Greenspan's every word, but these days they should listen to business executives like Earnest W. Deavenport and David E. Berges even more. The decisions they make are turning out to have more power to lift the economy, or keep it weak, than Mr. Greenspan's control over interest rates. And for now, corporate executives are pulling back.
 As chairman of Eastman Chemical Company, Mr. Deavenport is not even thinking about building another big chemical plant like the two that went up in the late 1990's. No longer is he as open-handed in financing dot-coms that might develop software that would be useful to Eastman. "We were spending $600 to $800 million a year in the mid-1990's," Mr. Deavenport said, referring to all of Eastman's capital spending, "and now we are down to less than $300 million, mostly for maintenance." 
 Mr. Berges is closing plants, not building new ones: two closings in the last 12 months and a third planned for this year. As president of Honeywell's Consumer Products Group -- maker of Prestone, Fram filters and other auto paraphernalia -- he is using what capital spending there is to cut costs or squeeze more from existing plants. 
"The upturn in capital spending that everyone longs for will not come from us," Mr. Berges said. "We are not a growth business these days."
This business cycle, which began in 1991 and is now the longest on record, is different. In all the others since World War II, the economy responded primarily to consumers, expanding and contracting in step with their spending. Consumers still play a big role, of course. But in its rush to acquire the new information technologies, business made the economy boom in the 1990's. Its spending rose considerably faster than consumer outlays. And when business pulled back last year, the economy fell into the doldrums.
A new boom-and-bust cycle had appeared, one more like those in the first half of the last century -- in which capital spending wagged the dog. But getting executives to spend again for machinery and equipment they do not need is far harder, economists say, than getting consumers to step up spending on extras.
"We may well escape with no recession," said Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, "but we are likely to have a long period -- a year or more -- of weak economic growth and rising unemployment."
The Federal Reserve, with Mr. Greenspan as chairman, has tried to hasten a rebound through sharp cuts in interest rates, and will almost certainly cut them again at a policy meeting on Tuesday. But interest rate swings work most immediately with consumers, who usually respond to lower rates by borrowing and spending more.
Capital investment is another matter. Interest rates play only a minor role. The promise of rising profits is what prompts Mr. Deavenport and Mr. Berges to spend that extra dollar on capital goods -- and the promise of rising profits is fading. "I think for the next year or two, anyway, we are going to be in a mode of reduced capital spending," he said.
That is a 180-degree swing in mood, one that the National Association of Purchasing Management has tracked in periodic surveys of capital spending plans at more than 600 companies in all sectors of the economy. Out of exuberance and the promise -- or mirage -- of fat profits, business in the late 1990's poured huge sums into machinery, office buildings, factories, computers, software, new airliners, World Wide Web sites, trucks, cell phone networks and the many other tools that are used to produce and distribute the goods and services that people buy.
The rising stock market helped to finance these investments, and inflation ceased to be a problem. With capital spending accelerating in the 1990's more rapidly than consumer spending, there were no significant shortages to drive up prices.
Then, last spring, the nation's executives pulled back abruptly on their spending, finally realizing that with all their new tools, they could produce much more than they could profitably sell. The nation's computer manufacturers, for example, have the machinery, the assembly lines and the floor space to increase production immediately by 25 percent. There is similar idle capacity in chemicals, autos, aircraft, plastics, long-distance phone service and machinery, among other industries.
Plunging stock prices helped to change corporate behavior. And the economy quickly weakened, falling from an average annual growth rate of over 4 percent since 1996 to under 2 percent in the last six months.
The rise in capital spending accounted for nearly one-third of the nation's economic growth from the end of the last recession in 1991 through last summer, according to Commerce Department data. That is double its influence during the 1980's expansion. Capital outlays currently account for 10 percent of the nation's $16.1 trillion in total annual transactions, compared with 40 percent for consumer spending. So when capital investment swung from a 21 percent annual growth rate in the first quarter of 2000 to nearly zero a year later, the economy naturally weakened. 
"You would have to have an awfully big jump in consumer spending to get the gross domestic product growing at 4 percent again," said Brent Moulton, chief of the division at the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis that produces the quarterly G.D.P. reports. "You really cannot get there without a revival of capital spending." 
The issue, then, in forecasting a recovery is stark: When will capital spending revive? Or, put another way, when will executives decide they must buy more equipment to meet the rising demand of consumers? That may be months or years away, some economists say, given that consumer spending itself has slipped. But others note that nearly 50 percent of capital investment in recent years has been for computers, software and communications gear -- and these items have short lives.
"It is plausible that a lot of companies will decide next year that they have to replace two- and three-year-old computers with faster ones," said Dean Baker, of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. "That could revive capital spending and produce a mild recovery."
Meanwhile, caution rules. It showed up frequently in interviews with executives and specialists in more than a dozen industries. Among retailers, for example, Lands' End, which sells clothing and household merchandise through a catalog and a Web site, plans to spend $45 million in the current fiscal year, roughly the same as last year. "That could go down," said Charlotte LaComb, manager of investor relations. 
Lands' End is finishing construction of a giant warehouse in Wisconsin, but has no plans to build more. Nor does it plan to open another call center, where operators take orders from customers. And investment in the new Web site is declining, as it is at many companies. "We will continue to develop features that we think are valuable to our customers," Ms. LaComb said, "but we do not have the start-up costs anymore."
The AT&T Corporation spent $14 billion last year to expand voice and data networks, but like Lands' End, the direction of investment this year is more likely to be down, says Frank Ianna, president of ATT Network Services. In recent years, the company has laid nearly 50,000 miles of fiber optic cable, much more than enough to satisfy current demand.
Stringing cable is the expensive part of the process, Mr. Ianna said. The numerous optic fibers have to be "lit up," through the installation of devices that send signals down the fibers. And connections have to be made from the cables to individual homes and offices. "This 'edge' investment is a totally different cost profile," Mr. Ianna said. "You are paying out less money in a given time period, and you have to sell to customers during a slowdown."
Financing has become another stone around capital spending's neck, not only for dot-com entrepreneurs who can no longer find eager investors, but at a more mundane level as well. Certainly Robert Hawkins is pulling back.
Mr. Hawkins is chairman of Southern Commercial Bank in St. Louis, which lends to small machine shops in that city. "The owners of these shops were hot to purchase computer-controlled grinding machines," Mr. Hawkins said. That was partly because they could not hire enough machinists in the late 1990's to operate the older equipment, and partly because their order books were full, Mr. Hawkins said. One customer, who makes industrial pulleys, even spent $1 million on a Japanese machine that grinds castings unattended after the shop closes for the night.
Now, machinists are easier to find, order books are no longer filled and Mr. Hawkins is pressing his customers to pay the debts accumulated during the capital spending splurge. "What I tell these guys is you can lay off your workers and shut down your machines, but you can never lay off your banker," Mr. Hawkins said.
There are some bright spots. Construction of office buildings and stores is still going strong, although vacancy rates have begun to rise. Investment is rising in oil and gas exploration, electric power, cell phone networks, biotechnology and the purchase of commercial aircraft. The nation's airlines are scheduled to take delivery of 450 planes this year, up from 350 last year, the Air Transport Association reports.
But even there, shrinking airline profits could alter plans. "When profits decline, investment slows, no matter what the cost savings might be from operating the new planes," said David Swierenga, the association's chief economist. "In the short term, you conserve cash and postpone delivery of new aircraft."

HEADLINE: BRAINS, PLANES AND AUTOMOBILES; 
Toward a Smoother Flight

BYLINE:  By CHRISTINE NEGRONI; Christine Negroni is the author of "Deadly Departure: Why the Experts Failed to Prevent the T.W.A. Flight 800 Disaster and How It Could Happen Again."

 BODY:
IT'S your vacation, and every millisecond is precious. How much of it do you want to spend in transit?
 Few people planning to travel by air this summer are likely to have forgotten the televised scenes from last year, when bad weather and labor unrest resulted in flight delays that broke records. The nightmare stories prompted Congress to consider several versions of an air passengers' bill of rights, but these efforts also seem to be delayed at the gate. 
 The coming travel season shows every sign of being as bad, if not worse. So while Allan Sherman used to sing that "good advice costs nothing, and it's worth the price," it may be wise to consider the tips frequent fliers use, and engage in what the Department of Transportation creatively describes as "defensive flying."

Risk: Labor Unrest
The most ominous situation for summer air travelers is a threat on the ground: two of the largest United States airlines -- United and American -- face possible strikes. The last time there was such an alignment of labor unrest was in 1966, when machinists from five major airlines went on strike simultaneously, prompting President Lyndon B. Johnson to intervene. Now there are more than six times as many people flying, and both labor and management are aware of the power of a job action. As Clay Foushee, the vice president of regulatory affairs at Northwest Airlines (which just settled with its mechanics' and cleaners' union), put it, "The employee group can shut you down."
Even without a strike, labor unrest can affect travelers if employees engage in work slowdowns or job actions. The normal advice -- avoid booking flights on airlines with labor disputes -- won't be easy to follow: these two airlines carry a third of all air travelers in the United States.
"There are only a small number of airlines where travelers can go to seek shelter," says David S. Stempler, the president of the Air Travelers Association, an air passenger group in Washington. "And those airlines don't have enough capacity to offer a safe harbor." Of course, users of frequent-flier miles are out of luck in a strike.
So it makes sense to pay close attention to news reports about union negotiations and make ticket-buying decisions accordingly. Updates on the labor situation can be found on the Internet at airlinebiz.com/wire /labor. If you have already bought a ticket on Northwest, United or American, do a little research before you travel to find out what other airlines fly to your destination. Then call and find out the policy on accepting a striking airlines' tickets.
Alternative flight information can be found on the online reservations systems of most major airlines by entering departure and destination information and selecting "show all airlines." (For the New York area, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has an extensive listing of flights at www.panynj.gov/aviation /oagframe.HTM. )
If you absolutely have to be somewhere at a certain time, and are willing to pay for the assurance, back up your ticket with a fully refundable ticket on another carrier. If your original flight goes off without a hitch, you can get your money back on the second ticket. 

Tip: Stay Flexible
I can be absent-minded -- I once reserved a car service to take my family home from the airport after a vacation, forgetting our minivan was in long-term parking -- so when airlines began offering electronic ticketing, I was delighted. No more forgetting where I put my ticket, at least. But there is a price for such a convenience.
When a flight is canceled, the defensive traveler with a paper ticket can call the toll-free number of another airline and reserve a seat on its next flight or go to its boarding gate and present the paper ticket to the gate agent, and if there is room get on that flight. Sure, travelers with e-tickets can do the same thing, but they must first convert their ticket to a flight coupon, which means getting in line and waiting with everyone else. By then, people with paper tickets could have filled up the seats on the other carrier or the plane could have left.
Airlines have saved millions of dollars in paper and postage since the introduction of the e-ticket. They won't like it if passengers start to reject them. Some airlines have begun to charge a $10 fee for a paper ticket. Dean Headley, the author of the annual Airline Quality Rating report, thinks the fee is a worthwhile investment.
"With an e-ticket, the issuing company has you locked in," he said. "A paper ticket is a piece of flexibility you can maintain for yourself."

Risk: Airport Delays
More than 450,000 flights were delayed at least 15 minutes last year, a 20 percent increase from 1999, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. If past is prologue, delays will be the biggest inconvenience this summer, too.
The airline industry's hub-and-spoke system plays a significant role. Unless you're flying from one major city to another, and only a quarter of travelers do, air travel involves collecting passengers from scattered airports and routing them to one of two dozen major hubs, then on to their final destination. 
It makes economic sense for the airlines, but it creates a house of cards at the airports. To make it work, arrivals and departures at the hubs must be closely timed, putting pressure on everyone involved, from the crews who clean and service the airplanes to the luggage handlers who load and unload them to pilots and air traffic controllers who must pack all those planes onto the same amount of concrete.
With a process so delicately balanced, a single deviation -- and there can be many in a business as complex as commercial aviation -- quickly cascades, creating problems that can affect an entire day and even an entire airport. 

Tips: Fly Early in the Day
If yours is the first flight out in the morning, the plane and the crew have often spent the night in town. Even problems like weather and unexpected aircraft repairs are better dealt with when everyone is fresh. As the day wears on, molehills become mountains of trouble. And those friendly airline workers who helped board the breakfast flight can be impatient and irritable by dinnertime. 

FLY AT OFF HOURS -- If the first flight of the day doesn't work for you, schedule your trip during the daily lulls. Reservation agents can steer you to the off-peak flights. Soon there may be a financial incentive as well: to reduce bottlenecks, the government is encouraging airports to increase landing fees at peak hours.

Risk: Airport Overload
Some of the most notoriously delay-ridden airports -- La Guardia (responsible for nearly a third of all flight delays last year), O'Hare and Logan, in Boston -- were built many years ago, when air traffic was a fraction of what it is today. "It's just like the highway," said Mr. Foushee of Northwest. "The concrete can only handle so many vehicles."
But few communities are eager to add runways to existing airports. Only six new runways have been added to major airports in the last 20 years. 
There are alternatives to the most congested airports. San Francisco's famous fog helped the airport earn its rank as the fifth most delay-plagued airport in the country. Across the bay, the skies are usually clear at Oakland International.
In Boston, the Massachusetts Port Authority, which oversees Logan Airport, began a campaign to encourage travelers to fly from one of the six other New England airports. The airports in Manchester, N.H., and Warwick, R.I. (T. F. Green Airport), are only a little more than an hour's drive from downtown Boston. 
"People associate the term 'reliever airport' or 'secondary airport' with secondary service," said Virginia Buckingham, the authority's executive director, "but that's clearly not the case. Once they break the habit of coming through a major airport and experience the ease of driving in -- parking is cheaper, it's more comfortable because the terminals are less crowded -- they find out what a positive experience it is." 

Tip: Avoid Busy Airports
Consider selecting less congested airports for both ends of your trip, and, if you have a choice, what hub to go through. Many major cities are served by more than one airport in cities or large towns nearby. In Miami it's Fort Lauderdale; in New York there are Westchester County Airport, MacArthur Airport in Islip on Long Island and Stewart Airport in Newburgh, N.Y. Information about alternatives in New England is available at www.flynewengland.com.

Risk: Denied Boarding
"On the planet Earth there is no airline that does not overbook," said Ed Stewart, director of public relations for Southwest Airlines. "Or else they'd be out of business." 
The peculiar economics of the airline industry seem to require some amount of overbooking. Ensuring that a plane takes off at least 65 percent full -- roughly the break-even point -- seems to require selling seats that on the day of travel might already have someone in them. On routes with a high no-show rate, an airline may sell twice as many tickets as it has seats. 
Sometimes, more passengers than expected show up for the flight. If the airline can't persuade enough of them to take a later plane, someone is going to get bumped.
Airlines are required to pay up if they can't get bumped travelers to their destination within two hours of the original arrival time, so some folks are happy to take a later flight and pocket the money or a voucher for free travel in the future. But not all vacation travelers will cheerfully see their plans changed without their consent. To those folks, a warning: when it comes to selecting which passengers will be removed from a flight involuntarily, a number of airlines start with the passengers who paid the least.
"People are astounded by that," said Mr. Stempler of the Air Travelers Association, "but think about it. Full-fare passengers constitute 15 percent of the people on the plane. They're paying full-fare coach, but the airlines don't give them an improved product. What they get is protection against being bumped." 
Smart travelers build a cushion of time into their trips when flying on discounted tickets, flying in a day or a half a day before they absolutely must be there. 
"If you build flexibility into your schedule and you are denied boarding, it can be turned into a benefit," Mr. Headley of the Air Quality Rating report said. "You can miss one flight and get a voucher to boot, and it doesn't hurt your attitude any."
Students and others on tight travel budgets have been known to schedule themselves on flights that are regularly overbooked. Airline reservations agents can check to see how full a flight is and will supply this information if asked. 
Flights in and out of popular vacation destinations like Las Vegas, San Juan and Orlando are known for offering opportunities for being bumped.

Tip: Follow the Rules
If you don't want to be bumped, first comply with the boarding requirements of your airline, which can be found on the back of the ticket, or with the e-mail or fax confirming an electronic ticket. Your seat can be canceled, even if you've paid for it, if you do not check in 15 minutes before flight time. "The time you are at the gate is the important time," Mr. Stempler said. "That way, you're among the shows instead of the no-shows." 
And by the way, loyalty pays. Most airlines protect their frequent fliers from bumping.

Risk: Lost Luggage
It doesn't happen that often, but mishandled luggage is the third most common complaint of air travelers. Business travelers are notorious for trying to stow all their belongings in the overhead bins; for vacationers toting things like golf clubs and portable playpens, this isn't an option.
Air travelers sometimes add to their problems by showing up late for a flight or failing to put identification on suitcases. Occasionally, a bag goes astray when another traveler walks off with it by mistake.
The now famous videotape of Northwest Airlines baggage handlers playing basketball with suitcases and packages in Minneapolis last Christmas should be sufficient proof that suitcases may not receive proper respect. Airlines constantly warn travelers not to pack irreplaceable, fragile, valuable or critical items like medication in checked luggage. Furthermore, if checked luggage is damaged or the contents are lost, the airline will not necessarily compensate what you think you're due.
On domestic flights, airlines accept a maximum liability of $2,500 for lost luggage, but that's not a given. "It's adjusted, like any other claim would be," said Emmet Schwartzman, an aviation lawyer with Carlton Fields, a Florida firm that represents airlines. "You've got to itemize what it is you claim you lost. If you can document it, that helps your case." Airlines will not pay for those valuable, breakable or electronic items it warned you not to pack, even if you've carried them on. 

Tips: Don't Push It
Checking in for a flight with minutes to spare requires hustle on the part of the airline. And while you may be willing to make an undignified dash through the terminal to catch your plane, not every airline bag handler will feel motivated to join you.

LABELS, INSIDE AND OUT -- Identification tags can come off. A second card with your name, home and destination information placed inside an unlocked compartment of your suitcase will help the airline reunite you with your bags if they get lost.

DOUBLE-CHECK THE CLAIM TICKET -- Before handing over your luggage, make sure the correct destination tag is on each piece. Check again when picking up the luggage on arrival: many suitcases really do look alike. A bright ribbon or a luggage tag attached to the handle will distinguish your bag from the dozen other black Samsonites on the carousel.
Commercial aviation in the United States is overtaxed under the best of circumstances, and summer vacation travel makes it worse. No matter how many precautions you take, you may find your trip disrupted. Which leads to the final tip:
Behave yourself.
You may be traveling with children, but don't act like one yourself. If your flight plans are disrupted, it is unlikely to be the fault of one airport or airline worker. Like most people, the workers appreciate patience and respect. 
"If you want to mistreat our employees, fly another airline," said Mr. Stewart of Southwest Airlines. "The customer is not always right."
Since airline employees have a great deal of discretionary control over how passengers will be accommodated, being well mannered and polite is the best defensive flying technique of all.

HEADLINE: A CONVERSATION WITH: Dan Shapiro; 
A Doctor's Story of Hope, Humor and Deadly Cancer

BYLINE:  By JANE E. BRODY 

DATELINE: TUCSON, Ariz. 

 BODY:
In May 1987, Dan Shapiro, then a 20-year-old junior at Vassar College, discovered he had Hodgkin's disease. After seven months of treatment with four chemotherapy drugs and radiation, he seemed healthy again.
 In 1988, in his first year of graduate school in clinical psychology, he counseled a young girl named Jodi who was not doing well after a bone marrow transplant for the same cancer and who soon died. Six months later, he learned that his own cancer had returned and that his only hope was a bone marrow transplant. His survival chances were 40 percent. Sixteen months after the transplant, in July 1991, he had a second relapse, and few options remained. 
 He did a lot of homework and ultimately sought treatment from a leading Hodgkin's disease expert, Dr. Saul Rosenberg at Stanford University Medical Center. "I don't think I can cure you," Dr. Rosenberg told him, "but I'm going to try." 
It is now nine years after treatment at Stanford. Dr. Shapiro has received a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of Florida; since 1995 he has been an assistant professor in psychiatry, integrative medicine and psychology at the University of Arizona medical school. He is married to Terry Wikle, a nurse he met on the bone marrow transplant unit, and they are parents of Alexandra, 5, and Abigail, 18 months, conceived through artificial insemination with his own sperm, frozen before his first chemotherapy at age 20.
And he wrote "Mom's Marijuana: Insights About Living," a collection of essays not about marijuana but rather a tribute to his otherwise conventional mother who, when her son became ill, grew marijuana in her backyard in Connecticut to help him withstand the nausea and vomiting brought on by chemotherapy.
As a clinical psychologist, Dr. Shapiro applies what he has learned to help other patients get what they need from doctors and to help doctors practice a more humane and integrated form of medicine.

Q. Before your cancer was diagnosed, you investigated your grandfather's extremely difficult life -- barely escaping from the Nazis, being separated from his wife and children, suffering from tuberculosis that killed him at an early age. You doubted whether you were strong enough to withstand what he went through. What helped you muster the needed resilience?

A. It helped me to know about my grandparents' struggles and to read other people's histories of struggle and adversity. I think that's why memoirs are so popular. We're hungry to know how others coped with challenge and trauma. I didn't think "why me, how could I be singled out?" but rather that crisis visits all lives. There are periods of calm and periods of crisis.

Q. While battling your cancer, you made a brief foray into alternative medicine. You asked a Chinese homeopath for something for cancer, and he said, "See a doctor." What would you advise cancer patients about alternative medicine?

A. That Chinese doctor summed up the best of alternative medicine. Good practitioners recognize the limits of their ability and where their expertise lies but they don't claim to cure cancer. In acute situations, you need to go to conventional treaters. But for a lot of chronic illness, it can be very helpful.

Q. How can a lay person distinguish between a responsible alternative medicine practitioner and a quack?

A. Unfortunately we don't yet have licensure for alternative medicine, so it's tricky. Often it's by word of mouth. Hopefully, as the alternative medicine movement continues to swell, conventional physicians will help us separate the quacks from the helpful.

Q. You quizzed your radiation oncologist about treatment side effects. If all patients did this, wouldn't some refuse treatment?

A. About 85 percent of patients are information-seeking and want to know the limitations as well as the strengths of their treatment. Unfortunately, a lot of physicians overestimate the treatment benefits and underplay the side effects. In the short term more people accept treatment, then become surprised, dismayed and often panicked when predictable side effects occur. If patients know about side effects in advance and are taught how to anticipate and cope with them, they would do a lot better.

Q. A vibrant sense of humor helped you through the repeated recurrences and many rounds of treatments with horrific side effects. How can others adopt a life-affirming perspective in the face of crisis?

A. We all have a choice as to how to respond to stressful situations. Take losing one's luggage. We can respond with humor: "Has my luggage gone somewhere interesting? Is it out having a good time?" Or we can take it as a calamity. When you're stressed, your heart pounds, pupils dilate and catecholamines pour into the bloodstream and suppress immunity. So it's probably physiologically helpful to have a sense of humor.

Q. You say you were helped by writing all through your therapy. For someone not comfortable with writing, can talking help?

A. Behavioral scientists have shown that expressing emotions may confer immunological benefits. Though I didn't know that at the time, I filled notebooks randomly, especially when my treatment was particularly challenging. One of our goals is to match a person's style of emotional disclosure with the mode they use to do it. For some it's writing; for others it's talking.

Q. You wrote that being "high on hope" kept you from giving up, even when near death. Can health professionals foster hope?

A. Health professionals should help patients find things to hope for. But patients also need room to mourn their losses. Our "put-on-a-happy-face" culture can deny patients an opportunity to grieve lost life expectations. A lot of patients have New Age guilt because people around them say, "If you'd just be optimistic, you'd survive." We deny people the opportunity to say: "You know what? This stinks."

Q. What if doctors were more willing to tell patients when the end is near instead of hitting them with more treatments?

A. Patients would have an opportunity to talk about their lives and say their goodbyes, which would help achieve some sense of closure, not only for the dying but also for the people who will grieve them. Research has shown that grieving is worse and more prolonged when there are unresolved issues.

Q. How can doctors learn to be more accepting of the end of life?

A. There's a conspiracy of silence in medicine around death and dying. Physicians have no opportunity to ventilate their feelings and soon become hardened to death in order to survive emotionally. When a patient dies, the physician should be able to sit down and talk about it with other physicians and about what a dignified optimal death entails.

Q. How can patients increase their chances of receiving humane treatment, of being treated as a whole person?

A. Most patients have been brought up on "Dr. Kildare," "Marcus Welby," "Chicago Hope" or "E.R.", where the physicians are largely very caring, have some degree of self-knowledge and plenty of time for their patients. The reality is quite different. I try to give patients an understanding of what 15-minute medicine is really like. I teach them to be very organized and to insist on being treated with dignity.
I teach them to keep an illness notebook, to write down all the information in one place, go in with all their questions written down, go with more than one person and bring a tape recorder. I have patients practice assertiveness: how to get the physician back into the room when he's about to walk out and you haven't had your questions answered. It doesn't matter if medical schools take in more humane people, they can still beat out all their empathy. 

Q. You work with Dr. Andrew Weil, the guru of integrated medicine. How has this affected your thinking about medical care in this country?

A. Clearly, patients are hungry for physicians who will take time with them. I understand the economic pressures today to make medicine less expensive, but I think we're being penny-wise and pound-foolish. When physicians take the time to give sound advice, they have the opportunity to prevent future ailments because patients often try to make the recommended changes. Also, the national hunger for physicians who understand the best of alternative and conventional medicine far overrides anything we can do. We also need a medical insurance system that reimburses for treatments like nutrition and exercise counseling and we need parity for mental health. About 50 percent of patients come to their physicians with mental health issues that show up as physical illness because it's easier to talk about physical symptoms.

Q. Your book has a very catchy title: "Mom's Marijuana." What stance should our country take on medical marijuana?

A. I think it's absurd that physicians have in their arsenal drugs that are much more biologically addictive, like morphine, Valium, Percocet and not have in their arsenal marijuana, which is useful in some circumstances.

Q. It was just luck -- your mother meeting someone in a waiting room -- that resulted in your banking sperm before your treatment was begun. Is this common practice now?

A. It should be standard practice for oncologists who treat people of reproductive age. Many always do it; some never do. Fertility is the No. 2 concern of patients who survive, the No. 1 concern being relapse.

Q. You seem to find joy in so many little things, like a child jumping in a rain puddle. Were you always like this?

A. It was honed during illness, and it's the fuel of resilience. When my body and mind slowed, I hungered for more input and studied the things around me with more energy. Now it's a richer world, a constantly unfolding, fascinating series of what some people would consider pedestrian events -- the way water beads up on a window, the way a child takes to a lemon Popsicle -- and small human interactions.
Our culture revolves around acquisition of material goods, and that turns out to be a pretty dissatisfying pursuit. It is very important for people to have meaning and purpose in their lives and connection to other humans.

HEADLINE: The Green Revolution Yields to the Bottom Line 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
Dr. William Folk, a professor at the University of Missouri, wants to genetically engineer soybeans to improve their nutritional value. But he faces more than scientific hurdles. He and Monsanto never agreed on how he might use a patented technique for inserting genes into the beans. 
 "These procedures that have by and large been most useful are now inaccessible," Dr. Folk said. 
 Dr. Folk is feeling the effects of a major change engulfing agricultural research. Once the realm of public institutions like land-grant colleges, it is increasingly being controlled by private companies. 
This fundamental shift alarms some farming experts, who point out that the public research system trained thousands of farmers over the decades and vastly improved farm output both in the United States and overseas.
Now, these critics say, patent restrictions are choking the free exchange of seeds and technology that nourished the public system.
Research on potential crop improvements has been delayed or abandoned. And in the quest for profits, crop development for poor countries could be neglected. 
Scientists at the University of Costa Rica, for example, have genetically engineered rice to provide resistance to a virus that is a major problem in the tropics. But before the university can sell the seeds to farmers, it must get clearance from holders of as many as 34 patents, said Dr. Ana Sittenfeld, an associate professor there.
In the United States, about 45 percent of plant breeders at universities said that trouble getting seeds from private companies interfered with their research, according to a 1999 survey by Steven C. Price, director for industry relations at the University of Wisconsin.
"The things that give us a safe and healthy food supply are slowly eroding," said Dr. Samuel H. Smith, the former president of Washington State University, who is trying to secure more financing for land-grant colleges like his own. "It's a slow death."
Seed companies and other agricultural experts dismiss any safety concerns or say they are overstated.
And, they say, the private sector influx has brought with it new technology and increased total research spending.
"Nobody was investing any serious money in improving soybeans until there was intellectual property protection," said Dr. Tony Cavalieri, a vice president at Pioneer Hi-Bred International. 
But some critics say companies are overemphasizing genetic engineering because it is easier to protect engineered crops with patents. That is risky, they say, because consumers may reject bioengineered food. Nor is it certain that biotechnology will improve crop output the way classical breeding has.
"I am worried we are getting off the proven thoroughbred too quickly to get on a highly decorated donkey," Dr. Margaret Mellon of the Union of Concerned Scientists said.
Others worry that a small group of companies could control the world's food supply.
Such concerns were heightened in January when two companies announced they had determined the genetic code of rice, years ahead of a government effort. 
"One thing people could argue is, How can a company own the most important food crop in the world?" said Dr. Rod A. Wing of Clemson University. "In Asia, rice is like a religion. To own a religion, so to speak, that's just a question. Can you do that? I don't think so."
The shift from public to private research was spurred by court and patent office decisions in the 1980's that allowed plant varieties and genes to be patented. The rulings meant that companies could more easily recoup investments in improved crops. And with the advent of biotechnology, advanced research now requires tools that some public institutes cannot afford, like gene databases.
At the same time, growth in government spending on farm research has slowed as fears of widespread hunger have abated. In industrialized countries, public spending has been growing 1.8 percent a year and private spending 5 percent, according to Philip G. Pardey, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington.
The United States Department of Agriculture's research budget, about $2 billion a year, has barely grown in real terms over two decades.
Britain has privatized some government agricultural research centers. And some developing countries have actually cut research spending.
In the United States, private agricultural research spending surpassed public spending in the early 1980's, and the gap has widened. By 1994, two-thirds of American plant breeding was in the private sector, according to an Iowa State University survey that is still considered authoritative. "Breeders in the public sector have essentially vanished," said Dr. William F. Tracy, professor of agronomy at the University of Wisconsin. 
If public breeding withers, perhaps the biggest concern is that the improvement of crops for the developing world will falter because of low profit potential.
"It's the same phenomenon with the malaria vaccine," said Dr. Hubert Zandstra, director general of the International Potato Center in Peru, which is supported by governments and charities. "Why is there no malaria vaccine? Because there's no one to pay for it."
Dr. Zandstra said seed companies hesitated to develop virus-resistant potato seeds because the harm done by viruses forced farmers to buy new seeds. But with his center developing such seeds, companies are following so they don't lose sales. 
Even in wealthy countries, companies are not likely to devote much effort to minor crops. 
A further concern is that a wave of acquisitions has left much of the seed business and most agricultural biotech patents in the hands of five big companies: Monsanto; Syngenta; DuPont, which bought Pioneer Hi-Bred; Dow Chemical; and Aventis. 
Some smaller companies also worry about this trend.
"If the companies are making all those discoveries they may lock them up," said Dr. Jerry Caulder, chief executive of the Akkadix Corporation, an agricultural biotech start-up. "If our universities were doing it, then literally thousands of new companies could be created." 
Even at universities, a small but growing portion of research is being conducted by companies. In 1998, Novartis, now known as Syngenta, agreed to give $25 million over five years to the plant and microbial biology department at the University of California at Berkeley in exchange for first rights to licensing some department discoveries.
While critics on campus say the deal threatens academic freedom, the university argues that it gets needed money and access to crop gene databases that are needed for plant research but which it cannot develop on its own.
The old breeding technique of crossing two plants rarely involves patents. But the modern equivalent -- inserting a gene into a plant -- can involve numerous patented technologies, including the gene itself, the insertion method, the "promoter" that turns the gene on and the marker used to detect whether the gene is present. 
Golden rice, an experimental crop that might one day help alleviate vitamin A deficiency, which can cause blindness, was covered by as many as 70 patents owned by 31 companies or universities in various countries. The patent holders have agreed to charge no royalties for rice that is to be given free to poor farmers in developing countries. But the licensing process delayed work on the rice by about a year. 
Hoping to garner public support for genetically modified foods, the biotech companies say they are willing to allow their technologies to be used for humanitarian purposes.
Some companies insist the process is less than overwhelming. "Is it more of a hassle? Yes," Dr. Robert T. Fraley, chief technology officer of Monsanto. "Is it a real barrier? I don't think so."
Monsanto usually allows university scientists to use its technology for research, executives said, though a separate license may be required for commercial use. Dr. Folk of the University of Missouri planned commercial use for the soybean seeds he developed, so he was treated like a competitor and asked for a detailed proposal, which he did not provide, a Monsanto spokesman said.
But some scientists say having a license only for research is not enough. California strawberry growers canceled a project to develop a strawberry resistant to fungus for fear that they would not be allowed to let the strawberry be grown commercially, said Dr. Alan Bennett, executive director of the office of technology transfer at the University of California, which discovered the fungal resistance gene.
In some cases, companies let academic scientists use their technology in return for commercial rights to any results. And universities themselves are now patenting their inventions -- and often licensing them to companies. The result is that companies are capturing the output of public sector research, said Dr. Gary Toenniessen, director for food security at the Rockefeller Foundation. 
The gene that spurred the green revolution in the 1960's -- creating high-yield grain and helping alleviate world hunger -- was provided to Dr. Norman E. Borlaug by Washington State University. "If that happened today," he said, "Washington State would take out a patent and license it to DuPont or Monsanto or somebody."
The International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines spent 11 years narrowing the search for a gene to make rice resistant to leaf blight. It gave its work to the University of California at Davis, which found the gene and patented it. But before it could use the gene to develop blight-resistant rice for poor farmers, the institute needed a license from Davis, and that license took three years to get. 
As companies and universities patent improved varieties, developing countries, which harbor many wild seeds useful in breeding, are growing reluctant to share these seeds without compensation. Barley from Ethiopia imparted virus resistance to California's crop in the 1950's, without any compensation to Ethiopia.
But such free exchange, which nourished world agriculture for decades, is becoming a thing of the past.
Now, farmers and public researchers hope to reclaim lost ground. A new lobbying group, the National Coalition for Food and Agricultural Research, held its inaugural meeting in January. It attracted about 50 individuals and institutions including farmers, farm groups like the American Soybean Association, university scientists and companies like Monsanto, which benefit from the scientific advances and training provided by the public sector.
Terry L. Wolf, a farmer from Homer, Ill., who is president of the coalition, said increased research was needed for American agriculture to remain competitive in world markets. "Most new innovation that has come about in the last 50 years has come from the public sector," Mr. Wolf said. 
The voices are being heard somewhat. The Agriculture Department's budget is up 11 percent this year. However, President Bush's budget for next year would increase the department's main research program by only $1 million, to $916 million, and would cut other research programs. 
It is difficult to argue for more funding when farmers suffer from crop surpluses, when obesity seems a bigger problem than malnutrition and when medical research has more ardent advocates.
"It's a real poignant testimony for a youngster to come in and say, 'We need more funding or I'm going to die,' " said Barbara Glenn, chairwoman of CoFARM, a coalition of professional societies pushing for more agricultural research. "No one's dying from starvation. It's a really hard argument to make."
Some academic experts say that ultimately the best hope for the public sector is to tap into the money and technology of the private sector. The companies now seem more willing to enter into such partnerships, in part to avert criticism of biotechnology and in part because the sequencing of crop genomes is providing too much information for the companies to analyze alone.
"Perhaps the private sector is more willing to have public institutions working with them, whereas in the past they didn't need us," said Dr. Victor Lechtenberg, dean of agriculture at Purdue.
Right now each licensing deal has to be arranged separately, a cumbersome process. Scientists met in Berkeley in February to discuss setting up a patent exchange on the Internet.
Still, some say that even faster licensing is no substitute for the old ways. "Improvements will slow with the loss of free exchange," said Dr. Tracy of the University of Wisconsin. "That's just basically inevitable."

HEADLINE: Those Congested Roads 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman ("Nation in a Jam," column, May 13) is correct that today's roads are even more clogged with cars than they were 10 years ago. One reason: the heavy investment in highway construction serves only to increase Americans' desire to take to the road. 
 We can reverse this trend only when we spend dollars on more attractive alternatives like an improved Amtrak system and better local public transportation facilities.
Congested roads not only carry economic and environmental costs but also are costly in terms of the adverse impacts on the health and well-being of all exposed to traffic noise and fumes, whether in the cars or living alongside the highways.

English Is Spoken Here . . . Too Much, Some Say

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, May 14 

 BODY:
If Aldo Rebelo gets his way, it will soon be illegal for Brazilians to go to a "drive-in" for a "hot dog" and "milkshake," entrust their cars to "valet parking" or invest their money with a "personal banker." 
 The activities themselves will not be prohibited, mind you, just the use of the English-language terms by which they are commonly known here. 
 Mr. Rebelo, a member of Congress, decided to take action after he took offense at the proliferation here of stores with English-language names, like The Pet From Ipanema; Love, Sex and Money, a boutique; World Top Lock; Fashion Mall; Bad Kid; Video Market; and Sweet Way.
"Why should Brazilians have to feel embarrassed in their own country because they can't pronounce these names?" said Mr. Rebelo, a member of the Communist Party of Brazil. 
In a burst of what opponents disparagingly call "verbal nationalism," Mr. Rebelo is sponsoring legislation that would outlaw the introduction and use of foreign words in this nation of 170 million people. It was initially considered little more than a crank bill.
The goal of his bill, he said, is "to boost the self-esteem of the people in relation to Portuguese and show them that it is not a language that is ugly, underdeveloped, backward or useless, as some people might imagine."
Mr. Rebelo said he was particularly alarmed by the use of English-language terms in business and technology when "there are perfectly adequate Portuguese-language substitutes." 
Brazil has the largest computer and Internet industry in Latin America, and English-derived verbs like startar, printar, attachar or deletear and the nouns homepage, e-mail, site and mouse are standard usage.
"I think he and the whole idea are nuts," retorted Ricardo Gouveia Botelho, a 28-year-old Web site designer shopping at a computer store. "We use those words because everybody in the world understands them. And what does he plan to do, send the language police to the office to bust us?"
But the proposal was approved by the lower house of Congress on March 29, and business and advertising groups are lobbying intensely to defeat it in the Senate. 
The lower house passed the bill in an atmosphere of wanting to distract attention from a growing political corruption scandal, and it is not known when the Senate will get around to dealing with it. If the Senate passes the bill, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso will have to decide whether to sign it.
Though French and Arabic have historically been the main sources of foreign words used in Portuguese, the language of Brazil, the initiative is clearly aimed at English, which Mr. Rebelo said he regarded as an instrument of "the economic and commercial hegemony of the United States."
Businesses have already begun reacting as though they expect his bill to become law. Major banks have ended programs with names like Hot Money, Federal Card and Home Banking, while stores have begun taking down signs that advertise a "sale" or "20 percent off" and replacing them with others announcing a "liquidacao."
In a show of support for Mr. Rebelo, posters listing Portuguese-language substitutes for English words have gone up over this cosmopolitan city, which sets styles for the rest of the country. They were put up by the Movement for the Valuation of Brazilian Culture, Language and Riches, a nationalist group.
But most language professionals maintain that the legislation is too extreme and that it underestimates the absorptive capacity of Brazilian Portuguese.
Brazilians have proven so creative in adapting English to their own needs, in fact, that native speakers of English are often baffled by the usages they encounter here. To Brazilians a shower stall is a "box," a billboard is an "outdoors," to go jogging is to "cooper" (after a doctor who introduced it here), a razor blade is a "gilete" and the steroid-fueled weight lifters who pick fights in nightclubs are "pit boys."
Taken literally, the measure would also appear to outlaw much of the vocabulary of soccer, the national sport, starting with the name of the game itself, futebol, and including such terms as gol and penalti. But Mr. Rebelo said he was willing to grant an exception for words that had already been or were being assimilated into Portuguese.
"We don't want to control the evolution of the language," he said. "What we want is to avoid abuses." And the best way to do that, he contends, is to punish violators with fines or by "sending them back to school for Portuguese classes."
The legislation calls for the Brazilian Academy of Letters to determine which foreign words can be used legally, or as Mr. Rebelo puts it, "granted a residence visa," and which cannot. But the academy, which already sets the rules for spelling here, seems to have reservations about the expanded role envisioned for it.
"The congressman's concern for the health of our language is praiseworthy," said Tarcisio Padilha, president of the 40-member group. "But this problem is a cultural one of great complexity, and it seems to me to be more a matter for public debate than one which should be regulated by laws and decrees."
Sergio Nogueira Duarte, a professor of Portuguese who writes a weekly column on language for the daily Jornal do Brasil, said: "Foreign words are present in any language, and often for good reasons. To use the word 'dumping,' for example, is better than wasting a whole line to explain in Portuguese that you are talking about selling a product below cost so as to damage a competitor."
One reason Mr. Rebelo's proposal may be flourishing is Brazil's status as the only Portuguese-speaking country in the Western Hemisphere, which feeds a sense of isolation and fear that the language will be overwhelmed by others.
The drive to protect Portuguese is not the only such movement. France has passed numerous laws in the last decade to try to protect the French language; in fact, Mr. Rebelo said his measure was modeled on those. Quebec also has passed laws to assure the supremacy of French.
Portuguese may be the seventh most widely spoken language in the world, but outside Brazil it is the mother tongue of fewer than 50 million people, the bulk of whom live in five very poor countries in Africa -- Mozambique, Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde and Sao Tome e Principe.
As a result, there was a flurry of concern last year when Steven R. Fischer, an American linguist, predicted that "within 300 years Brazil will be speaking" a different language. 
That forecast came on the heels of a government decision to make the study of Spanish obligatory in Brazilian schools to help forge closer ties with the rest of Latin America, which often dismisses Portuguese as nothing more than "Spanish, badly spoken."
"Brazil is surrounded by countries that speak Spanish," Dr. Fischer said in an interview with the newsmagazine Veja. "As commercial exchanges and contacts increase," he said, "there will be much pressure" to abandon Portuguese. 
"Due to the enormous influence of Spanish, it is quite likely that a type of Portunhol will emerge," he added, combining the Portuguese words for Portuguese and Spanish.
In an effort to fortify the language internationally, Brazil has stepped up its financial support for the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Nations, created in 1996. 
The Brazilian government has also pushed for Portuguese to be used as an official language at the United Nations and taken the lead in trying to revive the use of Portuguese in East Timor, where use of the language was harshly restricted during 25 years of Indonesian rule.
But Brazilians should not "feel threatened or go tilting at windmills on some sort of Don Quixote quest that doesn't make sense," Dr. Padilha counseled. "Any language is a living organism that is evolving, and our language, thank God, is one that has always shown a capacity to accept the foreign words it wants and to reject the ones that it doesn't want."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
Bond Market Gives Signals Of an Upturn

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The bond market has not gotten a lot of respect recently as analyst after analyst has concluded that it is being led around by the stock market. When stocks are up, bonds are down, and vice versa.
 But the recent performance of bonds suggests that these investors are already looking ahead to an economic rebound and are not just following the beat of the stock market. 
 Over the last two months, longer-term Treasury securities have been selling off, pushing their yields higher, while shorter-term rates have held relatively stable. This split appears to reflect a measure of confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut rates enough to get the economy on the rebound in the second half of the year. By this argument, the rising yields on longer-term issues simply presage a move toward higher interest rates as the economy picks up steam again. 
Rates on short-term securities, meanwhile, reflect the prospect of further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, whose policy makers are expected to reduce short-term rates again, by a quarter- or a half-point, when they meet today. 
The yield on the Treasury's two-year note was 4.25 percent yesterday, just a bit above its average of 4.23 percent for the last two months. The yield on the 10-year note, though, was at 5.43 percent, up from 4.76 percent on March 22. The spread between the yields on these securities is now 1.18 percentage points, twice what it was in March, and the widest it has been since 1994.
Some analysts conclude that the sell-off among longer-term issues is not as negative as it seems. Bond market investors are merely looking to a brighter economic future.
"They have confidence that it is not going to be a long, drawn-out U-shaped downturn," said Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson Associates, a research firm.
Mr. Crandall and others also spot an underlying concern about inflation, although he does not consider that the main reason longer-term yields have moved higher. There is little concern that prices, which rose 2.9 percent at the consumer level over the last 12 months, will surge, he said.
Still, investors know that once an economic rebound is under way, Fed policy makers will turn their attention to curbing inflation and will probably begin to raise rates sooner than they have during past recoveries.
The view that the economy is headed for recovery in the second half of the year has been helped along by the surprise cut of half a percentage point made by the Fed on April 18, the fourth cut of that size since January, and by reports last week that showed retail sales were stronger than expected in April and consumer confidence rose to a four-month high.
Signs of economic strength remain mixed, however. A report released yesterday showed that industrial production declined 0.3 percent in April and has fallen seven months in a row, a fresh reminder that the economy may not have hit bottom yet.
That report also helped swing investors to bet on a rate cut of half a percentage point today. At the end of last week, given the surprisingly strong economic data, investors saw a 50 percent chance of a cut that big, based on the price and yield of the federal funds futures contract. By yesterday investors saw a 70 percent chance of a half-point cut.
When Fed policy makers announce their decision early this afternoon, investors will be focused on whether the central bank will keep cutting. Policy makers could choose to keep expectations of more rate cuts alive in their announcement. But if they quash this sentiment, both bond and stock investors are likely to be unhappy for a while since they both have become dependent on Fed largess.
Policy makers will signal what they see in the near term.
In a statement after the intermeeting rate cut in April, the Fed noted that consumer spending, while flat, had held up rather well. But policy makers said that "capital investment has continued to soften and the persistent erosion in current and expected profitability, in combination with rising uncertainty about the business outlook, seems poised to dampen capital spending going forward."
"This potential restraint, together with the possible effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk of slower growth abroad, threatens to keep the pace of economic activity unacceptably weak."
Since the release of the retail sales data on Friday, some analysts have argued that the strength in April was overstated. They noted that February and March retail sales were revised downward and that while automotive sales rose last month, unit sales reported by the industry fell. The softer sales, these analysts said, may mean that the economy grew slower than the 2 percent rate reported for the first quarter and that growth may be slow this quarter.
The industrial production report for April also helped underscore the fact that capital spending had not yet turned around.

PERSON: Jason Miller 

HEADLINE: Jason Miller, Playwright and Actor, Dies at 62 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
Jason Miller, the playwright and actor who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for "That Championship Season," died on Sunday in Scranton, Pa. He was 62 and lived in Scranton.
 The cause was a heart attack, said Joseph Brennan, the Lackawanna County coroner. 
 Mr. Miller also won a Tony Award for "That Championship Season" and in the same year was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Father Damien Karras in the horror movie "The Exorcist." 
"That Championship Season," about a reunion of members of a winning basketball team with their coach, set in the Lackawanna Valley, was based on Mr. Miller's experience as a member of the St. Patrick's High School basketball team in the 1950's. The play, directed by A. J. Antoon, who also won a Tony Award for his work, originated at Joseph Papp's Public Theater in 1972 and then moved to the Booth on Broadway. The cast included Charles Durning and Paul Sorvino, who was nominated for a Tony Award for his performance.
Writing in The New York Times, Walter Kerr called "That Championship Season" "rock solid, bitterly funny, painfully shaming." Mr. Miller adapted the play into a film, which he also directed. Released in 1982, it featured Robert Mitchum as the coach, Bruce Dern as the mayor and Stacy Keach, Martin Sheen and Mr. Sorvino as members of the team. The play was revived in 1999 at the Second Stage Theater.
Born in Long Island City, Queens, Mr. Miller grew up in Scranton and graduated from St. Patrick's and the Jesuit-run University of Scranton, where he studied English and philosophy, acted and won first prize in the Jesuit Eastern Play Contest. According to The Associated Press, Mr. Miller later earned a master's degree from Catholic University in Washington.
But in a 1974 interview in The Times, Mr. Miller said he was asked to leave the speech and drama department at Catholic University "for never attending classes, never taking tests and never getting the girls back to their dormitory by 10 o'clock."
At Catholic University, Mr. Miller met his wife, Linda, Jackie Gleason's daughter, with whom he had three children. Mr. Miller had a fourth child with a girlfriend, Susan Bernard.
To earn money, Mr. Miller worked as a welfare investigator, waiter, truck driver and messenger boy. Along the way he wrote plays, among them "The Circus Lady," "Perfect Son" and "Lou Gehrig Did Not Die of Cancer." One of them, "Nobody Hears a Broken Drum," was produced off Broadway in 1970.
Just weeks before "That Championship Season" opened in May 1972 at the Public Theater, Mr. Miller was drawing unemployment checks. Mr. Papp knew Mr. Miller from his performance in "Subject to Fits," a Public Theater production.
After "That Championship Season," Mr. Miller went on to act in other projects, including "The Nickel Ride," a 1973 film, and "The Dain Curse," a 1978 CBS mini-series based on the Dashiell Hammett novel. But he remained best known for his Pulitzer Prize-winning play and for his role in "The Exorcist" as a priest battling a young girl's demons.
Mr. Miller and his family eventually moved from Queens to New Jersey. In the 1974 Times interview, Mr. Miller said he could never leave the New York area for long. "When I was growing up in Scranton, Pa., New York was the capital of my imagination, the El Dorado of my mind," he said. "As soon as I was able, I started visiting whenever I could, coming with a little money and selling my blood on Delancey Street for a few dollars more, to sit and drink in the Cedar Bar, hoping that Jackson Pollock, Allen Ginsberg or Norman Mailer would drop in."
"And now that I've lived there and know all the criticisms, I still have a great affection for the city," he continued. "Its rhythm and vitality suit me. I need this element of risk for survival since perhaps it is the city's dangers that force me to creativity. The point is, I went to New York to do something. And I did it."
Most recently, Mr. Miller was artistic director of the Scranton Public Theater and its summer theater festival. He was to play Oscar Madison in the theater's forthcoming production of "The Odd Couple."
According to the Associated Press, Mr. Miller is survived by three sons: Jason Patric, the actor, and Joshua Miller, both of Los Angeles; and Jordan Miller of New York City. He is also survived by a daughter, Jennifer Miller of Los Angeles. 
The Associated Press reported that Mr. Miller described his own epitaph last year in an interview with Electric City, a free entertainment weekly, for the Pennsylvania Film Festival: "On my tombstone I'll put, 'It's all a paper moon.' All the philosophies and all the -isms and all the religions are contained in that. . . . I'd prefer that when I take the bus to another zone, I go further. I'm not interested in coming back."

HEADLINE: Japan's Travails 

 BODY:
After a decade-long slump, Japan faces nothing but painful choices in trying to revive its economy. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who took office last month, is already encountering resistance to his reform proposals, which range from deregulation and privatization to writing off hundreds of billions of dollars in bad bank loans. But instead of promoting his economic agenda he is pressing to rewrite Japan's postwar Constitution, particularly its provision forever renouncing war as an option for Japan. 
 Japan's economic problems are daunting. Estimates of the extent of so-called "non-performing" loans in the banking system are as high as $800 billion, an amount that could take decades to write off, especially since the value of Japanese assets is dropping in the current cycle of deflation. After years of trying to prime the pump, government debt has also soared. But Mr. Koizumi's plans to retire these debts could cause extensive unemployment and even social unrest. Embarking on a systematic program of inflation, however, runs the risk of hurting retirees and reducing the value of the yen. A collapse of Japan's currency would make its exports cheaper overseas, stirring tensions with the United States on trade. 
 As Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill has observed, there is not much the United States can do for Japan right now other than to support Mr. Koizumi's attempts to reform the economy. Indeed, for years Japan has been urged by outside economists to write off its bad loans, deregulate its business environment and privatize its postal savings system and other government entities. These steps have been resisted because of the power of vested interests within Japan. 
The Japanese Constitution, written by a team working for Gen. Douglas MacArthur during the American occupation, has been a source of bitter feelings within Japan's right wing for many years. But there is scant public sentiment for rearming Japan or discarding the prohibition against war as an instrument of Japanese policy. It thus seemed ill advised for Richard Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, to appear to be encouraging a reappraisal of some constitutional restrictions during his visit to Japan last week.
Mr. Armitage was careful not to endorse a change in the Constitution itself, but he lamented what he called Japan's inability "to participate in collective self-defense" because of its Constitution. The last thing Japan needs to do at a time of grave economic crisis is to redefine its military position in the world.
Mr. Koizumi's motive in raising the defense issue is unclear. He may be trying to shore up support within his party's conservative establishment by adopting a nationalistic posture. He has also announced plans to visit a monument to Japan's war dead, including some convicted and executed as war criminals, later this year. But placating conservatives this way may backfire. The best way for him to build a consensus on the tough economic steps Japan needs to take is to speak honestly about them and explain why they are necessary to return Japan to economic health.

HEADLINE: Testimony Begins in Hearing on California Natural Gas Pricing 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14 

 BODY:
In evaluating whether the El Paso Corporation artificially drove up natural gas prices in California -- and thus the cost of power -- a key factor will be determining whether pipeline constraints created a Southern California gas market that is separate from the rest of the state, an administrative law judge said today.
 The judge, Curtis L. Wagner Jr., who is expected to hear testimony in the case all week at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission here, said that if the market consisted only of Southern California, then El Paso had a "rather high level" of concentration in that market. 
 The California Public Utilities Commission and Southern California Edison, one of the state's struggling utilities, contend that El Paso, one of the nation's largest energy concerns, sought to profit by curtailing the flow of gas to California and thus worsened the state's energy crisis. Edison contends that an El Paso subsidiary, El Paso Merchant Energy, which controls about 40 percent of the capacity to California on a pipeline owned by a sister company, withheld gas shipments last year to limit storage for winter, helping cause prices to soar to five times those in other parts of the nation. 
El Paso officials say that is not true and that they will argue this week that other factors -- including soaring demand by electric-power generators, shortages of hydroelectric power, the poor credit standing of the state's utilities and California's failure to build more gas pipelines in recent years -- are the cause. They also said that Edison's allegations were misleading because much of the pipeline capacity El Paso Merchant controls cannot be easily used or transferred to other gas shippers.
Judge Wagner, the F.E.R.C. chief administrative law judge, will issue a decision by June 30. His findings will be presented to the agency's commissioners, who will decide the case. 
The stakes are huge for everyone involved. California officials are seeking to show that market manipulation has played at least some role in the state's power crisis, while El Paso, which has emerged as one of the most dominant of the new breed of energy companies, is seeking to refute allegations that its conduct has cost at least $3.7 billion.
Last week, an economist with the F.E.R.C., Jonathan D. Ogur, concluded in written testimony that "it is likely that El Paso Corporation had and exercised market power," assuming certain conditions were present, including that pipeline constraints created a separate gas market in Southern California. El Paso Merchant lawyers disagree, arguing that Southern California is not a separate gas market. 
During the proceedings today, a lawyer for El Paso Merchant, William S. Scherman, sought to show that the California utilities commission had relied too heavily on research paid for by Edison, which he said "has directed the prosecution of this case." Questioning a witness from the commission, Mr. Scherman asked whether it "creates the appearance of impropriety" to have a utility providing "a gift" to a state agency that so closely regulates it.
Harvey Morris, a lawyer for the utilities commission, objected to the questions by Mr. Scherman, and the objections were sustained by Judge Wagner. California officials have said that because of their limited resources -- in part because of so much litigation stemming from the energy crisis -- they have had to rely on Edison to provide much of the evidence against El Paso.

HEADLINE: Production At Factories Decreases For 7th Month 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14 

 BODY:
Industrial production fell in April for a seventh consecutive month, the longest string of declines since 1982.
 Production at factories, mines and utilities declined 0.3 percent last month, after falling 0.1 percent in March, the Federal Reserve said. Manufacturing of business equipment, appliances and metals all dropped in April. 
 The statistics suggest "there is little question that the Fed will look to help out" at its policy meeting on Tuesday, said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa. The Fed has reduced its benchmark overnight bank lending rate four times this year. The rate, now at 4.5 percent, is the lowest in six years.
An economic slowdown this year has been most evident in manufacturing, where inventories piled up as consumer and business spending stalled. The inventory-to-sales ratio, a gauge of how long stockpiles stay on shelves at the current sales pace, was 1.37 months in March, figures from the Commerce Department showed today. That matched February's ratio, which was the highest since January 1999. Business sales declined 0.3 percent in March.
Businesses have been selling goods from existing stockpiles instead of ordering from factories. "While firms are doing the best they can to reduce the overhang, there is still more to be done," Mr. Naroff said.
The string of declines in industrial production is the longest since March-December 1982. The economy was in recession from July 1981 to November 1982, according to statistics from the National Bureau of Economic Research.
The report today also showed that factories, mines and utilities operated at 78.5 percent of capacity last month, the lowest rate since the end of the last recession in 1991.
Factories alone reported production dropped 0.3 percent last month, after decreasing 0.2 percent in March. The economy grew at a 1.5 percent annual rate from October to March, the slowest since a 1.1 percent increase in the first half of 1995.
Electric and gas utility production fell 1 percent last month, after rising 0.4 percent the previous month. Mine production and oil and gas drilling increased 0.6 percent last month, after a rise of 1.1 percent the previous month.
The Fed's statistics showed production of business equipment declined 1.1 percent in April, after rising 0.5 percent the previous month. Production of information processing equipment, a gauge of capital spending, fell 1.9 percent in April, after rising 0.3 percent in March.
Motor vehicles and parts production was unchanged in April, after rising 7.3 percent in March. Ford Motor produced 15 percent fewer cars and light trucks in North America in the first quarter, and reduced its production plans for the second quarter.

HEADLINE: A Pre-emptive Strike On Global Warming; 
Many Companies Cut Gas Emissions To Head Off Tougher Regulations

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER and ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Despite the Bush administration's decision to back away from regulating emissions of global- warming gases, many multinational companies plan to continue reducing such emissions because they face strong pressure to do so in Europe and Japan, fear rising energy costs or want to promote their products as being friendly to the environment.
 Some of the executives with plans to reduce emissions say they are trying to be good corporate citizens. But companies also cite a wide range of business reasons that have little to do either with the environment or with what happens in Washington. 
 And even as they move ahead on their own, some top officials at these companies say that while voluntary action is the right approach in the short run, at some point they expect the United States and others to adopt binding restrictions on the gases.
"Eventually, you're going to have to have a hard cap of some kind," said E. Linn Draper Jr., chairman and chief executive of American Electric Power, which owns coal-fired power plants across the Midwest and builds power projects overseas. 
Because of the many steps being taken, emissions of global-warming gases by American industry are in fact falling, and at a surprising rate. The big increases these days come more from decisions made by consumers than corporations, as emissions from autos and homes continue to rise with people driving farther each year, buying less-fuel-efficient vehicles and building ever-larger houses with more appliances.
The shift in thinking at big companies is so marked that some executives who once led the fight against restrictions on the heat-trapping gases are now advocating action. Peter J. Pestillo, chairman and chief executive of the Visteon Corporation, one of the world's largest auto parts makers, said many companies had discovered that efforts to address climate and other environmental matters not only had marketing value but could often be addressed at a modest cost, provided the problems were identified early in the planning of each new project.
"People aren't debating global warming any more," Mr. Pestillo said. "It is more to take a high ground where you will be one day, rather than be driven to it."
Mr. Pestillo's views are significant because as a top executive at Ford in the 1990's, he used to coordinate the auto industry's opposition to many environmental rules.
In industry after industry, steps like these are being taken that have the effect of reducing global-warming emissions:
*Every large automaker is investing heavily in new engine technologies to improve fuel economy, partly because the burning of gasoline in cars and trucks is one of the largest and fastest-growing sources of carbon dioxide, the main global-warming gas, and because gasoline prices are rising and regulators in Europe and Japan are demanding major improvements in fuel economy.
*European-based oil giants like Shell and BP are taking steps to end the burning off of natural gas at oil wells -- both to mollify environmentalists in their home markets and in hopes of selling the gas and gaining a competitive advantage by acquiring a greener image. American producers like Exxon Mobil are starting to move in the same direction.
*Companies like DuPont are lowering their output of certain chemicals that contribute to global warming, an action begun years ago because some of the same chemicals damage the ozone layer.
*Some big manufacturers like Alcoa, which release other heat-trapping gases, have been shifting to less polluting methods, partly to address the climate issue but also because cost-effective improvements in industrial processes reduce heat-trapping emissions.
*Electric utilities are trying to reduce the amount of energy wasted by their power plants, so they can burn less fuel as well as head off government regulations.
The corporate moves to reduce emissions of global-warming gases add up, some environmental groups say, to a significant shift in approach.
"Many companies figured out in the 1990's that if an environmental issue reaches a certain level of public consciousness and seriousness, it's better to be proactive than reactive," said Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, a private Washington group that has been lobbying to salvage the Kyoto Protocol, the proposed climate agreement that was rejected by President Bush two months ago. "You're then seen as a leader and get to be at the table framing all the rules." 
But Mr. Clapp and many other environmental campaigners maintain that only government action to restrict warming gases will ultimately be sufficient to spur adequate changes.
Some business executives oppose binding restrictions on greenhouse gases but say that government must still play a role by establishing rules and methods -- for example, a trading arrangement for credits earned by cutting emissions. This is what they are seeking from the Bush administration, which has been hearing from scientists, economists and industries as it ponders a counterproposal to the Kyoto agreement.
"There can't be an entirely free-market approach," said Norine Kennedy, vice president for environmental affairs of the United States Council for International Business, which represents about 300 American companies doing business overseas.
White House officials, for the moment, decline to say how the administration will deal with the contentious issue. "The president has pledged to review the full range of options" on dealing with climate change, a White House spokesman, Ken Lisaius, said. "He will be continuing to reach out to a wide range of groups and soliciting a diversity of views on the matter."
Yet many corporations say that by taking some voluntary steps now, they hope to head off regulations that could be much more stringent. Dennis Minano, vice president for energy and the environment at General Motors, said that even as G.M. tried to improve fuel economy, it continued to oppose all federal fuel-economy standards. The company welcomed Mr. Bush's decision to withdraw American support for the Kyoto agreement, which would require industrial nations to reduce emissions of the warming gases.
Overall emissions of global-warming gases in the United States climbed 0.9 percent in 1999 compared with 1998, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Industrial emissions in fact fell that year, by 2.1 percent. Commercial emissions -- mainly from electric utilities that supply stores and other businesses -- rose 1.9 percent. But residential emissions were up 2.9 percent, also reflecting the increased use of electric power. Global-warming emissions from transportation, primarily from the burning of gasoline in automobiles and diesel fuel in trucks, grew 3.4 percent in 1999. 
Auto executives are working on their own to reduce emissions amid popular dismay in Japan and particularly in Europe, where there has been much more public interest than in this country on global warming. Japanese regulators have ordered automakers to improve average gas mileage to 35.5 miles a gallon in 2010, from 30.3 now. Automakers with operations in Europe, including Ford and G.M., have reluctantly agreed to increase fuel economy there to 41 miles a gallon from 33 miles now.
Both of these standards go well beyond those now in the United States, which require new cars to average 27.5 miles a gallon and light trucks, like pickups and sport utility vehicles, to achieve 20.7 miles.
Some American auto executives say they are coming under pressure from European managers within their companies who want them to tone down their criticism of the Kyoto agreement to avoid antagonizing prospective buyers there.
Detroit's leading automakers -- DaimlerChrysler, in addition to G.M. and Ford -- have each announced plans to increase the gas mileage of light trucks, especially sport utility vehicles, but oppose any toughening of federal standards.
Big gains in fuel economy are possible in Europe because most drivers there prefer smaller vehicles and because of the growing use in cars of diesel engines, which will be virtually banned in the United States in 2004 by air pollution rules. In Japan, vehicles increasingly use an engine valve technology that improves fuel efficiency but tends to restrict acceleration. 
Toyota, which has factories in Asia, Europe and North America, plans to reduce the energy needed to manufacture a vehicle 15 percent by 2005, after years in which energy use has been flat. Toyota has already taken lots of little steps, like turning off the lights in factories between shifts, and installing computer-controlled thermostats throughout the plants to fine-tune the level of air-conditioning needed. 
The complex mixture of corporate motives is illustrated by the pledge of Royal Dutch/Shell to stop burning off natural gas at oil fields by 2008. Natural gas often comes out of the ground with oil, but it is expensive to build pipelines or construct factories to liquefy and ship it.
Shell is working harder to sell the gas now anyway. Expecting industrial nations to impose some kind of restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, Shell has modified its accounting of the costs and benefits of future projects in these countries. In deciding which projects to carry forward, the company has begun including a $5 penalty for each ton of carbon dioxide that will be emitted in these countries from 2005 to 2009, and a $20-a-ton penalty thereafter.
Including this accounting device will give the decision-making process a bias toward more efficient projects, Shell says. 
The split among electric power producers, which are responsible for about a third of the country's carbon dioxide emissions, tends to reflect their views of how long they will be allowed to operate without further restrictions. Some companies that rely mainly on coal, the fuel that produces the most carbon dioxide, have expressed doubt that global warming is a problem. But despite that, a few of these companies have joined with government agencies in programs aimed at voluntarily reducing greenhouse gas releases.
Other utilities, including American Electric Power, have accepted the idea that government limits on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are inevitable.
It is the seeming inevitability of such emissions limits that prompted some utilities to support legislation cutting carbon dioxide emissions from power plants as part of a broader cleanup of factory pollution. This idea gained momentum when Mr. Bush, as a presidential candidate, pledged that he would seek mandatory cuts in carbon dioxide from the plants. But the momentum died in March, when Mr. Bush abandoned that pledge and rejected the Kyoto accord.
Some of the same utilities are lobbying the White House to come up with a concrete plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions that can be presented as an alternative to the Kyoto agreement. Executives say their goal is to save money in the long term by establishing clear rules early.
In heavy manufacturing, one leader in addressing climate change has been Dupont, which by last year had reduced emissions of greenhouse gases from its factories worldwide more than 50 percent below levels of 1990. This came mainly through changing the way that DuPont makes nylon, a process that once produced enormous emissions of nitrous oxide -- a gas that, molecule for molecule, is 300 times as potent as carbon dioxide in trapping heat in the atmosphere. By 2010, company officials say, their goal is to reduce greenhouse gas releases to 65 percent below 1990 levels.
Executives in other businesses also say there is the potential for major improvements, not just slow progress. The aluminum industry is testing new smelting processes that if widely adopted, could greatly cut releases of both carbon dioxide and perfluorocarbons, another group of potent warming gases.
Alcoa, which until recently was run by Paul H. O'Neill, now secretary of the Treasury, announced plans last month to reduce its greenhouse emissions by 2010 to levels 25 percent below those in 1990. If its tests of a new smelting method succeed, the company said, it could double that, achieving a 50 percent cut within a decade.
Many power company officials say they are also ready to help pay farmers, here and abroad, to sop up carbon dioxide, which would be far cheaper than upgrading existing power plants to produce less greenhouse pollution. G.M. is helping the Nature Conservancy buy 30,000 acres of Atlantic coastal rain forest in Brazil, which are to be preserved to absorb carbon dioxide and protect wildlife.
Thomas C. Jorling, vice president for environmental affairs of the International Paper Company, said government officials had identified 65 million acres of degraded pasture or cropland that could be planted with trees, and in so doing pull millions of tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. The company is in discussions with manufacturers that are big emitters of greenhouse gases over ways to share the costs, and greenhouse credits, of such an effort.
But first the government must establish the rules to ensure the fairness and effectiveness of this kind of deal, he said. "Bush can still come out of this as a very positive force," Mr. Jorling said.

HEADLINE: For First Time, Nuclear Families Drop Below 25% of Households 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14 

 BODY:
For the first time, less than a quarter of the households in the United States are made up of married couples with their children, new census data show. 
 That results from a number of factors, like many men and women delaying both marriage and having children, more couples living longer after their adult children leave home and the number of single-parent families growing much faster than the number of married couples. 
 Indeed, the number of families headed by women who have children, which are typically poorer than two-parent families, grew nearly five times faster in the 1990's than the number of married couples with children, a trend that some family experts and demographers described today as disturbing. 
The new data offer the 2000 census' first glimpse into the shifting and complicated makeup of American families and carry wide-ranging implications that policy makers and politicians are already struggling to address. 
With more communities having fewer households with children, public schools often face an increasingly difficult time gathering support for renovating aging buildings and investing in education over all. Voters in Cleveland last week approved $380 million in levies to fix city schools, but only after two months of exhaustive lobbying by civic leaders. 
"This may have something to do with why our education system is not up to snuff," said Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "Oftentimes, those parents who still are invested in the schools don't have the money or influence to change things." 
Demographers expressed surprise that the number of unmarried couples in the United States nearly doubled in the 1990's, to 5.5 million couples from 3.2 million in 1990. Some of those couples have children. 
Many conservative groups point to the increase as well as the statistics on single-parent households as troubling indicators of deeper societal problems. 
"This data shows we need to regain the importance of marriage as a social institution," said Bridget Maher, a marriage and family policy analyst at the conservative Family Research Council. "People are disregarding the importance of marriage and the importance of having a mother and father who are married." 
Ms. Maher and other conservatives point to the findings as justification for the enactment of policies that they say would strengthen the family, like eliminating the so-called marriage penalty in the tax code. 
The decades-long decline in the overall number of American households with children slowed during the 1990's as two of the most troubling trends -- divorce and out-of-wedlock births -- moderated, demographers said. 
But even with that slowdown, the percentage of married-couple households with children under 18 has declined to 23.5 percent of all households in 2000 from 25.6 percent in 1990, and from 45 percent in 1960, said Martin O'Connell, chief of the Census Bureau's fertility and family statistics branch. The number of Americans living alone, 26 percent of all households, surpassed, for the first time, the number of married-couple households with children.
William H. Frey, a demographer at the University of Michigan, said, "Being married is great, but being married with kids is tougher in today's society with spouses in different jobs and expensive day care and schools."
The number of married-couple families with children grew by just under 6 percent in the 1990's. In contrast, households with children headed by single mothers, which account for nearly 7 percent of all households, increased by 25 percent in the 1990's. 
The new census data paint a more detailed picture of the American family in other ways. 
Unmarried couples represent 9 percent of all unions, up from 6 percent a decade ago.
"It's certainly consistent with what we've all been noting, the growth in cohabitation in this country, but it also tells us how complex American families are becoming," said Freya L. Sonenstein, director of population studies at the Urban Institute in Washington and a visiting fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. 
The number of nonfamily households, which consist of people living alone or with people who are not related, make up about one-third of all households. They grew at twice the rate of family households in the 1990's. 
Demographers pointed to several factors to explain the figures. People are marrying later, if they marry at all. The median age of the first marriage for men has increased to 27 years old from 22 in 1960; for women, it has increased to 25 years old from 20 in 1960, said Campbell Gibson, a Census Bureau demographic adviser. 
The booming economy has allowed more younger people to leave home and live on their own. Divorce, while leveling off, has left many middle-age people living alone -- at least temporarily. Advances in medicine and bulging stock portfolios have permitted many elderly people to live independently longer. 
"It's easier for a young person to start out on his own or live in a group home," said Mr. O'Connell. "And the elderly population is healthier and economically better off." 
Census officials said the median age of the country's population increased to 35.3 years old, the highest it has ever been. This reflects the influence of the so-called baby boom generation, born between 1946 and 1964. The most rapid increase in size of any age group was the 49 percent jump in the population 45-to-54 years old. 
While an influx of immigrants and other foreign-born residents with larger, younger families held down this aging indicator, several other statistics underscore the demographic and marketing power the baby boomers wield as they enter their peak earning years. For example, the share of owner-occupied housing increased to 66 percent in 2000 compared with 64 percent in 1990.
"Baby boomers are driving the increase in owner-occupied housing," said Jeffrey S. Passel, a demographer at the Urban Institute, a social policy research organization. "Ten years from now, they will be pushing pre-retirement homes, and 20 years from now they will cause the Social Security crisis." 
The new census data also show that while there are still about 5 million more women than men in the United States, men are narrowing the gap partly because of improved medicine and greater health awareness by men, but also because of slightly higher rates of lung-related deaths among women, primarily due to increased smoking among them, demographers said. 
The number of men for every 100 women increased to 96.3 in 2000 from 95.1 in 1990, largely because men are closing the life-expectancy gap with women. As of 1998, the latest figures available from the National Center for Health Statistics, women on average live 79.5 years, up from 78.8 years in 1990.
Men can expect to live 73.8 years, up from 71.8 years in 1990, Mr. Gibson said. 
Within the refined demographic profile, there were also intriguing trends among specific racial groups. For instance, the overall Asian population in the United States grew by 48 percent in the 1990's, but the number of Chinese, Indians and Vietnamese doubled or nearly doubled in the decade.

 A softer economy and sharply lower revenues from the capital gains tax led Gov. 
Gray Davis to issue a revised budget plan that cuts almost $3.2 billion in new programs and proposed spending increases from the version he presented in January. The $101 billion proposal assumes that the close to $7 billion that the state has spent buying electricity will be repaid through a bond issue by August, and Mr. Davis sought to shelter his favored programs in education and public safety.

HEADLINE: Europe Elbows Wall St. for Share of China Offering 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 14 

 BODY:
For American investment banks in China, politics has often been a handmaiden to business, enabling the more savvy firms to elbow aside their rivals with comparable credentials for deals.
 Now, with the debut of a potential $1.5 billion bond offering by China, the Americans have been given a taste of their own tactics. And politics, far from being subordinate, may have played a decisive role. 
 On Thursday, the Chinese government announced that three top United States firms -- Goldman, Sachs; J. P. Morgan Chase; and Morgan Stanley -- would handle its first overseas bond deal since late 1998. 
The next day, three European banks -- Barclays Capital, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank -- said they would handle the portion of the offering denominated in euros.
What happened in the interim, according to several bankers involved in the deal, was an intense campaign by the governments of France and Germany to press China to give their banks part of the business.
The French ambassador to China, Pierre Morel, sent a letter to the Chinese finance minister, Xiang Huaicheng, asking him to look favorably on Paribas as a gesture to European-Chinese ties. Bankers involved in the deal said the German Embassy sent the ministry a similar letter.
Such lobbying by governments is not uncommon before the awarding of these fiercely competitive assignments. But bankers and lawyers here said it was highly unusual to do so after the Chinese government had announced its decision. And it was even more unusual for China to capitulate.
"Normally, you would expect China to say to the losers, 'Don't worry, we'll take care of you the next time around,' " said Gordon G. Chang, a former partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in Beijing.
Mr. Chang, who just completed a book on the Chinese economy, said Beijing might have relented because it did not want to alienate European banks as its appetite for foreign capital is increasing.
"China has less borrowing capacity than many people think; it is not as creditworthy as many people think," Mr. Chang said. "Perhaps they think they'll really need the Europeans down the road."
That is certainly not the image China sought to project as it began promoting the offering today. At a presentation here for fund managers, the vice minister of finance, Jin Liqun, noted that China had a fast-growing economy, $176 billion in foreign reserves and a relatively low level of public debt.
"We don't need to borrow," Mr. Jin said, according to investors who attended the closed session. "We are here because we see issuing bonds as the best way to reach out to the world economy."
Mr. Jin was not asked about the expanded list of underwriters. The Chinese government did not even formally acknowledge it, leaving the European firms to announce that they had been added to the list.
Some bankers involved in the deal said the Chinese government was merely making good on an oral commitment to the European banks two years ago that it would award them the euro-denominated portion of the offering. Others said such commitments count for little in the murky world of Chinese business.
European banks have used politics before to even the score in China. Last fall, UBS Warburg, the Swiss bank, was added to a list of finalists for the stock offering of China Telecom after its executives appealed to senior leaders in Beijing (it did not win the deal).
This time, some bankers said they believed that the Europeans had exploited the recent tension between the United States and China in grabbing the assignment. Other experts said it was natural, during a chilly period, that China would reduce its reliance on American companies.
"The Chinese are sensitive to the fact that there is still a U.S. reconnaissance plane sitting on Hainan Island and a vote on trade relations coming up in the Senate," said T. L. Tsim, an independent analyst.
It was not the first time that politics had affected a Chinese debt offering. Beijing first contemplated mounting this deal in early 1999, not long after it completed its first offering of $1 billion in bonds. But it held off after NATO bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
For the American firms, it is a bitter pill. Goldman , which has a lead role among the firms, underwrote China's first bond offering, as well as the first stock offering of a Chinese state-owned company, China Mobile, in 1997. It also handled the offering of PetroChina, the flagship state oil company, which was dogged by charges of human-rights abuses.
A spokesman at Goldman declined to comment. The firm's vice chairman for Asia, Carlos A. Cordeiro, introduced Mr. Jin at the presentation.
Goldman and its American colleagues can take solace from the fact that the dollar-denominated portion of the offering is likely to be twice the size of the euro-denominated portion.
And as Mr. Chang put it, "The fact that China originally awarded it to three American firms really shows their dominance in the debt market."

HEADLINE: Ranks of the Wealthy Grow Worldwide 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The world's rich grew richer last year, except in Asia and Africa, a study released yesterday found.
 The study reported nearly 7.2 million people had at least $1 million in investable assets in 2000, an increase of 180,000 from 1999. 
Their total wealth was estimated at $27 trillion, up 6 percent from $25.5 trillion the previous year. 
 The survey looked at people it called high net worth individuals, who had cash, stocks and other assets worth at least $1 million. Most were beyond what people think of as millionaires since the wealth figure did not include their real estate holdings and other nonliquid assets.
In the United States and Canada, the number of people with high net worths rose 2.4 percent, to 2.54 million, and their wealth increased 9 percent, to $8.8 trillion.
The growth in both the number of wealthy and their holdings would have been even greater last year had stock markets around the world not fallen substantially after the first quarter. In 1999, when the stock market rose strongly, the assets of the world's wealthiest people grew 18 percent.
The only regions that did not join in the boom last year were Africa, where commodity prices have been depressed, and Asia, where performance was dampened by weak economic growth in Japan.
The annual study, the fifth in a series, was prepared by Merrill Lynch & Company and Cap Gemini Ernst & Young consultants.
At 7.2 million, the world's wealthiest people represent just a fraction of the world's population of 6.1 billion.

HEADLINE: North Korea May Get Help Under Plan By Europeans 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 14 

 BODY:
The European Union announced today that it would open diplomatic relations with North Korea to help Pyongyang solve its food and health crisis. 
 The European group also said it planned to support peace efforts between the two Koreas, which never signed a treaty after their war ended in a highly armed truce in July 1953. 
 In a brief statement in Brussels, the commission said it hoped that the move would "facilitate the European Community's efforts in support of reconciliation in the Korean Peninsula and, in particular, in support of economic reform and easing of the acute food and health problems" in the North. But the statement gave no details on when and how ties would be opened. 
In Seoul, South Korea's Foreign Ministry hailed the move to open relations. Most members of the union have relations, with the exception of Ireland and France. Last week, France said it would not rush to embrace Pyongyang until the North improved its records on arms proliferation and human rights.
The European Union, which sent a delegation to Pyongyang this month, had already announced its intentions to expand its role in the region. That decision was announced shortly after the Bush administration said it was delaying its own talks with North Korea and ordering a policy review on resuming discussions. 
At the time, Europe's effort to reach out was largely seen as a rebuke to Washington. But since then, both sides have said that they agree on European initiatives.
Last week, Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage raised hopes that the United States would soon resume talks with North Korea when he said that the policy review was nearly complete and that he suspected that discussions would begin again "in the near future." 
In Washington today, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell refused to criticize Europe's decision to establish relations. "That's a choice for the E.U. to make," Secretary Powell said in an interview on CNN. "I don't have anything to say about it." 
General Powell did say he had been receiving regular reports from his European colleagues.
President Bush made clear in March that he was uncomfortable with continuing the fast-moving talks on the North Korean missile systems that the Clinton administration had pushed. When President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea visited the White House in March, Mr. Bush said he did not trust North Korea.
Relations between the two Koreas warmed significantly after a historic summit meeting between their leaders in Pyongyang in June. But contacts stalled after Mr. Bush took a more hawkish stand on regional security than President Bill Clinton.
In recent days, North Korea has lashed out at South Korea and the United States, saying Washington's plans for a missile system would bring only death and destruction. Earlier at talks with the European delegation, Kim Jong Il, promised that his nation would keep a moratorium on its missile tests until at least 2003.
