HEADLINE: Report Urges Japan to Raise Taxes

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 16

 BODY:
Underscoring the effects of a rapidly aging population, low birthrates and skyrocketing fiscal deficits in Japan, the prime minister's tax advisory council released a report on Friday that strongly suggested tax increases are necessary if the country is to avoid financial disaster.
The Tax Commission recommended lowering the minimum income level at which taxes begin, raising sales taxes and forcing even the 60 percent of Japanese corporations that report losses to pay local taxes based on their size rather than their profitability. 
 It noted that corporate tax rates have fallen to levels comparable to those in the United States and that Japan's income tax revenue is among the lowest in major industrialized countries. At 5 percent, Japan's sales tax is also one of the lowest among its economic peers, the report said.
The report poses a problem for the Japanese government, which has struggled for the last decade to get the economy back on its feet after the burst of the asset bubble that marked Japan's heady ascent in the 1980's.
"We think Japan faces a policy bind -- no matter what you do, you wind up creating problems in other areas," Vincent J. Truglia, co-head of sovereign risk at Moody's Investors Service, the credit ratings agency, told Bloomberg News on Friday. Moody's is considering another downgrade of Japan's credit rating.
The report is not binding. But the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's tax panel, which makes policy, has in the past made its revisions to the tax code in line with the Tax Commission's reports.
The implications of the report are sobering. Higher individual taxes would hurt spending, which accounts for some 60 percent of economic activity here at a time when policy makers are heavily relying on consumption to fuel Japan's sputtering economic recovery.
That will no doubt come under discussion on Monday when the Bank of Japan's policy board meets. Economists have placed even odds that the board will vote to increase interest rates, abandoning its policy of maintaining rates at virtually zero.
But the prospect of higher taxes combined with rising interest rates would most likely choke whatever economic revival is under way. An increase in the consumption tax a few years ago slammed the brakes on what was shaping up as a mild economic recovery, a memory that remains especially painful for the Liberal Democratic Party.
In fact, the report is somewhat embarrassing for the party, which criticized the opposition Democratic Party for suggesting during parliamentary elections last month that taxes must rise.
The report's recommendations stand in stark contrast to steps other countries are taking to reduce the tax burdens on their citizens.
The same day that the Tax Commission released its report, Germany enacted a package of tax reforms intended to enhance the competitiveness of its industries.
That package is likely to push Germany's neighbors to adopt more liberal tax policies, which would leave Japan to buck the trend alone among the major industrialized nations.
But Japan's problems, while not singular, are more exacerbated than those of its biggest trading partners. The Japanese population is aging far more rapidly and its birthrate falling more rapidly than in any other country, and its efforts to spend its way out of a decadelong economic downturn, rather than adopting more painful structural remedies, has left it with the highest deficit of any industrialized country.
Japan's tax revenue covers less than half its expenditures, and thus the Organization for Economic Development estimates that Japan's debts will exceed its gross domestic product by almost 18 percent this year. In contrast, Germany's debt stands at 63 percent of gross domestic product and the United States' at 51.7 percent.

Ebony Ends Publication in South Africa

BYLINE: By HENRI E. CAUVIN 

DATELINE: DURBAN, South Africa, July 16

 BODY:
The South African edition of Ebony magazine, introduced nearly five years ago in the afterglow of the country's triumph over apartheid, has shut down after failing to find profits or many readers.
On newsstands around the country, a fewleft-over copies of last month's issue are all that remains of Ebony South Africa. 
 Leaping aboard the post-apartheid bandwagon, Ebony's American publisher, Johnson Publishing, had hoped to bring an institution of African-American culture to the coffee tables of South Africa, a country with enormous economic promise but still wrestling with the legacy of white domination and the struggle for black equality.
But prosperity has been slower than expected in reaching the black majority. For Ebony South Africa, that meant a retail market with still too little interest in advertising to black consumers and a magazine industry with little room for a publication celebrating a level of success that few black people here can yet conceive, let alone achieve.
In South Africa, blacks number about 34.6 million out of a total population of 44.7 million, according to the University of South Africa's mid-year estimate. But millions of them are unemployed and the majority of them are poor, a problem that has worsened in recent years as job losses in government and industry have increased.
Circulation peaked at 23,880 during the first half of 1999 before dropping to 22,477 during the second half of the year, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations South Africa.
Even at its highest circulation, the magazine never pulled in enough advertising, said Christopher D. Benson, a vice president of Johnson Publishing.
"We didn't see that it was going to improve, and we just had to make the hard decision," Mr. Benson said in a telephone interview from Chicago. "I think it's a function of the commitment that we had to the project that we held on as long as we did in the face of mounting losses."
Moreover, according to some industry observers here, the magazine never quite found the necessary balance of American and African content.
"What they were turning out was more of an American Ebony with a touch of South Africa rather than a South African Ebony with a touch of America," said Fraser Mtshali, the editor in chief of Bona. Based in Durban, Bona is aimed at black readers and is the nation's best-selling lifestyle magazine. "They were seeing South Africa through American eyes."
Ebony South Africa's final cover story, on the soccer star Lucas Radebe, was a revealing example, Mr. Mtshali said. Despite his popularity, Mr. Radebe is old news, Mr. Mtshali said. Without some tantalizing new tale about the athlete, there was little to attract the average South African reader, he said.
Inside the last issue of Ebony South Africa were stories about the American singer Toni Braxton, the American jazz great Louis Armstrong and American athletes running into trouble with the law. There was also a feature on Nelson Mandela and his wife, short profiles of South African musical greats and a mix of health and romance items.
Mr. Benson, the Johnson Publishing executive, said Ebony South Africa, which had a local staff directed by an American editor and took some of its articles from the American edition, tried to capture the interests and nuances of the South African audience. "We were constantly evaluating it, through readership surveys, to find out what readers were looking for," he said. "I think the magazine reflected that."
Bona, which is published in English as well as in three indigenous languages, is looking for the same successful, free-spending black people in their late 20's and early 30's that Ebony South Africa was aimed at. But Mr. Mtshali said his magazine also tried to embrace younger and older readers as well.
The cover of the July issue of Bona advertises stories on "Soccer's New Heroes," a "Wake-up Call From God" for a South African singer and a "Baby That Took Five Years to Be Born."
"Our market is broader," Mr. Mtshali said. "We're more family oriented." And yet, even Bona, which has been around for more than four decades, has watched its circulation fall to just under 178,000 during the second half of last year, compared with 271,230 four years earlier.
With the economy growing only modestly here, the media sector is struggling to hold onto what share of the market it already has.
Tribute, a glossy that aims for the same affluent audience that Ebony South Africa was going for, has seen its circulation drop from just over 16,000 in 1994 to slightly more than 10,000 during the second half of last year.
"I don't think there's been the kind of black aspirational success that had been hoped, and that has to have had an effect on publishing," said Kerry Swift, who in the late 1970's was an executive editor of Drum, a magazine that made its name as the literary conscience of the struggle against apartheid. Subsequently, Drum became a more conventional life style magazine that now has a weekly circulation of about 137,000 -- down several thousand from its heyday 20 years ago.
"The market really hurts," said Mr. Swift, who is now a director for Core Media Holdings, a South African company that publishes the local editions of publications like PC, an American computer magazine owned by Ziff-Davis. "But I think there are much deeper cultural factors at work, too."

HEADLINE: Money, Jobs, Big Cars: How's an Irishman to Cope?

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: DUBLIN

 BODY:
Ireland's economy has been growing faster than any other in the Western world, and the country whose master playwright, Sean O'Casey, once said, "I'd rather be inspired by idleness than bullied by 'busyness' " now has some of the hardest-working citizens in Europe.
For the first time in its history, Ireland has a problem with too much money, not too little -- with too few people living here, not too many. 
 The subject of what to keep, what to shed and what to adapt for modern times is on lots of Irish minds as the country -- a proven force in developing sustaining myths to overcome failure, poverty and melancholy -- turns to coping with the novelty of prosperity.
"You have tourists giving out about us that we've lost our courtesy, that we don't have time to talk to one another anymore, that our Irish identity is slipping away," said Maureen Gaffney, head of The National Economic and Social Forum, a consultative group partly funded by the government. "We're very disturbed by that, and I'm not a Cassandra, but I think we have the vibrancy here to handle it."
From the cranes that lumber across the Dublin skyline to the traffic jams that pile up along the Liffey as early as 6:30 a.m., progress is intruding. With so many opportunities at home, Ireland's young professionals no longer leave and those that did a generation ago have now come back. But one disruptive consequence of this happy turnaround is a 20 percent-a-year spiral in the cost of housing that is pricing the middle class out of city living.
The look of new Dublin pubs seems to have more to do with the East Coast of the United States than the West Coast of Ireland. Typifying the trend, a former flower stand just off the landmark Ha'penny Bridge has been turned into a minimalist cafe called Pravda with Cyrillic lettering design features and a menu featuring Thai wraps, tortillas and spicy chicken wings.
There are 20,000 job openings, and an estimated 200,000 more coming up in the next five years that will have to be filled by foreigners. Executives are often out of town on recruitment trips, and businesses have dropped their earlier insistence that applicants speak English.
Yet in a development that is bringing shame to Ireland, the country that sent millions of people abroad as poor immigrants is proving inhospitable to needy outsiders who are arriving here. Despite the jobs in Dublin going wanting, asylum seekers, who now number 1,000 a month, are being dispersed around the country and barred from working. "We thrived on tales of the Boston Brahmins and 'No Irish need apply,' " said Maurice Hayes, a member of the Irish Senate and chairman of The Ireland Funds, the country's largest charity. "Now we think the only immigrants we want are people who otherwise would have gone directly to Silicon Valley."
Car sales are up 40 percent this year over 1999, and traffic congestion projected for the year 2010 has already arrived, but highway construction to accommodate all the new vehicles lags. Rural areas even 40 miles out of Dublin are becoming bedroom communities, with country lanes pressed into service to handle the new commuting class. "Nobody thought ahead about this, and you can't just go out and buy a mile of road down at Woolworth's," said Colm McCarthy of DKM Economic Consultants Ltd.
Public services in particular are suffering from underfunding and a lack of planning, and their downtroddenness stands out starkly against the shine and efficiency of the booming private sector. Last year, nurses went on strike for higher wages.
"Our nurses were working so hard they were really and truly bent," said Mary Tynan, 48, the head emergency room nurse at Beaumont Hospital. Describing the nurses' desperation, she said the value of the house she bought for $12,000 in 1979 was now $265,000, and people on public salaries could not afford to buy homes anymore.
Inflation is running at 5.2 percent, three times the average of the other 10 countries that have adopted the euro currency and therefore a centralized interest rate. That rate today is 4.25 percent, at least four points lower than where analysts say the Irish central bank would peg it if it were still operating independently. While participation in Europe over all has been enormously beneficial to Ireland, bringing subsidies that helped spur the boom, the government finds its hands tied in coping with inflation without the customary rate-increase mechanism at its disposal. "It's like playing tennis without a racket," Mr. McCarthy said.
With inflation threatening to overtake negotiated wage increases of 5.5 percent, union leaders are questioning the national business-labor agreement that since 1987 has brought wage restraint in exchange for job growth. An emphasis on computer literacy and information technologies, however, is creating a permanent underclass as it spreads affluence, and the abundance of things is spawning what Senator Hayes called relative deprivation. "People who were poor now have more to eat," he said, "but they don't have a television, and everyone down at the pub is talking about what they saw on TV."
Social habits are changing, breaking down traditional patterns of association. "You used to be part of an extended family or a village," said Brendan Keenan, 55, business editor of The Independent. "Even after you came to Dublin, you were a Corkman or a Galwayman, and that's who you socialized and drank with. Now you might have one set of friends at work and another at home. And home isn't around the corner. It might be in a suburb."
The government has attracted admiration for its success in steering the process that has brought the promise of an end to a century's sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland, but it is squandering its reputation through disclosures from tribunals of cronyism and corruption that still permeate Ireland's public life.
Frank Madden, 38, of Ballsbridge Motors in one of Dublin's upscale neighborhoods, is a salesman with a prospering clientele who want to swan around in eye-catching cars and stock their garages with extra ones from the sports and convertible lines. "When I began in this business, people bought cars as a necessity," he said. "Now they buy them as indulgences."
Mr. Madden is making more money than he ever dreamed possible, and his company will move 6,000 Mercedes-Benzes off its jammed lots this year. "Ten years ago," he said, "we'd have had a celebration if we sold 600."
But seated in his busy showroom, he was not in a party mood. "I'm here from 8 in the morning to 8 at night, and I can genuinely say it's not healthy for me or my family. I cannot be the husband and father I want to be at night after days like these, and I hear my colleagues around the floor say the same thing. We don't feel self-rewarded by the good times we're in."
There is a consensus that the two biggest changes in Ireland are the fall of the Roman Catholic Church as social arbiter and the rise of women as active participants in society. Brendan Kennelly, a leading poet and professor of modern literature at Trinity College, Dublin, said the most important development in Irish letters was the emergence of talented women among writers. "From being adored symbols on pedestals, women have come down to become articulate voices, no longer passive receivers of homage but expressive of their own problems and the problems in the culture," he said
One of Ireland's new generation of outspoken women is Ivana Bacik, 32, who as the Reid professor of criminal law at Trinity occupies the same post once held by the current president of Ireland, Mary McAleese, and by her predecessor, Mary Robinson. "I grew up in Cork in the 1970's, and Ireland was a horrible place to be," she said. "People are misconceiving the past. There has always been huge poverty and huge hypocrisy, but now you can talk openly about them. When I was a student here in the early 1990's, it was radical to be in favor of even giving information to women."
The boom has happened so speedily that some people are not yet convinced that it is here to stay. "Irish history has been one of uninterrupted failure since the beginning of the 19th century, and this has impinged on our psychology," Mr. Keenan said. "The big question for many people now is when is it going to end, because they remember that everything else eventually went wrong. The question for them is not what are the consequences, but where's the catch?"
Mr. Keenan believes that it will last. "It's simple," he said. "In the euro zone, having a young, well-educated population is like having oil."
Another reason Ireland seems to be weathering the rapid and profound cultural shock of the past decade reasonably well is the solidarity built up over centuries from being small, compact, homogeneous and deprived. "Say what you will about the Catholic Church," Senator Hayes said, "there was something important for us in having been told over and over of being all together and equal before God."
Fintan O'Toole, a columnist and author who travels to New York once a month to do theater reviews for The Daily News, credited Ireland's particular ease with America. "Ireland is a culture besotted with American images," he said. "What's happened with all this American investment is that you have come to us, and instead of making us change, it gives us a way to continue with our old life."
Ireland was not as comfortable with its stereotype as it pretended to be for its own survival, he said, and there is little nostalgia for the misty past.
Mr. Keenan said: "No one wants dear old Ireland back. Dear old Ireland was nice for the tourists, but not for us."
There is also little gloating at how well things seem to have worked out. "There is real pleasure in the fact that economists and politicians now come over here to find out how we did it and in the realization that we are world class because we were always considered second rate," Mr. Keenan said.
Ms. Gaffney said she thought that the Irish today drew strength from the unity gained, paradoxically, from having been dispersed around the globe. "'We were supposed to represent our country as well as ourselves and not just competently but with skill and confidence," she said. "There was a tremendous emphasis on the presentation of ourselves to the world."
Ireland got through hard times on this ability to compose its own narrative, and that same talent may keep it secure and distinct through the good times. "You know, in Gaelic, when you greet someone, the actual words mean, 'What's your news?' " Mr. Kennelly said. "We live on stories. I always think of that phrase, 'I am the way, the truth and the light.' You see, the truth comes second; it's the way that matters. It's how you tell things. And that is the oldest Irish tradition."

HEADLINE: John Pastore, Prominent Figure in Rhode Island Politics for Three Decades, Dies at 93

BYLINE: By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN 

 BODY:
John O. Pastore, the first Italian-American to be elected as a governor and sit in the United States Senate, and a dominant figure in Rhode Island politics for three decades, died on Saturday at a nursing home in North Kingstown, R.I. He was 93.
"Rhode Island is the smallest state in the union, and I am the smallest governor in the United States," the 5-foot-4-inch Mr. Pastore once told a group of German editors visiting the Statehouse in Providence. When he went to Washington, he became the smallest senator. But in his 26 years in the Senate, he established himself as a formidable presence, a liberal Democrat regarded as a fierce debater with a booming voice and a firm grasp on the issues of his day. 
 He staked out a specialty in nuclear power matters as chairman of the powerful Joint Committee on Atomic Energy and in 1963 provided important backing for the Kennedy administration's controversial treaty with the Soviet Union barring nuclear tests in the atmosphere.
In waging a successful fight for ratification, Senator Pastore displayed his flair for the dramatic. During the debate he flung open his jacket and struck the left side of his chest. "I say to those who have doubts about this treaty that I want them to open their heart and look into their consciences," he implored fellow senators. "I want them to realize what they might be doing. If by their vote they destroy and kill the treaty, God help us! God help us!"
His son, John O. Pastore Jr., a cardiologist, of Winchester, Mass., was secretary of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War when the Boston-based organization, jointly founded by American and Soviet physicians, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985.
Senator Pastore gained national recognition for his oratory while serving as keynote speaker at the 1964 Democratic National Convention, a choice that reflected President Lyndon B. Johnson's bid for support from the industrial states of the East, but also a tribute to his ability to rouse an audience.
His voice rising and falling to great dramatic effect, his fists pounding, Mr. Pastore drew roars from the more than 5,000 Democrats at the Atlantic City Convention Hall as he denounced Senator Barry Goldwater, the Republican nominee, as a captive of "reactionaries and extremists." The response to Mr. Pastore's speech was so enthusiastic that he enjoyed a brief consideration for the vice presidential nomination that eventually went to Senator Hubert H. Humphrey.
In addition to heading the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, Mr. Pastore held posts on the Commerce and Appropriations Committees, as well as the Senate Democratic Policy Committee, making him one of the Senate's most influential members.
He led a bitter but losing battle to block the politically restrictive McCarran-Walter Immigration Act that passed over President Harry S. Truman's veto and played an important role in passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act barring discrimination in public accommodations and cutting off federal financing of discriminatory programs.
Senator Pastore was floor manager of legislation suspending equal-time provisions of the Federal Communications Act to bring about the televised Kennedy-Nixon Presidential debates in 1960. As chairman of the Senate's communications subcommittee, he sometimes took a conservative stance on social issues. In the late 1960's and 70's, he denounced what he viewed as excessive violence and sexual content in television programming.
The son of an immigrant tailor, left fatherless at age 9, he epitomized the self-made man. "I always felt there were two strikes against me, and to succeed I had to do a better job than anyone else," he said.
Mr. Pastore, who served as governor of Rhode Island from 1945 to 1950 and who never lost an election, entered statewide politics when Italian-Americans were voting in increasingly significant numbers in urban areas and using their growing economic strength to provide financial backing for political candidates they favored.
For a man whose rise reflected inroads by Italian-Americans on political gains made by Irish-Americans, John Orlando Pastore had an intriguing birthday. He was born in the largely Italian Federal Hill section of Providence on St. Patrick's Day -- March 17, 1907.
Mr. Pastore's father, Michele, a native of Potenza in southern Italy, supported his wife, Erminia, and their four children with his tailor shop. But Michele Pastore died suddenly in May 1916 while his wife was pregnant with their fifth child. Mrs. Pastore went to work as a seamstress in a department store while John cared for the three younger children.
Mrs. Pastore made sure her children were well-dressed and well-mannered, and young John developed a penchant for fastidiousness. "When he cleaned house, he moved every stick of furniture," his mother would remember. His impeccable dress would become a hallmark in his public life -- he changed his shirts in the middle of the day if they bore the slightest signs of wear.
In 1927, while working as a $15-a-week claims adjuster for an electric utility company, Mr. Pastore enrolled in evening law school classes offered by Northeastern University of Boston at a Providence Y.M.C.A. In 1932 he set up a law office in the basement of the family home, but with the Depression in full force, he attracted few clients.
One Sunday in 1933, Mr. Pastore waited outside St. Bartholomew's Church until Tommy Testa, an important local politician, came out. "I'd like to go into politics," Mr. Pastore told him. Mr. Testa, who would recall how "I liked Johnny's manner," helped him obtain the Democratic nomination for the Rhode Island General Assembly, and he was elected to two-year terms in 1934 and 1936.
Mr. Pastore then gained an appointment as an assistant state attorney general, and by the early 1940's his oratorical skill was winning over juries in criminal cases. One day a young woman named Elena Caito was passing by a courthouse while Mr. Pastore was prosecuting a case. As Mr. Pastore's son told the story long afterward: "The transom over the door was open. She could hear this booming voice coming out, and she asked one of her brothers, 'Who is that?' So they got introduced." In July 1941, they were married.
In 1944, Mr. Pastore was asked to run for lieutenant governor, a part-time position, on the statewide Democratic ticket headed by Gov. J. Howard McGrath. The Democrats won, and then Mr. Pastore got a huge break, succeeding to the governor's chair in October 1945 when Mr. McGrath was appointed solicitor general in the Truman administration. Mr. Pastore was narrowly elected to the Statehouse in November 1946, but two years later he gained a second term with ease.
Although he was the first person of Italian descent to be elected governor, he was not the first to serve in a statehouse. Charles Poletti, a son of Italian immigrants who had been lieutenant governor of New York State, served as governor in December 1942 to complete the term of Gov. Herbert Lehman, who resigned to direct American war-relief efforts in Europe.
A liberal on social-welfare matters, Mr. Pastore, as governor, worked with business interests, pushing through a sales tax, rather than relying solely on corporate income taxes, to pay for public improvements neglected during World War II. He maintained a popular touch, eating lunch with Statehouse employees in their cafeteria, and he was adept at cultivating the press.
In November 1950, Mr. Pastore was elected to the United States Senate to fill out the unexpired term of Mr. McGrath, who had moved from the solicitor general's post to the Senate, then resigned to become President Truman's attorney general. In 1952, Mr. Pastore was elected to the first of his four full terms in the Senate.
Arguing his points on the Senate floor, Mr. Pastore was not averse to wagging a finger under another senator's nose, and he impressed his Senate colleagues mightily when he got the better of the bearish senator from Oklahoma, Robert Kerr, a fierce debater, in an encounter on the floor.
Although his oratory could be flamboyant, his personal appearance was conservative -- his grooming meticulous, his black hair slicked back, his salt-and-pepper mustache kept trim.
Mr. Pastore, who retired from the Senate in 1976, is survived by his wife and son; two daughters, Francesca Pastore and Louise Harbourt, both of Springfield, Va.; two sisters, Elena Valente of North Providence, R.I., and Michelina Mentasti of Florida; seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
Through his Senate years, Mr. Pastore earnestly pursued weighty issues. But he could also poke fun at himself.
He once observed that nuclear fallout might bring bizarre changes. "Mutations!" he thundered. "Perhaps they'll make Pastore 6 feet tall."
And he expressed gratitude that his parents had Anglicized his first name. "If they had called me Giovanni," he said, "my initials would be G.O.P."

HEADLINE: In Los Angeles, Tears, Confusion and a Resolution to End the Violence

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 16

 BODY:
Helen Austin was late for work the other day, something that almost never happens. She spent the morning at the beauty shop, crying and praying with her hairdresser.
"Her only son was killed going to work three months ago," Mrs. Austin said at Save Our Future, the neighborhood center where she volunteers. "She's having a very hard time. She's lost 30 pounds." 
 Mrs. Austin's eyes were still red and puffy an hour later. In her hand she held a crushed ball of tissue and a poster announcing a reward for the young man's killer.
But Mrs. Austin wasn't just crying for her friend. She was also crying for her own family -- two of her grandchildren have been killed over the years. And she was crying for her community of south Los Angeles, which in the last several months has been bloodied, along with many other parts of the city, by a wave of violence and killing, a scourge that many here thought was fading fast.
"I think we're starting to see the start of another epidemic," said Billie Weiss, executive director of the Violence Prevention Coalition of Greater Los Angeles. "It's starting to look like the early 90's again."
In more than two dozen interviews this week with teenagers, middle-aged ex-gang members, mothers of murdered children, social workers, elected officials, neighborhood advocates, police officers and a woman whose disabled brother was shot to death the day before the interview, people here said they were afraid and baffled by the rise in violence and just as determined to stop it.
"There's no quick fix," said Gary Honore, who speaks to youth groups about the perils of the streets and has buried a daughter, a brother and a sister slain in the last decade. "But if we don't start today, there won't be a tomorrow."
After years of dropping crime rates across the city and county, there have been 266 homicides in Los Angeles this year, a 30 percent increase from a year ago. About 42 percent of the killings have been gang-related, according to the Police Department. But no one knows for sure what is causing the surge, beyond the usual suspects of drugs, turf and too many bored and desperate young men -- and some women -- able to get their hands on too many powerful weapons.
"What I know is that it has got to stop," said a Los Angeles City Council member, Mark Ridley-Thomas, whose district has been hard hit by the violence. "It seems to be coming on rather ferociously."
Mr. Ridley-Thomas is pushing the City Council to allocate $5 million in emergency money to create summer jobs and violence-prevention programs, which have been struggling because of lack of money, he said.
"We've had as many as 13,000 summer jobs in the past," he said. "Now, it's down to 3,500."
Even in this booming economy, jobs for teenagers and for ex-convicts like Melvin Farmer, 43, are hard to find in the inner city, despite being so crucial in stopping the violence, many people here said.
Mr. Farmer, a longtime gang member, has been in and out of prison for nearly 20 years. He was last in prison three years ago. He came out determined never to return and today is vice president of the National Alliance for Positive Action, a neighborhood and youth advocate group.
"I've been out three years, and I can't find a job because of my record," Mr. Farmer said. "I might go two or three days without eating. There are a lot of temptations out here, but I'm never going back to that life. It would kill my mother."
At one of at least three anti-violence meetings held last week across the city, a Los Angeles County supervisor, Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, said finding jobs for ex-convicts should be a priority because so many are beginning to return to the streets.
Last Thursday morning, another anti-violence meeting was held, this time in the City Council chambers. As dozens of people filed into the chamber, Anthony Wingate, 46, was being helped to his chair in front of his building in South-Central Los Angeles. Mr. Wingate was partially paralyzed 12 years ago after being shot in a robbery, his sister, Natalie, said. He sat in the chair every morning, greeting passers-by.
Shortly before 9 a.m., a man walked up to Mr. Wingate's neighbor, Clifton Adams, 24, and shot him to death. Then he turned on the only witness in sight, the crippled man in the chair.
"My brother couldn't run," Ms. Wingate said. "He was handicapped. He had to be carried to the bathroom. He didn't deserve to be killed like that."
The next day, a red candle left on the stoop as a memorial to Mr. Wingate had melted over the sidewalk like blood.
"That ain't his blood," a relative said. "But that's some of his brains in the grass."
Such stories don't faze lanky Kenneth, a 17-year-old who attends an after-school program for troubled teenagers called People Who Care. "It's always more killing when it's hot," Kenneth said. "I might get killed myself. Three days back, my friend got shot in the hip. I just know it's a possibility every time I wake up."
Kenneth is about the same age as the slain sons of the three friends who founded Justice for Murdered Children, LaWanda Hawkins, Vicky Lindsey and Rita Norwood. They founded the group four years ago because they felt left out of the system and because the killers of their children were never caught. The group tries to pressure local police departments to investigate inner city homicides more aggressively.
"There are therapy groups we could have joined," Mrs. Hawkins said. "But we wanted something else. We wanted justice for our children."
Back at Save Our Future, Mrs. Austin said she wanted justice for her friend's son, too. She got some tape to put the reward poster up at the south Los Angeles center, which offers neighborhood life skills and employment training. The center was founded by Mrs. Austin's stepdaughter, Charlotte Austin Jordan, to honor her murdered children.
Mrs. Jordan's 13-year-old daughter, Jamee, was killed in 1988, a victim of mistaken identity. She was shot 15 times. "That started my crusade," Mrs. Jordan said. In 1996, her son Corey, 25, was shot and killed by a 41-year-old gang member. "Corey had two children and one on the way," Mrs. Jordan said. "The baby was born two days after we buried my son."
The men who killed her children had been in and out prison since they were young teenagers. "Nothing in prison happens to help them change," she said.
Mrs. Jordan has a 15-year-old son who asked her, "Am I going to die like that, too?"
"I couldn't just say no," Mrs. Jordan said. "All I could say was that I will do everything I can to make our community safe for him."
In the meantime, she moved her family to the suburbs, "so my son could have his childhood back."
As she talked, a former gang member named Hakeem, 29, and his brother Mookie, 14, came in. Hakeem is the same age Mrs. Jordan's son would be if he were alive, and she has practically adopted him. He calls her Mom. His own mother was killed in a drive-by shooting several years ago while he was locked up for a murder, committed when he was 13.
Mookie is dressed in baggy pants and is wearing a black bandanna on his head. "In order to stay out of trouble, you have to change the way you dress," Mrs. Jordan said to him.
Mookie looked at the floor.
"He's just like my little cousin who got shot in his neck and his back," Hakeem said. "Now he's paralyzed. He's just 15."
Hakeem sounded angry and sad.
"I shot and killed someone," he said. "I know violence ain't the answer. I don't want my little brother to be like me."
Mookie likes to go swimming, but the neighborhood pool is controlled by rival gang members. "First we fight," he said. "Then we swim."
When his cousin was shot by one of the boys who claim the pool, Mookie immediately thought revenge. It is the easiest thing in the world to get a gun in his neighborhood. But he didn't. "Because of my brother," he said. "He told me it wasn't the way. And I don't want to get locked up for the rest of my life."
Mrs. Jordan smiled. At least for a day, someone was listening.

HEADLINE: UTILITIES TRYING NEW APPROACHES TO PRICING ENERGY

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
As air-conditioners hum this summer, and experts issue dire warnings about electricity running short, a growing number of utilities are varying the price of power based on supply and demand to make sure there is enough to go around.
The approach is a decidedly novel one for electric utilities, which have mostly set prices for power without regard to fluctuations in energy use. And it is inducing companies and individual consumers to change how they use power and think harder about what electricity is worth to them at different times. 
 Wisconsin Electric Power is one of the utilities with a new approach to pricing power. The company usually has no trouble meeting demand when temperatures rise in the summer. But during the second week of May, usually the slack season for power use, between the winter and summer peaks, the utility had closed many generating stations for maintenance.
So when the temperature in Milwaukee hit an unseasonable 90 degrees, Wisconsin Electric saw a power shortage looming. One possibility was buying electricity from another company on the open market, but because other utilities were also caught short, that would have cost 10 to 20 times the usual price.
Instead, the utility called one of its biggest customers, the Cleveland Cliffs iron ore mine, in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. How would the mine feel, dispatchers asked, about taking the afternoon off -- and being paid for it?
At first the answer was no. But then plant managers looked at the pile of crushed ore coming out of the milling machines, and realized that if the machines shut down for the rest of the day, no shipments would be delayed. After some quick negotiations, a deal was struck: Wisconsin Electric would pay the mine $82,000 to shut down its ore crushers.
"That was a heck of a good deal," said Richard A. Abdoo, the chairman, president and chief executive of Wisconsin Electric. His company would be paying Cleveland Cliffs about 30 cents a kilowatt-hour not to use electricity, or about six times what Wisconsin Electric charges industrial customers for a kilowatt hour. But it was cheaper than buying power on the open market.
Wisconsin has gotten more sophisticated since May, gathering the beeper and fax numbers of 80 of its biggest customers. On hot afternoons, it can alert them to log on to its Web page, where it offers them cash -- the amount varies, much like the price of a restaurant's lobster special -- to reduce consumption at certain hours.
There are no statistics on the number of utilities using new methods to manage energy demand, but more and more companies seem to be doing it. In Connecticut, Northeast Utilities is installing Internet-controlled thermostats in 50 houses, which it can use to bump air-conditioner settings up by 4 degrees when it needs the power, in exchange for a $200 payment to each homeowner for the summer. And around the country, utilities are installing radio-controlled switches on central air-conditioners and swimming pool pumps to turn them off at peak hours.
For years, electricity has been sold under a system that is worthy of the old Soviet Union: a kilowatt-hour has a fixed price, and you can have as much as you want until it runs out; then there isn't any for anybody.
Allan Schurr, vice president of Silicon Energy, which writes software for the Internet-controlled thermostats, compared the traditional system to an airline that keeps a flock of planes by the gate in case a crowd suddenly wants to fly somewhere. "We don't have a reservation system," he said.
Not troubling customers with the fluctuations of price worked fairly well under the old regulated system. A kilowatt-hour, which the utility typically sold for 8 to 10 cents, often cost 2 cents but hardly ever more than 12. Now, electricity is often bought and sold wholesale, with no regulation, and the cost can temporarily soar to $6 a kilowatt-hour. No utility can buy much at that price, resell it at 5 or 10 cents, and still make a profit. Some utilities can pass those costs through and spread them among their customers, but everyone's costs would be much lower if customers had a choice to cut consumption when prices became exorbitant.
The new pricing structure, with rates varying by the hour, will take some getting used to. "A lot of people are going to say, I don't want to face this," said Eric Hirst, a consultant on electric industry reorganization. "But others are going to say, I can make money by cutting consumption here and increasing consumption there."
Pricing by the hour has no impact on energy efficiency -- the amount of work done per kilowatt-hour -- but it does improve reliability, he said, because it will minimize power failures.
Some utilities are reluctant to let customers know they do not have enough power on hand to handle every contingency, preferring to sell as much power as possible and pass along occasionally extraordinary prices.
"Frankly, there are not a lot of production operations that keep a lot of inventory around these days," said William T. McCormick Jr., chairman and chief executive of CMS Energy, the parent of Consumers Power, of Michigan.
And customers can be reluctant.
"We don't like to take a plant up and down if we don't have to," said David L. Gardner, a spokesman for Cleveland Cliffs. But on that day in May, it worked out that a shutdown entailed little waste of manpower. "It was a win-win situation," he said.
Cleveland Cliffs is one of many Wisconsin Electric customers on an "interruptible" contract, which allows the utility to pull the plug in an emergency. But this was not an emergency, just a time when the economics favored rewarding the mine to shut down.
The utility has signed up 81 major customers this spring, with a total demand of 40 megawatts (enough to power 1,000 homes), who are prepared to bid for power interruptions. It hopes to sign up customers using an added 30 megawatts, though it is not yet sure how much of that will be volunteered when it needs relief. But the amount could be a significant fraction of demand on a bad day. Last year, the maximum amount of power required simultaneously by all its customers reached 5,975 megawatts.
In a blunt, low-tech way, utilities have tried for years to cut peaks in demand for power, which they call peak load. Potomac Electric Power, which serves the District of Columbia and some Maryland suburbs, has persuaded about a third of its 600,000 residential customers to join a "kilowatchers club." In exchange for a monthly credit of $9 on their bill, the utility has installed a second electric meter for their air-conditioners. It can shut off the air-conditioners by radio control for 13 minutes every half-hour. Some customers, in exchange for a $22 monthly payment, have meters that can shut off their air-conditioners altogether. Last year, demand for Potomac Electric's power peaked at 5,927 megawatts, but the kilowatchers can shave 271 megawatts if necessary. Potomac Electric typically uses the radio control 5 to 10 days a year.
Northeast Utilities, in Connecticut, also reduces demand for its electricity for air-conditioning, but in a more sophisticated way.
At the end of June, David and Elizabeth Yu, of Unionville, Conn., accepted a $50 payment from their utility, Northeast Utilities, to let Northeast replace the thermostat that runs their air-conditioner.
Central air-conditioners in houses like the Yus' -- a 16-year-old, four-bedroom Cape -- draw about 3 kilowatts; raising the thermostat 4 degrees cuts the number of minutes they run each hour by about 30 percent, said Michael W. Townsley, a Northeast manager who oversees conservation. If the family had the thermostat set at 74, for example, the utility could reset it to 78.
Most of the year, the power saved costs only a few cents an hour. But now that Northeast buys its electricity on the open market at peak hours, the price can change fast. Hence the value of fiddling with the Yus' thermostat from a central office.
"When supply and demand are very tight, you're going to see tremendous swings," Mr. Townsley said. "In the morning the price might be down around 2 cents, later, $1 a kilowatt-hour. What that says is, there are some potential economic opportunities there."
Many companies are marketing radio-controlled switches that will turn off an air-conditioner or a pool pump. But the thermostat, developed with the Carrier Corporation, has a more subtle impact on the household.
The Yus' new thermostat calls in four times a day for instructions. If the family lets the utility control the temperature, Northeast will pay them another $150 on Oct. 1. But if Mrs. Yu finds the house uncomfortably warm, she can override the setting. Each time she does so, though, Northeast will deduct $15 from that bounty.
"The financial incentive is not that much," Mr. Yu said. "It'll just get absorbed into the budget." But, being a gadget-lover, he is attracted by the device itself.
Mr. Yu is at work during the hours that Northeast is most likely to adjust their thermostat. But Mrs. Yu, who is at home with the couple's three children, said, "It'll be interesting to see how it changes our lives during the peak hours."
Like all utilities, Northeast already has precise historical data on how much power customers will demand at any given level of temperature and humidity; now it wants to know what that demand curve looks like when price is a factor.
"Our interest is primarily reliability, when supply and demand tend to be outside of equilibrium," Mr. Townsley said. "But that's also at the time when the economics come in."

Chart: "When Utilities Pay the Customer"
Utilities are finding new ways to manage demand for electricity.
Here is one method.
 
Electric companies can deliver power inexpensively during
periods of normal demand . . .
 
THE UTILITY -- Electricity is often generated for around 2 cents a kilowatt hour, and rarely exceeds 12 cents.
 
CUSTOMERS -- Utilities usually charge between 5 cents and 10 cents a kilowatt hour for electricity.
 
. . . but when demand peaks, supplying the extra power can be very
costly, especially if bought on the open market . . .
 
Power purchased at peak times on the open market can soar to $6 a kilowatt.
Utilities are often unable to pass along short-term surges in cost.
 
. . . and some utilities are finding it is cheaper to pay customers, like
big industrial users, not to use power at times of peak demand.
 
Paying 30 cents a kilowatt hour for not using power can still be cheaper for the utility than buying extra power. At the right price, some customers may find it more profitable to shut down for short periods. (pg. A16)

HEADLINE: TODAY: TAXES -- CAMPAIGN 2000;
Channeling the Revenue River

 BODY:
If there is anything as inevitable as death and taxes, it is the fact that the presidential candidates will be debating tax policy. Certainly the differing proposals by both Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore to cut taxes will keep the issue before the voters. Later in the campaign, we will be looking at the details of their plans. But at this early stage, we feel it would be useful to define some broad principles that ought to govern the choice of potential tax cuts. The threshold question that needs to be asked is whether tax cuts of any kind are the best way to bring about economic growth as well as progressive policy goals like expanded health care.
If there is to be a tax cut, it should make the tax code more simple, fair and progressive. Progres-sivity is a time-honored principle often forgotten in the political debates. But since the beginning of this century, Americans have consistently embraced the principle that calls for the wealthy to pay proportionately larger shares of their income in taxes. The tax system became less progressive after the tax cuts of President Ronald Reagan and more progressive after tax increases under Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton. The latest Treasury estimate is that the top fifth of American families accounts for 56.7 percent of American family income but 65.1 percent of total federal tax revenues. The top 1 percent accounts for 14.8 percent of total income and 20.1 percent of tax revenues. These rates do not make for an excessively progressive tax system. 
 Some argue that higher taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers -- particularly the marginal income tax rate of 39.6 percent and the estate tax -- are destructive of the incentive to create more wealth. But raising the highest income tax rates on the wealthiest families in 1993 did not deter them from increasing their wealth throughout the decade.
Beyond the importance of progressivity, fairness dictates that taxpayers in similar categories be treated equally. But this principle can be difficult to put into practice. Many in Congress argue that it is unfair for a married couple earning the same income and filing a joint return to pay more in taxes than an unmarried couple filing separately. This bipartisan group wants to eliminate the so-called "marriage penalty." Doing so, however, would lower taxes on families with higher incomes.
The tax code is filled with quandaries like this one. A certain amount of inequity is inevitable in the tax code. Two families with the same income, living across the street from each other, might pay dramatically different amounts of taxes depending on which took advantage of tax breaks for health care, child care, education or tax-free investments. A major step toward simplicity was taken in 1986, when several layers of credits, deductions and loopholes for special interests were stripped out of the tax code so that all taxpayers could enjoy somewhat lower rates.
In the years since then, however, many more tax breaks have been introduced. Faced with a Republican Congress, President Clinton has been a master at expanding the role of the federal government, not by spending programs but by tax credits for child care, education and other activities. Now both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have moved in the direction of more tax breaks. The Texas governor calls for new tax credits for long-term health care, education, health insurance, charitable giving and adoptions. Mr. Gore proposes tax credits for health insurance premiums, after-school care, college tuition and retirement savings. All these proposals make the tax code more complex, adding to the billions it already costs taxpayers simply to prepare their forms. Rather than indiscriminately handing out more tax incentives, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush should consider simplifying the code and achieving the lower tax rates they think the voters are demanding in an across-the-board but progressive way.
Tax cuts, in the final analysis, should be tested on whether they eat up too much of the federal surplus, leaving little money for other needs. They must not be weighted toward the wealthy, like the repeal of the federal estate tax that has now passed both houses. They should keep the tax code equitable and be set up in a way that the working poor can use to their advantage.
The logic for large tax cuts is that the surplus "belongs" to American taxpayers and should be returned to them before being used for more federal spending. What that formulation leaves out is that the federal debt also belongs to the taxpayers, and so does the obligation to think about huge future costs, including the retirement security of the current work force. Assuring that the next generation will have the education and skills to keep the economy growing, and a clean environment to live in, is also an obligation that belongs to the taxpayers.

The sewers are backed up at Seventh and Elm Streets again, and pools of scummy liquid are collecting in the collapsing gutters and rutted street in front of the Bible Tabernacle Church.
It stinks. 
 The Rev. Heyward Wiggins of Bible Tabernacle is there, talking about his hopes for his stricken city, now that the state has given up on Camden's local government and is set to begin the first city takeover in the state's history, amounting to the imposition of a benign but absolute dictator. It is also to be the biggest city takeover in the country since the Great Depression.
"If you ask people what they want, they would say they want Camden to be comfortable to live in again," Mr. Wiggins says. "They would say they just want to sit on their front porch without someone harassing them or sneaking in the back door. They want the streets cleaned and the sewers fixed. They don't want big things. They want little things."
But delivering services, little or big, is just what Camden's city government has been unable to do. Done in by government corruption, poverty and the flight of manufacturing industries, it has been functionally bankrupt for more than a decade, kept afloat with cash from Trenton, which now pays for 70 percent of the municipal and public school budget. In this city across the Delaware River from the chiseled, historic skyline of Philadelphia, not one residential street has been repaved for years, and 16 percent of the buildings are abandoned. The high school dropout rate is 50, 70 or 80 percent, depending on whom you ask, and the infant mortality rate (27 deaths per 1,000 births in 1996) is three times that of the suburbs whose borders lie less than a mile from where Mr. Wiggins stood.
More than 200 open-air drug bazaars are in operation, but there are only 80 city police officers on duty at one time. In March, Milton Milan became the third Camden mayor in 20 years to be indicted on corruption charges.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman toured Camden in 1996 and looked around in despair. "I thought to myself, 'There's no way you can raise a child here,' " she said at the time.
So this week, Mrs. Whitman handed the Legislature her Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Revitalization Act, which would strip power from the mayor, City Council and regulatory and licensing agencies in Camden and put it all in the hands of one person, a chief management officer appointed by the state.
The Legislature is out of session now, but is expected to pass the bill with minor changes when it reconvenes in the fall.
The manager would have the power to break contracts, ignore Civil Service rules in hiring and firing, issue or revoke licenses and direct all appointments and spending decisions. The manager's only obligation to the public would be to consult with a state-selected board of local citizens and to hold two public hearings a year.
The reason, said Ulrich H. (Al) Steinberg, director of the division of local government services, is that Camden's city government has simply ceased to function.
"It's like quicksand," Mr. Steinberg said in an interview. "You look in the books for something and you find there's no solid footing. There is paper and there are words, but they are empty. There's no basis for what they say." These days, state agencies bypass the city government and deal directly with a shadow government of nonprofit social and housing groups to bring everything from new housing to day care to health care to Camden's 85,000 residents.
There have been three other takeovers of bankrupt cities and incompetent or corrupt city administrations in recent years, but Camden's is the biggest of them all. Michigan took over the tiny Detroit suburb of Ecorse in 1986; Massachusetts took over the Boston suburb of Chelsea, population 35,000, in 1992; and Illinois has been operating East St. Louis, population 39,000, since 1994.
Chelsea's takeover resulted in a revamped city charter and was an unqualified success. The results in East St. Louis and Ecorse are mixed. The cities are still struggling.
Harry Spence, until recently the vice chancellor for operations of the New York City public schools, was the receiver, or manager, for Chelsea for three years. New Jersey officials have consulted extensively with him. In an interview, he said that when things were as bad as they were in Camden, a takeover was the only way to go.
"Piecemeal intervention is not enough to draw the necessary confidence either from the citizens themselves or from outsiders to come in and invest in new development," Mr. Spence said.
"When you leave the government structures in place, you allow the existing cadre of elected officials and their cohorts to take up all the space, to maintain a continued sham of democratic process," he added. "You have got to break open space for new people to enter, because at this time the chances of any rational member of the Camden population, for a hero to step in, are so slim that they not going to happen."
But Camden is mostly black and Hispanic. The idea of a white governor like Mrs. Whitman and a Republican administration in Trenton abolishing self-government in a mostly minority city resonates in threatening ways among city leaders. This racial disparity confronted state officials with their most delicate task, of alliance building inside the city before they could let the hammer fall.
Gwendolyn A. Faison, president of the Camden City Council and a black woman, practically levitated out of her seat with anger when word came down, during a Council session this week, that the takeover bill had been introduced.
"My father was beaten off the courthouse steps in Clinton, North Carolina, just for asking to register to vote," Mrs. Faison declared. "To register! Do they think we are going to give up the right that my people fought for and died for?"
But it is a measure of Camden's desperation, and of the state's careful cultivation of local allies, that the city's grass-roots leaders, including black leaders, think exactly that.
Camden is home to some of the most bumptious Democrats in the state -- it was the cradle of former Gov. Jim Florio's career as a political fighter -- but years of preparation by the Whitman administration have won over the core of the city's civic leadership, minority and Democratic as it is, to the idea of a state takeover.
On June 13, two major church groups, Camden Churches Organized for People, a mixed group of Roman Catholic Hispanic and black congregations, and the all-black Concerned Black Clergy, filled St. Joseph's Pro-Cathedral on Federal Street with 1,500 residents to invite the state to take over their city.
In exchange for the support, the state agreed to a manifesto presented by the church leaders that describes the city's ills and lists timetables for solutions: demolishing 362 condemned buildings within one year; shutting down 200 drug markets within three years; and creating a timetable for raising the graduation rate from Camden high schools to 70 percent, among other things.
Sean Closkey, the head of St. Joseph's Carpenter Society, which rehabilitates houses for low income owners, said it would be a mistake if other New Jerseyans, who enjoy a booming economy and never need to creep through Camden's blighted streets, think people here are not aware of the magnitude of their choice.
"You lost the ZIP code lottery and now your chances of dying are three times higher because you were born here," Mr. Closkey said. "That's when you start to wonder when the principles of democracy are trumped by questions of social justice. If we are given the right to rule without the tools, is that democracy? People here are asking those questions. They may not be asking them in Summit or Short Hills, but they are here."
Many members of the nonprofit church groups that already act as a kind of surrogate government will presumably fill out the 15-member advisory board the new city manager is required to create and consult. This reliance on religious leaders riles those in the City Hall faction who are losing their power.
"It's a church-run coup d'etat," said Luis Pastoriza, the Camden municipal clerk. "We're going to have a faith-based government, like the ayatollahs." Mr. Pastoriza stands to lose his municipal job as a result of the takeover.
The Rev. James E. Fitten, president of Concerned Black Clergy, has watched the political power of Camden's black community shrink, first with the election of the city's first Hispanic mayor in Mr. Milan, and now at the prospect of a state takeover. He lives in an ornate, lovingly restored 19th-century brick row house on Chambers Avenue, just down from Cooper Hospital. Yet half of the houses on his block, including one adjoining his, are boarded up, and the quaint cobblestone street is an obstacle course. He faces the issues behind the takeover every day, he said.
"I understand all of the arguments," Mr. Fitten said. "But we need people in government who are competent and truthful, and who have the proper skills to guide the community. They're going to have my neck for saying it, but I just don't see those things in this city right now."
For all the disagreements between City Hall and the takeover proponents, there is no disagreement about what Camden needs. Church people, City Hall leaders and state officials say that Camden's problem can only be solved by market-driven solutions, principally by attracting middle-class residents and the businesses that cater to them.
"I don't think that Camden ought to be a warehouse of the poor," said Msgr. Robert McDermott of St. Joseph's. "I think Camden ought to have its share of middle-class people, people who can afford to pay taxes, who would make the school system better, and who would render certain parts of the city better places to live."
Mr. Steinberg, the state's takeover specialist, looks at Philadelphia's cityscape rising spellbindingly across the Delaware from Camden's nearly empty riverfront and wonders why no on has discovered it as a place for investment yet. Back on Seventh Street, in front of Mr. Wiggins's Bible Tabernacle, Benny Lopez, recently of Brooklyn, was thinking along the same lines.
"They've got to make this place pretty," Mr. Lopez said. "With a better environment, you get better people, and with better people, you get more businesses. Like New York."

HEADLINE: In Harlem, Loans Without the Sharks

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO 

 BODY:
In his 16 years of business in West Harlem, Dario Pichardo has run a restaurant, a car service and a beauty salon. And when he has needed money to keep his businesses afloat, Mr. Pichardo said, he has not hesitated to go to loan sharks, despite sky-high interest rates and the implied threat of violence for unpaid debts.
"You have to get loans where you can, personal loans, and that can be expensive," said Mr. Pichardo, 46. He explained that he has little alternative since banks have regularly denied his loan applications. "It's a painful method for getting money. For a small businessman, it can hurt him quite a bit and drain from the few benefits that he has." 
 Now, Mr. Pichardo, a Dominican immigrant, is thinking about a loan for his latest venture, Anoranza D'29 Restaurant on Amsterdam Avenue, which opened in September. Although his place is crowded at lunch hour with diners hungry for sancocho stews, garlicky chicken and other Dominican dishes, Mr. Pichardo said he needs $5,000 to replace the water-stained drop ceilings, the chipped floor tiles and the cheap-looking Formica tables. And he wants to add some classy touches, like a bar and a brass banister.
But this time, Mr. Pichardo said, he hopes he will get help from a Washington Heights credit union that is scheduled to open a second branch today at 1631 Amsterdam Avenue near 141st Street, between Cabrini Car Service and a Blimpie outlet.
The financial institution, Neighborhood Trust Federal Credit Union, is one of the more successful of the 30 community-based credit unions in New York City. Since it opened in 1997, it has accumulated $5 million in assets, about double the amount of the deposits in most neighborhood credit unions. Based in a former bank on Fort Washington Avenue and 178th Street, the credit union has provided services to residents who once kept their money under mattresses and went to loan sharks when they needed money.
The 3,000 members of Neighborhood Trust can open no-fee checking accounts with a minimum of $100. They can apply for low-interest loans for amounts from $500 to $10,000 to expand tiny businesses like home-run day care centers and beauty parlors. Neighborhood Trust even employs a full-time teacher who runs free classes for neighborhood residents interested in learning how to keep a budget, how to understand the mysteries of credit or how to run a small business.
"I think they've done a lot of things right; there are a lot of things to emulate," said Clifford Rosenthal, director of the National Federation of Community Development Credit Unions, a nonprofit organization that provides management support to credit unions.
Mark D. Levine, who runs Neighborhood Trust, said expanding into West Harlem made perfect sense because of the area's dire need for financial services. The median family income in the neighborhood is $12,849, and an estimated 51 percent of adults do not have a banking account, according to Neighborhood Trust's business plan.
"There are only two bank branches for over 75,000 people," said Mr. Levine, 31, a Maryland native who taught at a public school in the Bronx before starting Neighborhood Trust with other former teachers and community leaders. "And so in has come an entire industry of check-cashing stores and pawn shops and loan sharks that are, in a sense, filling the gap but doing it in very exploitative ways."
Like many people in low-income neighborhoods across the city, large numbers of residents of West Harlem have never dealt with a bank. Many have shunned banks because the costs are too high; banks typically charge monthly fees on checking accounts if the balance falls below $3,000. Others do not have enough identification to open accounts or feel alienated by banks.
The Rev. Ronnie L. Faison, pastor of Traveler's Rest Baptist Church on Amsterdam Avenue, said many of his parishioners have been eagerly awaiting the credit union since officials from Neighborhood Trust told them weeks ago that the new branch would be coming to their area.
"Most people go out of the area for financial services, or they have their own little setups, home safety vaults," explained Mr. Faison. "It means a great deal to have something like this right here."
Ramon Murphy, co-owner of Natali Supermarket on West 143rd Street and president of the 2,000-member Deli Grocery Store Owners Association, said the absence of established financial institutions and the inability of small business owners to secure loans has led many to turn to loan sharks, or "prestamistas," as they are known to Dominican shop owners.
The loan sharks, he said, charge exorbitant weekly interest rates that can turn a $5,000 loan into a $20,000 payback. And it is not unheard of, he said, for a small business owner to lose his shop to a loan shark because he cannot make the payments.
"The service we need is a bank that integrates itself into the community, so the small businesses can borrow," said Mr. Murphy, who owns two bodegas with Arsenio Mendoza. Both have strongly supported the arrival of Neighborhood Trust.
Milton Balcacer, a businessman who lives in Washington Heights, knows the pitfalls of counting on prestamistas.
Before joining Neighborhood Trust two years ago, Mr. Balcacer said, he never kept track of earnings, expenditures or inventory for his store, Milton Variety, on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. He also turned to loan sharks when he needed $14,000, a move that cost him $28,000 by the time he repaid the initial loan and the interest.
Now, Mr. Balcacer said, he is running his business smoothly. He completed a course for entrepreneurs run by Neighborhood Trust and learned how to keep his books in order and watch the bottom line. Recently, he received a $3,500 loan, which he is repaying in 18 months at 8 percent interest.
"I'm running a better-organized business," he said. "I'm progressing. Before, I would throw my money in my pocket and never keep track. Now, what little I make from sales, I put my earnings in the bank."

Global Cooling

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
So what can we do about global warming?
First, keep in mind the goal, which is to bring the potentially catastrophic warming under control by curtailing the release of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. 
 Ordinary people can help immediately by becoming more energy efficient. Stop using the familiar incandescent light bulbs and replace them with compact fluorescent bulbs, which last much longer and use only a quarter of the energy consumed by conventional bulbs.
Compact fluorescent bulbs are significantly more expensive, but because they last so long (up to 10 times the life of a standard bulb) and use so little electricity, they are substantially cheaper in the long run.
Next, when shopping for an appliance -- a refrigerator, a dishwasher, an air-conditioner -- select the one with the highest energy efficiency rating. There will be a sticker on the appliance, telling you how much energy it uses. Pay attention. There can be a difference of 30 percent to 40 percent or more in the amount of energy consumed by appliances with comparable features.
Even more important is the choice you make in the car or truck you buy. Motor vehicles are responsible for about a third of the carbon dioxide emissions in the United States. The vehicles that are the most fuel efficient emit the least carbon dioxide. (Fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions are inversely proportional. If you double fuel economy, you cut carbon dioxide emissions in half.)
According to the research and advocacy group Environmental Defense, if you buy a new car that gets 10 more miles per gallon than your old car, the amount of carbon dioxide reduction realized in one year will be about 2,500 pounds.
So buying a car or truck that suits your needs and is fuel efficient is a big help.
Honda and Toyota are bringing so-called hybrid vehicles onto the market in the U.S. Hybrids are cars that combine an internal combustion engine and a battery-powered electric motor. They are mid-sized cars that are achieving twice the fuel economy of conventional cars.
Dr. Paul Epstein, associate director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School, summed the matter up as follows: "The issue is not so much what we are doing, but how we power what we are doing. That's the first step."
Over the long term, the requirements are far more ambitious. Ideally, over the course of the next 100 or so years, a transformation will take place and most energy will end up coming not from fossil fuels like coal and oil, but from clean energy sources -- the sun, the wind, hydrogen and non-polluting fuel cells.
"To get there at a cost that's affordable will require substantial technological development," said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, the chief scientist of Environmental Defense.
To move from our pollution-choked present to a future in which climate change is not a mortal threat will take more than that all-important first step of an enlightened citizenry buying cleaner cars and more efficient appliances. Tough action by Congress and the president is needed, and soon. And international cooperation, with enforceable agreements covering both industrialized and, ultimately, developing nations, will be crucial.
Among other things, the federal government can offer subsidies and other incentives to reduce the cost and foster the use of existing clean-energy technology, and to encourage the development of ever more efficient new technologies. And the government can -- and should -- develop more sophisticated strategies like emissions trading and more stringent requirements for reducing carbon dioxide emissions everywhere.
Global warming is the most serious problem we face in the 21st century. Last week an intensive analysis by a respected geologist at Texas A&M University suggested -- as most scientists have been saying for some time now -- that human activity, not natural factors, is the primary cause of the warming.
We caused the problem and we have within our grasp a variety of potential solutions. To ignore those solutions, to be aware of them but not make use of them, is not just profoundly destructive, it's suicidal.

HEADLINE: War Without End in Sri Lanka

 BODY:
Few ethnic conflicts in the world are more savage than the war in Sri Lanka, an island nation off the southern tip of India. Since 1983, more than 60,000 people have died, many times the number killed in Northern Ireland. The fighting has so resisted outside efforts to mediate that Michael Ondaatje, in his powerful new novel "Anil's Ghost," refers to it as "a Hundred Years' War with modern weaponry." Since the spring, the war has heated up again with an anti-government offensive by separatist Tamils in Sri Lanka's north. But there has also been a positive development. The United States, India and other countries are increasingly united in trying to bring an end to the fighting.
In the 1970's, Sri Lanka was often hailed as a model of stability, democracy and economic progress in the third world. But for many decades, Sri Lanka's Tamil minority bristled under discriminatory policies of the government in Colombo, which is dominated by the ethnic Sinhalese majority. With covert help from India in the 1980's, a Tamil insurgency seeking independence in the north and east made extensive military gains. India came to its senses and kicked the Tamil rebels off Indian soil and sent its own troops to Sri Lanka. The troops were later withdrawn, but Tamil rebels retaliated by murdering former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991. 
 The northern city of Jaffna, once captured by the rebels, is controlled again by the government, but in the last two months 30,000 government troops have been besieged by the new Tamil offensive. The obvious way to stop the fighting would be to establish some sort of federation on Sri Lanka, with autonomy for Tamil areas. The government has accepted the idea but not gone far enough in its devolution proposals. Tamil rebels cling to their goal of independence. Moreover, the main rebel group, known as the Tigers, has killed off and wiped out rival moderate groups.
A mediation attempt by Norway made some progress earlier this year, but the offensive by the Tigers has put the possibility of talks on hold. One good sign is that President Chandrika Kumaratunga of Sri Lanka has been working with the main opposition party to agree on a set of new Tamil autonomy proposals. These need to be fleshed out, but the unity attempt is a step forward.
It may not be possible to restart the negotiating process until it is clear who will control Jaffna and the surrounding peninsula in the north. But all sides should recognize that there can be no military solution to Sri Lanka's troubles. The terror, assassinations and army clashes have gone on so long that, as Mr. Ondaatje writes, the original reasons have been all but forgotten.

HEADLINE: Summing Up: Is Our House Divided by Race?;
Jews and Race

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "How Race Is Lived in America": 
 The Jewish Council for Public Affairs, a network of national and local Jewish public affairs organizations, has just completed a two-year study of race and public policy based on the views of scholars, public officials and community activists who offered a range of ideological and political viewpoints.
These are among its findings: Jews largely support affirmative action that considers race among many factors. Also needed are effective antipoverty programs, true justice in the courts and quality public education. At the local level, members of the Jewish community are taking part in interracial socialaction coalitions engaged in projects that foster literacy, youth mentoring, low-and moderate-income housing, and economic development. What we learn from Judaism and Jewish history impels us to work to build a just society. Our vision is of a country that is inclusive and open, ensuring equal rights and opportunity for all.

HEADLINE: Insular Tribe of the Hamptons Struggles for a Political Voice;
A Younger Generation of Shinnecock Indians Asserts Itself in Calling Attention to Land Claims

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y.

 BODY:
The road leading into the Shinnecock Indian reservation is not a welcoming one. The sign marking the way reads, "Trespassers will be arrested."
Some uninvited people -- drug dealers and government workers -- have been fired upon after crossing onto tribal lands. Tourists are simply asked to leave. 
 The Indians are by nature an insular lot. The world outside their 800-acre reservation here on Shinnecock Neck knows little about them, and for 350 years, that's the way they have preferred it. Their dealings with society, they say, have never been good.
"It seems every time we've dealt with the white man, we've come out the worse for it," said Harriet Gumbs, a 79-year-old elder and a tribal historian.
The reservation is a postage stamp of marshland swamped by poverty and unemployment. For years, the Indians watched as land that was once theirs was transformed into upscale housing subdivisions. Although they quietly complained, there were few sympathetic ears at the local courthouse and Town Hall. After all, they had signed treaties and land-swap agreements, town officials say.
"They built on our ancestors' bones, and we never really did anything to stop it," said Elizabeth Haile, 69, a member of the Thunderbird clan who watched over the years as houses and other buildings sprouted up around the reservation. "That's changing with the young people."
East End power brokers on Long Island have taken notice as those in this new breed of Shinnecock have lain in front of bulldozers, marched on Town Hall and protested on the steps of the Capitol in Albany to stop the development of 62 acres of virgin woodland to the north of Montauk Highway, the road that separates the reservation from the rest of Southampton. The news of the protests has spread from Indian-run radio in Canada to the editorial pages of The News From Indian Country, a national newspaper published in Wisconsin.
The young Shinnecock have been radicalized by the success of tribes that used to be destitute, like the Oneida Indians. The Oneida reservation was once a tumbledown 32 acres in upstate New York, but the tribe now owns the state's largest casino and has a land claim wending its way through federal court asking for the return of 250,000 acres between Syracuse and Utica.
As a result, the younger Shinnecock Indians are talking aggressively about seeking claim to 3,600 acres of prime Southampton real estate that includes three golf courses -- among them the renowned Shinnecock Hills, to be the site of the United States Open in 2004 -- and Southampton College of Long Island University.
It is land that once belonged to the Shinnecock. It is land they want back. The tribe filed a petition with the federal government three years ago seeking recognition and has since raised the specter of casinos on the East End.
"A lot of my people are scared about what we're doing," said Becky Genia, 43, who left the reservation as a teenager in the mid-1970's and learned the politics of protest with the American Indian Movement. "We're surrounded by very rich people. The folks on the rez think that raising Cain about broken promises and miserable living conditions means they're going to take what little land we got left. I got news: they aren't going to touch another acre of it."
The developers say they hold a title to the disputed 62 acres that dates back more than a century and their claim to the property is built on firm legal ground.
"The homes are being built as we speak," said John J. Bennet, a lawyer for the developers, Parrish Pond Associates. "The Indians' lawsuit was thrown out of court."
The Indians have stopped short of laying formal claim to the 62 acres, but say the wooded site is a small but sacred portion of their heritage that should be preserved.
The Shinnecock is a state-recognized tribe, but one of more than 100 Indian tribes not acknowledged by the federal government. They have no access to federal education and health money and run no gambling operations. More important, they receive no legal assistance from the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, so their land claims hang in limbo.
According to archival records, in the early 18th century, the town of Southampton paid the tribe $20 for its land and gave it a 1,000-year lease on the 3,600 acres. In 1859, town officials convinced the State Legislature that the Shinnecock were willing to break that lease to allow the Long Island Rail Road to go through in exchange for outright title to the current reservation on Shinnecock Neck.
John A. Strong, a professor emeritus of history at Southampton College, said he believed that the Shinnecock were pressured into the deal and that the signatures on the document were faked. If a court should ever rule in the Shinnecock's favor, the tribe would hold legal title to billions of dollars in property.
"This new group of Indians have got people's attention," said State Senator Kenneth P. LaValle, a Republican who represents the area. "The buzzword is casino. Right now, the Indians don't have a friend in the world, but if they get the feds on board, imagine the fight. The Hamptons are the playground of the powerful. You think they'll stand for rabble coming out from the city to play cards, get drunk and urinate on their hedgerows?"
For the most part, the Shinnecock, a small Algonquin tribe, has been content with life on the south side of the Montauk Highway.
The Shinnecocks, like most American Indians, are of mixed blood. Some look as black as Africans, and others so white you have to study their faces to find a glimpse of Indian blood. Others look as Indian as Cochise. About 500 people live on the reservation, and 200 are scattered across the country. They honor the old traditions, partake in the sweat lodge and sing the old songs.
But those traditions are borrowed from the Western tribes, the songs from the Lakota Sioux. The last fluent speaker of Shinnecock died 40 years ago.
New homes are being built on the reservation by retirees who, after living in black society in cities like Washington and Los Angeles, have returned to the reservation, where they pay no property taxes. The income disparity on the reservation has widened. The main employers are the smoke shops and hot dog stands that line the highway and serve the weekend tourists. The tribal schoolhouse has been closed and Indian children attend public schools.
The Shinnecocks, for the most part, take a hostile view of politics, whether they are federal, state, town or tribal. But it is especially the tribal politics that tie the community in knots. Without a coherent voice of resistance for the tribe, the bulldozers continue to clear trees.
"Those old dogs, they're in it for themselves," said Ruben Bess Valdez, 45, a university-trained environmentalist, speaking of the tribal trustees. He said the leaders had in the past made land-use and right-of-way deals with the state, kept the money for themselves and kept the tribe in the dark. "If you're in it for yourself, how can you fight for anyone else?"
With little money for court battles, the tribe remains divided over the more aggressive tactics. On one side are the tribal trustees who hold nearly all the decision-making power in the lives of the 500 people on the reservation. On the other side are the brash group of college- and street-educated Indians who want a settlement now.
"We need changes now," said Chuck Quinn, who has been arrested for sitting on the 18th green at Shinnecock Hills in protest. "No more selling us out, no more backdoor deals with the whites."
So the Indians await word of their application for federal recognition. Such status would give the tribe the right to negotiate gambling deals with the state. The application process can take years, experts say, and the tribal trustees have yet to respond to a 1998 letter from the Bureau of Indian Affairs requesting more application materials.
Federal recognition would also mean that the tribe would have to draft a new constitution and set up a new government.
"The truth of the matter is that we need to come together on the reservation before we can make our demands to the general public," said Harold Dent, a Shinnecock and an adviser to the tribal trustees. "I am trying to make this point to the trustees. But people running around shouting willy-nilly isn't going to help our situation."
The reservation is a world apart from the rest of the Hamptons. Cancer rates among the Shinnecock are among the highest on Long Island. In a town where a poolside bungalow rents for $30,000 for the summer, the median per capita income on the reservation hovers around $6,000.
The reservation, in addition, has yet to be hooked up to the Suffolk County water supply. The Indians drink from an aquifer that is contaminated with the pesticide Temik at levels seven times the amount considered safe for human consumption, according to the Suffolk County Health Services Department.
"The water authority simply won't run them pipes," said the Southampton town supervisor, Vincent J. Cannuscio. "Somebody has to pay for it. And it's going to have to be the Shinnecock."
The Indians also cannot get home-improvement loans because the land is held in common and they have no mortgages. What is more, no Indian holds any meaningful elected or appointed town position.
"Their situation is the dirty little secret of Southampton," said Bob Zellner, a civil rights activist and adjunct professor of history at Southampton College.
That leaves people like Ms. Genia.
Her little house is as shaggy as a wet dog. She bathes in the poisoned water. She brushes her teeth with it. She makes coffee with it. In the mornings, she dresses in old blue jeans, flips through the talk shows and then walks down the road to make sure that a desperate friend has not hanged herself.
Her friend's house is falling in on itself. The rain drips through the roof like mercury. The woman inside has written letters to the local churches asking for financial help.
"Can you believe there are still people living like this?" Ms. Genia asked herself while looking in the broken window of her friend's shanty. She kicked on the door, looked in another window. There was no one hanging from the ceiling.
"At least that's one good thing," she said. "Why do people have to live like this in this day and age? I'm telling you, we're not going to take it no more."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: POLITICAL MEMO;
BUSH TRAIL TAKES ROSE GARDEN TURN

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
Out on the campaign trail, Gov. George W. Bush appears to be barely breaking a sweat these days.
Town hall meetings where large audiences are free to ask questions vanished months ago when Senator John McCain of Arizona, a master of spontaneity, disappeared from the presidential race. Now audiences rarely get to ask Mr. Bush anything. 
 On many days the governor makes no more than one or two public appearances, and occasionally they last no more than 15 minutes.
Mr. Bush's signature campaign events are small panel discussions that more resemble seminars on social services. Ostensibly, the sessions are about new policy proposals. But Mr. Bush's aides say they are just as much about mood, emotion and image. As the once troubled teenagers and single mothers who make up the panels tell Mr. Bush how they have overcome hardship, he responds with emotive language, words and phrases like "love" or "loving family" or "willing heart."
The style and schedule that Mr. Bush is keeping is deliberate, reflecting the campaign's strategic confidence that he can mold his image by carefully choreographing television images in battleground states.
In an era in which voters are more and more turned off by partisanship, the events make him seem to be governing rather than campaigning.
It is almost as if he is running a modified version of an incumbent's Rose Garden strategy, only he is not the incumbent, and the Rose Garden is not at the White House but in a handful of swing states.
That is not to say that Mr. Bush is not working hard. His days are filled with fund-raisers, policy meetings and interviews with reporters. He is putting the last touches on his convention speech, and is in the final phase of choosing a running mate.
Still, Mr. Bush's style could not be more different from that of his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, who is generally running behind in the polls and has longer, more event-packed campaign days. Mr. Gore takes question after question from larger audiences, showing off a detailed knowledge of subjects like immigration law and the history of Medicare.
But while the presidential race is only now moving into the critical convention period, Mr. Bush and his aides say his method of campaigning has produced good results. It has put him ahead in many crucial states and made him competitive in ones the Democrats had counted on.
At Bush headquarters in Austin, Tex., the staff keeps a blue and red color-coded electoral map that shows which way each state is leaning. Bush aides right now have a panorama showing Mr. Bush leading in states that are worth a combined 345 electoral votes and Mr. Gore leading in states worth a combined 92 electoral votes. The map shows states representing 101 electoral votes up for grabs. A candidate needs 270 to win the presidency.
"The good news is I'm leading some of the polls," Mr. Bush told state Republican officials gathered in Austin last week. "The bad news is the election isn't tomorrow."
So confident are the Republicans that after running about $5 million in advertisements promoting Mr. Bush's Social Security proposals, they let the Democrats spend about $14 million in key states on commercials promoting Mr. Gore and Democratic issues without responding.
"The race stayed the same," one Bush adviser said. The Republican Party is readying a new advertising campaign to lead into the Republican National Convention in two weeks.
Mr. Bush's aides attribute the state of the presidential race partly to a series of missteps by Mr. Gore over a rocky spring. But they also point to Mr. Bush's turn to a policy-oriented campaign style after the primaries ended. That was when he needed to erase the bitterness of his fight with Senator McCain and soften the hard conservative edges he had created for himself.
The Texas governor says he knew from the start that he wanted to campaign this way, much as he did in his first governor's race, in 1994. At that time he stuck to four issues with relentless repetition: juvenile crime, welfare overhaul, education and an overhaul of the legal system.
"Candidates tend to repeat the successes of the past," Mr. Bush said. "I found that ideas do drive campaigns."
Mr. Bush is using the same phrases he did more than a year ago, that he is a "compassionate conservative," that he wants to fight the "soft bigotry of low expectations" for minority students in public schools, that he wants to rally "the armies of compassion."
He says he does not get bored by the repetition: "I view it as an opportunity. What a good candidate has to understand is every minute is an opportunity to convey a message."
But he has used policy proposals to give himself and his themes more definition, showing how he is a traditional Republican and how he is not.
The groundwork for the policy offensive was set more than a year ago. Mr. Bush named three senior advisers for policy: Lawrence B. Lindsey for the economy, Stephen Goldsmith for domestic affairs and Condoleezza Rice for national security. He also assembled a large think tank under the leadership of Josh Bolten, who had worked in the administration of Mr. Bush's father.
But the final plan for policy proposals leading into the convention was put together by the campaign staff just as the primaries were coming to a close in early March.
The first speeches on education and health care and the environment put Mr. Bush squarely on Democratic turf with reading programs for poor areas and tax credits to help people who lack health insurance.
Then came broad proposals to reshape Social Security and rethink nuclear policy. They skipped all of the devilish details. But Mr. Bush's aides say they showed voters that Mr. Bush was willing to take risks.
Lately, he seems to be unveiling policies for every line item of the federal budget, an additional $75 million across five years for veterans mentoring, for example, or $400 million for after-school programs.
These latest proposals may seem small, but aides say Mr. Bush is using the ideas to shape his image. In a year in which no issue is dominating, a Bush adviser said, "issues are important but they are important as reflections of broader values and keys into a candidate's leadership." He said independent swing voters "are not taking their stands on individual issues, but their feelings about what values the candidate reflects."
Normally, a result is that in swing state after swing state, evening news programs show Mr. Bush surrounded by winsome minority children or troubled teenagers or poor-but-determined single mothers talking of hopes for building a better life. Only rarely is the script interrupted the way it was on Friday in New Jersey when a minister challenged Mr. Bush about the death penalty.
The dynamics of the presidential race could well change by the fall. Mr. Gore's aides say that a vice president traditionally does not come out from under the shadow of the president until the party convention. And they argue that the public still favors Democratic positions on issues, that Mr. Gore is better under pressure and that he will shine when the candidates meet in debates.
The governor promised today that he would not lie back and let Mr. Gore criticize his positions and his Texas record. "I'm a good counterpuncher," he said on the ABC program "This Week." "I am."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
Microsoft Sees Software 'Agent' as Way to Avoid Distractions

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: REDMOND, Wash.

 BODY:
Attention, please.
Hoping to shed its longstanding industry reputation as a mere imitator, not an innovator, Microsoft is spending heavily on research in a wide range of software technologies that include hand-held computing and voice recognition. But the most intriguing project may be taking place in the cramped office of Eric Horvitz, a devotee of an obscure, 17-century statistical technique that plays a key role in his current work. 
 In essence, Mr. Horvitz and his team of researchers are trying to make it possible, in the age of information overload, to reclaim the right to pay attention.
Using statistical probability and decision-theory techniques that draw inferences from a user's behavior, the team is developing software meant to shield people from information overload while they are working. The new software -- which Microsoft hopes to use in commercial products within the year -- would act as a combination secretary and traffic cop to hold back the torrents of electronic and voice mail, appointment requests and Internet information that increasingly threaten to overwhelm today's office workers.
In the view of many computer-design experts, restricting electronic interruptions to only the most urgent ones has become a pressing necessity in the Internet age.
"Most Internet entrepreneurs treat the users' attention as a third-world country to be strip mined," said Jakob Nielsen, a Silicon Valley expert on software useability.
Microsoft's top executives predict that if Mr. Horvitz's software goals can be reached, the company will be able to re-invent the personal computer user interface -- the visual and physical controls that since the mid-1980's have been fixed on the concept of mice, windows and on-screen menus.
In the view of Mr. Horvitz's team, this aging interface has allowed a deluge of electronic interruptions to cascade upon office workers with each new generation of technology, to the point that the telephone and potentially dozens of computer programs are now free to distract a person with impunity.
"If I had to write a book," Mr. Horvitz said in a recent interview, "It would be titled 'My Battle With Attention.' "
In the new world of the Attentional User Interface, as the researchers call it, a software program known as a notification manager would continuously monitor streams of data that include electronic mail, voice mail, Internet news alerts and so-called instant messaging notes.
The system would also observe whether the computer user was typing, talking on the phone or speaking with someone face to face in the office. Helping keep tabs of the user would be a small camera that could determine whether the person was present and looking at the computer screen.
But the Attentional User Interface would not be confined to the desktop computer. It would be a software cloak enveloping the users wherever they might be, able to alert them via cell phone, hand-held computer, pager or other digital means -- whenever and wherever the software deemed something worthy of their attention.
The notification manager software, which would reside on a remote computer out on the Internet, would use a continuously changing web of probabilities to evaluate each new piece of information in terms of its time value to the user. For the truly economic minded, the individual decisions could even be assigned monetary values.
If an e-mail message arrived from a colleague or a supervisor, for example, the system would try to determine how valuable it would be for the user to know about the message immediately. An urgent message from a family member might be assigned a value of $1, for example, while the colleague's message might be valued at 5 cents and the supervisor's at 25 cents.
In weighing the decision on whether to issue an alert, the notification manager software would take into account dozens of details -- like the time of day and whether the user was in his office, in a meeting, on the phone or behind the wheel. Having made the decision to send an alert, the program would also have enough information to know whether it should be displayed on the office computer screen or on the small screen of a cell phone, pager or other device.
"The software considers what the value of the information is and the cost of the disruption," Mr. Horvitz said.
The software is at the heart of the new post-PC ".NET strategy" that Microsoft announced last month. Even as its lawyers are intent on resisting a court-ordered break-up of the company, its technical staff is fixated on the idea of reinventing the computer user interface.
They are motivated, in part, by their desire to overcome the infamy of Bob -- an intrusive, cartoony on-screen valet Microsoft introduced with great fanfare in 1995 then quickly retired after it was ridiculed by computer users and reviewers. Despite that flop, William H. Gates, Microsoft's chief executive, who earlier this year also assumed the title of chief software architect, remains committed to the idea of software as an "agent" with human attributes.
"Throughout all those futuristic demos you've seen over the last few decades, there was always this concept of an agent, something working on your behalf," Mr. Gates said at a June 22 briefing where he introduced the company's .NET strategy. "Well, we now have what it takes to really build an information agent. We have rich decision software called Bayesian Inference Software that we can build down into the system that can track your usage and adjust in an automatic fashion."
Bayesian what, you say? The reference is to Bayesian statistical techniques -- so named for Thomas Bayes, a 17th-century English minister and polymath who described them in a posthumously published essay.
The Bayesian approach centers on a formula for updating the probabilities of events based on repeated observations. The formula, referred to as the Bayes rule, describes how to transform a current assumption about an event into a revised, more accurate assumption after observing further evidence.
In the late 1980's, artificial intelligence researchers seized on Bayesian techniques in part because more powerful computers were able to compute large networks of many variables quickly.
For Mr. Horvitz, the Bayesian approach came naturally. "I was a Bayesian before I knew what it meant," he said. "I was the kind of person who would look at events in the world and automatically consider the probability of certain events happening."
Mr. Horvitz's Microsoft Web site (www.research.microsoft.com/users/horvitz) makes his commitment to the Bayesian perspective clear. Along with the lists of dozens of academic papers on decision theory and Bayesian methods is a photo of Mr. Horvitz and his young son on a visit to the Bayes tomb in London.
Mr. Horvitz, who has a Ph.D. in computer science and a medical degree from Stanford University, is an intense man who incessantly taps his foot during an interview. As a self-described entrepreneur, he started an artificial-intelligence company -- Knowledge Industries -- while he was still in medical school, sometimes unsuccessfully juggling the two pursuits. Once, as he assisted in the operating room, the chief surgeon ordered a nurse to remove Mr. Horvitz's pager, which was buzzing impatiently.
Microsoft acquired the company in 1993, after it was discovered by Nathan Myhrvold, who was Mr. Gates's chief technologist at the time and who persuaded Mr. Horvitz and his researchers that their work could make a bigger impact within Microsoft.
Two years later, the Horvitz team saw its first commercial program become part of Microsoft's Office software. The program, based on Bayesian techniques, was a relatively simple tool known as the Answer Wizard, which tried to anticipate the needs of users looking up topics in the software's electronic documentation.
The Bayesian techniques have been widely adopted in Microsoft's products -- including the Paper Clip help wizard that pops up frequently to offer advice in the company's Office program. Many users, however, have criticized Paper Clip as an irritant, popping up too often with unwanted help.
Mr. Horvitz, who speaks apologetically about the Paper Clip program, said its shortcomings were the result of Microsoft's failure to implement all of his team's ideas.
There have been other missteps indicating that Bayesian techniques must be added to software with great care. In December 1998, for example, Blue Mountain Arts, the Internet greeting card company, filed suit after it discovered that a preliminary version of Microsoft's electronic mail software mistakenly filtered Blue Mountain's e-mail greeting cards into users' trash cans. The filter, which had been based on software developed by Mr. Horvitz's researchers, was repaired in the final release of the program. It was an important lesson, he said, in the risk of artificial intelligence making poor judgments.
The new Attentional User Interface is already employed in several experimental systems being tested In Mr. Horvitz's office. One, called Lookout, automatically reads electronic mail messages and attempts to schedule requests for appointments and meetings. Another system, Priorities, performs the calculus of deciding when and where to interrupt the user.
As one of the few computer users who has experienced such a software agent, Mr. Horvitz concedes that it has had a startling effect on him.
"There is a definite sense of a continuous, cross-device 'presence' that understands me and my life in a way that I had not been accustomed to -- and that people have not been accustomed to yet," he wrote in a recent e-mail message.
Indeed, some computer scientists familiar with Mr. Horvitz's work worry that the Attentional User Interface may be too disorienting.
"If a system changes in ways that are not predictable, it may be upsetting to the user," said Ben Schneiderman, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland. "The designers of these systems tend to create elaborate models, which can cause both users and designers to lose track of what's happening."
And Mr. Horvitz and his researchers themselves acknowledge that the information collected by the notification manager software -- potentially, information on the personal activities and movements of millions of people that would be stored on the Internet -- raises privacy and security issues that have yet to be resolved.
But Mr. Horvitz said he was confident that adequate security and privacy safeguards would be created. And he sees a vast array of other applications for his Bayesian approach.
"Come back in six months," he said. His researchers are now working on a conversational system they plan to use experimentally in the research group's reception area. He expects that the system will be able to greet and converse with new visitors. The conversation, he says, will be on par with speaking to a person who is hard-of-hearing.
Not perfect, but within shouting distance of the future world of software agents.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about software research at Microsoft based in part on a statistical technique developed by Thomas Bayes, an English mathematician and clergyman, misstated the century in which he worked. It was the 18th, not the 17th.
An article in Business Day on July 17 about Microsoft's plans for new software technologies to manage information overload misstated the company's relationship to an artificial intelligence company, Knowledge Industries. While Microsoft bought parts of it in 1993, the company remains independent; it was not wholly acquired.

HEADLINE: Drug War Awaits Attack of Killer Fungus

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS 

DATELINE: BOZEMAN, Mont.

 BODY:
Dr. David C. Sands holds out a clear plastic petri dish filled with a white fuzzy fungus growing across the bottom. This substance, he believes, is the key to ending much of the world's production of illicit drugs.
Members of Congress also believe that Dr. Sands and other researchers may be on to a powerful and environmentally safe method of killing not only coca plants, but also marijuana and poppy plants. The members have asked the government of Colombia to test a strain of Fusarium oxysporum over the next two years. If it proves effective, the disease will be sprayed on vast fields of coca plants there, and experts say it could wipe out much of the coca crop within a year. 
 The research holds such promise that officials at Montana State University ended it two years ago, fearing it could make the university a target of drug cartels. But the technique had already been developed.
Others are not sure that fusarium will be effective against the the cartels. "Efficacy is high on my list of concerns," said Eric Rosenquist, a United States Department of Agriculture official involved with international research programs. "You can put a lot of energy into this and get nothing out in the end." Mr. Rosenquist said a naturally occurring fusarium coca virus in Peru had killed only 40 percent of the crop there.
An attack on coca plants may be only a first salvo in the attack of the fusarium fungus. Dr. Sands and others believe that the use of fungal disease is an ideal way to kill a broad range of undesirable plants. Research on fusarium has been under way for years, and Dr. Sands and other scientists say the research is about to usher in an era of effective and environmentally safe controls that would be alternatives to chemical herbicides and genetically modified organisms.
Biological controls, the use of a pest's enemies against it, are old: centuries ago, the Chinese built bridges between trees so predatory ants could find and destroy aphids. But biological control is not yet proven as a viable alternative to chemicals. Most diseases and predatory insects, for example, are not especially deadly; they "farm" a plant, attacking it but not wiping it out, so they can keep consuming it. "They live in total coexistence, like real estate agents," Dr. Sands said. "They take a percentage. If they took too much they would be out of business."
But some diseases are especially virulent, wiping out most or all of the host. Phytophtora, a fungus that destroyed potatoes in 19th-century Ireland and caused the great famine there, is one. Fusarium, Dr. Sands said, is another of the "Attila the Hun" diseases, and there are strains of fusarium for virtually every cultivated plant and many wild ones.
A plant pathologist, Dr. Sands came to the field of bioherbicides in his search for a way to treat exotic plants from Asia that run rampant through Western range land because they are unchecked by native enemies. Some diseases found in Montana are being tested on these weeds. But a much more effective approach, Dr. Sands said, may be to bring back the fungal diseases that the weeds evolved with in Central Asia and elsewhere and use them as herbicides.
He has had collaborators scouring Kazakhstan and Russia for diseases that evolved with two especially difficult species, spotted knapweed and leafy spurge, and some have been shipped to the United States where they remain in a containment facility in Maryland awaiting approval to be used in testing.
In 1987, while working with weeds, Dr. Sands got a call from the department of agriculture. Worried about a revolution in Peru, Coca-Cola had established a coca plantation in Hawaii to assure a supply of the plant for its soft drinks. (The stimulating components of the plant are not included in the product.)
When the plantation was abandoned, the department used the plants to test herbicides that might be used in the drug war. But something killed many of the plants in a control plot that was not being sprayed. Dr. Sands discovered that it was a strain of fusarium.
Dr. Sands cultured the fungus and spread it as granules on a three-acre plot. It killed nearly all of the coca plants.
Fusarium is especially virulent on plants that dominate a landscape, he said. Dutch elm disease and chestnut blight are both fungal diseases similar to fusarium. They destroyed trees across America because those trees were the only ones that many cities planted.
While Dr. Sands believes that importing diseases can be an effective approach to combating exotic weeds in Montana, officials in Colombia say they will use an indigenous fungus, a strategy Dr. Sands also advocates, because coca is a native plant. But because politics as well as biology is involved, the outcome in Colombia remains in question.
Conservationists generally favor substitutes for chemicals in killing weeds, but some are not sure that de facto biological warfare is the answer. They worry about "mission drift"; a disease may start as an effective enemy of coca but somehow change hosts and kill important nontarget plants, like bananas, or attack wild relatives of the coca plant and threaten biodiversity.
Dr. Peter Stiling, a professor of biology at the University of South Florida who has studied introduced species, says possible unintended effects have not been sufficiently examined. "I am not prepared to come down on one side of the fence." Dr. Stiling said. "But I think we should be careful. It's difficult enough to find the nontarget effects of insects, and it's even more difficult for nontarget effects of fungi and bacteria."
Such problems are often subtle at first and might not be found for a long time, Dr. Stiling said. A study in Oregon has indicated that the use of Btk, a bacterial pesticide for control of the western spruce budworm, may have reduced the abundance and diversity of butterfly larvae.
"There are 500 people working on fusarium," Dr. Sands responded, "and we don't see it changing its host species."
So far, no environmental problems have been blamed on fusarium, largely because it has not been widely used in the United States.,
The use of fungal disease as a herbicide was studied before by the Agricultural Research Service, but the agency determined that it wasn't viable as a biological control primarily because it required a great deal of the product to cover the vast areas involved.
To make fusarium economical, Dr. Sands and other researchers have discovered they can use a native grass seed to culture the fungus. In a patented process, they spray fusarium on the seed and drop it; when it hits the ground the fungus multiplies. Once the fungus kills the coca plants, the theory goes, the grass seed or whatever seed officials choose to use, takes over for the dead plants.
What's more, the fungus lasts in the soil. "They kill and they survive the nongrowing season perhaps for as long as five years," Dr. Sands said.
Another advantage to fungal defoliants is that while chemicals must be sprayed on coca plants from very low altitudes during daylight, fusarium can be dropped from thousands of feet above the fields at night.
Although the university ended the fungus research, Dr. Sands said that others could easily follow his formula for making fungus-based bioherbicides.
Culturing fungus is fairly simple and can be taught in a couple of weeks, he said.
The coca producers could respond with a fungicide or disease-resistant plants, but Dr. Sands said that could take many years.

HEADLINE: Mexico's One-Way Remedy

BYLINE: By George J. Borjas; George J. Borjas, a professor of public policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, is author of "Heaven's Door: Immigration Policy and the American Economy."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
President-elect Vicente Fox of Mexico has wasted no time initiating a much-needed dialogue over U.S.-Mexican immigration issues. More than seven million Mexican immigrants now live in the United States, a number equal to 7 percent of Mexico's current population. And we get an additional 130,000 legal Mexican immigrants and 150,000 illegal ones annually. What Mr. Fox wants to do, however, is radical.
He proposes that the United States immediately provide 250,000 visas a year to Mexican nationals, accommodating much of the desire to move here, and that within 10 years, our countries share an open border, with free movement of people and goods. 
 This would be good for the Mexican economy, reducing labor market pressures, and pleasing to many Mexican immigrants in the United States, who maintain an interest in Mexican politics and are increasingly powerful there. But it would be far less likely to benefit the United States.
The U.S.-Mexico wage gap is among the largest between contiguous countries. A manufacturing worker in the United States earns four times the salary of a Mexican factory worker and 30 times that of a Mexican agricultural worker. These differences ensure that an open border would increase the number of immigrants.
No one knows how many more people would immigrate, but the Puerto Rican experience may be instructive. Puerto Ricans are American citizens who can move freely within the United States, and the differences in economic opportunities between Puerto Rico and the mainland are quite large. Not surprisingly, about 25 percent of Puerto Rico's population moved to the United States in the last 50 years. Even if the Mexican migration response were only half that of Puerto Rico, total Mexican immigration to the United States could conceivably be 12.5 million, compared with the current 7 million.
The new immigrants would probably resemble the Mexican immigrants already here, whose poverty rate exceeds 33 percent. Research that I conducted with my Harvard colleagues Richard Freeman and Larry Katz showed that the large-scale immigration of low-skill workers during the 1980's and 1990's, by increasing the pool of low-skill workers, reduced the relative wage of native workers with less than a high school education by 5 percentage points. This group's wages would be further eroded under Mr. Fox's proposals.
Some may say that Mexican immigrants take jobs that Americans do not want, but a more sensible statement is that Mexican immigrants take jobs that Americans do not want at the going wage. The service sector remains alive and well even in those parts of the country that have not been penetrated by heavy immigration. It just costs more to have a manicured lawn in New England than in Southern California.
Almost 30 percent of the immigrants now living in this country are of Mexican origin. (In 1920, after decades of heavy immigration, the three largest groups -- Germans, Italians, and Russians -- together made up only a third.) Numbers like these slow assimilation because a large immigrant group can maintain its separate identity, culture and language far into the future. It is unfashionable to view the melting pot as desirable, but is balkanization good for the United States?
The free movement of people is not the same thing as the free movement of goods. And, as we will surely relearn in the next economic downturn, the United States offers public services that are far more expensive to maintain when there are many immigrants who are poor and have low job skills.
The United States should begin to reflect more seriously on its huge income disparity with Mexico, and the onset of democracy there suggests that it may be time to think about a Marshall program to introduce permanent prosperity. But enacting Vicente Fox's proposals now would limit the economic opportunities available to America's less advantaged and would cause a higher level of immigration than the United States could comfortably sustain.

When a Questionable Past Pays Political Dividends

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: KAMPALA, Uganda

 BODY:
It was not the most conventional way for an aspiring president of Uganda to warm up a crowd. But it seemed to work.
"Thank you," Nasser Ntege Sebaggala said at a rally downtown recently, "for welcoming me at the airport when I was coming from jail in America." 
 The crowd rose up in cheers remembering that day in February, when Mr. Sebaggala, 52, a businessman and former mayor of Kampala, arrived home after serving one year of a 15-month federal prison term for passing bad checks in Boston. Flowers were uprooted along the route from the airport and strewn on the road. He took six hours for what normally might be an hour's ride.
Mr. Sebaggala has become a political phenomenon in Uganda, despite his obvious flaws. He is a convicted fraud. He is not well educated.
His English, the lingua franca of Uganda, is not only atrocious but comical. One of the national newspapers cruelly ran a verbatim transcript of an interview in English not long after came home. His native tongue is Luganda, the language of Uganda's largest ethnic group.
The truth is, he is popular because of his flaws, not to mention a well-honed populist touch. In the same way that some Americans may see a bit of themselves in Bill Clinton's indiscretions, some Ugandans who feel left behind in the nation's slow economic revival embrace the entire package of Mr. Sebaggala. They actually like the idea that he may have stolen $44,000 in one of the world's richest countries.
"We need Sebaggala," Mark Mukiibi, 25, a teacher, said at the rally. "He knows the people of the Uganda. He understand the problems of Ugandans."
Mr. Mukiibi dismissed any suggestion that Mr. Sebaggala's stint in prison might make it hard for him to run for president. "That was a very short time," he said. "It was not even a year."
The question is whether Mr. Sebaggala can, in fact, translate that popularity into the presidency. Early next year, Ugandans will elect a leader for only the third time in 21 years. If he runs -- and he says he will -- Mr. Sebaggala will face President Yoweri Museveni, who is his opposite in nearly every way.
Mr. Museveni, in office since he fought his way to power in 1986, graduated from Dar es Salaam University in Tanzania and is able to make campaign speeches into little history lessons. His English is flawless. He is a military man, while Mr. Sebaggala is a businessman. Mr. Museveni's career was in many ways formed against the dictatorship of Idi Amin in the 1970's, while Mr. Sebaggala's businesses did quite well then.
Mr. Museveni is often given credit for turning Uganda around after the ravages of Mr. Amin and another dictator, Milton Obote. But many people say Mr. Sebaggala's popularity is a reflection of the things still undone. Poverty and unemployment are still high. Uganda's involvement in the war in neighboring Congo is unpopular. Many people are tired of Mr. Museveni after 14 years in office and would like the political system, a so-called no-party state, opened up.
"There is so much cynicism" about Mr. Museveni, said Charles Onyango-Obbo, the editor of The Monitor, an independent national newspaper. "They are just throwing Sebaggala in his face."
"People were laughing at him" when he first returned home, Mr. Onyango-Obbo said of Mr. Sebaggala. "He couldn't speak proper English. But it's made him terribly popular."
Mr. Sebaggala, one of 23 children in a Muslim family of several wives, began his career as a sales representative of a dairy company in the early 1970's. In 1973 he started a textile company and became one of the leading businessmen in Kampala, as black Africans took over the economy after Mr. Amin expelled the ethnic Indian business class in the early 1970's. He was mentioned in newspaper articles as Uganda's youngest millionaire.
In April 1998 he beat the incumbent mayor of Kampala, Christopher Iga, who was backed strongly by Mr. Museveni, in a vote seen as a rebuke to the president. Soon after his election, he attended a conference on garbage disposal in the United States and ended up arrested in Boston. He was charged with passing eight fraudulent traveler's checks worth $44,000 and was convicted in December 1998.
In Uganda, trafficking in fake currencies and traveler's checks became a way of life for a certain class of businessman as Mr. Museveni liberalized the economy and foreign exchange in the late 1980's. But Mr. Sebaggala, who opened a foreign exchange business in 1992, denied that he had done anything wrong.
In an interview he said that among $2.5 million in deposits he had made in the Bank of Boston were some bad traveler's checks that a few customers had passed him without his knowledge. "I say you can't put me as responsible," he said.
The prison term only made his legend grow. He was released in December 1999, and his homecoming was a national event. He made his political ambitions clear as soon as he arrived.
"I am no longer a businessman," he said at the time. "I am a full-time politician." Then the next day: "I have come not only to liberate this country but to bring a revolution. If I am arrested you should not demand for my bail, because most people cannot afford the bail fee."
Since then he has campaigned around Uganda, at one point being shot at by government soldiers in the town of Mbarara, in what the government said was a mistake and Mr. Sebaggala says was an attempt on his life. He was a strong supporter of a boycott of the referendum held in June on whether to continue Mr. Museveni's "no party" system.
For all his talk of revolution, Mr. Sebaggala is not proposing anything especially radical. He wants a return to multiparty politics. He wants to increase the use of irrigation in farming, which employs more than 80 percent of Ugandans. He wants to attract more foreign business, particularly technology companies. He says he would expand education.
He said many of his political ideas had come from his time in the United States, which he said he admired very much despite the prison term. There is one area especially in which he would like Uganda to be more like the United States.
"Always when I am in campaign I mention your countrymen, like George Washington," he said. "You remember that they tried to put him for a third term? He said it was enough and the young generation should take over. What he did was great.
"I give the example that the more than 40 presidents, they relinquished power and have been buried in America. None of them went into exile."
In Uganda, since independence from Britain in 1963, every president has gone into exile. If all goes well, he would like to make Mr. Museveni the first not to.

HEADLINE: Putin Visits China In Hope of Strengthening a Strategic Axis

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, July 17

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia arrived in Beijing tonight on the first stop of an Asian tour intended to revive his country's faded diplomatic role in the region and build what could become a Chinese-Russian axis to counter American influence.
Mr. Putin is expected to sign at least six accords with Chinese leaders on Tuesday, including a joint statement with President Jiang Zemin condemning American proposals for missile defense systems over North America and Asia. Opposition to the American plan has accelerated a relationship that Russia and China describe as a "strategic partnership" intended to counter American power. 
 "The partnership is an effort to oppose hegemony and supremacy, and one single country dominating the world," said Zhao Huasheng, director of the Russian Studies department at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies.
On Wednesday, Mr. Putin travels to North Korea, where he is expected to ask that country's leader, Kim Jong Il, to forgo its missile development program. The United States has told Russia and China that the proposed American missile defense system is intended to counter threats posed by smaller, missile-armed states like North Korea.
Mr. Putin then stops in Blagoveshchensk, in eastern Russia, for a conference on a region that is experiencing increased immigration from China. He ends his tour on the Japanese island of Okinawa, where he is due to arrive late Friday for the annual gathering of leading industrial countries.
China is by far Mr. Putin's most important stop. It will be his first visit there since he was elected president in March. And it follows eight visits by his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, who agreed with President Jiang in 1996 to establish the strategic partnership to build a "multi-polar world," a euphemism to describe opposition to America's status as the world's sole superpower.
"Russia shares a strategic partnership with China and puts relations with Beijing among the highest priorities of its foreign policy," Mr. Putin said in an interview with China's state television last week.
While it is not yet clear how warmly Mr. Putin will embrace the Chinese worldview, Western analysts say the rapprochement between the countries is taking on an increasingly anti-American cast.
"On one level, this is classic realpolitik balance-of-power, but on another it has the appearance of a united front against the United States," said David Shambaugh, a China specialist at George Washington University and the Brookings Institution in Washington.
Mr. Jiang and Mr. Yeltsin had pledged to increase economic cooperation between the two countries to bolster that partnership, but bilateral trade has fallen far short of the targeted $20 billion a year, stagnating at around $6 billion. Russian arms sales to China account for much of that.
Mr. Putin hopes to change that, though it will not happen overnight. Russia's troubled economy presents a far less attractive export market for China than the United States, Europe and Japan, and Russian goods cannot compete in China against domestically manufactured products or high technology imports from Japan and the West. About the only things Russia can offer China besides arms are commodities like natural gas.
Among the agreements Mr. Putin is expected to sign in Beijing is one calling for a feasibility study for a gas pipeline from Russia's Irkutsk region to China. That project has been talked about for years with little progress, partly because China does not really need more natural gas.
Another deal on the table during Mr. Putin's visit is Russia's sale of a second pair of nuclear reactors for the Tianwan nuclear power plant in eastern China. An initial two Russian reactors are currently being built at the plant.
Still, weapons are likely to remain the strongest bond in the two countries' economic relationship. China wants weapons to modernize its military and Russia's overdeveloped arms industry is begging for customers with cash. Already, China has bought advanced fighter aircraft, submarines and Russian guided-missile destroyers.
Russia has become even more important to China since Israel bowed to American pressure earlier this month and canceled the sale to Beijing of an early-warning radar system mounted atop a Russian jet. Russia could supply China with similar technology.
Mr. Putin's large delegation includes Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and the director of Russia's arms exporter Rosvooruzheniye, Alexei Ogarev. And China is expected to place additional weapons orders during Mr. Putin's visit.
China remains decades from developing a military force sufficient to challenge the United States, but it is intent on building a credible threat to Taiwan, over which Beijing claims sovereignty. Though China has repeatedly threatened to recover control of the island by force, it does not currently have the military capability to do so.
That military build-up is just one of the many areas in which China and Russia's economic and political interests converge. Russia not only offers China the hardware necessary to achieve its goals in the Taiwan Strait, it also acts as a potential diplomatic counterbalance to any intervention by the United States, which supports Taiwan.
China, for its part, has stood by Russia in opposition to the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and in Moscow's brutal war against separatists in Chechnya. Beijing sees parallels between those cases and separatist movements in its own regions of Tibet and Xinjiang, where it fears Western condemnation or even intervention if conditions deteriorate.
In fact, Mr. Putin first met Mr. Jiang earlier this month in Tajikistan, bordering Xinjiang, where they signed an agreement to fight ethnic separatism and terrorism in the region.
Still, those areas of common interest pale in comparison to the American missile defense proposal, which both countries see as a means of securing the United States military dominance in the world.
"Of course, since this will affect both international security, the security of Russia and China, I can tell you I expect that we will have to have more consultations and discussions to find out ways and means to eliminate or at least reduce this kind of security threat," Sha Zukang, head of the Foreign Ministry's Department of Arms Control and Disarmament, said last week.

Rich Get Cable Deals, Poor Get Rabbit Ears

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
What a fascinating confluence of events: last Friday, a blue-ribbon commission studying baseball's economics recommended that teams share up to 50 percent of their local revenues, including television fees.
On the same day, a lawsuit filed against the Yankees by MSG Network revealed that the team has made a deal with the many-tentacled International Management Group to create a cable television network that will pay the team $65 million next year and $119 million by 2010. 
 Teams were jealous enough of the Yankees' MSG deal, which expires after this season, when the world champions will receive $55.4 million.
Think of the envy of teams with puny television deals, which cannot support a $100 million payroll or win three World Series in four seasons.
Think of the Pirates, with only $7 million in TV cash, or the poor Padres, with a mere $6 million, according to Broadcasting & Cable magazine. The Expos have no TV deal!
Even a new Pirates or Reds stadium won't level the revenue field much; eventually, the Yankees will get a new ballpark that will generate so much cash that George Steinbrenner's squad may have no solvent teams to compete against.
Back to the blue-ribbon panel. It hardly seems possible that Steinbrenner endorsed the creation of a network that would generate still more TV cash in order to kick half of it back to revenue-poor clubs.
Imagine a sitdown between Steinbrenner and Harvey Schiller, the chairman of YankeeNets, the parent company of the Yankees.
"I feel bad for my Padres pals," the Boss says. "They've lost $72 million since 1995 and I've made $64 million. Dang it, if I prosper, the Pods got to prosper. Got it, Harv?"
Right now, teams contribute 20 percent of their net local revenues to a major league pool, with only one-quarter of the money redistributed to teams below the industry's average local revenue. The rest goes equally to all clubs.
The panel suggested pooling 40 percent to 50 percent of all local revenues in a yet unspecified way.
Don't expect Steinbrenner, the future impresario of the New York Sports Network and sovereign of a new stadium with 150 luxury suites, to gladly hand over half of these wonderful revenues to enhance the cause of major league socialism.
Who is to say sharing more revenues will help struggling teams? Why give the weak sisters a windfall for being, well, weak sisters?
Page 1 of the commission's report noted that existing revenue sharing has not helped competitive balance; needy teams did not use the cash to pay players. "Some low-revenue clubs," the report said, "believing the amount of their proceeds from revenue sharing insufficient to enable them to become competitive, used those proceeds to become modestly profitable."
The commission linked more revenue sharing to setting minimum payrolls, discouraging teams from lining their greedy pockets. Good old George Steinbrenner can help. If he pooled half his network cash, the poor teams could sign more players and post higher profits. All thanks to George. Imagine the acclaim that would shower down on our corporate Yankee Doodle Dandy if he personally pushed other teams into the black.
The Expos, in a market that doesn't sustain a team with a teensy payroll, lost $5.1 million from 1995 to 1999. Just send a few more million over the border, George, just a few more. Help put us over the top.
Montreal's owner, Jeffrey Loria, might have trimmed his losses if he hadn't jacked up his TV contract demands beyond what any station would sanely pay.
With the Yankees, there is no such concern. MSG would likely pay semi-insanely to keep the Yankees, the bulwark of the network. What would MSG carry in the spring and summer without the Yanks? Metro Guide programming?
Cablevision would probably pay from $75 million to $100 million a year to preserve the Yankees on MSG. But MSG is in a war of retention. In its lawsuit, MSG claims that the new Yankee network is not an offer that it can match, under its right to match any outside offers for Yankee rights.
The Yankees followed the contract, presenting the network as its offer and challenging Cablevision to do exactly what I.M.G. plans to do.
"There's nothing to match," said Bob Gutkowski, who made the Yankee deal at MSG when Paramount Communications owned it. Paramount outbid Cablevision's Sportschannel New York (now Fox Sports New York) to snare the Yankees. Eventually, Cablevision acquired Madison Square Garden.
Gutkowski, now the president of Worldwide Entertainment & Sports, has seen the other side of the Yankee equation. Between 1997 and 1999, as an executive for the Marquee Group and SFX Sports, Gutkowski counseled Steinbrenner on creating a network of his own.
"The Yankees don't want to sell their rights, so George is creating an equity base and a competitor," he said, noting that Cablevision's matching right does not preclude the Yankees from changing their desires from a straight rights deal to a network. "I think the Yankees will win. And losing the Yankees will be a huge body blow to Cablevision. MSG may have to be folded into Fox Sports New York."
In the first phase of the Yankees-MSG battle, Judge Barry A. Cozier issued a preliminary injunction to keep the Yankees from consummating the network deal. Barring a settlement, the two sports fat cats will meet in court on July 31, the day the network deal is set to close. Now, this is great interleague baseball.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Bar Needs Raising on the Bottom Line

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
Page 84 of the 87-page blue-ribbon panel's report on baseball economics is the one that probably raises the most eyebrows. It lists each club's profit or loss over a five-year period, 1995 to 1999.
Black ink means profit. The numbers next to only three teams are in black -- the Yankees, the Cleveland Indians, the Colorado Rockies. Red ink means loss. The Atlanta Braves, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Chicago Cubs are among the 27 teams that have red numbers next to their names. 
 The skeptics seriously doubt that those three teams, which are owned by news media giants, lost money. They suggest that the value of their teams' cablecasts is grossly undervalued because their owners own the cable outlets, too. The skeptics know, too, that baseball owners have been known to be less than forthcoming in certain matters.
In fact, earlier this year, a federal appellate judge minced no words in his view of the owners' behavior in the mid-1980's, when they colluded against free agents in violation of the labor agreement. Writing the decision in Steve Garvey's appeal of his collusion award, Judge Stephen Reinhardt said: "The owners' mendacity in their 1980's collusive efforts to depress the ballplayers' income was in many ways as damaging to baseball as the Black Sox scandal of 1919. The scope of the owners' deceit and fabrications in their 1980's effort to cheat their employees out of their rightful wages was wholly unprecedented, as was the financial injury suffered by the ballplayers."
The four members of the blue-ribbon panel did not create the profit-and-loss table included in last week's report. The figures on that page were provided to them, as were all of the financial figures in the report. The report, the panelists said, was wholly theirs, including the recommendations that are the focus of the report.
But three people with close ties to management said that Commissioner Bud Selig reviewed various drafts of the report and sent it back for stiffer recommendations. Selig yesterday flatly denied any involvement. "Absolutely untrue," he said.
What is clear from the final version of the report is that no high-revenue, big-spending teams had any input in its formulation. The major recommendations, covering increased sharing of local revenue and a harsher payroll tax, are aimed directly at them. In the three years the luxury tax on payrolls existed (1997 to 1999), the Yankees paid about $16 million. If the panel's formula were in effect this season, the Yankees would pay almost that amount for 2000 alone.
George Steinbrenner, who has opted to refrain from comment on the report, will not easily accept the panel's plans if the owners decide to adopt them. Besides feeling he should not have to support poorly managed teams, the Yankees principal owner is outraged that some teams that have received funds from the existing revenue-sharing plan have pocketed the money rather than spending it on players to become more competitive.
On the first page of the report, the panel writes, "Some low-revenue clubs, believing the amount of their proceeds from revenue sharing insufficient to enable them to become competitive, used those proceeds to become modestly profitable."
Hey, George, thanks for your contribution, but I think I'll buy myself a Learjet instead of a cleanup hitter.
The owners often act against their collective best interests when suggestions for improvement are made. They generally agree, for example, that some form of realignment is needed, but individually the owners say let the other guy change leagues.
The report also recommends that teams with little chance for financial success be given "the option to relocate if better markets can be identified."
The Oakland Athletics have talked of moving south to San Jose or elsewhere in Santa Clara County, but the San Francisco Giants say not so fast. That territory belongs to them, and they will not allow it to be inhabited by a rival team. For several years, there has been talk of moving a franchise to Washington, D.C., or northern Virginia, but the Baltimore Orioles claim territorial possession there.
The report says a team could move into a large market that already has a team, citing enhanced economic prospects for all concerned. But how loud would the Yankees' tantrum be if a team wanted to move to northern New Jersey?
While concern is focused primarily on Montreal and Minnesota as trouble spots, Florida is becoming a baseball wasteland. H. Wayne Huizenga wrecked the future of baseball in south Florida when he decimated the 1997 World Series champion Marlins, then sold the team. Despite the remarkable rebuilding job General Manager Dave Dombrowski has done with good young players, the Marlins cannot attract fans or get a new stadium.
Across the state, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays are proving that baseball should never have put a team in St. Petersburg. After the franchise was awarded, but before the Devil Rays began playing, some owners thought it was a mistake that should be corrected. Now the mistake is there for all to see.
"I think it is a good baseball market," Vincent Naimoli, the Devil Rays' managing partner, said in a recent interview. Looks sure must be deceiving.
Interest in baseball is so low in Florida that the two teams could not even generate big crowds for their interleague games. Three games in south Florida drew 46,131; three in St. Petersburg drew 79,505, with the bulk of the biggest crowd (42,823) attracted by a Christian concert. "Most of the people stayed for the game," a club employee said.
The blue-ribbon panel didn't say anything about concerts.

HEADLINE: Shortchanging Foreign Aid

 BODY:
Although there are some positive elements in the foreign aid bill that the House passed last week, it is still seriously flawed and has rightly invited a veto threat from President Clinton. The basic problem is that the overall allocation is far too low to meet American foreign policy objectives. Both the House bill and the Senate version that passed in June are nearly $2 billion below the White House request for fiscal 2001.
Both spending bills make severe cuts in White House funding for multinational development banks that make basic infrastructure loans to the poorest countries. They also fail to finance international women's health programs adequately, and reduce funding for peacekeeping and nuclear nonproliferation efforts. The House, for instance, would cut the administration's contribution to development loans by 40 percent. 
 In addition, the House bill contains an unacceptable provision that would deny American assistance to any foreign organization that uses its own money to provide abortions or engages in political debate to change abortion laws. Under longstanding law, no United States government funds may be used to pay for abortions or to lobby on abortion policy in other countries. Last year Congress went further, barring groups from using other funds to engage in those activities. The Clinton administration accepted a one-year restriction as part of a deal with Congressional Republicans to pay back dues owed to the United Nations. This anti-democratic gag rule on abortion advocacy should now be abandoned.
Mr. Clinton is also calling on Congress to raise international family planning aid overall. The House bill maintains funding at the inadequate level of $385 million, which is 30 percent below 1995 levels, before Congress slashed the program.
The House did, however, approve an amendment to increase funding for debt relief for the world's poorest nations, to meet Mr. Clinton's request of $225 million. Debt relief is crucial because the poorest nations are spending up to 60 percent of their budgets to service debt on old loans, and are unable to direct scarce resources toward health and social investments that can reduce poverty. But the House failed, as did the Senate, to provide $210 million for debt relief in supplemental spending for the current fiscal year.
The House wisely adopted an amendment to finance global AIDS programs at the president's request of $244 million. But those funds came out of other important foreign operations accounts.
The Senate bill does not contain the anti-abortion provision, but it has only a paltry $75 million for debt relief, and deserves a veto for that funding shortfall. These unrealistic, crippling cuts most likely mean that the final foreign aid numbers will have to be part of the budget negotiations between the White House and Congress later in the year.

HEADLINE: Insurers Said To Continue Racial Bias

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Nearly a month after one of the largest insurers in the United States agreed to pay more than $215 million in penalties and restitution to resolve claims that it charged black customers more for coverage than white ones, regulators in Florida and Georgia said they suspected some companies were continuing to discriminate.
The regulators said they thought that at least four companies were continuing to discriminate in premium collections in Georgia and at least one was doing so in Florida. But they said their investgations were in the preliminary stages and that the number might well grow as they gathered more information. 
 Both Bill Nelson, the insurance commissioner in Florida, and John W. Oxendine, the commissioner in Georgia, issued orders yesterday that the practice be stopped immediately. The orders apply to 28 companies in Florida and 23 in Georgia. Ignoring the order, the regulators said, could lead to fines and revocation of sales licenses.
Neither state would identify companies suspected of discrimination. But they said that while they developed their cases, they wanted to pre-empt further discrimination.
"We don't want to let another day go by with consumers paying higher premiums because of the color of their skin," Mr. Nelson said.
On June 21, American General, the nation's fourth-largest life insurer, agreed to pay $215.5 million in fines and restitution to settle a class-action suit and accusations by regulators that for decades it had charged black customers up to 30 percent more than it charged white ones for burial insurance. American General acknowledged that it had continued to collect the discriminatory premiums until April, when Mr. Nelson ordered the company to stop.
Just last week, the two largest American life insurers -- MetLife and Prudential Insurance of America -- were accused in separate class-action suits of charging blacks more than whites for coverage. Both companies acknowledged they had priced life insurance based at least in part on race but said they stopped collecting premiums on all burial policies, known as industrial life, in the early 1980's.
For decades, until the civil rights actions of the early 1960's, the insurance industry sold life insurance based on actuarial tables indicating that blacks were likely to die sooner than whites. Later, the actuaries came to believe that longevity was related to economic conditions rather than race.
Anticipating paying death benefits to blacks sooner than to whites, the insurers charged blacks higher premiums. In many cases, the companies also often charged both blacks and whites more in premiums than the policies would eventually pay their heirs.
Florida began investigating the discrimination last fall. In Atlanta, Mr. Oxendine said his office had begun looking into companies in Georgia just last month. "We definitely see indications that some of these policies are still in force and that the race-based premiums are still being collected," he said. "We've just started. We haven't looked at most of the companies yet."

HEADLINE: Wowing Them With Excess in the Hamptons

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN 

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y., July 16

 BODY:
To take the temperature of excess in the Hamptons this summer, join Jay Lieberman in the shower of the 12,000-square-foot house that he hopes to sell for $8 million, preferably to someone who will pay cash.
Mr. Lieberman, a builder, has taken a seat in the shower stall of the "his" bathroom in the master bedroom. He proudly points to a shower head that is 10 inches in diameter and is capable of caressing the human body with 22 gallons of water per minute (about nine times the maximum flow allowed in New York State, but unlikely to result in any legal woes). That super-size spritzer costs $800. But it is merely an appetizer for what awaits across the hall in what Mr. Lieberman calls "the last word in bathrooms." 
 The "hers" bathroom has a skylight, radiant heat in the floors, wiring for satellite television. Like the "his" bath, the showpiece here is in the shower: an all-exposed, hand-machined, hand-polished, nickel-plated, thermostatic mixer with overhead shower and hand sprayer on a cradle. It costs $3,000.
"There isn't anything in this house that I did not pull out all the stops for," Mr. Lieberman boasts. "Whoever takes this house will be a client with a lot of money who walks in and says, 'Wow!' "
Based on the frenzied pace of speculative construction here this summer and the frazzled lives of workers doing the building, the Hamptons have never before been invaded by so many rich people wanting to be wowed and demanding that it happen fast.
The invasion has driven construction costs to record levels, seduced builders, architects and even carpenters to build houses on "spec," choked roads with commuting workers and encouraged subcontractors to insist on bonuses merely for showing up on time. It also has enriched and exhausted nearly everyone willing to drive a nail, paint a wall or dig a swimming pool.
Mr. Lieberman's house ranks among the most expensive ever built in the Hamptons without a contracted buyer. Part of the reason it is so expensive is what goes on in its 9 1/2 bathrooms. Each bath, excepting the maid's, has faucets imported from England that cost an average of $2,000 each. The company that made them, Barber Wilsons & Company Ltd., does faucets for the Queen of England and for Steven Spielberg.
"You can't price yourself out of this market," said Carmine Cornacchio, owner of Cornacchio Electric here in Southampton. He and his crew of 20 electricians specialize in custom wiring for houses selling for $2 million to $3 million. Such houses, Mr. Cornacchio said, usually include high-tech devices that, for example, allow an owner stuck in traffic on the Long Island Expressway to turn on the hot tub with a cell phone.
Echoing the sentiments of many architects, builders and subcontractors in the Hamptons, Mr. Cornacchio said that this year it has become all but impossible to put off mansion-hungry clients by charging outrageous prices.
Several subcontractors said they are making record profits, and a few have used the windfall to buy big-ticket toys, like airplanes. But they also said it would be bad business to talk publicly about their new wealth. Steven Gaines, who lives in the Hamptons and whose best-selling book "Philistines at the Hedgerow" (Little Brown, 1998) chronicles the hijinks of rich residents, said his plumber now owns a plane. Mr. Gaines said, however, that disclosing the plumber's name would mean that he would have to find somebody else to fix his toilet.
John Tortorella builds swimming pools for the rich and famous in the Hamptons. His clients have included Billy Joel, Peter Jennings and Kathleen Turner. This year, he said, has been the busiest and most lucrative of his 19 years in the swimming-pool trade. But he said overwork is making him question the meaning of success.
He is exhausted, his employees are exhausted, and still the orders for bigger, more costly and more complicated swimming pools keep rolling in. Five years ago, he said, a $200,000 pool was considered "pretty huge." Now, his company, J. Tortorella Swimming Pools, is rushing to complete five pools, the cheapest of which will cost $1.5 million.
"Now we are talking 'backyard concepts,' with a pool, a spa, a pergola, a stone bridge, wrought iron gates," said Mr. Tortorella, who has begun to design his biggest pools along historical themes like the lost island of Atlantis, ancient Egypt and Stonehenge.
"Everybody used to talk about the go-go 80's like they were so wonderful," he said. "Well, the 80's were like child's play. It is ridiculous now. The amount of time and stress that my people have had to put up with is inhuman."
The minting of millionaires in Manhattan is far outpacing the supply of skilled labor and good property in the Hamptons, according to local government officials on the East End of Long Island.
As the number of prime lots dwindles, the chief building inspectors in the towns of Southampton and East Hampton said, million-dollar houses are being built near town dumps and on misshapen or poorly drained parcels of land.
"People are building on properties now that they wouldn't have even looked at 10 years ago," said Don Sharkey, the chief building inspector for the Town of East Hampton. "In a couple of years, we are going to run out of buildable parcels."
The shortage of land, combined with local moratoriums on some kinds of subdivisions and the possibility of far more restrictive development rules in the near future, have helped push home prices this year to levels that stun veteran real estate agents.
"We have seen the biggest-ever across-the-board quarterly jump in home prices in the Hamptons," said Diane Saatchi, president of Dayton-Halstead Real Estate, which publishes a quarterly report on home prices in seven markets in the Hamptons. Figures for the first quarter of 2000 came out last week.
They show that in the Village of East Hampton, summer home to the likes of Mr. Spielberg and Martha Stewart, the average price of houses has jumped in the last three years to $2.1 million from $1.2 million. More than two-thirds of that increase occurred during the first quarter of this year, according to the report.
Ms. Saatchi, voicing an opinion shared by many builders and architects, speculates that the boom is fueled by continued strength in the stock market and by aging baby boomers in Manhattan who find themselves with buckets of excess money.
"They have gotten to a point where they are in their prime earning years, their kids are through college, and they need houses that are big enough to accommodate several generations and kids from multiple marriages," said Ms. Saatchi, who has been selling real estate in the Hamptons for 14 years.
Whatever their reasons, buyers are spreading so much money so fast that the craftsmen in the Hamptons are at risk of drowning in a flood of trickle-down economics. The unemployment rate in Southampton hit a record low of 2 percent this spring. For skilled labor, New York State employment officials said, the jobless rate in the Hamptons is about zero.
"The East End of Long Island is the tightest skilled-construction market in the United States, without compromise," said Daniel McMillan, regional vice president of Trade Source, a company in Greenwich, Conn., that recruits and places craftsmen in construction jobs around the country. "We have hired a former Navy recruiter to go around the Hamptons and talk to anybody who is wearing work boots and driving a pickup."
With more jobs than workers to fill them, Trade Source two weeks ago began offering a free carpenter's course to recent high school graduates. The first class was convened in an office building in the Suffolk County hamlet of Bohemia, about an hour's drive from the Hamptons.
"I figure that if I improve my skills, I can bump my wages from $15 to at least $25 an hour out in the Hamptons," said John Vitale, 23, who showed up for the course. "The money is definitely out there."
To keep pace with demand, a number of Hamptons builders have begun hiring immigrants from Central America to frame houses, shingle roofs and build swimming pools.
"They broke out of the landscaping business about two years ago, and now they are rising through the trades," said Al Tuff, a builder in Bridgehampton who employs recent immigrants and who said his business would shut down without them.
Miguel Velasquez, a Salvadoran immigrant who has been in the United States for six years, earns $23 an hour and works 12 hours a day, seven days a week, for Mr. Tuff, who also employs Mr. Velasquez's two sons, Carlos and Victor, both in their early 20's. They, too, usually work 12 hours a day, seven days a week.
"There is just too much work," Mr. Velasquez said.
Elected officials in the Hamptons are struggling to find ways to slow the pace of development, and a few are conceding that local governments have all but lost the fight.
"For the last decade, we have been building houses at a rate of a house every single day," said Jay Schneiderman, the supervisor in the Town of East Hampton. "We have added probably 20,000 people to our summer population without changing any significant infrastructure. That is creating tremendous stress on the quality of life in this area. It has not been a balanced approach."
Mr. Schneiderman said that town governments, even with millions of dollars to spend on buying up vacant land, are finding it difficult to persuade speculators to sell.
"A builder would rather build a spec house," Mr. Schneiderman said. "He knows that the profit he'll yield will far exceed what he'll make selling us vacant land. That makes it difficult to preserve vacant space."
Mr. Lieberman, builder of the $8 million house with the pricey shower heads, said: "Even I realize that there is a certain amount of property that should be preserved. Things are obviously getting difficult."
Difficult or not, Cindi Crain, a former magazine editor, said she is going ahead with her dream house, which she is planning to build on two acres of land she bought for $1 million in 1998.
Ms. Crain, 31, who has family money (Crain Communications, publisher of Advertising Age and Crain's New York Business), said she has been warned repeatedly by friends about the impossibility of getting a house built on time and within a budget.
She has been forced by soaring design and construction prices to raise her budget for her planned 6,000-square-foot house to about $3.5 million from $1.5 million.
She intends to elude the pain of summer in the Hamptons by sticking to back roads, staying away from overcrowded restaurants and never commuting from Manhattan on Fridays or Sundays.
And why is this worth $3.5 million?
"You really feel the sea out here. You suck in the sea air," Ms. Crain said. "You can still chill out in the Hamptons, if you know what you are doing."

HEADLINE: With New York's Apples in Ruin, Growers Fear for a Way of Life

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

DATELINE: MILTON, N.Y.

 BODY:
Usually, when hail descends on the picturesque apple orchards of the Hudson Valley, it strikes fitfully, wreaking havoc on a farmer's field of Empires, say, but sparing his McIntoshes. But this spring's hail was different.
Two storms pelted newly formed apples with jagged balls of ice on more than 7,000 acres, and as the apples have grown, the tiny bruises have turned into ugly divots. Two thousand of those acres were so badly hurt that farmers are abandoning them entirely this season. In all, some 2.09 million bushels, about a third of the crop, are expected to be lost in what farmers say is the worst crop damage in memory. 
 "The wind was so strong that it drove the hail into the apples like bullets," said Jeffrey D. Crist, a fourth-generation apple grower who said he had no choice but to let the deformed apples in his orchard here drop to the ground this fall.
In earlier times, apple farmers would curse Mother Nature and hope for better luck next year. But a number of economic forces -- from depressed prices resulting from a worldwide glut of apples to spotty insurance coverage to demands for flawless fruit -- have pushed the Hudson Valley farmers to the brink. Many are wondering aloud whether the 10-minute hail bursts in May and June will be the straws that finally break them -- and in the process alter an austere landscape of gnarled trees and open sky forever.
Indeed, as the apple growers band together to ask the federal government for direct cash assistance of $20 million to cover their losses, they are talking as much about open space and suburban sprawl as about agriculture, speaking a language that resonates with politicians, tourists and the many owners of weekend houses here in Ulster County, the second largest apple-producing county in a state that is second only to Washington in apple production.
A dozen or so farmers met this month with Representative Benjamin A. Gilman in an orchard in Orange County south of Milton, a hamlet just west of the Hudson about 70 miles north of Midtown Manhattan. The growers evoked a potential consequence of their financial crisis in apple-producing counties like Ulster, Orange, Columbia and Dutchess, where a wave of new building has swept through in the last decade.
"Do we just go home and call our Realtor or do we hang in there?" Roderick Dressel of Dressel Farms in New Paltz asked on a crisp, breezy day that felt like fall. "We're asking for a one-time Band-Aid to keep our industry going, to preserve open space and to prevent it from all going to traffic and septic tanks."
In 1985, 104 farms covered 11,629 acres in Ulster County. By 1996, the most recent year for which statistics are available, the number of farms had fallen to 63 on 8,632 acres. The decisions now being made by apple growers like Anthony Porpiglia could accelerate the trend. Having lost 60 percent of his apple crop to the May 18 hailstorm in Ulster County, Mr. Porpiglia says he cannot borrow money, even at the low interest rates available to farmers in a declared disaster area. Instead, he is looking to one of his eight orchards to make him whole.
"Our debt load is tremendous, and we don't want to get any deeper," Mr. Porpiglia said. "We have an orchard -- 35 acres in Ulster Park in the middle of a development. We're thinking of selling it. It's a valuable piece of land."
Experts in farming practices say that when more than a third of the apples in an orchard are damaged, it does not pay to harvest the remaining good ones.
"The pickers are paid based on volume and there's really no way to slow a picker down so that he would turn over each piece of fruit and examine it, said Michael J. Fargione, an educator with Cornell Cooperative Extension, a program of Cornell University that provides research information and educational programs to farmers. "Even a small ding is enough to have that fruit rejected by a grocery chain."
Gov. George E. Pataki asked the United States Department of Agriculture on June 18 to declare large sections of the Hudson Valley a disaster area, as well as some two dozen counties across the state where heavy rains damaged a number of other crops. But the federal agency has yet to do so.
Many farmers say they would not be eligible for the low-interest loans available through the disaster program anyway. Farmers must first be turned down by their regular lenders in order to qualify for loans, but banks are more than happy to lend to growers who have ample collateral in the form of valuable land.
In the meantime, farmers who carried hail insurance are having a tough time collecting on their claims. The insurers argue that hail-damaged fruit can still be used for the juice market. But the juice market is so weak that the cost of harvesting the bruised apples would exceed the price paid for the fruit.
"The cider market is $1.20 a bushel and it costs $4 a bushel to pick it," said Russ Bartolotta Jr. of Klein's Kill Fruit Farms in Germantown, N.Y., across the Hudson River in Columbia County. "Economically, you're committing suicide to go in there and try to salvage. You're going to throw good money after bad."
A bushel of apples sold for fresh fruit rather than juice would have brought a farmer $6 in 1995. Today, the same bushel brings $3.50, apple growers say. Farmers say, too, that walking away from an apple orchard for a season does not free them from maintaining it. "You still have to mow and trim the orchards and spray so certain insects and fungus don't get in there," said Mr. Bartolotta, who estimates that 90 percent of the apple crop was ruined on his family's 320 acres of orchards. "There are things you have to keep doing so next year's crop won't be affected."
A few factors have made apple farmers in New York State particularly vulnerable to a setback like hail damage. The apple industry has suffered from depressed prices in recent years, the result of a worldwide overproduction of apples and exports of cheap apple-juice concentrate to the United States from China. In addition, a key export market for the United States -- Southeast Asia -- wilted after the economic crisis there. And the continuing consolidation among retailers has strengthened the hand of stores in demanding lower prices from farmers.
Industry experts say that this year's hail damage should not affect consumer prices because of the general oversupply of apples from across the United States and abroad.
The apple farmers now find themselves in the role of activists, organizing meetings, faxing fact sheets, collaring any politician who will listen. When Representative Gilman, a Republican, came for his tour here, there was a table set up alongside the orchard with the evidence: tree branches from other farms bearing pockmarked fruit. "We're doing things we're not accustomed to doing," said Mr. Crist, who counts 150 of his 600 acres of apples a complete loss.
Legislation is pending in Congress that would provide $115 million to apple farmers nationwide to compensate them for market losses and crop damage from previous years. In June, President Clinton signed the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000, a $15 billion relief package for producers of a variety of crops that will, among other things, reduce the cost of crop insurance. But how much of that money will eventually make its way to the Hudson Valley, where Hurricane Floyd caused damage last fall, is uncertain. And none of the money would offset the losses from this spring's hail.
Steve Clarke, a 55-year-old apple grower whose family farm dates to 1817, knows the global economics of apple production as well as anyone, but he is now focused on his own finances. Still farming alongside his 82-year-old father, Leonard Clarke, and bringing along his 24-year-old son, Brad, Mr. Clarke has 60 acres of useless apples outside his front door here -- half his apple crop.
He says he will have to borrow $50,000 to $60,000 to maintain his orchards, pay his bills and meet his payroll. "We don't have the reserve or cushion to say we're going to take it out of that," Mr. Clarke said. "The business just hasn't been that good the last four years. Ten minutes of hail is going to cost me about three years of my life."
Like other apple farmers in the Hudson Valley, Mr. Clarke is asking for an emergency infusion of cash from the federal government, assistance that Mr. Gilman said he would try to get. In asking for that subsidy, Mr. Clarke is unabashedly tapping fears that open land north of New York City is quickly disappearing to development.
"We're just at the very reaches of commuting from New York City and as Orange County fills up and Dutchess fills up, there are going to be more pressures on the land," he said. "Are people willing to pay to maintain open space? That's something that needs to be debated."

HEADLINE: Books by the Chapter or Verse Arrive on the Internet This Fall

BYLINE: By LISA GUERNSEY 

 BODY:
The Frommer's guide to France may be made up of chapters and maps, but most readers know it as an indivisible and coherent whole: a book.
This fall, that book and a few hundred others will take a new form on the Internet. They will be sold in component parts -- chapters, maps and even paragraphs -- that can be mixed and matched. Readers will be invited to create customized books by picking pieces of content a la carte from an array of already-published guides at, say, $5 a chapter instead of $20 a book. Buyers will have the option of receiving their books electronically or ordering them printed, bound and delivered to their door. 
 The customization is possible because of a deal announced last month between an online service called iUniverse and IDG Books, the publisher of the Dummies guidebooks, Frommer's travel guides and Cliffs Notes. With IDG's permission, iUniverse is creating a digital system that enables pieces of every guidebook to be assembled on the fly.
The partnership is one of the first steps toward a new editorial marketplace that some publishers and technology companies have been envisioning since the dawn of digital media. And it is the latest challenge to the traditional definition of a book. Under this model, books have not only turned into streams of electronic bits that are downloaded to hand-held devices or printed on demand. They have also turned into databases -- pools of digital information that people can extract and combine on their own terms.
"Imagine that you are going on a trip," said Patricia Schroeder, president of the Association of American Publishers and a former member of Congress. "You may want a couple chapters of a travel book, a couple chapters of a cookbook," adding that readers probably do not want to carry each of those books for just a few chapters.
Now imagine going into a bookstore and asking to buy only those chapters. "They are going to look at you," she said, "and say, 'What?' "
On the Internet, that request is not so crazy. "The online world is uniquely suited to providing this kind of highly targeted, highly customized information," said David Sidman, director of new publishing technologies for John Wiley & Sons. Four years ago, Mr. Sidman helped to develop tools that enabled scientific journals to be delivered online, article by article. Today, he said, selling content this way "represents a tremendous new revenue opportunity for publishers of all kinds."
Travel books, textbooks, cookbooks and how-to guides will be some of the first books chopped into interchangeable parts, according to officials at publishing and software companies experimenting with the concept. In fact, some publishers are already offering bits and pieces of content for downloading to hand-held devices like Palm organizers. And although no one is talking about chopping up narrative books, like novels, anthologies of short stories could be distributed this way.
"We're so close we can just smell it," Ms. Schroeder said. "This is all going to be very doable, very soon."
But before pages and chapters will be available for the picking, several issues need to be addressed. For example, turning books into what the industry calls "disaggregated content" could destabilize the economics of publishing, something that most established publishers are loath to do. What happens, they ask, if people stop buying whole books in favor of a few popular chapters?
John Kilcullen, chief executive of IDG Books, does not think that will happen. Although he has not yet set prices for the material that will be available this fall, he said some chapters might be given away as promotional materials and other prices might be set proportionally, so that a 25-page chapter of a 100-page book would cost about 25 percent of the book's list price. Other sections, he added, could cost almost as much as the book itself, particularly if they are in high demand.
Even so, authors might not be thrilled about having their work sold in pieces or packaged with the work of others. Many recent contracts include broad provisions for electronic rights, publishers say, but few mention the possibility of selling pieces for mixing and matching. Some agents and publishers are already gearing up for new negotiations over modular content.
William Gladstone, the founder of Waterside Productions, an agency representing many authors in the series of Dummies books, is encouraging writers to sign contracts that permit publishers to sell content in pieces. He is betting that writers will earn more royalties that way. "I would advise them to be cooperative," he said.
Another hurdle involves technical barriers. If a book is going to be chopped into digital pieces for mixing and matching, those pieces need to be technologically compatible with parts of other books. And to make those pieces searchable across databases, companies will have to establish a standard means to identify the piecemeal content, just as the International Standard Book Number, or ISBN, enables books to be catalogued, tracked and bought quickly.
Until standards are set, publishers are faced with "a rat's nest" of problems, said James Lichtenberg, president of Lightspeed, a consulting company for the educational publishing industry. "You have to have very clear definitions," Mr. Lichtenberg said, "things like 'this means a photograph,' 'this means a map.' "
Most of the progress so far has come from the realm of education and research. College professors, after all, have been mixing chunks of editorial content for decades by assigning "course packs" that are typically compilations of photocopied pages from magazines, anthologies and nonfiction books.
Now, with advances in copyright-protection software and the recent drive to create electronic books, many publishers have embraced the idea of selling individual chapters from multiple academic books.
McGraw-Hill was one of the first to do so; it created a database called Primis that enables professors to choose from 180,000 pages of material spanning 20 disciplines. For example, a professor can build a book that includes "Notes of a Native Son" by James Baldwin and see that the selection adds $1.75 to the cost of the book. Other building blocks cost more, like 83 pages of "The Turn of the Screw," by Henry James, priced at $8.55.
Prices are usually dependent on the popularity of the items and how much McGraw-Hill may have to pay for reprint permissions, said Ginny Moffat, vice president for marketing and custom publishing at McGraw-Hill Higher Education. Features like color pages bump up the costs, too.
Another large textbook company, Taylor & Francis, will soon be offering a database for building books. It announced last week that it had signed a deal with Versaware, a publishing-technology company that has developed its own customization system. The books could be delivered to students over the Internet as files for printing or downloading to hand-held devices, said Harry Fox, Versa ware's chief executive. Or they could be printed and bound nearby, then shipped to the college bookstore.
Manish Chopra, a graduate student at the University of Michigan, is one reader who says he would appreciate the chance to buy books in pieces, rather than whole. He recently visited a Borders bookstore to find "Consulting Demons," a book on corporate consulting by Lewis Pinault. A friend had recommended that he read the early chapters, which dealt with recruiting tactics.
"This book was like $30 hard cover," Mr. Chopra said, "and I was like, I don't know if I want to buy it, because I was only interested in the first four chapters." Instead, he stayed in the bookstore, spent several hours reading the chapters, and put the book back on the shelf.
If he had been given the chance to buy those chapters for a few dollars, he said, he would have done so. "It's always the case that you don't need all the information," Mr. Chopra said. But if you could buy it in pieces, he said, "that would be a great tool."

HEADLINE: Talk of Lower Expectations As Mideast Deadline Nears

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: THURMONT, Md., July 17

 BODY:
As the Camp David summit meeting moved closer to a supposed deadline of President Clinton's Wednesday morning departure for Japan, the White House remained officially committed to reaching "an agreement" before then and talks shifted into high-drive for a crucial 48-hour period.
But some American, Israeli and Palestinian officials today began deliberately lowering expectations for a breakthrough, even suggesting that additional summit meetings may be needed. And the White House left ample room for interpretation in its goal, since "an agreement" could include anything from a more modest declaration of principles to a full-blown accord between the two sides. 
 Although American officials previously said quietly that President Clinton's itinerary could be modified, the White House continued to declare today that he has no intention of delaying his trip to a meeting of the leaders of the leading industrial nations in Okinawa or of sending Vice President Al Gore in his place.
"The plan is to complete the process before the president goes," said his spokesman, Joe Lockhart. Later, Mr. Lockhart added: "You will know we are following the schedule when you see the president walk up the steps of the plane, wave and the door close."
Several Middle East experts, however, including officials on all sides, find it hard to imagine that the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, could modify a well-documented personal history of pushing things to the wire. And in Mr. Arafat's case, that could mean an ultimate deadline not of Wednesday but of Sept. 13, by which he has pledged to declare a state.
Some experts envisioned the leaders taking a break of a couple of weeks before reconvening for a continued summit meeting. But others said that this would be highly risky because it would expose what has been a completely secret, blacked-out negotiation to the leaks, misinformation, disinformation and political pressures of Israel and the Palestinian territories.
"It's feasible to do that, to break off and then return," said a senior Israeli official. "But I'm not sure it's a good idea to let the energy dissipate. The rumors and false assumptions could lead to terrible results."
Yitzhak Herzog, Israel's cabinet secretary, who is in Washington, said: "It's clear that both parties must seize the moment, not only the moment, but literally the day. We should be thinking of Wednesday as a once-in-a-lifetime chance."
Still, the Israelis have been putting out the word that Prime Minister Ehud Barak "is not going to stay forever at Camp David," and expressing frustration that, in their view, Mr. Barak has taken "giant steps" toward Mr. Arafat while the Palestinian leader has remained unyielding.
"The Palestinians are not showing flexibility and are not going the extra mile," said Yuli Tamir, Israel's dovish immigration minister who is serving as an Israeli spokeswoman in Washington. "I think they are pushing Barak to cross his red lines, and I think they are making a mistake. He will not change his mind."
Although Mr. Clinton has professed to be more optimistic than at the start of the summit meeting last Tuesday, Mr. Barak is "more on the pessimistic side," Avraham Burg, Israel's Parliament speaker, told Israel Radio today.
Other Israeli ministers and lawmakers who spoke to the prime minister expressed similar impressions.
The Palestinians, who voiced unusual optimism late last week, today hit a peak of frustration, although it may have been short-lived. One Palestinian official who is not inside Camp David said that the Israelis seemed to be retreating on expected concessions. In talks leading up to the summit meeting the two sides had hammered out understandings on several key issues, understandings that may be reconfiguring themselves in the course of the current talks.
The Palestinians have told the Americans that they do not plan to stay beyond Wednesday, the official said. Indeed, one senior Palestinian negotiator, Abu Mazen, who is the Palestine Liberation Organization's senior official after Mr. Arafat, faces a personal deadline. His son, Tarek, is getting married in Ramallah on Thursday, and the whole Palestinian team is invited and planning to attend.
With Wednesday looming, the pace and intensity of the negotiations have quickened, and the teams worked until about 5 a.m. before breaking and resuming at midday. All three leaders are night owls, known to thrive in the post-midnight hours.
Israeli and Palestinian officials outside the talks say that a kind of high-tension fatigue is setting in. Mr. Lockhart said, "Coming back continually to the same issues with the same people, that kind of environment is not always the best for the warm and fuzzies."
Israel Radio reported tonight that while key differences remain on the thorniest issues of Jerusalem and the right of return of refugees, progress has been made on some relatively minor issues like water and the environment. Side talks are being held at a small college in Emmitsburg.
But an American official there said that the side talks can only get so far without knowing the parameters of a core agreement, and Israeli and Palestinian participants who have longstanding professional relationships have been drafting and re-drafting individual paragraphs about some of those side issues, like civil affairs and economic relations.
Rather than twiddle their thumbs, some Palestinian officials involved in the side talks have opted instead for long afternoons shopping at the Pentagon City mall in Virginia where many are staying, the American official said. (Some have been seeking wedding presents for Tarek Abbas, Abu Mazen's son.)
Mr. Barak summoned a former director general of the foreign ministry from Israel, Reuven Merhak, who is also an expert on Jerusalem. He has been stationed at Emmitsburg since arriving. But Israeli analysts took his arrival as a sign that Mr. Barak wanted to have close by an analyst who has thought through all the solutions for sharing the holy city, including what Mr. Burg referred to recently as "shrinking and expanding" Jerusalem -- annexing Jerusalem suburbs in the West Bank to Israel while relinquishing Palestinian neighborhoods.
The news blackout has held remarkably well through seven days, which most take as a good sign that no one wants to blow up the process. Inside Camp David, though, the delegations have ample access to American newspapers and 60 or 70 television channels, Mr. Lockhart said.

Nazi Slave Labor Compensation
The United States and Germany signed an agreement to compensate forced laborers from the Nazi era.

HEADLINE: Mrs. Clinton's Credible Response

 BODY:
It is a sour coincidence that Hillary Rodham Clinton should be accused of using anti-Semitic language while negotiations are under way at Camp David that represent the best chance in decades for a comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East. But in another sense, this juxtaposition of domestic politics and foreign policy provides an opportunity to examine a serious underlying principle. There is no doubt, in our view, that Mrs. Clinton, if elected to the Senate, would be a firm supporter of Israel's security, its aspirations for peace and its economic vitality. We say that without imputing any weakness on these issues to her Republican opponent, Representative Rick Lazio. Our intent is simply to say that this is one of those campaign moments when voters need to look at long-term policy prospects rather than the controversy of the moment.
To be sure, Mrs. Clinton's handling of matters important to New York's Jewish voters has been fraught with controversy since the start of her candidacy to succeed Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a fellow Democrat. But her early gaffes were not as shocking as depicted by detractors who want to see her lose part of a constituency that is essential to any Democrat in a tight statewide race. Mrs. Clinton's 1998 remark that she would favor creation of a Palestinian state is now not far afield from current Israeli and American policies. Both governments are open to establishment of such a state as part of the Camp David negotiations. Her appearance with Yasir Arafat's wife, Suha, last year, while awkward, was nonetheless handled in a way that did not disrupt sensitive negotiations between Israeli and Palestinian leaders. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, was among those defending Mrs. Clinton. 
 The current complication centers on the report in a new book about the Clintons' marriage, "State of a Union," by Jerry Oppenheimer, that she used an anti-Semitic slur in an argument with the manager of her husband's losing Congressional campaign in 1974. Those not present can never be absolutely certain about what was said at the campaign headquarters that day. But the circumstantial evidence inclines us strongly toward believing Mrs. Clinton when she says she never used such language. The alleged remark took place only a few years after Mrs. Clinton's expansively humanistic commencement speech at Wellesley and soon after she had worked in a sophisticated legal environment for the impeachment of a president, Richard M. Nixon, who did use anti-Semitic language. Mrs. Clinton by her own admission has a volatile temper, but this kind of language seems out of keeping with her philosophy and a well-documented history of public remarks and private political conversations.
The latest Quinnipiac University poll shows Mrs. Clinton getting 54 percent of the Jewish vote to 34 percent for Mr. Lazio. In order to win, she probably has to come close to the 76 percent gained by Senator Charles Schumer in 1998. Her decision to abandon her usual no-comment mode in favor of a passionate, almost teary response to the allegation of anti-Semitic language was a sound one. President Clinton's decision to step into the fray, while understandable as husbandly concern, was probably less helpful to the political task confronting Mrs. Clinton. Her problem extends beyond any single constituency group.
This is going to be a grindingly brutal campaign. From now on, Mrs. Clinton will be under continuous pressure to assert her independence from her husband and to fight her own fights. She also has to explain her policies and reveal her personality to an electorate that does not know her well. In this instance, we think she made a convincing case that she did not use the language ascribed to her.

HEADLINE: Trying a New Shoe on for Size;
Can Owners of Skechers Learn From Their Mistakes?

BYLINE: By KRUTI TRIVEDI 

 BODY:
Michael Greenberg, the founder and president of the trendy shoe company Skechers U.S.A., is so determined to put out his company's message that he follows a written outline when he recites a list of recent feats.
Skechers (pronounced SKETCH-ers), he says slowly and deliberately between glances at the crumpled bit of paper in front of him in the company booth last month at the Fashion Footwear Association of New York exposition, is now the third-most-popular brand among teenagers, after Nike and Adidas. Company sales, he adds, jumped 40 percent last quarter compared with a year earlier; and as retailers are becoming choosier about which shoe brands to stock, both Lord & Taylor and Athlete's Foot have just signed on. 
 "If there was a Gap of footwear," Mr. Greenberg, 37, said, "I believe that Skechers would be that company."
Mr. Greenberg's dogged focus shows as much about his ambitions as about his determination to leave behind what many analysts see as a nagging past.
Currently, Skechers U.S.A. Inc., based in Manhattan Beach, Calif., seems to be something of a find. As the shoe business slowly revives from its recent slump, the small, eight-year-old family-run company is leading the charge. Its winning formula is simple: Skechers makes lower-priced versions of popular shoes like the latest high-performance Nikes and dressy loafers by Kenneth Cole. And its stock has been among the market's best performers this year.
That meteoric rise, however, followed a steep decline after Skechers's initial public offering in June 1999 -- a sign, analysts say, of concern that the company has some uncomfortable parallels with the last Greenberg family project, L.A. Gear Inc., one of the retailing industry's most spectacular collapses.
"The Greenbergs are going to have to prove that Skechers is not L.A. Gear," said John Shanley, a senior vice president at Security Van Kaspar who once followed L.A. Gear.
It was Robert Greenberg, Michael Greenberg's father, who founded L.A. Gear and is widely blamed for its implosion. And while Michael Greenberg founded Skechers -- as a distributor for Doc Martens footwear -- and is its public face and spokesman, his father is the company's chairman and chief executive.
The elder Mr. Greenberg sold everything from wigs to roller skates before he stumbled on the idea that would make him famous: a modestly priced hybrid of performance and fashion shoe that women could wear while doing aerobics. L.A. Gear's revenues shot up from $70.6 million in 1987 to $900 million in 1990, making it the third largest in the country, after Nike and Reebok.
But in a path that is almost unheard of for companies that flirt with the billion-dollar mark, L.A. Gear fell apart almost as quickly as it had grown. The stock, which hit a high of $50.125 in 1990, had tumbled to $11 by 1992. The company eventually filed for bankruptcy protection.
Analysts say L.A. Gear expanded too quickly. While the company had been successful with stylish aerobic shoes, by 1991 it was offering customers 500 different styles of shoes and apparel. The expansion was poorly timed, occurring as the strongest growth in the shoe industry was in men's athletic shoes -- a market that L.A. Gear, perceived as a women's and children's shoemaker, never could capture. The result was a retailer's nightmare: crate-loads of inventory in a still-weak economy.
Legal problems also plagued the operation. L.A. Gear signed a marketing deal with Michael Jackson in 1989 in an attempt to win over men; when that strategy failed, the company entered a lengthy breach-of-contract suit-countersuit tussle with Mr. Jackson. Both Nike and Reebok also fought legal battles with L.A. Gear, contending that the company had illegally used their patented technology. All the suits were eventually settled.
Robert Greenberg and five other executives were the subject of five shareholder securities fraud suits filed in 1990 and 1991. The class action suits contended that members of L.A. Gear management had issued public documents containing "materially false and misleading statements" about the company that led to L.A. Gear's stock becoming "artificially inflated," according to the settlement papers. The defendants eventually settled for a total of $29.8 million without admitting or denying guilt.
After losses began to mount and the company's credit line was cut, Robert Greenberg was forced to sell a 30 percent minority stake worth $100 million of preferred stock to Trefoil Capital Investors, an investment fund founded by Roy Disney, nephew of the late Walt Disney, and cede much of his control of the company. The Trefoil team eventually ousted him in January 1992 and dismissed Michael Greenberg, then an L.A. Gear national sales manager, soon after.
Trefoil bailed out in late 1997, after failing to turn the company around. Under PCH Investments, which currently controls the company, L.A. Gear entered and emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1998 a much more modest operation.
Michael Greenberg insists that his family was unfairly disparaged over L.A. Gear's tumble. "We didn't get that company to $900 million by accident," he said. If given the chance, he added, his family could have saved the company.
In response to the inevitable comparisons with L.A. Gear, Skechers officials say their company is closely monitoring its growth, will license rather than make apparel and is just as popular with men as with women.
Michael Greenberg founded Skechers -- street slang meaning frenetic teenagers -- in 1992, just months after leaving L.A. Gear. He convinced his father and David Weinberg, a former L.A. Gear executive whom he describes as a "member of the family," to join his company in October 1993. Three of his brothers are currently vice presidents at Skechers; a fourth manages the Skechers Sport brand of sneakers.
The company's sales grew steadily, as the Greenbergs capitalized on the shoe industry contacts they made in their years at L.A. Gear to make sure that Skechers displays were given prime retail space.
Investors, however, were wary. When Skechers went public in June 1999, the company had reduced its asking price and the number of shares it offered. Even so, the stock lost value in its first day of trading. "When a company prices at $11 and then opens trading at $10.50, that's generally kind of a sign of weakness," said Omar Sacirbey, a senior editor at The IPO Reporter.
Robert Greenberg declined to comment. But Lloyd Grief, a close acquaintance of the family and president of Grief & Company of Los Angeles, the investment bank that took L.A. Gear public in 1986, said, "I think he was stunned with his stock's original reception."
Investors' fears seemed justified when, just as its predecessor had, Skechers ran into both inventory and legal troubles. Soon after the initial offering, the company reported losses for the third quarter of 1999, the period that is generally the strongest in the shoe industry because of back-to-school sales. The company had too many shoes in the retail channel and floundered when its platform sneakers fell out of style, problems eerily similar to those that had plagued L.A. Gear.
"When you have that kind of situation, especially when it comes so soon after doing a public offering, institutions are very wary," said Harry Katica, vice president for research at Prudential Securities, one of Skechers' underwriters.
Then, in December, a group of shareholders sued, contending that the company had misled investors by not disclosing in its initial filing that it was having legal problems with R. Griggs Group. Griggs, the maker of Doc Martens shoes, sued its former business partner five days after the offering, saying that Skechers had pirated its designs for men's boots. Skechers stock, which had been heading steadily downward, fell to its all-time low of $3.25 in January, after the company announced that two more shareholder suits had been filed. A total of five suits have now been filed; the consolidated lawsuit is pending.
"The lawsuit is completely frivolous," Michael Greenberg said in a prepared statement. "Skechers vehemently denies violating any of the security laws and believes all disclosures were made on a timely basis."
Now, the Greenbergs' luck may be beginning to change. In March, the company settled with Griggs and announced that 1999 net sales rose almost 14 percent from 1998, to $424.6 million, despite the unusually poor third quarter. The next month, the shares finally reached their initial public offering price. Then, in May, Skechers announced a blowout first quarter. All this good news has led many analysts to believe that Skechers may indeed be able to step out from behind the L.A. Gear shadow.
Skechers, with its 900 styles, is doing a good job executing its strategy of being "everyone and everything" in footwear, said David Turner, an analyst at Ferris, Baker Watts.
The company's newest styles, like its Energy gym shoes, have reignited interest among teenagers. They have gone from being on the "uncool" list last fall to the "cool list" this summer, said Kevin Ume, president of element Holdings Inc., a marketing firm that specializes in research on the buying habits of teenagers. During the back-to-school sales season, Skechers will even be displayed at the high-visibility area in Lady Foot Lockers where the mall meets the store, a coveted spot usually reserved for Nike.
And right behind the teenagers are the investors, who seem willing to forget the past. "Skechers has not been on our coverage list but in the last couple months it's just popped up," said Allison Boswell, president of Allison Boswell Consulting, a group that surveys shoe buyers. "They were considered one of the top three fashion trend setting brands. They were also named as a brand that would be expected to have very high back-to-school increases."
Michael Greenberg notes with a broad smile that the company's stock is well above its initial price. The shares closed on Monday at $16.375, a high.
Such successes are seen as vindication by the Greenbergs, who are dreaming big again. "I think Wall Street understands one thing, and that's show me the numbers and deliver," Michael Greenberg said. "I think they're getting on board."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about Skechers U.S.A., the shoe company, misstated its financial performance for the third quarter of 1999. The company had net income of $8.5 million, down $5 million from the quarter a year earlier. It did not report a loss.
The article and a picture caption also misspelled the surname of the chief executive of Element Holdings Inc., a marketing firm, who commented on the popularity of the company's shoes. He is Kevin Umeh, not Ume.

HEADLINE: To Shirkers, The Days Of Whine And Roses

BYLINE: By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU 

 BODY:
For more than three months, Kevin Meeker, owner of Philadelphia Fish and Company, a restaurant and bar, put up with a cook whose obsession with the stock market often took his mind away from the soup. The 22-year-old employee checked his Motorola shares every half-hour on his pager and periodically slipped out to the dining room to get the bartender to turn on CNBC.
Not so long ago, Mr. Meeker says, he would have warned the cook to knock it off and fired him if he did not comply. But not in this job market. Instead, he turned a blind eye to the goofing off, and says he would probably still have the man on the payroll if he had not quit on Mother's Day after being asked to work beyond his eight-hour shift. 
 "I think the attitude among workers right now is, 'I could always go and get another job,' " Mr. Meeker said. "Now, that cook's working for another restaurant around the corner."
Checking on stock prices is the least of it. Increasingly, employees are testing the boundaries of the American work ethic as employers, hammered by recruiting and training expenses and fearful that they will be unable to fill job openings, make allowances for just about every form of misconduct. Offenses like frequent tardiness or absenteeism, apathy and even insubordination that would have merited a pink slip a few years ago are now being shrugged off as inconveniences.
The new management rule of thumb, it seems, is that a warm body is better than no body.
Take Suzan Windnagel, director of human resources for a credit union in San Jose, Calif. A woman who worked for her was frequently late, gave customers incorrect information and just did not feel like learning new computer skills.
If not for the tight labor market, Ms. Windnagel says, she would have dismissed the slacker within four months. Instead, she spent a year and a half counseling her, lecturing her and desperately trying to train her. Nothing worked, and, finally, she had to let her go.
But she says she is neither surprised nor particularly upset about the sloppy work habits she sees around her these days. "Workers, not bosses, have the upper hand," said Ms. Windnagel, who has been a human resources manager for 22 years. "Managers today know how hard it is to recruit people, so they put up with more. I don't blame workers at all."
Most people still put in an honest day's work, of course. It is just that the lazy, the rude and the nonproductive have an an easier time of it.
Doug Peterson, vice president for human resources at the Shape Corporation, an automotive supplier in Grand Haven, Mich., for example, says most of the company's 1,000 workers are productive and disciplined. Yet Mr. Peterson acknowledges that he harbors under-performers.
"Have we held on to people where in years past, we would have fired them?" he said. "The answer is yes."
The reason for the leniency is that at any given time, the company has an average of 40 unfilled jobs.
Because skilled trades are such tough positions to fill, Mr. Peterson said, he tolerated for nearly a year a hot-tempered staff electrician who often threatened co-workers. The company tried to counsel him and even signed him up for anger-management training, but finally dismissed him. "Five or six years ago, we would have not put up with that," Mr. Peterson said. "The person would have been gone immediately."
To combat worsening tardiness and absenteeism, he said, Shape has chosen the carrot over the stick. Last year, it decided to give workers 17 hours of personal time off a year on top of their vacation days -- and to pay them $10 for each of those hours they do not use. "We're giving incentives for people to be at work," he said.
Adaptec Inc., a maker of software and computer components in Milpitas, Calif., illustrates the starkness of the change taking place in the workplace. Six years ago, almost one-third of the people who left the company had been fired, according to Rick Olivieri, the director of compensation and benefits. Today, that proportion is down to 2 percent. "It's a real war for people out there right now," Mr. Olivieri said.
But leniency carries risks, warns DeAnne Rosenberg, author of "Hiring the Best Person for Every Job" (John Wiley & Sons, 2000). Most notably, accommodating shirkers can hurt office morale, she says.
Ms. Rosenberg cites the case of a home-health care administrator in Boston who yelled constantly at her co-workers, fobbed off work on colleagues and treated clients disrespectfully. Over eight months, 10 co-workers complained to her supervisor, but he refused to reprimand her, much less fire her. "He kept saying: 'It's a hard labor market. At least the little she does, she does,' " Ms. Rosenberg said.
Ultimately, the co-workers took matters into their own hands. They came in on a weekend, packed up the administrator's belongings and moved her desk and chair to another floor, she said. When the administrator came to work on Monday, they pretended she was not there and talked about her as if she had gone to another company.
She quit that day.
Obnoxious behavior is one thing. Illegal behavior is another.
Mark Spring, a labor and employment lawyer in Sacramento, Calif., says that executives at one of his client companies, a national book and music chain, merely gave a written warning to a manager who had ordered two subordinates to move a marijuana plant from his office to his home during work hours, he said.
In another case, a bank slapped the wrist of an employee who had been caught downloading pornography from the Internet, revoking his Internet privileges for 30 days and sending him to a sensitivity-training course.
Both the book and music chain and the bank exposed themselves to potential litigation by their inaction, Mr. Spring said.
Referring to the bank employee, he said, "If this had happened in the early 90's, he would have been fired because of the recession and because at the time everyone was nervous over sexual harassment."
Barring blatant wrongdoing, though, many companies are pursuing the path of least resistance.
"If a slacker comes in to work at 10 a.m. instead of 8 a.m., maybe the company needs to rethink that worker's schedule," said Erisa Ojimba, compensation expert for Salary.com, a salary-resource Web site based in Wellesley, Mass. "Maybe they're not their most productive before 10 a.m."

HEADLINE: Had a Reservation. Honest.

BYLINE: By ALEX WITCHEL 

 BODY:
THE original author of "Thou Shalt Not Lie" never anticipated Nobu. Or Pastis. Or Cafe des Artistes.
Specifically, the lying is about reservations, like "I made it a month ago" (often heard at Joe Allen, which accepts them only a week in advance) or "My secretary set it up this morning" (often heard at Nobu, which its manager politely terms "usually impossible"). 
 During the last year or so, restaurateurs all over the city say, lying has spiraled out of control. People want what they want when they want it, and, well, if they didn't plan in advance, they're just going to show up and demand it. And they're not only looking for something as modest as a table for two. Parties of 12 are walking in the door unannounced, brandishing a major sense of entitlement.
"It happens in an economic boom," said Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant based in Manhattan. "When all the really big Hamptons estates are sold, New Yorkers need another place to compete."
And it really is a competition, with top restaurants like Babbo and Nobu booking one month in advance, and many more accepting reservations no more than a week ahead. Of course, for some people, it's sport to show up unannounced and see what they can get away with. When they cheat and win, the thrill is complete. Then again, there are others who are simply lazy.
"I just forgot to call and do it," one liar told me.
She appeared anyway with a friend after the theater one night at Joe Allen, insisting she had called. She was seated.
"Lying happens several times an evening," said Sara Collins, a manager and maitre d'hotel at Nobu. "We have a very good reservations system, and inherent in the system are controls about who's telling the truth. Oftentimes, a group of eight will stand in front of me and in the thick of it they can't answer the right questions. The ones who are lying always come in ready to fight. They think they can intimidate us, and since I'm a woman they think I'll ultimately buckle and be afraid of them."
She sighed. "They think it's a great thing to brag that they just walked into Nobu and got a table, because the restaurant has become a cult thing, if you will. People know how difficult it is to get in here."
You might think that a really smart liar would take a different tack and try to charm the staff, rather than alienate it. (Charming liars who are willing to wait get better treatment than their nasty counterparts, restaurateurs admit.) But the ones who start off nasty, they say, are dead giveaways.
"If the name is not in the book and the people are not the least bit polite, all signs point to guilty," said Mike Cetta, the owner of Sparks Steakhouse. "Though you've got to play it by ear. The good news is we have 684 seats. If we have a table, we'll seat them."
Some liars reveal themselves more quickly than others. Jenifer Lang, the managing director of Cafe des Artistes, who is married to its owner, George Lang, recalled: "A couple came in once without a reservation and they were very loud, saying, 'Jenifer and George Lang are really close friends of ours.' George and I were standing right there in front of them." She laughed. "It happens a lot."
Stephane Gerbier, the general manager at Pastis, has had similar experiences.
"The ultimate line is, 'I'm a friend of Keith's,' " he said, referring to the restaurant's owner, Keith McNally. "Much of our staff has worked with Keith in the past, so they tend to know his friends." He sighed. "But we're trained to be agreeable. It's not a kick for a us to find a liar."
Another way some people lie their way through a restaurant's door is to skip playing pals with the owner and go for the big time: using real celebrities.
"Last week, someone called who said he was coming in with Tom Cruise and they wanted to be served late," Ms. Lang said. "They preordered their dinner and we made special arrangements to stay open. They showed up an hour late and came in without him."
Did anyone say anything? "No, we're in the hospitality business," she said philosophically. "We also had Howard Stern last week. He was a 75-year-old man who came in with his wife."
Jerry Della Femina, who owns Della Femina in New York and East Hampton, had an even more unnerving experience. "I called Alison's by the Beach to make a reservation last week," he said, "and I said who I was and the woman asked, 'Are you really?' It turned out that a few weeks ago someone called and said it was me with a party of eight, and even though the restaurant was really booked, they spent an hour reconfiguring everything. Then in walks a short fat guy with lots of hair."
Mr. Della Femina is notoriously bald.
Needless to say, a stunt like that will work only once, though for some, once is enough.
"I think people feel restaurants are fair game, and when they're in the Hamptons they're even more fair game," Mr. Della Femina said. He recalled an incident that his staff named the Happy Birthday Barbara Scam, which was a reservation for a birthday dinner for 12 on a Saturday night in the middle of the summer. The group requested a custom birthday cake, which the restaurant special-ordered.
"Three or four days later," Mr. Della Femina said, "the baker called to say that Laundry had put in an order for a cake for 12, East Hampton Point ordered a cake for 12 and Nick & Toni's ordered a cake for 12. These people were going to literally stiff one of us. We stopped our order that day and the people never showed up. Later, we found that they had also tried booking at the Palm that night but had been turned down. I'm not even sure where they wound up. But that's beyond being cynical."
Also hovering in the beyond-cynical category, said Tom Piscitello, a maitre d'hotel at Babbo, is the new rash of self-styled concierges. "That's what they call themselves, but what they do is broker tables for money," he said. "They learn a restaurant's booking system, secure tables and sell them to other people."
"We've heard all of the stories people can come up with," he went on. "There are no new ones." One of the ways the Babbo staff weeds out storytellers is to assign reservation numbers. But Mr. Piscitello stressed: "We try to bend over backwards to accommodate people. If someone wants to eat here, they will. They'll just wait."
Fair enough, if a liar's got the time and inclination. But at theater district restaurants, for example, the schedule is not as flexible, since the dinner hour begins at around 10 p.m. or later. (Pretheater lying has a very low glamour quotient: after the show is when the actors tend to eat and bring their famous friends with them.)
Angus McIndoe, a maitre d'hotel at Joe Allen, says he can expect an influx of up to 20 people at one time at 11 on a Saturday night. "What bothers me most is when people come in then and lie," he said. "They try to intimidate the staff while they hold up everyone else who did things honestly. The people who do it feel it's O.K. to do it. But I can never say, 'Are you lying?' to a customer, and I can't insinuate that because there is always a .01 percent chance that we've made a mistake. So, I tell them, if we have a table, you'll get it. We treat them like a walk-in."
Of course, a restaurant like Joe Allen, which is a traditional hangout for people in show business, is not the best place for a liar to stage a scene. As Mr. McIndoe said: "If it is a Saturday night at 11 o'clock and a celebrity regular comes in, I'm going to seat him first. I'm not going to make Al Pacino wait at the bar for a table."
And that's the whole point, isn't it? Because after all the lies have been tried -- the lies on the phone and the lies at the door -- at the end of the day, one thing is clear. He really is Al Pacino. And you're not.

HEADLINE: Covent Garden Chief to Lead Kennedy Center

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
Michael Kaiser, the New York theater and ballet manager who helped rescue Royal Opera House at Covent Garden in London from a financial crisis, is about to be named president of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a Kennedy Center official said today.
Mr. Kaiser, who announced last month that he was returning to the United States, said then that he would leave Covent Garden at the end of the 2000-01 season, but the Kennedy Center official said today that Mr. Kaiser was scheduled to start his duties here on Feb. 1, well before the end of next season. 
 The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the appointment is to be announced formally on Wednesday after the center's board formally votes its approval and that Mr. Kaiser would not be available for comment until then.
As chief executive at at Covent Garden, Mr. Kaiser virtually eliminated the budget deficit and created a permanent endowment. When he announced his resignation he said the decision to quit was "the most profoundly difficult" of his career, adding, "But for personal reasons it is time for me to return to my home." After hearing of Mr. Kaiser's decision, Sir Colin Southgate, the Royal Opera House's board chairman, said, "We owe him a huge debt of gratitude."
Mr. Kaiser will succeed Lawrence J. Wilker, who announced in April that he would leave his post at the end of the year and, following the path of many other executives these days, would join a new Internet venture.
Mr. Wilker's announcement came a week after Nathan Leventhal said he would leave his job as president of Lincoln Center. That created the unusual circumstance of the nation's two leading performing arts centers recruiting chief operating officers at the same time.
Mr. Kaiser, the official said, told the search committee, "I was the world's worst board member because I was meddling all the time, and that's when I realized it was what I wanted to do."
After he realized that he wanted to make arts administration his career, Mr. Kaiser sold his business consulting firm and, the Kennedy Center official said, "started cold at the Kansas City Ballet and worked his way up."
Mr. Kaiser was also executive director at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and American Ballet Theater, helping restore those companies to financial health.
Mr. Kaiser, 47, told the search committee that he was a lover of the performing arts who was raised in a performing arts family. His grandfather was a violinist with the New York Philharmonic, and one of the earliest memories he has is of spending every Saturday at the orchestra's rehearsals.
The presidency of the Kennedy Center is the No. 2 post, behind the chairmanship, which puts him in day-to-day charge of the center's operations and performances.
"It is a demanding job, with 3,300 performances a year," said James A. Johnson, chairman of the Kennedy Center, when Mr. Wilker's resignation was announced. "There are six or seven stages operating in an evening when everything is full."
Mr. Leventhal's salary at Lincoln Center was $525,000 a year and Mr. Wilker's at the Kennedy Center was $325,000. The Kennedy Center official said that Mr. Kaiser's salary was still being discussed and that it would be competitive with similar positions in the performing arts.

HEADLINE: A Gallery In Harlem Beats the Odds;
Out of the Mainstream, A Contemporary Art Space Continues to Surprise

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
In the fall of 1998 Christian Haye, a New York poet and art critic, opened a gallery of contemporary art in Manhattan. He called it the Project and presented an impressive lineup of artists from the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia, many of them making local solo gallery debuts. Among them was Paul Pfeiffer, who went on to become a star of this year's Whitney Biennial and the recipient of that museum's first $100,000 Bucksbaum Award, currently the world's largest award for a visual artist.
In a city where competition for attention-grabbing talent is keen, the Project seemed to be on a winning track. But it was also bucking serious odds, New York has hundreds of art galleries; they open and fold all the time. Start-up backing can ensure at least short-term survival; Mr. Haye had none. And if prime location is everything, his venture had a major handicap. It wasn't situated within one of Manhattan's downtown art precincts. It was in a former disco on West 126th Street in Harlem. 
 Mr. Haye's solution was to turn being out of the way into a mark of distinction. "Everything about his gallery is a surprise," said Thelma Golden, deputy director for exhibitions and programs at the nearby Studio Museum in Harlem. "On the block it blends into the other buildings. Then you go inside and see the poured concrete floors and white Sheetrock walls. He shows international artists where you might expect to find only African-American artists. He brings a contemporary art world sensibility, but he's also deeply invested in the neighborhood."
What inspired Mr. Haye to open his gallery in Harlem? "In a sense, Chelsea," he said in a recent interview. He was referring to the city's now-not-so-new commercial art center in the far West 20's, in recent years a bleak stretch of storage buildings and garages until its overnight transformation into what some people see as an instant art mall.
"I wanted to be in a neighborhood with some history," Mr. Haye said. "SoHo was over. Williamsburg was already taken. Harlem was the natural choice. The area is overly politicized and has always been an economic battleground. But no place has more narrative than here."
Art has always been part of that narrative. Legendary figures like Aaron Douglas, Augusta Savageand Jacob Lawrence once lived in Harlem. High-profile contemporary artists like Ghada Amer, David Hammons and Nari Ward work in the area today. The Studio Museum, established in 1968, has a worldwide reputation as a center for African-American culture and is now expanding its physical plant and its programming.
"My great-grandmother came from Barbados to live here many years ago," said Mr. Haye, 30. "I've done a lot of traveling, and anywhere you go in the world people say: 'You're from New York. Are you from Harlem?' Everybody knows about it, though almost as if it were a virtual space. They don't know what the reality of it is."
That reality is notably upbeat at the moment. A commercial renovation is changing the face of 125th Street, bringing in Starbucks and Disney and with them presumably more visitors, including tourists. All of this may benefit the Project itself, which in February moved to new quarters a few doors from its original site after the ex-disco, on which Mr. Haye had a month-to-month lease, was sold to a social services agency.
The forced move was just one more learning experience for Mr. Haye, with little cash and almost no experience in running a gallery. Born in Queens, raised on Long Island, he enrolled at New York University when he was 16 to study comparative literature but dropped out fast. "I had problems with academia," he said. "There's something about the power structure between students and teachers that doesn't work for me."
He worked in publishing, then as a receptionist at The New York Review of Books. "Even when I was a teenager all I ever wanted to do was sit down and read and write book reviews," he said. He became briefly involved in the Nuyorican Poets Cafe in the East Village after hearing Amiri Baraka read there, and got a job with the Jack Tilton Gallery in SoHo, though that didn't last long. "I just don't play well with others," he said.
While at Tilton, he was living in the East Village in an apartment above the poet Steve Cannon, who had founded the literary and art magazine Gathering of the Tribes. Mr. Haye edited two issues and started writing about pop culture for other magazines like Bomb and Frieze, a contemporary art journal published in London.
In 1994 exasperated by what he viewed as misguided critical responses to black artists (and upset with the provocative "Black Male" show at the Whitney, organized by Ms. Golden and which he considered wrongheaded), he turned his attention to art criticism. "I thought, 'Well, I'm not an art critic, but I'm sick of reading this stuff.' Then I found myself writing more and more about art, which isn't what I set out to do."
He spent the next three years traveling, mostly in Europe, networking intensively and looking at work in art fairs and biennials as well as in institutional programs. "I basically opened a gallery to show artists I'd been wanting to write about," he said. So far, he added, no artist he has invited to show with him has turned him down.
After scouting around Harlem, he found the abandoned disco. With the help of friends, he put up interior walls on the first floor himself. He decided to use the basement as additional exhibition space, leaving it more or less as he found it with tropical landscapes picked out in glitter on black-painted walls.
No one who visited the Project that year is likely to forget it. There was no heat. And when a midwinter installation by the Scandinavian artist team of Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset entailed knocking a hole through the wall of the building, the inside temperature was biting.
Usually two solo shows were on view at a time; the mix was visually varied and conceptually unprogrammatic.
"The early 1990's was an ideological time," he said. "It was the message, not the medium that mattered. Now the pendulum seems to have swung the other way, and I guess I'm swinging with it."
Young artists like Bulent Sangar from Turkey and the Korean-born Kim Sooja (much noticed at last year's Venice Biennale) appeared along with maverick Americans rarely seen in New York, like the performance artist William Pope L., who a few years ago tied himself to the door of a midtown bank with a string of hot dogs and handed out money, and the California-based Daniel J. Martinez, known for the "I can't imagine ever wanting to be white" admission tags he designed for the 1993 Whitney Biennial.
The final show in the space was work by Romuald Hazoume from Benin, who arrived a month before the opening to collect local materials for his sculptures. It was Mr. Hazoume's first visit to the United States.
"The third day he was here," Mr. Haye recalled, "he said to me: 'Christian, this is really strange. I've met so many people from Benin here. And I don't have to speak English. I can just speak French all day.' I said: 'Well, this is Harlem. What do you expect?' "
After that show closed last July, the gallery was homeless for several months until its reappearance at 427 West 126th Street, a compact two-story former bar. Mr. Haye has also brought in a new director and partner, Jenny Liu, whose background is almost as varied as his. A Harvard Law School graduate with a background in linguistics and psychology, she has a degree in art history from the Institute of Fine Arts in New York and has worked as an assistant director at 303 Gallery in Chelsea.
The exhibition program continues to be lively. On view through Aug. 27 are the sound-based installations by Nadine Robinson and Stephen Vitiello, both of whom made strong impressions in the "Greater New York" exhibition at P.S. 1 this spring. (Through the summer the gallery will officially be open only on Sundays, 12 to 6 p.m., though Mr. Haye and Ms. Liu are often on the premises and welcome drop-in visits.)
September will bring a show Mr. Haye describes as "devoted mostly to pornography," with work by Shu Lea Cheang and Matthias Vriens, creative director of Gucci. Two young California artists, Art Domantay and Kori Newkirk, will follow. Mr. Pfeiffer is being given both floors of the gallery for a solo in November.
The gallery has attracted some backing since it opened, but, Ms. Liu said with a mild note of wonder, it largely supports itself through sales, which have recently ranged from a $400 drawing to a $100,000 installation. Openings are well attended and foot traffic has picked up.
"At the beginning we got maybe two people a day," she said. "Now we sometimes have 15 or 20, which is nothing at all for Chelsea but a lot for here."
Ms. Liu and Mr. Haye have high hopes for the expansion of the contemporary gallery scene in the neighborhood, which also includes two spaces that predate the Project's arrival and share its broad agenda: Gallery X at 23 West 129th Street and the nonprofit Gallery M at 123 West 135th Street. "We keep hearing rumors that other galleries are moving up here," Ms. Golden said, "and if they do it will be because of what Christian has done. His energy is infectious."
But Mr. Haye, who lives in an apartment near the Project, says he wonders whether the mainstream downtown art world will really follow his lead.
"I run into people from the New York art world all the time in Europe," he said. "They can find their way to Berlin, but they can't find their way to Harlem because it's too far away. It's not really about the distance, though. It's about mental image. People still ask me if it's safe here. It's so close to where a lot of people are, but it's a different world."

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT;
Mondavi's Battle Royal

BYLINE: By VIVIENNE WALT 

DATELINE: ANIANE, France

 BODY:
The United States is famous for its corporate marketing. Think Coke and McDonald's. France is famous for its fine wines. Think Chateau Lafite and Chateau Latour.
Imagine, then, an American juggernaut like the Robert Mondavi Corporation wandering into a French village like this one that prides itself on its centuries-old vineyards. Mondavi, the big wine company from Napa Valley, Calif., announces its plans to rip down a swath of publicly owned forest to create its own top-of-the-line vines, thereby adding panache to its well-known brand name. 
 In an area where distrust of pervasive American culture has been on the boil of late, the intrusion was bound to light a fire among some locals. In fact, it has brought on the most adventuresome management hurdle yet in the career of David Pearson, Mondavi's top executive in France.
Mr. Pearson, 38, an oenologist from San Diego who is fluent in French, spent a year in the mid-1980's working with traditional winemakers in France. So, he could be forgiven for thinking his task would be straightforward when he was dispatched from Mondavi's California headquarters in early 1998 with the task of finding a good location, acquiring it and starting a new vineyard.
The search for the right spot took two years. That, as it turned out, was the easy part.
In May, Mr. Pearson announced to local reporters that Mondavi wanted to lease a forested hillside above this village 15 miles northeast of the Mediterranean city of Montpellier and create France's first foreign-owned vin de terroire, the designation for a wine unique to a French region.
He expected Aniane's 2,120 inhabitants to cheer. After all, Mondavi would be pumping $8 million into the local economy the next 10 years.
Instead, some squawked -- loudly. They protested the destruction of acres of their forest, where they have hunted wild boar for hundreds of years. More than that, they feared that the arrival of a multinational operation would lead to a lowering of standards.
Mr. Pearson, the chief executive of Vichon S.A.R.L., Mondavi's French unit, repeatedly assured the villagers that the company would cherish the region's old growing methods. He noted that Mondavi would be selling the wine it produced there in the United States, not France. He inundated the town with documents and statistics.
Even so, after three months of negotiations with local officials, he has yet to sign a deal.
"I've said to myself, this could turn out to be a kind of Elian Gonzalez -- the bigger political issues around the project could complicate a pretty simple matter," Mr. Pearson said. "There are raw nerves out there that our opponents have used."
One of the most outspoken of those foes is Aime Guibert, 75, the owner of the Daumas Gassac vineyard that produces one of the finest wines in Languedoc, the region in which Aniane sits. Mr. Guibert is not one to hide his emotions. When the hugely popular farm leader Jose Bove went on trial in June for attacking a half-built McDonald's restaurant north of here, Mr. Guibert showed up to speak at a mass rally in support of Mr. Bove. Unfortunately for Mr. Pearson, Mr. Guibert's property abuts the forests Mondavi wants to buy, and he is in no mood to welcome new neighbors.
"Mondavi will never have a minute's rest and peace if he destroys the forest," Mr. Guibert said, sweeping his arm in the direction of the hills outside his old stone farmhouse. "Robert Mondavi comes from an industrial wine civilization, not a traditional civilization. I wrote to him and said, 'Robert, don't be mad, don't do something against the village!' "
Allied with Mr. Guibert is Marcel Pouget, a metal-factory owner, who runs Aniane's hunting association and has spent his free time tacking posters to the village street poles, reading: "Non a Mondavi." Mr. Pouget, who hunts boar in the hills that Mondavi covets, formed a committee in May to block the company's venture and vowed to take the case to court if necessary.
"If Mondavi wins, it will be the death of wines in Aniane," Mr. Pouget fumed over a morning glass of pastis in his garden in Aniane. "We have little chateaux here. Within a few years, Mondavi will be buying up land in other parts."
Mondavi's critics also fear that the company will use the Aniane vineyard to start a far bigger onslaught on the region's wine industry. "They are coming in saying they're making a high-class wine," said Mark Lintott, a British book editor who lives in Octon, near Aniane. He questions the $8 million Mondavi is prepared to spend. "The figure sounds like a big industrial winery," Mr. Lintott said. "The figure is hiding something. It's out of all proportion."
Mr. Lintott is active in a local environmental group that has spoken out against Mondavi and that is also fighting a bid by another American concern, the Panoz Auto Development Company in Hoschton, Ga., to take over a section of protected public land around a lake north of Aniane to build a resort hotel complete with golf course and auto race track.
France has long resisted economic and cultural incursions by foreigners, particularly Americans. But in the global economy, the quest for national purity is becoming an uphill battle. After all, French interests own several vineyards in Northern California. Taittinger has its own little piece of heaven smack in the middle of Napa Valley.
For many people here, though, Mondavi's plans seem to threaten a precious tradition: the age-old cultivation of small-scale wines, "one of the crown jewels of France," as Mr. Pearson calls them.
Mondavi is not about to halt its plans to please the traditionalists of Aniane, however. Having gone public in 1993, it has grown into an international player with more than $370 million in revenue last year. It has vineyards in Italy and Chile and sells its wines in more than 80 countries. In June, with a black-tie dinner in California for hundreds of clients and a charity auction in Manhattan, it celebrated the 20th anniversary of Opus One, its joint California operation with Baron Philippe de Rothschild, who died in 1988.
Besides, Mondavi is arguably the most skillful global marketer in the business. And what would an adroit global wine company be without a vineyard in France?
Mr. Pearson says the company was driven to start a vineyard in Languedoc in part because the area's winemakers are moving away from mass-produced, low-quality wine to classy labels created on small farms. Unlike the fine old wine areas of Burgundy and Bordeaux, the area seems almost up for grabs. "The whole issue of developing a region in France is a huge attraction of itself for the Mondavi family," he said. "It's not based on short-term returns. It's a passion for winemaking. It tends to be contagious."
When he arrived in France two years ago, Mr. Pearson began discreetly driving around Languedoc, scouting for land. His dream was to start a classic domaine, a farm that would produce a small quantity of top-end wine.
Since Languedoc winemakers were producing their best wine in many decades, however, no high-quality vineyards were for sale. Then, in May 1999, Mr. Pearson turned off the national highway and drove into the hills outside Aniane. "I knew immediately this was the spot," he said.
He still believes the project will pan out. The town council is planning to vote on the project on July 25. Meanwhile, Mr. Pearson brushes aside the main objection of opponents, that the project will destroy 500 acres of woods, saying the Aniane authorities will ultimately permit the creation of only about 125 acres of vineyards. Mr. Pearson expects to produce about 240,000 bottles of wine by 2010 to sell in American stores for about $60 a bottle.
He drives his visitor up into the middle of the forest and climbs atop a water tank to soak in the panoramic view. From this perch, he sketches in the air the 10 "islands" of vines, each of which will cover about 12 acres. The rest of the land, he insists, will be left undisturbed. "This place is wild country, that's its magic," he declares. "Why would we want to change it?"
Mr. Pearson even hired local ecologists to do an environmental impact study, which concluded that the company's vines might improve the forest's biodiversity.
In any case, Mr. Pearson says, his detractors are a bothersome minority. Indeed, he has powerful backers, including Andre Ruiz, the mayor of Aniane, who believes Mondavi's presence will bring the village winemakers the kind of international recognition they could sorely use.
"They know very well it will be easier to sell Aniane wines in the global markets," Mr. Ruiz said. Since the forest is public land, he notes, Mondavi will not actually own it but will take a 99-year lease on it.
Even if Mr. Pearson can cut a deal with the town fathers, though, his ordeal will not be over. Next, Mondavi will have to gain "planting rights," a process akin to getting one's hands on a New York City taxi medallion. Under European laws that restrict wine production, planting new vines requires buying an equal number of someone else's vines -- perhaps disused ones -- and ripping them out of the ground, freeing up those planting rights.
"Two years ago, I didn't understand the complexities of what was going on," Mr. Pearson said of all the hurdles he had faced. "Now I understand that this is all very, very complicated."

HEADLINE: Russia and China Unite in Criticism of U.S. Antimissile Plan

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 18

 BODY:
The presidents of China and Russia denounced the United States's proposed missile defense program in a joint statement today and vowed to strengthen a strategic partnership between their nations.
But the first day of their summit meeting produced no substantive economic agreements, which Western scholars said pointed to a fundamental flaw in that partnership. Trade ties are more binding than talk in the post-cold-war era, and Russia cannot compete with what the United States, Europe or Japan can offer China these days, they said. 
 "The Chinese are the ultimate realists, and they know Russia is now a third-rate country economically, technologically and politically," said Michel Oksenberg, a China scholar at Stanford University.
China's president, Jiang Zemin, and Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, met for nearly three hours today after a brief welcoming ceremony at Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square. Mr. Jiang bantered with his guest in Russian, which he had learned as a student in Moscow when the Soviet Union played big brother to the fledgling Chinese Communists.
After the first session of the summit meeting, which ends on Wednesday, the two leaders signed a joint statement condemning the United States for seeking "unilateral military and security advantages" with a missile defense plan that would violate the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. The statement warned that breaching that treaty would "trigger a new arms race." President Clinton may decide by October whether to begin the first phase of the system, or he may leave the decision to his successor.
"Our two countries presently share a common position on the global security balance," Mr. Putin said after signing four other documents, including accords on banking and energy cooperation and an agreement for Russia to build an experimental fast-neutron reactor in China. Mr. Jiang said that the two countries would "push forward a global multipolar process and establish a new political and economic order." Multipolar is the shorthand used by China to describe a world in which the United States is not the sole superpower.
But what was conspicuously missing from the list of documents signed today was an agreement on building a multibillion-dollar pipeline from Siberia to China. Some form of commitment on the pipeline was expected to have been the largest, most concrete development to come from Mr. Putin's visit.
The absence of any agreement contrasts sharply with visits by Western heads of state, who typically preside over the signing of billions of dollars in their trade deals with China. Trade between Russia and China totaled only $3.56 billion in the first half of this year. In 1999, trade between the United States and China totaled $94.9 billion.
"To further boost trade ties, China and Russia need a big-scale strategy and large projects," said Lu Nanquan, vice director of the Russian Studies Center at China's Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. He said the pipeline deal was stalled over a dispute about where it should go, with Russia favoring a route through Mongolia, and China wanting the pipeline to pass farther north to its refining center near the oil fields in Heilongjiang Province.
Despite the talk of partnership, analysts say that the two countries are likely to remain wary of each other without more cross-border investment and stronger trade flow. "China can get large investments and advanced technology only from the West, particularly from the U.S., so there is only so far such a Sino-Russian coalition can go," said Merle Goldman, a professor of Chinese history at Boston University.
Russia is so far unwilling to help China in the one area that it wants and for which Russia has the resources: the transfer of weapons technology. Moscow has been reluctant to give China sensitive know-how that could someday be used against it. Russia prefers to sell China arms instead.
And many people say Russia continues to regard China with suspicion, given Russia's increasingly tenuous hold over its own Far East. "Russia is most concerned about the immigration of Chinese into its Far East region, where only hundreds of thousands of Russians live close to a Chinese region with a population of hundreds of millions," said Zhao Huasheng, director of Russian studies at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies. "Russia fears that Chinese immigrants will outnumber Russian citizens in the region, and might someday raise territorial issues."
Mr. Oksenberg said Beijing also understands that too close a relationship with Russia could push the United States into an even closer relationship with Japan, which is something Beijing hopes to avoid. China wants to build better ties with the world's industrialized powerhouses rather than hitch itself to a weak economy like Russia's. "Beijing may seek to use Moscow opportunistically for a while, but China's leaders now conceive of themselves as in the big leagues, and behind their honeyed words, they view Russia with scorn, disdain and pity," he said.


 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Beijing's Objections Cause Concern
 WASHINGTON, July 18 (AP) -- Although Russia opposes a United States national missile shield, and European allies doubt its usefulness, the toughest political obstacle may be China, the chief United States arms control official said today.
"The ones that we have to work on most assiduously are the China concerns," said John D. Holum, senior adviser to the secretary of state on arms control. "It will take considerable work to demonstrate that this system isn't aimed at them."
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen met with President Jiang Zemin and other top Chinese officials in Beijing last week but reported making little headway in overcoming their objections to missile defense.
China has only a couple dozen ballistic missiles of intercontinental range. Although the Pentagon has said its proposed national missile shield is designed to counter a threat from North Korea, not China or Russia, it acknowledges that the system could defend against as many as two dozen incoming missiles.

HEADLINE: Colleges Seeing Shortage of Teachers for Teachers

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
When Dr. Alexandria Lawrence received her doctoral degree in May 1999 from Columbia University's Teachers College, she did not expect to end up as an assistant professor in Lehman College's education department.
"I hadn't even applied for this position," said Dr. Lawrence, who is now coordinator of Lehman's Graduate Childhood Program and teaches classroom teachers. "The ad had wanted a reading specialist. I teach a course on reading, but I'm not a specialist." 
 In fact, she had received three offers even before she donned her graduation robe. Dr. Lawrence's good fortune is a result of the ill fortune of many graduate and undergraduate teacher training programs, which are having acute problems finding good faculty members to teach prospective teachers. Although much attention has been focused on the teacher shortage faced by New York City's public schools, little has been paid to a related shortage: the metropolitan area's college education departments are facing the same crunch, and for many of the same reasons.
"We have searches going on all over," said Dr. James Bruni, dean of the Graduate School of Education at Lehman. "Right now, there are 13 faculty searches, in mathematics, bilingual education and special education. And, for our searches, we're seeing fewer candidates. There's much more competition for those candidates."
The intense competition to hire graduates like Dr. Lawrence suggests that some education programs either will not have the faculty to help produce the numbers of teachers needed to staff the city's classrooms, or that they will have to compromise on whom they hire. Not only are education instructors needed to prepare the estimated 54,000 new teachers who will be hired in New York City alone during the next five years, but they are also expected to make sure that the new teachers will be better prepared to help their students meet increasingly demanding academic requirements.
The drought in prospective education faculty members is caused by deep-seated economic and social forces that have been a long time in the making, some education school deans suggest. Dr. Alfred Posamentier, dean of the Graduate School of Education at City College, said that education schools needed good veteran teachers for their faculties, but that supply had diminished.
"It's like a reverse domino theory," Dr. Posamentier said.
Dr. Posamentier, who is hunting for a math specialist, said that 30 years ago "there would have been 45 people coming through the system who were math majors, were certified, had done student teaching and knew methods. Today, we have one."
Another reason for the shortage is money. Historically, schools of education have paid their faculty less than, say, business or law schools. The shortage has not yet affected salaries, deans of education said. When times have become rough, universities have usually made more severe cuts in their education departments than in other academic departments.
"Teacher educators have been notoriously underpaid," said Dr. Sylvia Blake, dean of the School of Education at Manhattanville College in Purchase.
"Now, with the top of the public school teaching scale in the mid to high 80's, it's harder to find people who would be taking a salary cut of 50 percent to teach at the college," Dr. Blake said. "Everybody is advertising for teacher educators. Ten years ago, there would have been 100 responses for an ad. Now we get about 20."
A third factor results from the gains of the feminist movement. Many women who would previously have been channeled into teaching careers, and ultimately would have formed a well-qualified pool from which college education departments could have drawn faculty members, choose other careers.
Not surprisingly, the particular difficulties in finding classroom teachers in areas including mathematics, science, special education and bilingual education also have an impact on recruiting faculty members in higher education.
"There's a pipeline problem in virtually any of these areas," said Dr. Jan McDonald, dean of Pace University's Graduate School of Education. "We're trying to hire a special educator, and there's a national critical shortage at the K-12 level."
It is particularly difficult for the graduate schools to find someone like Dr. Fernando Espinoza, who is an assistant professor in science education at Lehman. A 15-year classroom teacher of physics and earth science at a Queens Catholic high school, Dr. Espinoza has also taught physics as an adjunct faculty member at Queens College and published scholarly articles. He has a master's degree in physics, besides a doctorate of education.
"After having tried to reach students for 15 years, I thought I'd be more effective in reaching their teachers," Dr. Espinoza said. "I had tenure and a well-paid job. I had to take a pay cut to come to Lehman. But the dean was very persuasive."
One change putting pressure on some programs to find additional faculty members results from the New York State Regents' requirement that teacher training programs have a majority of full-time professors.
"Hiring new faculty is difficult, and becoming expensive," Dr. Blake said. "There used to be more part-time people, but with the new state education requirements, there have to be full-time people."
Dr. McDonald, from Pace, said that the state would soon require that a larger proportion of faculty members have doctorates, "and if the teacher doesn't have a doctorate in the field, we have to explain why."
Of course, not every school of education is having problems.
Michael Jennings, associate dean at Columbia University's Teachers College, said: "We have full-time faculty teaching our graduate students, and we tend to attract pretty good adjuncts. We're lucky."

HEADLINE: British Authorities May Get Wide Power to Decode E-Mail

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 18

 BODY:
As the Clinton administration formally enters the debate about law enforcement surveillance in cyberspace, the British government is about to enact a law that would give the authorities here broad powers to intercept and decode e-mail messages and other communications between companies, organizations and individuals.
The measure, which goes further than the American plan unveiled on Monday in Washington, would make Britain the only Western democracy where the government could require anyone using the Internet to turn over the keys to decoding e-mails messages and other data. 
 Such a measure would be an important tool for the government because data is increasingly being encrypted for reasons of security and privacy.
Despite a barrage of criticism from all sides, the bill is likely to become law as it passes through its final stage in the House of Lords and returns to the House of Commons next week because the Labor government, which offered the plan, holds a wide majority in Parliament.
Government officials maintain that the measure is essential if law enforcement agencies are to combat the sophisticated modern crime that is enhanced by access to the Internet, including pedophilia, drug smuggling, money laundering, terrorism and trafficking in refugees.
"The powers in the bill are necessary and proportionate to the threat posed by 21st century criminals, no more, no less," Charles Clarke, the Home Office official in charge of the bill, said last week.
But the measure has had a rocky time in Parliament, where lawmakers have vehemently objected to several provisions, including one that would give the government new powers to require Internet service providers to install "black box" surveillance systems that would sort and send a range of data and e-mail to a monitoring center controlled by the domestic security service, M.I.5.
Such systems are also being used in the United States by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, where the technology is known as Carnivore because it is able to extract the "meat" quickly from vast quantities of e-mail messages and other communications between computers.
But one major difference in the British measure is that the authorities here would be able to require companies to install and maintain the black boxes at their own expense and according to technological specifications set out by the government.
In addition, to justify such surveillance, the authorities would not be obligated to take elaborate steps to persuade an independent arbiter like a court that a crime had probably been committed. In contrast to the United States, Britain has a tradition of unfettered and often uncontested intrusion by the authorities into citizens' privacy,
In the United States, the F.B.I. must first obtain a search warrant before using the Carnivore technology, which is then installed and maintained by the bureau.
Under the British plan, failure to turn over a decryption key or to convert encrypted data or messages into plain text could result in a two-year prison sentence. Although many nations are considering similar bills to deal with encrypted data, only Singapore and Malaysia have so far enacted them.
The legislation would allow the British government to tap into and monitor electronic communication for a host of reasons, including to protect national security, to "safeguard the country's well-being," and to prevent and detect serious crime. That last, far-reaching category might include, for instance, "a large number of persons in pursuit of a common purpose."
The measure would not require traditional warrants signed by judges. Instead, warrants for e-mail surveillance would have to be signed by the home secretary, who controls a range of domestic and legal matters. Other officials, including high-ranking police officers, would be empowered to approve requests for encryption keys.
The effect of this part of the bill "can justifiably be described as mass surveillance of Internet activities without judicial warrant or adequate oversight," according to a report prepared for the British Chambers of Commerce by a team of professors at the London School of Economics and University College London.
Opponents of the measure in Britain represent an extraordinarily diverse interests, ranging from trade unions and Amnesty International to representatives of big business and newspapers across the political spectrum. Not only does the bill violate basic civil liberties, they argue, but it would also impose onerous costs on Internet service providers, subject them to anti-competitive restraints, and drive business out of Britain.
"This is Big Brother government realizing that unless they get their act together, technology is going to make them impotent by allowing individuals to bypass the regulations, and the spies, of the state," said Ian Angell, professor of information systems at the London School of Economics and a consultant on the recent report.
"I'm a supporter of the police, and I believe they should be given powers, but there has to be due process, and this bill doesn't provide that," Mr. Angell said. "They'll be allowed to go on fishing expeditions."
It is not yet clear how much the measure will cost. The government has put aside 20 million pounds, or $30 million, to help businesses set up the new technology, but as it stands now, Internet service providers themselves would bear most of the costs of the "black boxes" themselves. This provision is roughly akin to asking "manufacturers to pay for the police cars the Home Office provides to the police," said William Roebuck, an executive on the legal advisory group at the E-Center, a trade association that studies standards and practices in e-commerce.
The London School of Economics report estimated that the measure would cost British business some 640 million pounds, or $960 million, over the next five years, a figure that could rise to 46 billion, or $69 billion, when opportunity costs and losses from the economy are included. But Mr. Roebuck said it was impossible to tell what the final figure would be.
"If Internet service providers are made to take on board the costs, then the costs will be put through to the consumer," he said. "What's going to happen is that companies are going to reroute everything away from the U.K. and take their business abroad."
Among the companies that have already said the measure would make them reluctant to do business here is Poptel, one of Britain's oldest Internet service providers. Poptel serves the noncommercial sector -- charities, trade unions, lobbying organizations and the like -- and many of its members have serious concerns about the bill's implications.
"There are a number of our users who come into quite legitimate conflict with the government," said Shaun Fensom, Poptel's chairman, who said he might transfer some of the company's operations offshore. "They are concerned that the government could classify some of their legitimate activity as being snoopable. My feeling is that they will want access to at least some kind of secure e-mail facility."
Some critics are charging that the measure has been sloppily and hastily drawn up to give the government as broad latitude as possible.
"What this does is contravene a large number of fundamental rights in the European convention on human rights and other international standards, which include the right to privacy, the right to liberty, the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom of association," said Halya Gowan, a researcher at Amnesty International in London.
"As a human rights organization, our work is based on the confidentiality of statements we take from opponents of governments around the world who are possibly victims of human rights violations by these governments," she said. "But under this bill, we won't be able to guarantee confidentiality anymore."
The measure, known as the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill, or R.I.P., is an effort to extend a 1985 law setting out the government's powers to intercept and monitor communications across telephone lines to a host of modern technologies, including e-mail, Web sites, pagers and cell phones.
As it happens, said Mr. Roebuck of the E-Center, the government has already quietly been doing many of the things it will now be legally allowed to do. "They've already been doing covert surveillance, covertly intercepting e-mail," he said. "This gives them a legal basis to do so."
And the government agrees, in effect, saying it is merely setting out in law the parameters for what it has been doing informally anyway. "The bill is an important one which does not substantially increase the powers available to the law enforcement and security agencies but will make the U.K. a better and safer place to live for all," Mr. Clarke told The Daily Telegraph.
Some groups say that although they disagree with the nuts and bolts of the bill, they are encouraged that the government is, at last, trying to establish a legal framework for its surveillance activities.
"Generally, people should welcome the bill because it provides some kind of system of accountability for interferences with privacy where there hasn't been in the past," said John Wadham, the director of Liberty, a civil liberties group.
But that is not good enough, said Conor Gearty, a professor of human rights law at King's College London. "The British authorities have a history of engaging in activities outside the law which inflict on people's privacy or otherwise affect their liberties, and then suddenly saying that the time has come to bring the law into line with practice," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Nasdaq Moves 2.3% Lower As Investors Take Profits

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq composite index fell sharply yesterday as investors chose to take profits after pushing the technology-laden index higher in each of the previous four sessions.
The Nasdaq fell 97.50 points, or 2.3 percent, to 4,177.17. While the decline in Nasdaq stocks was most pronounced, other major market gauges also moved lower. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 64.35 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,739.92, led lower by Intel, which fell 35/16, to 143. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 16.75 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,493.74. General Electric, Pfizer and Lucent Technologies were among the big losers. And the Russell 2000 index of small company stocks fell 8.90, or 1.6 percent, to 536.28.
Traders and analysts said the decline in prices, which came on moderate volume, was warranted.
"The market has had a very nice move up over the last month or so, especially technology stocks, and the averages and individual stocks are very overbought," said Kenneth M. Sheinberg, head of listed trading at SG Cowen. "It is time to consolidate."
Contributing to the slide in Nasdaq were Qualcomm, JDS Uniphase and Cisco Systems, which all fell by more than 2 points. In the previous four sessions, the Nasdaq had gained 8 percent.
Although Intel fell during the day, it reported second-quarter results that were better than expected after the market closed and rallied as high as 147 after hours. It was not the only big company to issue an earnings report after the close of trading.
Microsoft and Apple Computer, two other technology heavyweights, also reported results that were better than expected.
The earnings numbers led some analysts to suggest that yesterday's sell-off may be short lived.
"My guess is there will be a bounce on Wednesday," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company in Boston. "The market has moved a lot in the last week, and there was room to take profits. But when we start focusing on these great earnings numbers, I think we will see buying again."
Three stocks fell for every two that rose on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. About 910 million shares changed hands on the Big Board.
Some stocks, which had advanced smartly in advance of earnings reports that were expected to be good, retreated once the news was announced.
Merrill Lynch, which rose 10 percent last week, was hit hard yesterday even though it reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street estimates. Merrill fell 3 3/4, to 128 1/4.
Aetna was another big loser. The nation's biggest health insurer fell 6 15/16, to 59 11/16, after it reported results that fell short of estimates.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasury Prices Rise
 (By Reuters) -- Treasury prices were little changed yesterday after the government's latest consumer price report raised no inflation alarms and did little to alter investors' outlook on the economy and interest rates.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said a spike in energy prices pushed the June Consumer Price Index, a broad measure of prices at the consumer level, up 0.6 percent in June.
The core rate, which is the index without its more volatile food and energy items, rose just 0.2 percent, matching the market consensus.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 4/32, to 104 26/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.90 percent from 5.91 percent on Monday.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 1/32, to 102 19/32. The note's yield was unchanged at 6.14 percent.

HEADLINE: Price Index Is Up Sharply, Led by Energy

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
With rising oil and natural gas prices squeezing nearly every household, the Consumer Price Index jumped by 0.6 percent in June, the Labor Department reported yesterday. But apart from energy, inflation remained mild.
Natural gas is the heating fuel for most homes and commercial buildings, and gas prices shot up 7.8 percent, the biggest one month increase since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking them in 1952. With inventories depleted, the price jump reflected fear of shortages this winter, the bureau said. 
 Wall Street focused on the narrower core rate of inflation, which excludes energy and food, two areas where prices jump around from month to month. This core rate was up only 0.2 percent in June, matching the increase in four of the five previous months.
Still, core inflation, which many view as providing a better indicator of underlying inflationary pressures, has edged up gradually since last year. For the 12 months ended in June, the rise was 2.4 percent, compared with 1.9 percent in 1999. Some economists argue that in a still-robust economy, in which demand is sufficient to allow companies to raise prices on a growing number of goods and services, the oil price shock may speed up the increase in core inflation.
"The risks are all toward a gradual acceleration of inflation," said Jan Hatzius, an economist at Goldman, Sachs.
Rising rents, for example, helped to push up housing costs 0.5 percent last month, although natural gas accounted for most of the increase. Airline fares rose by 1.5 percent, with higher fuel costs cited as a justification. But demand played a role, analysts said. Without so much ticket-buying, the higher fares might not have stuck, and the rising cost of fuel would have come out of profits.
"It is difficult to assess whether fuel prices are driving up fares, or fully booked flights are doing so," said Patrick Jackman, a senior economist at the bureau's consumer price division.
Stock market investors seemed to find in the June report on consumer prices a reason for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates at its next policy making meeting, on Aug. 22 -- although that view might change as more data on the economy becomes available in the next five weeks, including the July consumer price report. Rate increases fight inflation by slowing the economy, and fresh expectations of higher rates tend to push down stock prices.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 64.35 points, 0.6 percent, yesterday, to 10,739.92, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 97.50, or 2.3 percent, to 4,177.17.
The Clinton administration focused on the core rate in June. In a statement, Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman said, "Core consumer prices remain moderate despite pressure from energy prices." The administration has insisted that the booming economy is not inflationary, suggesting, in effect, that the Fed should go easy on interest rates. Six Fed rate increases since June 1999 have already helped to produce a mild slowing of the economy.
Energy prices are not easily held in check by interest rate increases. Rate increases are intended to discourage borrowing and spending, thus diluting demand, particularly among consumers. But oil prices have risen because of OPEC's decision 16 months ago to restrict production, a restriction just now being lifted. Consumer demand played no role.
"You are hard-pressed to find energy prices that have been passed along yet, or workers able to demand wage increases to keep up with price increases," said Dean Baker, an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.
Mr. Baker and others argue against further interest rate increases on the ground that the worst of the energy price increases are over. The 8.8 percent rise in gasoline prices in June, to $1.66 a gallon, on average, is not likely to be repeated in July. Weekly reports from the Energy Department say that gasoline prices hit a peak on June 19 and have since declined, though natural gas prices are likely to continue to rise until inventories are rebuilt, Mr. Jackman said.
Others, however, see in the oil shock an important role for the Fed. Their argument is that rising fuel prices must reverberate through a strong economy -- for example, encouraging workers in a period of low unemployment to demand higher wages to keep up with rising fuel bills. These would be passed along to consumers through price increases.
"The labor market is tight as a drum, the economy is growing like a bandit and this is not the time to be tolerant of oil price shocks," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He pointed to several surveys in which many business executives said they planned to raise prices this year.
A service sector index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, one that excludes energy, rose at an annual rate of 3.7 percent the first six months of this year, up from 2.7 percent in 1999.
Energy dominated the 0.6 percent June increase in the consumer price index, the largest increase since a 0.7 percent rise in March. Energy certainly contributed to the rising cost of maintaining a home -- not only the increase in natural gas prices but also an 0.8 percent rise in electricity bills. But outside housing and transportation, the only major jump in prices came in medical care, particularly hospital bills.
"Medical care costs have started to accelerate somewhat," Mr. Jackman noted. For the 12 months ending in June, they were up 4.1 percent, compared with 3.7 percent in 1999. "Hospital charges are the major story," Mr. Jackman said, "not what people pay their private physicians."
Otherwise, apparel prices fell again, as they have most of this year. Discounting accounted for much of the decline. Food prices rose a mild 0.1 percent, mostly because of higher prices for beef and fresh vegetables. Recreation costs rose 0.3 percent, with most of the increase in the prices of movie and theater tickets, and entry to sports events. New vehicle prices edged down 0.1 percent, while used vehicles rose 0.2 percent.
Tobacco prices fell, the result of discounting. Education costs jumped 0.8 percent, reflecting increases in tuition fees at private secondary schools. But telephone services fell in price. So did computers and computer equipment, and products that use oil as a raw material -- plastics, for example, and other petrochemicals -- did not rise in price. Indeed, an index of commodity prices, less food and energy, shows no change from last year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.

THE SENATE
 
CANDIDATE RESTORED TO BALLOT
Jack E. Robinson III, the Republican Senate candidate who had been bounced from the Massachusetts ballot in his challenge to Edward M. Kennedy, has suddenly stopped looking quite so beleaguered. The state's highest court ruled yesterday that Mr. Robinson could appear on the November ballot because he did in fact have the 10,000 signatures he needed to qualify. The court said a few dozen signature forms that were printed upside-down should still be counted. Mr. Robinson said that the decision would let him finally get his campaign into full gear. He plans to push ahead with fund-raising and organization-building, and to seek a reconciliation with state Republican leaders who had disavowed him earlier in the campaign as he was parrying accusations about his past. His chances against the most prominent member of one of America's best known political families in an overwhelmingly Democratic state are still seen as slim.

THE STATES
 
GORE TRAILS BUSH IN ARKANSAS
Bill Clinton and Al Gore carried Mr. Clinton's home state of Arkansas by comfortable margins in 1992 and 1996. But a new Mason-Dixon poll conducted for The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette raises some doubts whether Mr. Gore can continue the streak. It has Gov. George W. Bush of Texas ahead 46 percent to 40 percent, with 11 percent undecided. "A very disconcerting poll for Democrats," crowed Mr. Bush's Arkansas chairman, Senator Tim Hutchinson. Mr. Gore's chairman, state Attorney General Mark Pryor, countered: "It's encouraging for Gore because most of the undecided voters will back him." The poll, conducted July 13 through 15, covered 622 likely voters and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. (NYT)
 
THE CONVENTIONS
 
CAROLINE KENNEDY TO SPEAK
Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, perhaps the most private of all the Kennedys, has agreed to speak at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles next month, 40 years after the party nominated her father there. Her late brother, John F. Kennedy Jr., addressed the Democratic convention in 1988, and her uncle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who will appear with her, is a regular fixture at the conventions. Adam Clymer (NYT)
 
THE GREENS
 
A VOW TO REPLACE GREENSPAN
Ralph Nader, the Green Party presidential nominee, said that if he is elected president he would not reappoint Alan Greenspan to a fifth term as Federal Reserve chairman but instead would "re-educate" him. "I want him once to go up to Capitol Hill and testify by saying, 'I must report to you that our economy is not sound because it has 20 percent child poverty and 47 million workers without a livable wage,' " Mr. Nader said yesterday during a question-and-answer session at the National Press Club in Washington. Mr. Nader said he would consider replacing Mr. Greenspan with James Kenneth Galbraith, a University of Texas economist who has been critical of past increases in short-term interest rates.

HEADLINE: G.M. Revamps Incentive Plan Even After Profits Rise

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 18

 BODY:
General Motors today revamped its sales discounts for the third quarter, while announcing that its profits had inched up in the second quarter instead of falling slightly, as had been expected.
G.M. raised its rebates by $500 on a wide range of cars, minivans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. But the company also increased the lowest available interest rates on its discounted auto loans, to 3.9 percent from 0.9 percent. Recent interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve have made it prohibitively expensive for automakers to continue subsidizing deeply discounted loans. 
 The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G. changed its incentives last month to emphasize rebates at the expense of auto loans, while the Ford Motor Company quietly did so earlier this month on a limited basis. But neither program was as generous in rebates as the deals G.M. made available to its dealers today, which took effect immediately and will last through Oct. 2.
Because less-affluent buyers tend to choose auto loans while those with greater wealth tend to prefer rebates, the shift away from loans is likely to drive some less-prosperous customers out of the market, cooling overall sales and slowing the economy slightly, auto executives said.
"Are the Fed actions having an impact in terms of how we're taking our vehicles to market? I would say yes," said Kevin E. Costello, Ford Motor's finance director for North American marketing and revenue analysis.
Costly incentives in the second quarter had led many investors and some Wall Street analysts to fear that G.M. would post weak financial results today. But the company's net income from continuing operations ended up rising 1 percent, to $1.75 billion from $1.73 billion a year earlier. The giant automaker's earnings per share jumped 10.2 percent, to $2.93 from $2.66. That is largely because nearly two months ago the company reduced the number of its shares, by offering shareholders in exchange some of its Class H shares, which track the earnings of its Hughes Electronics subsidiary.
Financial analysts had forecast that G.M would earn $2.82 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. G.M. outperformed the estimates because its revenue from each vehicle stayed flat despite increasing discounts, analysts said. This was possible partly because customers ordered more optional equipment.
"More people are buying leather seats, more people are buying sun roofs," J. Michael Losh, G.M.'s chief financial officer, said in an interview.
G.M. announced its earnings before the opening bell today, while word of its new incentives did not dribble out until after the close of trading. G.M. stock climbed 44 cents, to close at $60.81.
Scott F. Merlis, an investment banker specializing in auto companies at Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc., said that financial markets had been expecting more harm to second-quarter earnings from the discounts. "The higher incentives are not leading to a devastation of the bottom line," he said.
Ronald Zarrella, the president of G.M.'s North American operations, said that the automaker's average price for each vehicle after incentives would be down by roughly half a percentage point for the full year despite flat prices in the second quarter. He blamed competitive pressures. The average net price fell seven-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter. It was unchanged in the second quarter.
G.M.'s sales rose to $48.74 billion in the second quarter from $45.07 billion a year earlier.
G.M. spun off its giant Delphi auto parts subsidiary during the second quarter of last year. Including the profits from that discontinued operation in last year's second-quarter results would mean that G.M.'s earnings actually shrank 8.7 percent, from $1.92 billion a year ago. But financial analysts have tended to exclude the Delphi figures, viewing the spinoff as a splitting of G.M. rather than the closing of a subsidiary.

HEADLINE: Financial Control Board Withers With Prosperity

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
A quarter of a century after the New York State Financial Control Board helped rescue the city from near financial collapse, the body is so far out of the limelight today that when its top executive tells strangers where he works, the first question he usually gets is, "What is that?"
"Things have quieted down," said Jeffrey L. Sommer, acting executive director of the Control Board, which has its annual meeting today to review city finances, the only scheduled gathering of the seven-member board this year. "There seems to be no interest" in the board's dealings, he added. 
 At its infancy, the board ordered hundreds of millions of dollars in city budget cuts, demanded the layoffs of thousands of city workers and rejected teachers' and transit workers' contracts. Even rumors floating from its 21st floor Broadway offices, overlooking City Hall, would generate front-page news.
"On an almost daily basis we got calls from the board on problems we had to solve, cuts we had to make," said Donald D. Kummerfeld, budget director under Abraham D. Beame, the former mayor. "The power of the purse in government is the ultimate power. And they had it."
Edward I. Koch, never one to concede a battle, yesterday recalled breakfast meetings he organized at Gracie Mansion with the Control Board staff and important members to try to smoothe out disputes. "I fought with them on occasion," said Mr. Koch, who once described the city as an "indentured servant," of the Control Board. "Generally, they won."
But yesterday, the day at the Control Board headquarters began with an eerie silence. Hour upon hour passed and not a single inquiry came in response to the board's just-released critique of the city budget. When one reporter called minutes before the close of business, Mr. Sommer could not hold back his surprise.
"I just got off the phone from New York 1," said Mr. Sommer, 52, a Brooklyn native and lawyer, referring to the cable TV news station. "What a shock." It had been three years since Mr. Sommer, who started his government career as a lobbyist in the John V. Lindsay administration and today is paid $124,000 a year, had gotten a call from a City Hall reporter about one of his budget releases, he said.
There is a good reason for the decline in the Control Board's stature. The board, formed by the State Legislature and Gov. Hugh L. Carey in September 1975 as the city teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, still has the same heavy-hitting members, including the current governor, mayor and city and state comptrollers.
But New York City, thanks to a three-year-running economic boom, just ended its 2000 fiscal year with an estimated $3.2 billion surplus, a figure all but unimaginable just a few years ago.
"It is a reflection of the prosperity of the city that it has become an obscure body," said Felix G. Rohatyn, who served as a Control Board member during its first two years, as well as chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, a related body that issued debt for the city during the financial crisis. "It is only necessary when things are very, very bad."
The Giuliani administration is so confident of the city's fiscal stability today that it would like to see the Control Board with even less clout: Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's budget director suggested yesterday that the Control Board or the office of the State Deputy Comptroller for New York City, a second state agency assigned to monitor city finances, should be abolished.
"There are people there making a lot of money and all they are doing is echoing each other's reports," said Adam L. Barsky, director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Even State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a frequent critic of the Giuliani administration, says he wonders how the 19-person Control Board staff keeps itself busy, at a cost of $2.1 million a year to city taxpayers.
"It has become kind of perfunctory," Mr. McCall said. His solution is to instruct the board's staff to delve deeper into the city's budget affairs. "It is during good times that government often does bad things," said Mr. McCall, who intends to warn fellow board members at today's meeting that the city is spending too much of its $3.2 billion surplus to just balance the 2001 fiscal year's budget, leaving it with an unusually large deficit the administration expects it could face in 2002.
At its birth, when it was called the Emergency Financial Control Board, it approved -- or rejected -- all city budgets, contracts and labor deals. Mr. Kummerfeld at times in the late 1970's found himself so subservient to the Control Board, he said, that he had a humorous nickname for its executive director at the time, Stephen Berger, who was bald and had a closely cropped beard and mustache. "He reminded an awful lot of people on our side of the street of the devil," Mr. Kummerfeld said.
Mr. Koch, who became mayor in 1978, described it as more of a "good guy-bad guy" routine between the mayor and the Control Board, as the mayor remembered telling labor union leaders: "You better make my life easier than you are making it. If not I will just let the Control Board decide your increase."
In 1986, after affirming that the city had balanced its budget for three consecutive years, paid off its federally guaranteed debt and restored its credit-worthiness, the board went into what the law calls "sunset" status: it voted to drop its power over city budgets and contracts, becoming little more than a monitor that issued quarterly reports on the city's finances.
Although it threatened to reassume control of the city's finances in 1991, its stature has been shrinking in recent years. The office of the executive director is unoccupied: the board has been without a permanent director since last November, and Mr. Sommer, not wanting to be too presumptuous, has stayed in his long-held deputy director's office.
Meanwhile, the board, which has had its commanding perch at 270 Broadway since 1975, is moving next week to rented space at 123 Williams Street, farther from City Hall, with a lease that expires in 2008, the year the board is set by law to go out of business.
Today, a resolution has already been prepared declaring again that the "sunset" conditions have been met, and that the board does not have to reactivate its original powers. Predicting the outcome of the vote is not too risky. It has been years, anyway, since a resolution passed by anything less than unanimity.

HEADLINE: Lazio Buys $1.6 Million in TV Ads in Race's First 6 Weeks

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
In the first six weeks after he abruptly entered the Senate race, Representative Rick A. Lazio spent $1.58 million on television advertising, and sought to bolster his candidacy by hiring several political consultants who had worked on Senator John McCain's failed presidential bid, according to campaign records released yesterday.
The records, which the Lazio campaign filed with the Federal Election Commission and released to reporters, show that Mr. Lazio collected $4.99 million in donations from April 1 through June 30, nearly all of it after becoming a candidate in the wake of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's withdrawal from the contest in mid-May. 
 Mr. Lazio spent a total of $2.32 million, and his campaign now has $6.19 million in the bank, including money left over from his House races.
The campaign of Mr. Lazio's Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, did not release her records yesterday, saying it would do so later in the week. Earlier this month, the Clinton campaign said it had raised $5.1 million from April 1 through June 30, and spent $5.49 million, leaving her with $6.4 million on hand.
Before April 1, Mrs. Clinton had already spent $6.12 million, meaning that so far in this campaign, she has raised $17.9 million and spent $11.61 million. Even with the departure of Mr. Giuliani, who had set a fund-raising record, the campaign is likely to be one of the most expensive in the nation's history.
In stepping in for Mr. Giuliani, who dropped out to focus on his treatment for prostate cancer, Mr. Lazio did not adopt much of the Giuliani campaign apparatus, the records suggest. The Lazio campaign did spend $4,000 buying computer equipment and mailing lists from the Giuliani campaign, but established its own office in Midtown Manhattan -- Mr. Giuliani's had been downtown -- paying $12,198 for rent and another $15,372 for furniture.
And instead of keeping the Giuliani staff, Mr. Lazio turned to veterans of the McCain campaign, the records indicate. Mr. Lazio spent several thousand dollars hiring Campaign Services Group, a firm headed by John Weaver, one of Mr. McCain's former strategists, as well as two other McCain consultants, Amy Griffith and Keith Nahigian.
Mr. Lazio also brought on another former McCain strategist, Michael Murphy, and some of Mr. Murphy's associates. A Lazio campaign spokesman, Dan McLagan, is another former McCain campaign aide.
Besides the advertising expenditures, Mr. Lazio focused heavily on direct mail fund-raising solicitations, hoping to emulate Mr. Giuliani's extraordinary success in collecting donations from people around the country who dislike Mrs. Clinton.
Mr. Lazio hired a prominent Republican fund-raising company, SCM Associates of New Hampshire, spending $183,412, according to the documents. The campaign also paid $20,156 to Econtributor.com, which handles on-line fund-raising.
The filings also show that the Lazio campaign returned a $2,000 contribution from Christopher Quick, a former executive of Quick & Reilly, the brokerage company.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Mr. Lazio had inside information before he bought options in Quick & Reilly stock in 1997, which yielded him roughly $13,500, a nearly 600 percent profit, in less than seven weeks.
Executives at Quick & Reilly, which is now a division of FleetBoston Financial, have been among Mr. Lazio's biggest supporters.
Mr. Quick donated $2,000 to the Lazio campaign on June 15, just as he was being questioned by reporters about Mr. Lazio's option's trade. (Mr. Quick said he had not discussed the company's stock with Mr. Lazio.)
On June 30, the Lazio campaign returned the $2,000 because it was over the limit. Mr. Quick had already donated $2,000, the maximum, on June 28, 1999.

HEADLINE: SENATE APPROVES TAX CUT TO HELP MARRIED COUPLES

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
The Senate passed a tax cut for married couples today, taking a big step in the election-year push by Republicans to highlight their differences with Democrats over what to do with the federal budget surplus.
The vote was 61 to 38. Eight Democrats joined Republicans to approve the measure, which would reduce income taxes for nearly all married couples, by a total of $248 billion over the next 10 years. One Republican voted against the bill. 
 A similar though somewhat smaller measure passed the House earlier this year. Republican leaders said they would act quickly to meld the two versions and send the legislation to President Clinton.
Mr. Clinton said he would veto the bill, in part because too much of the cut would go to affluent taxpayers at a time when, he maintained, the needs of low- and middle-income people are not being met.
But in an acknowledgment that tax reductions appear to be gaining political appeal as budget surplus projections grow, Mr. Clinton reiterated his willingness to negotiate a compromise under which he would accept a tax cut for couples of the scale sought by Republicans if Congress would accept his plan to add prescription drug coverage to Medicare.
Republicans showed no inclination to take him up on the offer and said a veto would help them make their case that Democrats are standing in the way of popular tax cuts.
The bill passed by the Senate was packaged by Republicans as a reduction in the "marriage penalty," the quirk in the tax code that leaves many two-income couples paying a higher tax bill than they would if they had remained single.
But it would cut taxes for almost all married couples, whether or not they now pay a marriage penalty. (It would not cut taxes for single people.)
Republicans said the bill was good economic and social policy because it would help to eliminate what they see as an unfair levy on marriage while advancing their agenda of returning as much of the surplus as possible to taxpayers before it is spent by Washington.
They said their case was only helped today by the release of new surplus projections from the Congressional Budget Office. The budget office said it now expected the surplus outside of Social Security to total nearly $2.2 trillion over the next 10 years, assuming that government spending grows in line with inflation. The projection is about $300 billion higher than an estimate made by the White House last month.
"This bill is the centerpiece of our efforts to reduce the tax overpayment by American families," said the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware. "I would ask those who oppose this family tax relief, Just how big will America's budget surplus have to get before America's families deserve to receive some of their tax dollars back?"
The Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said the new surplus projections might allow Congress to phase in some of the provisions in the bill more quickly than planned. He said House and Senate negotiators would consider that issue as they worked to reconcile their differing versions of the legislation this week.
Democrats said the bill suffered from a truth-in-advertising problem, since it would not completely eliminate the marriage penalty and would provide a tax cut even to couples, mostly those with only one working spouse, who benefit from a marriage bonus -- that is, they pay a lower tax bill because they are married than they would if single.
More important, Democrats said, Republicans have shown once again that their main goal is to provide tax breaks to upper-income people, even if doing so requires gambling the country's economic future on what the minority described as the dubious proposition that the surpluses will materialize as projected.
"I think that the surplus projections are the fiscal equivalent of the dot-com stock market," said the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota.
Both the House and the Senate have now passed both the tax cut for married couples and the other main Republican tax bill this year, the repeal of the estate tax, which Mr. Clinton has also vowed to veto.
Although polls have repeatedly found that voters do not see tax cuts as a priority, Republicans remain wedded to them ideologically and continue to put them at the heart of their political strategy. They say that individuals can better decide how to spend the money than government, and that leaving budget surpluses in Washington will lead inevitably to an increase in the size and reach of the federal government.
Democrats acknowledged that specific tax cuts, including the bill passed today, had some political appeal, and they are increasingly offering their own tax agenda focused on providing tax breaks to low- and middle-income people. But they said the Republicans were heading for political trouble by weighting their tax cuts to the wealthy and ignoring middle-class concerns like the costs of college tuition and child care.
The legislation passed today -- which under an arcane budget rule would technically require re-enactment after five years -- would increase the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly, starting next year, so that it is twice the standard deduction for single taxpayers.
The deduction is adjusted each year for inflation. For this year, the standard deduction for couples filing jointly is $7,350, or 1.67 times the deduction for single people, $4,400. Excluding any change for inflation, the legislation would increase the deduction for couples filing jointly next year to $8,800.
The bill would also gradually change the income levels covered by the two lowest income-tax brackets, 15 percent and 28 percent, so that the brackets for married couples filing jointly would grow to cover twice as much income as for single people.
The brackets change each year to adjust for inflation. For this year, the 15 percent bracket covers the first $26,250 of income for single people and 1.67 times as much -- $43,850 -- for couples filing jointly. The 28 percent brackets pick up where the 15 percent brackets end, and under current law extend to $63,550 for single people and to 1.67 times as much, $105,950, for couples filing jointly.
The legislation would increase the size of the brackets for couples filing jointly in steps over the next six years until they cover twice the income levels covered by the brackets for single people.
The bill would also give a tax break to married couples who claim the earned-income tax credit, which is a rebate for low-income working people. And it would keep certain other tax credits for families, including the child and dependent care credits, from being reduced by the alternative minimum tax.
The Democrats who voted for the bill were Senators Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, Max Cleland of Georgia, Dianne Feinstein of California, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey. The Republican who broke with his party to vote against the measure was Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio.

AN ACCORD ON TELECOM

 BODY:
Japan and the United States agreed early today to throw open the world's second biggest telecommunications market to greater competition, ending one of the thorniest disputes between the world's two biggest economies. The agreement came after nine days of talks in Tokyo centered around former state monopoly NTT's (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) last mile interconnection rates, which Washington had argued were too high, choking competition and preventing Internet-led growth in the recession-weary economy.

HEADLINE: U.S. OFFERS AFRICA $1 BILLION A YEAR FOR FIGHTING AIDS

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
The United States plans to offer sub-Saharan African nations $1 billion in loans annually to finance the purchase of American AIDS drugs and medical services, a program that greatly increases the money available to combat the disease in a region that has become its epicenter.
The program, which will be announced by the United States Export-Import Bank on Wednesday, comes after five multinational drug companies agreed in May to cut the prices they charge African nations for drugs to combat AIDS. The loans will help poor nations to buy the drugs that fight the complications and transmission of AIDS, and which are expensive even at discounted prices. 
 It is estimated that Africa already has 50 million people who carry H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, far more than any other region, and doing more to fight the disease there has become a central goal of the Clinton administration and several European nations. Despite the severity of the problem, international health officials estimate that only 5 percent of Africans who carry H.I.V. are aware of the fact.
But wealthy nations have only just begun to make money available to match their vocal pledges to address the problem. The United Nations estimated recently that the amount of money devoted to fight the disease in Africa needs to rise 10-fold to $3 billion annually if the nations hardest hit are to make significant progress in education, prevention and care.
"This is at least a first step in showing the world that Africa is important to the United States and that we can make a dent in this terrible problem," said James A. Harmon, president of the Export-Import Bank, which is an independent government agency financed by Congress. "We think that this is the most significant funding commitment by any international institution to date."
Mr. Harmon said he expected that export promotion agencies in Europe and Japan would eventually match the American initiative. He estimated that together wealthy nations could make $3 billion available in annual financing to African governments that want to buy pharmaceuticals, equipment and services.
The loans are not without complications. Several officials said the administration was split about the wisdom of the Export-Import bank's action, with some officials arguing that it does not make sense for the United States to lend African countries billions of dollars in export credits at a time when Congress is being pressed to forgive past loans.
Most of the new loans, which will not require Congressional approval, would be provided at commercial interest rates that now average about 7 percent, though a small percentage might be offered at a lower concessional rate, bank officials said.
Wealthy nations and international lending agencies are seeking to forgive as much as $100 billion in past development loans to the most indebted nations, including many in Africa. Some administration officials had promoted debt relief to a reluctant Republican-led Congress as the best way for the United States to combat AIDS, because it would free up money that African nations would otherwise have to use to service their debts.
The loans are also likely to increase an active debate among groups interested in development over the best way to tackle AIDS. Many of the African nations and private charity groups have argued that AIDS is a huge medical and social crisis that requires more than discounted drugs and new loans.
"I think what the United States is doing is laudable," said Koby Koomson, Ghana's ambassador in Washington, referring to the loans. "But the pharmaceutical companies need to come around and see that the only way to fight this pandemic is to donate whatever is necessary."
The United States loans could help American pharmaceutical companies prevent the spread of generic knock-offs of their profitable AIDS drugs to Africa. Even with heavy discounts of up to 80 or 90 percent -- the companies have not made public the prices they will charge -- some drug makers may still hope to sell their product profitably in Africa.
The United Nations has said it is exploring the possibility of helping African nations buy generic AIDS drugs from Brazil and India for less money that even the discounted prices Western drug companies might charge for the original product. The drug companies consider generic alternatives a violation of their intellectual property.
But it seems unlikely that Brazil, India or other nations that produce such drugs for home consumption would have the export financing available to help African nations buy the goods. The American loans, along with a recent commitment by the World Bank to provide at least $500 million to help African nations set up anti-AIDS initiatives, give added incentive to African nations to treat many of their AIDS cases with Western medicine.
Even at 90 percent discounts, a typical cocktail of AIDS-suppressing drugs might cost $2,000 a year for a single patient in Africa, more than four times the average per capita income in many of the worst-afflicted countries.
Jacob Gayle, a senior technical adviser for the United Nations AIDS Program, which is based in Geneva, called the Export-Import Bank action "a major announcement" that takes a big step toward providing the $3 billion in annual fund commitments that his agency considers necessary to fight the disease in Africa.
But he stressed that the problem is much broader than a lack of AIDS drugs. African nations need to set up education and prevention efforts and develop the medical infrastructure to administer drugs effectively before they can make good use of loans to purchase medicine, he said.
The loan program is the first time the Export-Import Bank has offered financing for drug purchases by any nation, Mr. Harmon said. Moreover, the government bank plans to make the financing available to the 24 eligible sub-Saharan nations for five-year terms, an unusually long term for loans that are considered high risk.
He called the loans a pilot program that could be expanded or scaled back depending on how African nations and drug companies respond.

Teaching Troops About AIDS
 
UNITED NATIONS, July 18 (By The New York Times) -- At the urging of the United States, the Security Council has adopted a resolution asking for more attention to education about AIDS to be given to peacekeeping troops, who have been carriers of the disease, especially in Africa. The United Nations has been advising peacekeepers on the dangers of AIDS and promoting the use of condoms, and the resolution reinforces those efforts.
In the vote on Monday, however, the American delegation failed to win a stronger resolution. It would have asked for a data base to be kept on peacekeepers to track national efforts to monitor the rate of infection with AIDS and test troops. Countries supplying troops objected to that proposal as an infringement of their control over military policies.

HEADLINE: Clinton Delays Trip to Remain at Peace Talks

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: THURMONT, Md., Wednesday, July 19

 BODY:
In an effort to finalize a Middle East peace accord, President Clinton has delayed his trip to Japan by one day and will stay at Camp David with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, the White House announced just after midnight.
Mr. Clinton now plans to leave for a summit meeting in Japan of the seven leading industrial nations on Thursday morning, giving him at least another 24 hours to urge the two leaders to come to an agreement. 
 The chief White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the president believed that delaying his departure was in the best interests of the peace effort.
The negotiations, described as increasingly intense and heated, were still going after midnight, the third straight night of very late talks.
"They're still at it," another White House spokesman, P. J. Crowley, said at 12:45 a.m.
The decision to stay at Camp David appeared to reflect the up and down twists of the talks. On Tuesday, it seemed that the impossible might be possible: an agreement on all the issues, including Jerusalem. At other times, the temperature fell to the more sober expectation of a modest agreement and a second meeting before Mr. Arafat's Sept. 13 deadline for declaring a Palestinian state.
But members of the Israeli delegation called home on Tuesday, leaking news that the question of Jerusalem had been under discussion since Monday and hinting at progress on this most intractable issue.
In contrast, Mr. Arafat was reported to have called his headquarters in Gaza and told his aides to spread the word that he was considering packing his bags and leaving.
Both sides were playing to their constituents and preparing public opinion for possible outcomes. Mr. Arafat, presumably, was showing that he was not going to give up on his long-held stance that East Jerusalem must be the capital of a Palestinian state.
As part of the same script, Mr. Barak was demonstrating that he was a man of reason, and was prepared, as Channel 2 in Israel reported on Tuesday, to make "unprecedented steps" toward the Palestinian position on Jerusalem. If an agreement were not reached on Jerusalem, Mr. Barak would be able to say that he had tried his best and that the Palestinians were unmovable.
The newspaper Haaretz in Israel published a report in its issue today that the negotiations were focused on a package of American-negotiated proposals involving the "core issues of borders, refugees and Jerusalem." The paper said Mr. Arafat had yet to approve the proposals, implying that Israel had.
The proposals, as described by Haaretz, appeared close to Israeli positions, raising the possibility that they had been leaked to reassure the Israeli public. There was no immediate comment from negotiators, who have maintained public silence.
According to Haaretz, the proposals included a provision for Jerusalem to remain united under Israeli sovereignty, and for Israeli annexation of major blocks of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
In return, the account said, Israel would agree to "broad autonomy" for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, and to accept some 100,000 Palestinian refugees into Israel -- though only in the context of family reunification, and without Israeli acceptance of responsibility for their original expulsion.
The report also said Israeli officials suggested that the current meeting at Camp David could end with a partial accord, which would include some form of Israeli recognition of a Palestinian state."
Though the report could not be verified, it supported other indications that the status of Jerusalem -- one of the most highly charged issues in the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians -- was at least on the table, which in itself marked progress over the seven-year time line of negotiations.
"I was astonished by the degree of progress in the last few hours," said an Israeli who was in contact with the delegation by telephone.
According to reports attributed to Israeli officials, the Israeli delegation at Camp David was presenting a plan that would incorporate the Israeli bedroom communities that are now a de facto part of the capital into the legal entity of Jerusalem. Among these West Bank settlements near Jerusalem being mentioned are Maale Advmim and Givat Zeev.
The plan also calls for areas populated by Palestinians, such as Beit Hanina and the Shuafat refugee camp, to be placed under Palestinian control. The moves together would provide more demographic balance in Jerusalem.
But this version of a solution for Jerusalem leaves unanswered the top concerns of Mr. Arafat, who has insisted all along that East Jerusalem, annexed by the Israelis in the 1967 war, should be the capital of a Palestinian state.
From the Palestinian point of view, the Israeli plan does not deal with the heart of the matter: it leaves under Israeli sovereignty the Old City of Jerusalem, home of the main religious sites of Judaism, Islam and Christianity.
There have also been reports that Mr. Arafat has stood firm on Jerusalem, insisting that no agreement can come out of these negotiations without Palestinian control over the Al Aqsa Mosque and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.
Mr. Lockhart stood studiously above the fray on the issue of Jerusalem. He did not utter the word Jerusalem or mention any of the other substantive matters, such as Palestinian refugees or the boundaries of a new Palestinian state.
Instead, through the release of bits of minutiae on who was meeting with whom, he depicted Mr. Clinton as waiting to do some down-to-the-line persuasion.
Now into the eighth day, the negotiations have produced a roller-coaster of emotions, Mr. Lockhart said.
"You go through various emotions, ranging from moments where you see promise, to moments where the only thing you see is frustration," he said on Tuesday. "Not only the president, the leaders and all the delegations have run the entire range over the last eight days."
Given that the technique of ostentatiously threatening to walk out has been used in the past -- Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt packed his bags at Camp David 22 years ago, and Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel did the same at Wye, Md., three years ago -- Mr. Lockhart was asked if a similar approach had been made this time.
"Not that I know of," he said. "It would be a long walk. You've got to go all the way down the mountain."

Jobless Rate Milestone

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Unemployment in New Jersey dropped to 3.4 percent in June, the lowest rate in three decades, and economists said it indicated virtually full employment statewide.
Mark Boyd, the state labor commissioner, called the rate a sign of a spectacular economy, pointing out that for five of the last six months, unemployment was below 4 percent. 
 The June rate was the lowest since the 3.3 percent mark set in March 1970. The record low is 3.2 percent, set in January 1970.

HEADLINE: Hey, Walkman: Time to Face the Music on a Chip

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT 

 BODY:
LESS than two years ago, the first handheld MP3 player was introduced, at a time when downloadable digital music was still a mystery to just about anyone who wasn't a college student or a basement-bound techie.
That first player, the Rio 300 PMP, has now spawned its third generation, the Rio 600, as sleek and curvy as its predecessor was boxy and bland. And it is only one of a new wave of consumer-friendly digital players, aimed not at the early adopters, the tech-hungry minority who will buy anything as long as it is shiny and showy and it beeps, but at the mass market, the rest of the gadget buyers, the ones who do not like a complicated instruction booklet. 
 The goal is nothing less than overtaking the cassette player and the CD player as the standard for listening to music on the go.
"The critical fact in the technology market right now is tailoring the product to consumer interests, rather than acting as if consumers' lifestyles and listening habits can be made to adapt to a singular device," said Mike Reed, vice president of marketing for S3's Rio division. The new mantra among consumer electronics executives and designers is ease of use, ease of use, ease of use.
Designers at the newly founded Nike Techlab, a sort of Skunk Works for Nike Inc., in Beaverton, Ore., called the approach "simplified logic."
And audio-player designers say they are reworking software as well as trying to improve the hardware, particularly the quality of the sound (still, on average, too tinny) and its volume (in most cases not yet approaching that of a common CD player) and storage (a paltry hour of music using the MP3 format and about twice that using the newer Windows Media Audio format). But for a few exceptions, they have a way to go.
For now, the players still depend almost exclusively on personal computers as a way to download digital music, which makes the audience smaller than that for tapes or CD's. But 45 million American households have personal computers, according to Forrester Research, so there are a lot of potential customers.
Legal issues about copyright still plague the downloading of music from the Web. But the industry is coming to terms with the idea that downloadable music will increasingly be a fact of life for consumers, and it is working with computer and electronics companies to develop better ways to offer music online that also protects copyright.
EMI Recorded Music announced earlier this month that it is releasing some of its songs using Liquid Audio, a digital format seen by many as being one of the more secure in the industry. And the makers of digital players are developing not only new hardware, but also new forms of memory and new systems that do not depend on personal computers for getting the music.
Forward Concepts, a research company in Tempe, Ariz., forecasted that the market for portable digital players will swell to 15 million in 2003 from a projected 3 million users this year. And young people view downloadable music as just another way to listen to what they want to hear. In a survey this spring by eBrain Market Research, a service of the Consumer Electronics Association, 57 percent of consumers 15 to 21 years old said they had played MP3 music files. Among those who had listened to MP3 music, most, according to the survey, found its sound comparable to that of a typical stereo.
So far, the appeal of personal digital players has rested on several factors: small size (the Sony VAIO Music Clip is slightly larger than a hefty fountain pen); completely skip-proof music playback; and the user's freedom to put any combination of songs on them. All of that can be done without cassette tape, compact discs, minidiscs or audio DVD's whirling away inside of them.
The new players, due this summer and early next year, share those features and add new ones. Prices range from about $170 to $300. And some are so simple to use that they would not require extensive thumbing through a voluminous operating manual to learn how to turn the thing on. (That's once you get the music downloaded from the Web or copied from CD's.)
The flattened-egg-shaped audio player called the Personal Sport Audio (PSA) Play, the result of a collaboration of the Nike Techlab and Rio, has its controls -- play, stop, forward and back -- on its smooth face with symbols for key functions so highly raised that users can press them through the fabric of their pockets.
Curtis Milander, marketing manager for the Nike Techlab, calls the approach blind design. "You don't have to look at it to operate it," Mr. Milander said. The PSA Play is scheduled to be available later this summer.
The MiniJam by InnoGear, scheduled for release Aug. 1, is packed into a small module that plugs into a Handspring Visor handheld computer. Once in place, the device is ready to store and play MP3's.
Engineers at PortalPlayer, a Santa Clara, Calif., developer of audio hardware and software, say they are building systems that will allow portable players to record digital music directly from a source, like a CD player, without the need of a computer.
Currently, almost all portable digital players must be plugged into a computer that either downloads music in a compressed format like MP3, which is the most popular, or the computer can translate music from CD's into a format like MP3, a process called ripping. The files are then copied and moved to the memory of a portable player.
"What we are saying is that with our technology, all you have to do is press the Record button on a player," said Michael J. Maia, vice president of marketing for PortalPlayer.
In the future, said Ron Boire, senior vice president of portable audio for Sony Electronics, personal digital players may be equipped with BlueTooth technology, an international standard that would allow devices like computers, electronic organizers and mobile phones to exchange information using radio waves. It would let consumers wirelessly load music into their players.
"The goal is to make the technology as seamless and transparent to the user as possible," Mr. Boire said.
S3's Rio said it shipped 500,000 players between November 1998, when the first Rio player was introduced, and February 2000. By the end of this summer, Mr. Reed said, that figure is expected to double.
But industry executives and others who follow the industry agree that if portable digital audio players are going to find a mass market -- customers other than those between the ages of 16 and 24 -- the players are going to have to offer mass appeal.
The first stumbling block -- storage -- is being tackled on several fronts.
Practically all portable players store music on solid state memory chips, including Compact Flash, Smart Media cards and Sony's Memory Sticks.
While solid state memory chips are small, run noiselessly and are reliable, they are also expensive and appear to be growing more so as demand begins to outstrip supply, manufacturers say.
One frustrated executive at an American consumer electronics manufacturer said he had traveled to Asia in an unsuccessful search for a company that could make and then sell the hardware components for a digital audio player to his company for $1. The reason? Much of the cost of a player, which is passed to consumers, is consumed by the cost of memory.
A digital player with adequate memory -- for at least a half-hour of playback -- that costs less than $100 has eluded the marketplace.
Most players are sold with 32 megabytes of embedded, often called "onboard," memory. A 32-megabyte memory card costs about $100. And the rule of thumb is that a player, like Samsung's Yepp player, requires about a megabyte of memory for every minute of recorded MP3 music (at near-CD-quality sound).
Adding more music requires more memory for storage, and the cost starts to climb steeply, said Craig Rathbun, the worldwide director of Clik technology for Iomega, maker of disk-based removable storage devices like the popular Zip and Jaz cartridges.
The 32-megabyte memory cards used in audio players are "essentially $100 half-hour albums," Mr. Rathbun said. Iomega is taking a different approach by adapting its Clik drives to digital audio players so that they may use the 40-megabyte Clik disks to store and play music.
Clik disks are not solid state and introduce moving parts into the players. But they are cheaper than solid state memory, Mr. Rathbun said.
A 40-megabyte Clik disk can cost as little as $10. They are also rugged, Mr. Rathbun said, as he held a handful of the half-dollar-size Clik disks, each containing a different genre of music.
This month, the first digital player using Clik technology, the Rave MP 2300 by Sensory Science, reached the market. Iomega officials said seven players with built-in Clik drives by other manufacturers -- including one by Iomega itself -- are expected to be available before the end of the year.
Rio is exploring alternatives to expensive, solid-state flash memory for storing music in its players.
Currently, the Rio 600, which is the first player to seamlessly play music encoded in the MP3 or Windows Media format, comes with 32 megabytes of memory. A more feature-laden Rio 800 is expected later this summer, with 64 megabytes of included memory.
Rio has also taken a novel approach to the question of expanding the storage capabilities of its audio players. Earlier models like the Rio 300 and Rio 500 use, as most players do, a slot in which an expansion memory card can be inserted, boosting the player's overall capacity to play more music. But such designs are limited, making it difficult to add more than a 64-megabyte card to the 32 megabytes already built into the player.
The new Rio players are designed with what its engineers call a backpack. It is a slip-off and slip-on back that contains the player's memory and power supply. The Rio 600, which costs $169, comes with a backpack with 32 megabytes built in and a single AA battery to power the unit.
An additional 64-megabyte backpack comes with a rechargeable battery. And Rio, in partnership with I.B.M., will soon release a backpack that will house a 340-megabyte I.B.M. Microdrive. Also in development is a Rio backpack equipped with a new 500-megabyte drive by DataPlay.
While executives at S3's Rio division said they were not ready to discuss the cost of the backpacks with the minidrives, they said the emerging memory technology helps to make their new Rio players "future-proof."
And because the disk-based storage devices spin only to retrieve a song before playing it from small embedded memory, they do not greatly tax battery life or make players more susceptible to skipping when moved or bumped.
"I think we are turning the corner with the release of the Rio 600 and other products in the family," Mr. Reed said, and added that Rio is looking beyond the youth market.
S3's Rio division, as well as a number of other consumer electronics companies, is also preparing to release a line of home-based digital audio players that resemble conventional stereo components. The newly released SongBank SL CD Memory System by Lydstrom not only plays and records CD's, but can also convert their content into a digital format and save iton the $800 machine's hard drive.
"When you look at the ways that people listen to CD's today," Mr. Reed at Rio said, you can pretty much count on us to replace that CD technology in the future with our technology."

HEADLINE: Is the Customer Ever Right?

BYLINE: By KATIE HAFNER 

 BODY:
BRENDA WINEGARDNER has been having a nightmare that is increasingly familiar to most consumers. In it she wanders between reality and virtual reality, from voice mail to e-mail to customer service counter, trying to get her computer fixed. But it's not a dream.
Since January, Ms. Winegardner, who operates a Web-based gift shop and mail-order business from her home in Monte Rio, Calif., about 60 miles north of San Francisco, has been battling CompUSA's customer service department because, she said, the Hewlett-Packard personal computer she bought there regularly slows down, then crashes. 
 "I got hives from the stress," she said after a recent visit to the store's real-world customer service counter, pointing to a telltale splotch on her cheek. She has often lain awake until 3 a.m. The hours she has spent on hold, not just with the store, but also with CompUSA's corporate headquarters and with Hewlett-Packard, she said, are too numerous to count.
When she does reach a human, she said, she encounters rudeness, incompetence or plain indifference. It's the unpleasantly real version of a well-known sketch from the 1970's British television show, "Monty Python's Flying Circus." In the skit, a man tries to return a dead parrot to a pet store and encounters a clerk who insists that the parrot is "resting."
Ms. Winegardner has had to struggle to have her complaint heard, she added, even though she sprang for CompUSA's $349.99 Premium Gold Service when she bought the computer. The card guaranteed unlimited access to technical support for three years.
Ms. Winegardner's experience is far from unusual, and CompUSA is no different from many other stores. Customer service that fails to satisfy is increasingly common. As measured by the American Customer Satisfaction Index, compiled at the University of Michigan, customer-service satisfaction has dropped overall since 1994. American consumers are more unhappy with the service they are receiving for nearly every sector of the economy measured by the index, including the computer industry, hotels, airlines, telephone companies and automobile manufacturers. There are many causes, but one that is widely recognized is technology itself. Phone systems and Web sites that are supposed to help can turn into infuriating mazes.
"This is a rough time for customer service," said Bob Chatham, a Forrester Research analyst who follows customer service.
One reason, he said, may be a general decline in civility, but he also pointed to technological advances in customer service, or customer care, as it is known in industry parlance. For example, he said, automated phone answering systems can send a caller into a loop, provoking the same explosive anger usually reserved for tailgaters, slowpokes and that idiot with the cell phone driving in front of you.
And the Web is often no help. For instance, Mr. Chatham said, "I got an auto-response e-mail once from AT&T Wireless that told me to call the call center."
"It's a fascinating paradox," said Laurel Pallock, an investigator who runs the complaint mediation program in the San Francisco district attorney's office. "Here we are in this predicament because of technology, the very thing that is supposed to keep us from being in this predicament."
Until recently, Ms. Pallock was the host of a weekly television program on consumers' issues. "I've gone on the air and said, 'You guys who own these companies, why don't you listen to your own customer service voice mail and see if you can get through to yourselves?' "
But even Ms. Pallock is not exempt from criticism. She was a guest on a local radio show recently when a man called in to complain about the automated phone system in Ms. Pallock's office. She apologized on the air, agreed that the office's phone system was "horrible," called him afterward to give him her direct line and set about fixing the problem.
Add to the phone rage what Mr. Chatham describes as still more dysfunctional aspects of today's customer service systems. More often than not, he said, customers' records on a company's Web sites are not linked with those maintained for the agents working by telephone.
"There's a self-inflicted phenomenon going on here. Companies got all excited about this technology, so they put it up without thinking about how it relates to everything else they do. Once they opened that Pandora's box, it launched this whole litany of problems."
But there is another, less technical, explanation for the decline in service. Mr. Chatham cited the overall labor shortage, which has forced companies to hire less qualified workers for what are already low-paying, largely thankless jobs.
"Would you look forward to coming to work if you had to spend the day talking to irate cusotmers?" he asked.
As a result, turnover on customer service desks runs as high as 100 percent per year, he said.
One author has even suggested that dissatisfaction has to do with customers' experiences with good service. Dr. Leonard Berry, a professor of marketing at Texas A&M University and author of "Discovering the Soul of Service" (Free Press, 1999), agreed that service was not good. "I give service in America a C minus," he said.
But at the same time, Dr. Berry added, people's expectations for service are rising. "We want better service even though we think we'll get worse service," he said. "And part of the reason is because we have experienced excellent service enough to know that it's possible."
Whatever the explanation, there seems to be no dispute about the reality of the decline. Complaints to the Better Business Bureau have risen sharply in recent years, said Ron Berry (no relation to Leonard Berry), senior vice president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus in Arlington, Va. Even so, Mr. Berry added, only a small percentage of disgruntled customers actually file formal complaints to bureaus.
Rachel Barany, an educational consultant in New York, is a conspicuous exception. In March, she bought a Sony VAIO notebook computer at Data Vision, a computer retailer in Manhattan, but she was unable to get the computer to work properly. After several rounds of phone calls and repeated trips to the store, she sent off a raft of letters and cc's to the Better Business Bureau, Sony, The New York Times, Data Vision and American Express, whose card she used to pay for the machine.
Finally, last month, Data Vision allowed Ms. Barany to exchange her computer for a less expensive I.B.M. Thinkpad. The difference in price was issued as a store credit.
But Ms. Barany is unhappy with the store credit. She wants a refund.
Every dispute has at least two sides. Jim Garson, a vice president of Data Vision, said that there was nothing wrong with Ms. Barany's laptop and that all it needed was a software patch for the internal modem. He said that he had offered to install the software for her but that she had declined. By allowing her to trade for the newer computer, he said, he took a loss on the old one.
"I don't take back a notebook three months later, especially when there's nothing wrong with it," he said. "How much more customer service can you give?"
Mr. Garson said many of the complaints against his store were unfounded. One customer called Mr. Garson to say she had bought an Olympus camera a year ago and seldom used it, so she wanted to return it, he said. "I said: 'Ma'am, there's nothing I can do. Try to sell it on eBay.' " She complained to the Better Business Bureau.
Some consumers do not feel satisfied unless they make themselves heard. Julie Kennedy, a corporate lawyer in San Francisco, is a customer service maven if ever there was one. On the phone, she always presses "0" immediately to reach a human. She shops only in stores that will give refunds, and she has no qualms about firing off a letter if she is dissatisfied. "I think there's a social contract that goes beyond courtesy," Ms. Kennedy said. "You pay someone money and you expect to be valued. It ticks me off when I find people so oblivious to that principle."
But Ms. Kennedy also makes a point of sending a letter when she stumbles upon excellent service.
Two years ago, Ms. Kennedy called United Airlines to reserve a flight to Ireland, using her free miles. Dodging the thicket of blackout dates made the task look formidable until she found an agent as interested in making the trip work as she was.
"He was trying everything," she said. "I was on the phone with him for over two hours. He tried every date, every time, and I got to use my free tickets." She sent a letter of praise to the airline.
Another consumer who keeps careful watch over the service he gets is Jim Hobby. He has a professional interest in the subject as well: he is vice president of customer client care at Gateway and has spent 25 years in the customer service business, including time at American Express and Federal Express.
"My kids call me the client from hell," he said. "They say when they're out with me and I get this look, they run, because they know someone is going to get my lecture on what customer service should be."
What customer service should be, he said, is a collection of thoughtfully placed "pleases" and "thank yous," combined with careful listening. These are known as soft skills. "It's showing that you care and you want to work with the customer," he said.
Service via live chat is growing in popularity, Mr. Hobby said, and so is the use of e-mail for such interactions. Gateway has also simplified its automated phone system in response to what Mr. Hobby described as a great deal of customer frustration.
Complaining is getting easier in some places. Many companies that emphasize customer service, like American Express, now let customers dispute charges on line.
The Better Business Bureau has seen a rise in the number of online complaints it gets. And a growing number of sites dedicated to filing gripes are cropping up online.
One such site, called uGetHeard.com, allows consumers to send both gripes and praise. Complaints are followed by efforts by uGetHeard.com to resolve the disputes. The average resolution is small -- around $50 -- but the gratification for the customer is beyond measure, said Michael Chen, the site's chief executive.
Mr. Chen said he was inspired to set up the site after a particularly unpleasant experience he had last spring at a private mailing center in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he went to mail a package. After paying, he grew nervous when he saw that no one was wrapping the package, so he decided to do it himself.
But when an employee demanded that he pay for the sealing tape he was using, he protested. After a while the manager emerged from the back. "She said: 'You're really irritating. We're too busy to deal with you,' " Mr. Chen recalled. "I've never been spoken to like that."
That was all the impetus he needed.

HEADLINE: Okinawans Hope Economic Meeting Puts Focus on Art Missing Since War

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Leaders on the Japanese island of Okinawa plan to use the eight-nation economic summit conference there this week to help speed the recovery of cultural property that disappeared from homes, public buildings and religious shrines when American soldiers seized the island in 1945.
To date, more than 100 artworks -- including ancient Buddhist temple bells, statuary and sacred manuscripts -- have been returned by American veterans, their heirs and, in at least one case, forcibly by the United States Customs Service. But one scholar, Peter Kleinen of the German Institute of Japanese Studies, recently reported finding nearly 800 objects of Okinawan origin in the holdings of 21 American museums. 
 Since many of these artworks were put on display after World War II, scholars believe they were looted during and immediately after the fighting.
One of the most cherished objects still missing is the ancient headdress worn by the Ryukyu kings who ruled Okinawa until the island was annexed by imperial Japan in 1879. The headdress is a silk, helmet-shaped crown studded with pearls, gold, jade and other precious stones. It has not been seen publicly since 1945.
Last month a delegation of six City Council members from Nago, where the economic meeting is to begin tomorrow, flew to Washington and gave President Clinton and other administration officials a council resolution calling on the United States to "investigate the whereabouts of our lost cultural assets and take relevant steps for their return."
Mikio Yabu, the leader of the group, said at a stop in New York, "We hope the summit conferees will pay attention not only to international economic issues but to the restoration of cultural losses from Okinawa."
Speaking by telephone from Naha, Okinawa's capital, Shizuo Kishaba, chairman of the semi-official Ryukyu-American Historical Research Society, who has played a major role in returning stolen objects to Okinawa, took a more forceful position.
While stopping short of predicting that President Clinton would face a hostile demonstration when he arrives in Okinawa, Mr. Kishaba said, "The president knows what we are seeking, and if he arrives empty-handed it will certainly sour our relationship with the United States."
The State Department, in response to an inquiry, issued a statement saying, "We recognize the deep concern of the people of Okinawa about artifacts missing since the end of World War II." The F.B.I., the statement said, has offered to list missing items in a database available at www.fbi.gov/majcases/arttheft/ art.htm.
Missing items are also being listed in the national stolen art file, accessible only to law enforcement officials, the statement said.
A State Department spokesman, however, said that it was unlikely that the American delegation would actually bring any of the artifacts this week.
In World War II priceless artworks were seized by soldiers in both the Pacific and European theaters and sometimes justified as war trophies. The issue of unreturned works still troubles relations between Germany and Russia. For American servicemen and women theft from conquered territories was prohibited by the Articles of War, No. 93.
Mr. Kishaba said that many American servicemen who stole objects from Okinawa in 1945 later sold or donated them to American museums. "The result is that Okinawan treasures are scattered across the United States," he said.
The Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Mass., has a group of six ceramic and pewter objects sold for $75 in 1947 by Cmdr. Carl W. Sternfelt, an American intelligence officer who served on Okinawa during the war.
Records of this sale are particularly significant, Mr. Kishaba said, because he and many others believe that Commander Sternfelt, who died in 1976, also took the royal Ryukyu headdress in 1945.
Much of Commander Sternfelt's loot was confiscated by United States Customs agents in 1953 and returned to Okinawa later that year in a ceremony celebrating the centennial of Matthew Perry's historic visit to Okinawa.
Commander Sternfelt's son, Robert Sternfelt, of Scituate, Mass., denies that his father ever possessed the headdress and said that his father voluntarily surrendered the booty he brought home from Okinawa.
Christina Hellmich, a spokeswoman for the Peabody Essex Museum, said, "If we are presented with evidence that Commander Sternfelt stole the objects now in our possession, we would repatriate them."
Another point of contention is a 10-inch flat stone from Okinawa incised so as to suggest that it may have been used as an ancient sundial or a navigational instrument. It is now in the collection of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Philadelphia.
Mr. Kishaba believes the stone was taken by an American soldier after the war and wants it returned to Okinawa, but Gregory L. Posschl, curator of the Asian collection of the museum, said that the provenance of the object was uncertain and that it could not be returned unless Okinawa's rightful ownership was established.
"We have no desire to keep things that don't belong to us," Mr. Posschl said. "But we have to go through a process that is both rigorous and fair to determine the validity of these claims."
In 1945 Okinawa was the scene of the largest land, air and sea battle in history, and the focus of Japan's desperate resort to kamikaze attacks.
The 81 days of fierce fighting that began on Easter left 12,000 Americans dead or missing and 72,000 wounded, more than twice the numbers from Guadalcanal and Iwo Jima combined.
Japanese losses were even greater. The Japanese death toll soared to 120,000 combatants and more than 150,000 civilians.
Few structures on the island were left standing, and looting by American soldiers -- commanders as well as enlisted men -- was widespread.
"A frenzy of souvenir hunting was part of the terrible strangeness of that battle," said George Feifer, author of "Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb" (Houghton Mifflin, 1992). "The Marines risked their lives to tear a photograph off of a wall or even to grab a pair of sneakers."
Mr. Kishaba said, "We were in danger of having our culture erased."
Members of the delegation spoke emotionally last month about their sense of loss. Kazunori Nagayama said learning to play the sanshin, a classical Okinawan stringed instrument, had inspired his interest in Okinawan cultural history.
When he plays his 80-year-old sanshin, he said, he dreams of ancient court life where such instruments were played in the presence of the royal family.
"But my dreams are frustrating because we have so little to remind us of our roots," he said.
Morio Kohama, 42, said he had learned about the history of Okinawa from his father, who is 86. "But I have no proof, nothing I can hold in my hands, of the truth of what he is telling me."

HEADLINE: LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL REVIEW;
Sounds of Almost Wordless Songs

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

 BODY:
The beauty of a diverse and multifaceted festival is that little connections pop up, too modest to qualify as full-blown themes and surely not planned as such. Two such connections arose on Tuesday evening, when Lincoln Center Festival 2000 introduced its three-part Meredith Monk retrospective, Voice Travel, featuring Ms. Monk as composer and conductor, with "Solo Landscapes," a program at the New York Society for Ethical Culture.
The first half consisted of unaccompanied songs, chiefly "Songs From the Hill," 11 pieces from 1976 inspired by the landscape and lore of New Mexico. These are vocal utterances in Ms. Monk's patented style, virtually devoid of intelligible words and made of shaped syllables, plosives, hums, even mere breaths. 
 In the sixth song, "Silo," Ms. Monk's amazingly flexible voice took on the color and disembodied wail long associated with electronic music; the piece would hardly have seemed out of place in the festival's Electronic Evolution series, just ended. In the eighth song, "Bird Code," Ms. Monk played a big, squawking specimen; the piece seemed an odd deviation from all the bird song (mostly, more cultivated) being heard in the festival's series devoted to music of Messiaen, which ends tomorrow.
With the range of sounds Ms. Monk can produce, she probably could have connected just as well to any other music the festival might have put forward. (As it is, a listener who missed the opera "Writing to Vermeer" can only guess how Ms. Monk's flirtations with Minimalism in ensemble works still to be heard may relate to Louis Andriessen's there.) The songs also conjured bugs (croaking or quirkily singing), old women and ghosts, depicted in all manner of articulation. In the last song, "Jew's Harp," Ms. Monk proved a virtuoso on that mouthful of an instrument, even singing along.
The second half of the program added piano. Ms. Monk accompanied herself in rudimentary fashion in more or less similar songs or was accompanied by Nurrit Tilles in bigger songs, ending with the most recent, "New York Requiem," a tribute to AIDS victims, from 1993. Ms. Tilles also played the "St. Petersburg Waltz," a piano solo of 1994.
Ms. Monk everywhere impressed with her versatility and imagination if not always with terseness and economy. In the end it all seemed a bit much of the same thing.
What today seems remarkable about the early works ("Porch," from 1969, and the songs of the 70's), at a time when "avant-garde" has become synonymous with "edge," is their consistent sweetness and innocence. In quantity they occasionally cloy (especially, for a listener allergic to cats, in the meowing).
More varied angles on Ms. Monk's music are promised in the remaining programs: "Expeditions in Concert," with chamber orchestra, tomorrow at Alice Tully Hall, and "Monk Perspectives," with film, on Sunday at La Guardia High School. And keep an ear out for others of those little connections.

HEADLINE: Coke, Lauding Its Strategy, Says Results Beat Estimates

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Declaring that its six-month-old "think local, act local" strategy was working in some parts of the world, the Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings slightly beat analysts' expectations, mainly because of savings from a sweeping reorganization this year.
Net income fell to $926 million, or 37 cents a diluted share, from $942 million, or 38 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 5 percent, to $5.62 billion from $5.33 billion, mostly because of price increases in some countries and improving economic conditions in others, the company said. 
 Excluding charges of $191 million, or 5 cents a share, for the reorganization, in which 5,200 employees were laid off, and 2 cents a share to reduce inventory of concentrate, profit was $1.2 billion, or 44 cents a share. Analysts had expected the company to earn 41 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
The inventory reduction, in which Coke stopped selling concentrate to bottlers that had bloated inventories, was announced in January as part of Coke's efforts to rebuild its global business. That was when Coke officials also said they would decentralize many of the company's operations and put more authority into the hands of local management.
One money manager questioned the inventory charge, saying it was not accompanied by a dollar amount on the company's income statement and therefore could not be properly analyzed by investors.
"They are trying to give themselves credit for business they did not do," said James S. Chanos, who runs the Kynikos Fund. "To say that their business would have been X if they had been able to ship the concentrate that they shipped and booked last year is an unbelievable example of accounting arrogance. Where is the audit committee?"
A Coke spokesman, Rob Baskin, said the charge amounted to $80 million. "We don't have it as a line item because it is a reconciling charge," he said. "We are noting that we did not ship that concentrate in the second quarter of this year. We did ship it in the second quarter of 1999."
The company said its volume, measured in cases of soft drinks, grew 7 percent in the quarter, including volume growth from the Cadbury Schweppes brands acquired last year. Without the Cadbury brands, volume rose about 5 percent.
Local marketing efforts in Germany, where a campaign is directed at German teenagers, produced volume growth of 9 percent, the company said. Germany is Coke's fourth-largest overseas market. In the United States, where Coke's biggest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, said on Tuesday that volume would be flat or rise just 1 percent this year, Coke plans an intensive marketing effort in the second half of this year. The company will also introduce certain brands regionally, like Fanta, and emphasize "pervasiveness" of its products in places like convenience stores and offices, said Coke's president, Jack L. Stahl.
Douglas N. Daft, the chairman and chief executive, told analysts during a conference call, "I'm happy with the improving trends in the business, and to see and feel and touch the improvement in the mindset of our people around the world."
Investors lifted shares of Coke $2.31.25, to $60.50.
Analysts seemed positive, too, though they noted that Coke's second quarter last year was one of its worst, including a big product recall in parts of Europe.
"I am more encouraged than I was after the April meeting," said Jennifer Solomon at Salomon Smith Barney, referring to a meeting in New York where Coke's senior management presided over a five-hour marathon of commercials and presentations on marketing efforts around the world that generally fell flat.
Mr. Daft said then that he expected volume to increase 5 to 6 percent this year, and 7 to 8 percent over the long term. In the conference call yesterday, he and other Coke executives said they were "comfortable" with those projections.
Several analysts questioned Mr. Daft about possible changes in Coke's bottling system. With the emphasis on local decision making, some analysts expect Mr. Daft to break up some of the larger bottlers or find alternatives to what one called the "pan-regional" system now in place, in which Coca-Cola Amatil, based in Sydney, Australia, oversees operations stretching from there to the Philippines, and Coca-Cola Enterprises, based in Atlanta, has 74 percent of Coke's business in the United States and five Western European countries.
In response, Mr. Daft outlined what he called "a broad-based, broad-front approach to what is a very complex issue," saying that technology and an emphasis on building relationships were enabling changes in Coke's dealings with its bottlers. At another point in the call, he said that volume growth would mean improved results for Coke and the bottlers, which he described more than once as "interdependent."

HEADLINE: An Indochina Flashback: Old Tremors Rock Laos

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: VIENTIANE, Laos, July 14

 BODY:
The Asian economic crisis has claimed this tiny Communist nation as its last, its poorest and its most obscure victim, and -- perhaps as a result -- Laos has suddenly been hit by an unaccustomed shudder of unrest.
A series of unexplained bomb blasts, an improbable cross-border raid by a hapless band of insurgents and a brief political demonstration -- the first in decades -- have raised the political temperature in this quiet and tightly controlled nation. 
 And now, in the one place the Indochina war never ended, reports have surfaced that Vietnamese security forces have become active again, if only in a supporting role, in tamping down a flare-up of fighting by ethnic rebels.
In this land of secrets and strongmen, no one outside the inner circle seems to know what is going on, and indeed there may be no one explanation for this troubled moment.
But some analysts say that, as in some other Asian nations, the economic squeeze may have heightened a variety of grievances. Last year inflation hit 150 percent and the currency, the kip, fell to a tenth of its value, the steepest collapse in the region.
The exception may be the ethnic insurgency, which never quite died after the Communist victories in Indochina in 1975. It mostly involves the Hmong hill tribesmen, descendants of the anti-Communist fighters who helped carry out America's "secret war" in Laos, still stirred to action by local grievances as well as by wartime commanders who fled to the United States two decades ago.
The Hmong (pronounced mung) still operate in the mountains of northern Laos, where the North Vietnamese built most of their supply line, the Ho Chi Minh trail, and where American bombers dropped more tonnage than in all of Vietnam.
"This is a leftover of the Indochina war, which everyone tries to forget," said Sunai Phasuk, a Thai expert on Laos at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. "There are those who left for foreign countries who still have their relatives in Laos and are supporting them with every possible means."
The reports of Vietnamese military involvement are sketchy, unconfirmed and hotly debated by analysts here and abroad. But they are supported by eyewitness accounts from foreigners who work in the mountains that border Vietnam, along with official reports of stepped-up government and military contacts between the two nations.
The Vietnamese are currently building a military hospital in the area of conflict.
Dr. Sunai said military analysts in neighboring Thailand estimated that a Vietnamese troop presence rose to 10,000 or more late last year.
But Carlyle A. Thayer, an Australian expert on the Vietnamese military, said any Vietnamese presence probably involves a long-standing deployment of troops from the Interior Ministry rather than an incursion by the armed forces. "At most it is advice and supplies and equipment and people on the ground to observe and report back to Vietnam," he said, noting that Vietnam has its own concerns in keeping its mountain tribes quiet along the porous border.
"Since late last year, or earlier, the Hmong armed groups have been giving the Lao Army hell," he said. "They've raided and grabbed payrolls and grabbed weapons. They've ambushed columns and shot down a helicopter."
The Laotian government also blames the Hmong for at least five small explosions here in Vientiane and elsewhere -- at a restaurant, a bus station, a marketplace, a hotel and on a bus -- that caused a number of injuries.
But most foreign analysts doubt that the Hmong were involved, seeing the recent unrest as diffuse and without central coordination. No one has claimed responsibility for any of the bombs, and some of them may be copycat affairs involving personal or business disputes.
One event reported by an Asian diplomat did seem intended to send a message. Gunmen are said to have stopped a rural bus, removed its passengers, set it alight, photographed it and disappeared.
A cross-border raid on July 3 seemed to be the clearest attempt to capitalize on the political uncertainties of the moment. About 60 rebels armed with assault rifles and grenade launchers crossed the border from Thailand, attacked a customs post, took hostages, released them and were gunned down by government forces. At least 5 were killed and 28 were captured when they retreated into Thailand.
According to Thai reports, the raiders had a document linking them to Crown Prince Soulivong Savang, the heir to the now-defunct Laotian throne, who fled across the Mekong River after the Communist victory and is now lobbying for support in the United States and Europe.
"I suspect that this was an attempt to exploit the general level of unhappiness in Laos," said Martin Stuart-Fox, a professor of history at the University of Queensland in Australia who has written a history of Laos. "It's the old network of resistance that was being supported by the Thai military and by an expatriate Lao network in the United States and France and Australia and is trying to resuscitate itself."
More than 250,000 Hmong now live in the United States, as well as tens of thousands of lowland Lao.
If the economic crisis is the underlying theme to these various incidents, it may have sharpened a variety of agendas.
According to one theory, the bomb blasts could be an attempt by a faction of the ruling clique to discredit another in advance of a party congress expected early next year.
Another theory is that anyone with a point to make may want to be heard before Dec. 2, which is the 25th anniversary of the end of the war in Laos and the takeover by the Communist Pathet Lao government.
That relatively low-key end to the war -- the American Embassy shut down for just one day -- came half a year after the traumatic Communist victories in Vietnam and Cambodia in April 1975.
Laos has since reverted to its role as a buffer state between Communist Vietnam and China and the surging capitalist economies of Southeast Asia. If Laos becomes unstable, one diplomat said, "the most frightening thing would be the reviving of some cold war traditions, with China and Vietnam backing Vientiane, hoping to keep away the stronger influence of the Thais."
Laos, one of the world's 10 poorest countries, has become a little brother to Vietnam, following its failed Communist policies for a decade and then, like Vietnam, opening up its economy at the start of the 1990's.
When the economic crisis struck the region in 1997, Laos was at first insulated by its isolation and poverty. But with its economy heavily dependent on Thailand, it soon lost most of the investment and markets it did have.
Just about the time Thailand was beginning to recover, Laos crashed. The 80 percent of its five million people who live on the edge of poverty in the countryside remained relatively untouched -- as poor as ever.
But civil servants, like teachers, nurses and bureaucrats, saw their pay shrink to almost nothing and many abandoned their jobs.
Among these people, said a European diplomat, "there is growing unhappiness. There were hopes a couple of years ago that people's lives were going to improve and that their children would have a better future. That's just not here anymore."
A leading foreign expert on Laos saw this as the major source of potential unrest and, possibly, of change. "There was a social contract in the early 90's," he said. "That contract depended on people's lives getting better. I think the theme is what I call the undoing of the social contract, and the question is whether the government can knit it back together, and it doesn't look as though they're doing a very good job of it."
He added: "When there is an economic contraction like this, and the pie at the top starts getting smaller, the possibility is that members of the elite start getting fed up. The only way things will come apart is when particular groups get squeezed out of the action."
But outside the power structure, the European diplomat said, "there is nothing here to take its place, no civil society, no democratic opposition, nothing. This country is totally repressed."
Thus, to diplomats and aid workers who live in Laos, the most astonishing -- and poignant -- event was an aborted demonstration last October that involved at least 50 university students and teachers, of whom at least five remain in detention.
This was the one echo Laos has seen of the pro-democracy movements that have swept the region. In an open letter, the protesters called for respect for human rights, the release of political prisoners, a multiparty political system and elections for a new National Assembly.
Little more is known about the demonstrators or their fate. More than in any other Communist nation, even the Soviet Union of the past, diplomats here throw up their hands in confusion over the nation they are observing.
"It's still vague and murky," said one of them. "That's my best assessment."
In a peculiar headline the other day, the government newspaper Vientiane Times seemed to be similarly at a loss. "The truth is out there . . ." read the headline, and stopped. The article beneath it offered little clue.

HEADLINE: Decline in Computer Shipments Lifts Trade Gap to $31 Billion

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit widened slightly more than expected in May, to a record $31.04 billion, as both exports and imports declined for the second straight month, new figures show.
A decline in shipments of computer parts and other electronic goods helped drag down exports 1 percent, to $85.7 billion, the Commerce Department said today. Imports slipped 0.3 percent, to $116.8 billion, but the weakness largely reflected fewer shipments of automobiles. Imports of consumer goods like televisions, toys and VCR's continued to be robust in May. 
 "The combination of strong domestic demand and a strong dollar means we're pulling in consumer imports at a record pace," said Robert Dederick, an economic consultant with the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "The economic expansion continues to roll along."
The deficit grew 1.8 percent in May from April's imbalance of $30.5 billion, which was revised up from the a previous estimate of $30.44 billion. The May data put the shortfall on track to reach more than $350 billion for all 2000, up one-third from last year's record $265 billion. Businesses are now starting to stock up on imports for the start of the school year and the holiday season.
The chronic trade deficit has caused some economists to worry about the outflow of dollars. If an economic slowdown also causes a withdrawal of overseas investment in the United States, the dollar could weaken, raising import prices and aggravating inflation, they say.
By country, the merchandise trade deficit with Japan fell to $6.9 billion in May from $7.3 billion in April. It was $5.2 billion a year earlier. The deficit with China rose $6.3 billion in May from $5.8 billion in April and $5.2 billion in May 1999.

HEADLINE: Earnings at United and American Beat Expectations

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Earnings at the nation's two largest airline companies, the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, and the AMR Corporation, owner of American Airlines, handily beat Wall Street expectations yesterday. But the good news was tempered by United's warning of weaker earnings in the current quarter, igniting a large sell-off of airline stocks, led by UAL.
In addition, US Airways, the No. 6 carrier, said its profit plunged 41 percent, excluding one-time gains, while T.W.A., which has continued to elude profitability despite the travel boom of recent years, narrowed its losses more than analysts had predicted. 
 The strong showing by United and American came after similar reports by Continental Airlines and the low-fare leader Southwest Airlines on Tuesday. "If the economy is slowing down, we don't see it in the airline business," said Tom Horton, AMR's chief financial officer.
Operating profit at UAL rose 17 percent, to $408 million, or $3.47 a diluted share, compared with $349 million, or $2.86 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent, to $5.11 billion from $4.54 billion in 1999. Analysts had expected the company to earn $3.24 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
United said that it had benefited from higher fares and a 6.8 percent increase in passenger traffic in the quarter, led by a 21 percent increase in the Asia-Pacific region. That more than made up for the surge in fuel prices, which is an airline's second-biggest expense after labor, thanks to an aggressive hedging program that locked in fuel costs before the big price increases.
But United also suffered from several operational headaches in the quarter that gave it the poorest on-time record and most flight cancellations among the big airlines. Executives blamed unusually poor weather, the air-traffic control system and the refusal of many pilots, who are angry about the slow pace of contract negotiations, to fly overtime.
Rono Dutta, UAL's president, said that the pilot action cost the company $50 million during the quarter. United has cut thousands of flights and is adding more time into its schedule to try to reduce cancellations and delays. Mr. Dutta said that revenue would continue to be strong in the current quarter but that the reduction in capacity along with higher fuel and wage costs would result in earnings between $2.60 and $3.20 a share, lower than analysts were expecting.
The news caused shares of UAL to plunge $5.9375, or 10 percent, to $53.3125 on the New York Stock Exchange.
AMR reported a 32 percent surge in profit, excluding extraordinary items, to $285 million, or $1.75 a share, compared with $216 million, or $1.36 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 10.4 percent, to $5 billion from $4.5 billion last year. Analysts had expected AMR to earn $1.57, according to First Call.
American also benefited from hedging its fuel costs, saving $105 million during the quarter, Mr. Horton said. He said that the airline also gained $10 million to $15 million in additional revenue by attracting passengers displaced by cancellations at United, its main competitor.
In addition, American faced an easier comparison with results in the quarter a year earlier, when its bookings were weakened by the aftermath of a pilot sickout that crippled its operations. And a recent decision to remove seats from most of its airplanes to give passengers more legroom helped increase its average fare.
Revenue at US Airways rose 6.4 percent during the quarter, to $2.43 billion from $2.28 billion in 1999. But profit fell to $80 million, or $1.17 a share, compared with $136 million, or $1.83 a share, in 1999, excluding one-time gains. Analysts were expecting US Airways to earn $1.36 a share.
Passenger demand was strong at the airline, which agreed in May to be acquired by UAL for $4.3 billion, but it was hurt more by the rise in the cost of fuel than were United and American. US Airways said that its fuel costs rose nearly 63 percent during the quarter, or $102 million, whereas American said its fuel costs rose only 37 percent. In addition, US Airways lost some lucrative business passengers who shied away from the airline because of the threat of a strike by its flight attendants.
Rakesh Gangwal, the chief executive of US Airways, told analysts that the airline was focusing on winning back business travelers. But he predicted a further decline in unit revenue in the third quarter and another hit from higher fuel costs.
T.W.A. also had record traffic during the quarter. Revenue rose 10.3 percent, to $954.9 million from $866 million. But the struggling airline, which does not aggressively hedge its fuel costs, was still in the red. T.W.A. said that it lost $4.2 million, or 8 cents a share, compared with a loss of $5.3 million, or 17 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Still, analysts had expected the airline to lose 33 cents a share during the quarter.
T.W.A.'s last profitable quarter was two years ago.

HEADLINE: Higher Fuel-Product Prices Barely Affecting Consumers

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
Facing higher fuel prices, motorists are guzzling less gas -- but only slightly less.
The American Petroleum Institute said today that deliveries of gasoline in the first half of 2000 were down about 0.7 percent, ending a long period of growth. Deliveries in 1999 ran 2 percent ahead of 1998, which itself was 3 percent ahead of 1997. The industry group reported a similar drop in use of all oil-based fuels, which went down 0.8 percent, the first decline in five years of economic expansion. 
 The data also showed that supplies of home heating oil were far lower than usual, but Bill Richardson, the energy secretary, said today that he was making progress toward establishing a reserve of heating oil in the Northeast.
The data from the industry group showed that despite the fact that prices have risen nationally by 60 or 70 cents a gallon, and more in the Midwest, the effect on consumption was small.
And for some consumers, it is accomplished with minor lifestyle adjustments.
Dennis Virag, an automotive consultant who commutes 40 miles each way from his home in Toledo, Ohio, to his job in Ann Arbor, Mich., said in an interview that he now sets the cruise control on his Mercury Villager minivan to 72 miles an hour instead of 80.
He figures that the change costs him about five minutes and saves him about 5 percent of the four gallons he needs for his daily commute.
Other drivers must be slowing down, too, he said: "I was keeping up with traffic in the past, and I'm keeping up with traffic now."
Experts expect that few people will make radical changes. At the National Automobile Dealers Association, Paul C. Taylor, the chief economist, said that a family planning a 2,500-mile driving vacation in a midsize S.U.V., like a Chevy Blazer or a Ford Explorer, rated at 20 miles a gallon, would use 125 gallons. If the price of fuel this summer is 50 cents higher than last, that would cost an extra $62.50. "That's about two stops at a fast-food restaurant for a family of five," he said.
At the American Automobile Association, Geoff Sundstrom, a spokesman, said, "We've predicted record summer travel." And as for everyday travel, he said, "For most people, driving is not an optional activity."
"This notion that people are just sort of driving aimlessly around in their car, and when gas prices go up they can stop driving, is quite mistaken," Mr. Sundstrom said.
The drop of 0.7 percent since last year does imply a significant choice for conservation, though, because the number of vehicles is rising by about 4 million a year, reaching 209.5 million motor vehicles at the end of last year.
In contrast to gasoline, deliveries of residual oil, used by industries that can often substitute natural gas if that is cheaper, declined by 17 percent in the first half of the year, the petroleum association said. Deliveries of jet fuel rose, pushed up by robust air traffic. And domestic oil production continued to decline, hitting a 50-year low, despite a tripling of crude oil prices, to the range of $34 a barrel recently, compared with around $10 last year.
The industry group also said that heating oil inventories were sharply lower now than at this time last year, but they said that the significance of this to prices this winter was not clear, because more than 90 percent of heating oil used in a winter comes from production during the winter.
About 40 industry executives met with the Mr. Richardson this afternoon to discuss heating oil and the two-million-barrel reserve that President Clinton ordered the agency to create earlier this month.
Red Cavaney, the president of the petroleum institute, said that the reserve might make no difference in total supplies, because its existence would dissuade private businesses from stockpiling fuel.
"They see no upside, recognizing that the government is probably going to sell it off at some point," he said.
But Mr. Richardson said, "I believe I've convinced them that it's for emergency purposes only, and that we have no intentions of using it to manipulate prices or discourage them from increasing their inventories."
"The government doesn't want to be in the heating oil business." he continued, "all we want to be able to do is respond in the event of a shortage or a severe price spike."
Energy department officials said that the reserve was too small to discourage private inventory-building. They said there was lots of surplus tank space in the Northeast, which they would lease for heating oil storage, bartering for the lease, and for the heating oil itself, with crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve on the gulf coast.

HEADLINE: Citigroup and Chase Post Earnings That Exceed Expectations

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Citigroup, the biggest financial services company, earned more than $3 billion for the second consecutive quarter, despite a sharp drop in the performance of its Salomon Smith Barney securities unit. At Chase Manhattan Bank, the No. 3 United States bank, the drag on earnings came from its investments in private companies.
Both companies reported second-quarter earnings yesterday that were higher than a year earlier and exceeded analysts expectations. Citigroup shares rose $1.3125, to $68, on the news, while Chase shares slipped 25 cents, to $50.6875. 
 Strong growth in its consumer businesses around the world helped Citigroup increase its net income 23 percent, to $3.005 billion, or 87 cents a diluted share, from $2.45 billion, or 70 cents a diluted share, in the second quarter of 1999. That profit was down significantly from Citigroup's first-quarter profit of $3.6 billion, which was the biggest quarterly profit any company has reported, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Analysts expected earnings of 83 cents a share.
Earnings at the Salomon unit were down 33 percent from the first quarter and up just 5 percent from the period a year earlier, at $641 million. Salomon was hurt by the downturn in stock market activity and a slowing in bond trading, caused in part by rising interest rates.
Sanford I. Weill, Citigroup's chairman and chief executive, noted that the Smith Barney brokerage unit took in $24 billion in new money from United States customers in the quarter, surpassing the $11 billion its bigger rival, Merrill Lynch, reported.
"Looking at what some of our competitors did, relative to the size of our sales force, we did excellent," Mr. Weill said.
Unlike Merrill, which said this week that it would cut 1,800 jobs in its brokerage unit, Smith Barney has no layoffs planned, Mr. Weill said. "We run a very efficient retail brokerage business," he said. "We like to run it on a steady-as-you-go basis."
Mr. Weill said that rising interest rates had not posed a problem for Citigroup's consumer lending businesses. "We continue to see in the U.S. very strong credit quality trends with delinquencies continuing to decline," he said. "Writeoffs are at the lowest level in five years."
Citigroup said it would split its shares on a 4-for-3 basis next month.
A few blocks away at Chase headquarters, executives sounded upbeat even though Chase's earnings fell 22 percent, to $1.09 billion, or 85 cents a diluted share, from $1.39 billion, or $1.06 a diluted share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, Chase earned 95 cents a share, beating analysts estimates by 12 cents.
Chase officials attributed most of the decline in profit to the falling value of its private equity investments. Chase had private equity gains of just $298 million, down from $513 million a year earlier.
"That's a real reassuring number that showed that even in a tough, dislocated market, they can protect their reported earnings," said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
Investors are more concerned about the bank's expenses rising faster than its revenue, Mr. Kraushaar said. Chase has spent a lot of money hiring people and buying companies to add heft to its investment banking business and, he said, the "question for investors is can they stay on top of the investments and turn it around quickly?"
Marc Shapiro, Chase's vice chairman, tried to reassure investors that spending would not outpace revenue growth for long.
"We don't have what I call a field-of-dreams strategy that says we will spend all of this money and hope that one day the revenues will come in and pay for it," he said. "We intend to pay for things on a pay-as-you-go basis."

HEADLINE: Clinton the Broker Puts the Other Summit on Hold

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
Bill Clinton today was a president caught between two summit meetings, one in Camp David dealing with the oldest and thorniest problems in diplomacy, the other in Japan approaching the newest and vaguest issues of global inequity.
The meeting on the Maryland mountaintop was grueling, but Mr. Clinton was not going to leave while there was even a glimmer of hope that he might achieve a legacy-enhancing breakthrough in the pursuit of Middle East peace. 
 And for him, the Group of 8 meeting in Okinawa, in southern Japan, has less to recommend it -- save for the fact that he would be the star and the issues, from bringing the Internet to developing nations to funding a global battle against AIDS, resonate with the themes he has tried to place on the international agenda.
Mr. Clinton's mind this week has clearly been on the older issues, not the newer ones he came to office promising to tackle. In fact, he has yet to be briefed on his role at the meeting beginning on Friday of leaders of seven leading industrialized nations, and with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers preceded Mr. Clinton to Japan to warm the president's seat and reassure the Japanese that he would be there eventually. Traveling with him was the chief person organizing the American part in the talks, Lael Brainard, who was to have briefed Mr. Clinton on Air Force One.
"So we'll wing it," one White House official said.
Meetings of the group are notoriously disjointed, but the agenda for this session is particularly scattered.
Leaders will discuss the "digital divide" between those nations taking advantage of the information revolution and those that are not; coordinated approaches to the spread of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria; and even a United States-backed proposal to create an international school lunch program.
"You can't say the issues are unimportant, but they are a laundry list and some of them don't meet my criteria for being the top global concerns," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics.
Two years ago, for example, the leaders promised to focus on remaking the international financial system until safeguards were in place to prevent another economic crisis like the one that struck Asia in 1997 from radiating around world markets.
But a recovery shortened the group's collective memory, and while modest progress has been made, one would have to dig far into the fine print to find that discussion on this year's agenda.
On the national security front, the meeting will grapple with more standard issues -- terrorism, the spread of nuclear weapons, turmoil in Africa, Chechnya and the Balkans. But those conversations tend to be as scripted as the summit communique, a reason that Mr. Clinton appeared far less eager to meet his fellow leaders than to play out his role as potential Middle East peacemaker.
That forced Mr. Clinton to postpone a meeting with the Japanese prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, whose days are considered numbered because of his party's poor showing in an election last month.
But Mr. Clinton also skipped one of the unique aspects of this meeting -- a gathering of the leaders of developing countries such as Algeria, Nigeria, South Africa and Thailand, all of whom have long complained that they are excluded from the elite club of large economies. Mr. Summers will see them instead, but the smaller nations are bound to view Mr. Clinton's no-show as a snub.
Mr. Clinton plans to hold meetings with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and a session with Mr. Putin that is expected to address Mr. Clinton's looming decision on a national missile defense system.
"The president, I'm sure, will want to take advantage of having the leaders there to discuss the issues that are facing him," said James Steinberg, deputy national security adviser. "I think that he will indicate that he is going to take into account the concerns that have been addressed," particularly "four basic variables of cost, threat, technical feasibility and the impact on overall security."
Mr. Clinton's late arrival shows how much has changed since his first step into global diplomacy, also in Japan. It was July 1993, and world leaders took turns beating up on Mr. Clinton for the size of the American budget deficit and Washington's failure to stabilize the world economy.
This time, America's economy is supreme and Mr. Clinton arrives as the indispensable peacemaker.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japan and U.S. Reach Trade Pact on Telecommunications

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 19

 BODY:
With its ownership of nearly all telephone lines that go into Japan's homes and businesses, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone has long enjoyed a virtual monopoly in this country. Today, however, a United States-Japanese trade agreement was reached that would likely make telecommunications services in Japan far more affordable, competitive and diverse.
The agreement came after nine days of intense negotiations and averted a major trade battle between Japan and the United States on the eve of a global summit the Japanese are hosting. American trade officials, who have been pressing loudly for increased access to the $140 billion Japanese market, called it a huge victory. 
 Its central feature is cuts in the fees that N.T.T. charges other telecommunications companies to use its domestic network, which covers 98 percent of the lines to all customers.
For other telephone companies, the agreement will lower the costs of linking up with N.T.T. by an average of 35 percent in two years and by at least 40 percent over three years, said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative.
Those charges have been consuming roughly 40 percent of the revenue of N.T.T.'s competitors stifling competition to provide telecommunications services in the world's second-largest economy.
"Japan has been placing a tax on the information age by the way it regulates N.T.T.," said Richard W. Fisher, Mrs. Barshefsky's deputy, in an interview. "It's therefore a tax on competition, and that tax is going to come down substantially now."
While Japanese officials said the agreement was only modestly different from a proposal they had made in January, their American counterparts noted that it provided for significantly deeper cuts than the 17 percent reduction Japan had offered previously. The agreement also accelerates the timing of the cuts so they mostly happen over two years instead of Japan's original offer of five years.
Perhaps more important, Japan agreed to reconsider its methods of setting the fees paid by N.T.T.'s competitors to use its network, which should have a more widespread effect on reducing fees and enhancing competition in 2002 and thereafter. But perhaps the most significant element of the deal is how it came together. That process ruptured longstanding relationships between regulators and politicians and N.T.T., and those rifts may lead to sweeping changes in regulatory structure here and in the structure of N.T.T. itself.
"By how many percent interconnection fees are cut and whether it takes place over two or three years is not really very important," said Harumasa Sato, a professor at Konan University in Kobe and a telecommunications policy expert. "The important thing is that it may lead to fundamental reform of regulation that will create fair competition in this market."
The broader scope of the agreement came about in part because of the way the United States trade representative's office fought for it. United States negotiators moved the debate out of the confines of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, which regulates telecommunications, and into a broader public view.
Thus, while past United States-Japanese trade fights over issues like film distribution, car parts and flat glass had failed to capture the imagination of ordinary citizens, the public took a major interest in this fight, and Japanese politicians noticed.
Mr. Fisher embarked on a calculated campaign to make the issue relevant to consumers in Japan, doing numerous interviews with the Japanese media, using easily understood examples of why high connection fees hurt Japan's prosperity.
He repeatedly bemoaned that only 10 percent of Japanese elementary and middle school students could connect to the Internet because charges were so high. He asked why his daughter paid less than $9 a month for Internet service in the United States while her Japanese friend in Tokyo paid eight times that amount.
"Why should a Japanese girl be at such a disadvantage to an American girl?" he asked over and over again.
He made his case, apparently, because, with the exception of only one newspaper known for its strong conservative editorial view, Japan's major dailies all supported sharp reductions in connection fees.
Japanese industry also spoke out. The business federation known as Keidanren, which represents Japan's giant, blue-chip organizations, argued for lower connection fees, and Hiroshi Mikitani, the founder and president of Japan's biggest e-commerce site, Rakuten Ichiba, commissioned a study about the impact of the fees on Japan's ability to harness the information technology revolution, which he then personally used to advocate lower charges.
N.T.T.'s Japanese competitors weighed in on the side of lower rates, as did European and American companies attempting to break into the market. Even some of the companies under the N.T.T. umbrella, which also pay fees for connecting with the lines owned by the regional telephone companies that are their cousins, complained.
The concerted effort worked, and around the beginning of the year, influential politicians began to question the postal ministry's arguments for only modest reductions in the connection fees.
Mindful that its position on fees was now politically unacceptable, N.T.T. officials offered to accede to United States demands in exchange for pledges from sympathetic politicians that they would work to abolish the N.T.T. Law, which restricts the company from entering other types of businesses.
That proposal appealed to Hiromu Nonaka, who is perhaps the most powerful politician in Japan and the secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Among his many roles, Mr. Nonaka serves as the leader of a large group of politicians with strong ties to the postal ministry and to N.T.T.
And in the end, Mr. Fisher said, it was Mr. Nonaka who struck the deal on connection fees that emerged today. Mr. Fisher said the breakthrough came when Mr. Nonaka invited him and other United States officials, including Ambassador Thomas Foley, to a Tuesday morning meeting. It began with a 20-minute monologue by Mr. Nonaka on the role that telecommunications plays in a modern economy.
"He gave me a very erudite and extremely thorough discussion about how Japan needed to come into the I.T. age and needed to restructure N.T.T. to do that," Mr. Fisher said.
One hour after the meeting ended, Mr. Fisher said, the postal ministry called the embassy and asked for a meeting that resulted in the agreement.

HEADLINE: School-Managing Company and Museum Plan Harlem Headquarters

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Edison Schools, the country's largest school management company, and the Museum for African Art are negotiating with city officials to build a combined corporate headquarters, school and museum at the northeast corner of Central Park, at Fifth Avenue and 110th Street.
The project would transform one of the few vacant parcels of land around Central Park. It calls for the construction of the multiuse building on the block of Fifth Avenue that stretches from 109th to 110th streets. 
 Edison, which has contracts to operate 108 schools in 21 states, would move its headquarters there from Midtown Manhattan as well as open a public or charter school that it would manage; the museum would relocate from SoHo. Edison disclosed the proposal in documents filed with federal securities officials earlier this month.
If the plan is successful, the development would extend Fifth Avenue's museum district further into Spanish Harlem, putting a unique cultural stamp on one of the four corners of Central Park, a site whose views of Harlem Meer make it one of the park's most beautiful and natural locations.
The project would contribute economic muscle to a neighborhood that generally has not benefited from the boom enjoyed by the city and most of the country and make Edison, whose annual revenues are $225 million, one of the largest corporations to locate in a relatively poor section of the city.
Negotiations by the company and the museum to buy four city-owned parcels of land at the site are in the early stages, city officials said, and the project faces several obstacles, including obtaining changes in zoning regulations for the site. The property is currently zoned for residential and community facility use, which would permit the development of the museum and the school but not the office space.
But, officials at City Hall and city agencies involved in the negotiations say the project has significant merits.
"This is a creative project that offers a lot for the neighborhood and the city," said Anthony P. Coles, the deputy mayor for planning, education and cultural affairs. "We're interested in it but no final decision has been made."
For Edison, the project fills several long-term goals, said Benno C. Schmidt Jr., the company's chairman, as Edison has long wanted to have a school as part of its headquarters, giving its curriculum development experts and instructional training staff a laboratory in which to test ideas and allowing visitors a chance to see the company in action, he said.
Currently, Edison operates no schools in New York City. Its first school in New York State, a charter school in Rochester, is scheduled to open in the fall. The school at the proposed development would not open until 2003 at the earliest, Mr. Schmidt said.
In addition, Mr. Schmidt said, the company has wanted to put its headquarters in a diverse, urban neighborhood like that in which many of its schools operate, and to create a partnership with a cultural institution that is relevant to those communities. Edison's agreement with the museum states its intent not only to raise money for the development, but also to help the museum raise $10 million for its endowment.
"We're enthusiastic about the project, but also realistic about the complexity of working through the necessary approvals," Mr. Schmidt said. "That particular location stands as a crossroads between the Latino and the African-American communities, which made it a perfect location in terms of representing the communities that are our partners around the country."
That crossroads is best symbolized by the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 110th Street, the location of Duke Ellington Circle, formerly known as Frawley Circle, where a statue of Duke Ellington towers over a public plaza. Later this summer, the City Council is expected to approve a resolution to rename West 110th Street after Tito Puente, the late band leader and percussionist known as El Rey, who grew up on the street.
But that intersection of black and Latino cultures also symbolizes some of the controversy that is likely to swirl around the project. Philip Reed, the City Council member whose East Harlem district includes the site, said that he was impressed that a company like Edison recognizes the neighborhood as an attractive place to build its corporate headquarters. But he questioned whether the Museum for African Art is the appropriate cultural institution for a community that is predominantly Hispanic.
While the Museo del Barrio is a few blocks south of the site, on Fifth Avenue at 105th Street, he said, "there really hasn't been the proper acknowledgment of the Latino culture of the neighborhood" in its cultural institutions and public spaces.
But State Senator Olga A. Mendez, whose district encompasses the site, embraced the project.
"This would be the kind of museum which people, whether they are African-American or not, could enjoy," she said.
A museum spokeswoman said it, like Edison, wanted to be located in a community with a significant population of African-Americans, and she noted that many immigrants to the United States from the Caribbean have roots in Africa.
Edison and the museum are negotiating with the Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit development company that works closely with the city, for the purchase of the city-owned land.
Situated on part of that land is the Nueva Esperanza Garden, a community garden sponsored by the city Parks and Recreation Department's Green Thumb project. Last spring, state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer obtained a state court injunction prohibiting the city from selling or physically altering any of the remaining community gardens.
Edison has already signed a contract to buy the recently cleared portion of the property at 109th Street and Fifth Avenue for $10 million from Castle Senior Living, a company in Teaneck, N.J.
Preliminary plans for the proposed project, which city officials say would create 400 permanent jobs and about 480 construction jobs, call for a building of up to 249,000 square feet, housing the museum, an elementary school and the offices of Edison and non-profit community organizations.

HEADLINE: William Corson, 74, Marine And Critic of U.S. on Vietnam

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
William R. Corson, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel who was an expert on revolution and counterinsurgency and was nearly court-martialed for writing a book venting his disillusionment over the Vietnam War, died on Monday at a hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 74 and lived in Potomac, Md.
The cause was emphysema and lung cancer, his wife, Judith, said. 
 In early 1968, Colonel Corson was just back from a tour in Vietnam and working in the Defense Department, looking forward to retirement. He spent much of his spare time hunched over a typewriter at home, working on a book he would call "The Betrayal."
Colonel Corson had never believed in the "domino theory" that one Communist takeover would lead to another, and he had long thought that the struggle in Vietnam was more about nationalism than Communism, his wife said.
The publisher, W. W. Norton, planned to publish the book the day after Colonel Corson's retirement became effective. But the colonel ran afoul of a regulation requiring officers to submit statements on public policy for official review before making them public.
Unconvinced by his argument that the regulation should not apply to him because he would be a civilian when the book came out and that his manuscript violated no national-security laws in any event, the Marine Corps delayed his retirement and moved to convene a court-martial. As the debate grew heated, the corps dropped the court-martial, and Colonel Corson retired a month later than planned.
The book condemned the assumptions that had led the United States into a quagmire. "The politicians saw in Vietnam, or so they thought at the time, a chance to pull off a cheap victory against the Communists," he wrote. "When their initial judgments about Vietnam were found to be in error, there was no way to confess their error, without risking defeat at the polls."
Colonel Corson argued that the American-backed Saigon government was inept and corrupt and out of touch with the people.
William Corson became familiar with Southeast Asia as a young officer. After service in the Korean War, he learned Chinese at the Naval Intelligence School in Washington. In the late 1950's he was stationed in Hong Kong, and in 1962 he was assigned to the office of the secretary of defense. From 1964 to 1966, he taught a course on communism and revolution at the Naval Academy.
In 1966, he was sent to command a tank battalion in Vietnam, a country he had been studying since it was a French colony. In 1967, he was named head of the Combined Action Program, in which marines aided South Vietnamese militia in villages. Colonel Corson's superiors praised his ability to win the confidence of the Vietnamese. Had he decided to remain in the corps instead of retiring, he seemed destined to wear the eagle of a full colonel, perhaps even the star of a brigadier general.
His career path had been unusual. Born in Chicago, he spent much of his early childhood with his grandparents after his mother and father divorced. As a teenager, he preferred wandering and odd jobs over the classroom. Then he got a job at The Chicago Daily News, whose publisher saw something in him.
The publisher was Frank Knox, later to become secretary of the Navy, who was on the board of the University of Chicago and helped the young man get a scholarship to the university.
William Corson enlisted in the Marine Corps in World War II and fought in Guam and Bougainville in the Pacific, rising to sergeant. After the war, he returned to the University of Chicago and earned a degree in mathematics. He received a master's degree in economics at the University of Miami and re-entered the Marines in 1949 as an officer. Years later, he got a doctorate in economics from American University in Washington.
After leaving the Marines, he taught history at Howard University in Washington for a year and wrote several books on national-security issues. He also was compliance director of the Price Commission, the agency created in 1971 as part of President Richard M. Nixon's efforts to stabilize the economy and hold down inflation.
In addition to his wife, Colonel Corson is survived by their three sons, Adam, Zachary and Andrew, all of Potomac; two sons from an earlier marriage, Christopher, of Silver Spring, Md., and David, of Greenville, S.C.; and five grandchildren.
Despite the unpleasantness surrounding his retirement, Colonel Corson remained a marine at heart, up to a point. "I could kill you in eight seconds," he boasted to an interviewer a year after leaving the corps. "But I don't have the instinct for that sort of thing anymore."

HEADLINE: William Whyte, a Gang Sociologist, Dies at 86

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
William F. Whyte, a sociologist with a passion for reform who wrote "Street Corner Society," the trailblazing 1943 study of Italian-American gangs in the North End of Boston, died last Sunday in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 86.
Mr. Whyte was a professor emeritus of sociology at Cornell University. In all, he wrote 20 influential books. But his first, "Street Corner Society," was the keystone of his career. Translated into Chinese, Japanese, German, French, Italian and Spanish, the book sold more than 270,000 copies, making it one of the best-selling sociology books in history. 
 "Street Corner Society" and the unusual methods that Mr. Whyte used to research it established his reputation as an innovative sociologist. He spent more than a year living with an Italian-American family in the North End slums and hanging out with gang members, watching them gamble, fight and flirt. He also guided them to organize demonstrations to get City Hall to pump more money into the neighborhood.
Mr. Whyte championed this methodology, which he called "participatory action research," asserting that he could maintain his objectivity while sometimes nudging his subject in the direction of reform. But many academics questioned his methods, calling for more passive, more objective observation.
"His practice of social science was really aimed at social reform and social change," said Davydd Greenwood, a professor of anthropology at Cornell. "He never accepted the notion that social science should be a purely academic profession."
In 1948, Mr. Whyte was hired as one of the first professors at the new Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. Over the next three decades, until he took emeritus status in 1979, Mr. Whyte was one of the school's most influential faculty members, an outspoken liberal who frequently called for empowering the disenfranchised and narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor.
With his unusual methods, highly personalized writing and political tilt, Mr. Whyte had a major influence on sociologists, anthropologists, social psychologists and professors of industrial relations. He wrote a widely followed how-to text for social science researchers, called "Learning from the Field: A Guide from Experience."
His other books focused on areas as diverse as restaurants in Chicago, oil fields in Oklahoma, peasant villages in Peru and worker-owned cooperatives in Mondragon, a town in the Basque country of Spain. Mr. Whyte usually analyzed the connections between social organization and work performance, often collaborating with economists and political scientists.
William Foote Whyte was born on June 27, 1914, in Springfield, Mass., the only child of John Whyte, a professor of German, and Caroline Van Sickle. He grew up in the Bronx, Caldwell, N.J., and Bronxville, N.Y. He showed an early proclivity for research while still in high school in Bronxville, reporting for The Bronxville Press and writing numerous columns on the town's elementary schools.
After spending a year in Germany with his father, he enrolled in Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, where he majored in economics, graduating in 1936.
Later that year he became a junior fellow at Harvard University, enabling him to take any course he wanted there. In his autobiography, "Participant Observer," he expressed ambivalence about Harvard's academic ambience.
"The emphasis on science and scholarship did not offend me, but I was struck by the absence of any reference to an obligation to make our learning useful to society," he wrote. "I said nothing, but I continued to wrestle over a way to reconcile my research interests with my social welfare concerns."
In February 1937, while at Harvard, Mr. Whyte began research on the book that would make his name, renting a third-story room in the North End, then one of the city's worst slums. He stayed with the Orlandi family, who ran the Capri Restaurant, and he grew friendly with one gang member who became his entree into gang society. By going to pool halls and gambling clubs, Mr. Whyte learned about the skills needed to become a gang leader.
He persuaded Harvard to give a $100 a grant to a high school dropout and gang member, Angelo (Ralph) Orlandella, who was his research assistant.
In his autobiography, Mr. Whyte tells of taking a North End girl to a church dance one evening and then accompanying her home, a move that in neighborhood tradition meant he intended to marry her. He vowed never to do that again.
In May 1938 he married a longtime acquaintance, Kathleen King, and they soon moved into a renovated apartment in the North End, where he completed research for "Street Corner Society." His wife, a commercial artist, edited several of his books and was co-author of his book on worker cooperatives in Spain.
"Street Corner Society" served as Mr. Whyte's thesis at the University of Chicago, where he obtained a doctorate in sociology. The book, first published by the University of Chicago Press, was little noticed at first, but sales of the second edition, published in 1950, took off, partly because it contained many frank details previously left out.
In 1942, Mr. Whyte began teaching sociology at the University of Oklahoma, and the next year Harvard offered him a position teaching Army veterans and doing further research on Italian-American community life. But that job never materialized because he contracted polio in 1943.
He, his wife and two young children spent a year at the Warm Springs Foundation in Georgia, where he learned to walk with a cane. He spent many years in leg braces and later did his field work with the aid of crutches or a cane.
From 1944 to 1948 he taught at the University of Chicago, and then moved to Ithaca, N.Y., to spend the rest of his teaching career at Cornell.
Besides his wife, Mr. Whyte is survived by two daughters, Joyce Wiza of Manchester, N.H., and Lucy Whyte Ferguson of Taos, N.M.; two sons, Martin King Whyte of Silver Spring, Md., and John Whyte of Philadelphia; 12 grandchildren; and 8 great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: In America;
The Crime Fighter

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
An important but frequently overlooked factor in the nationwide decline in crime over the past few years has been the corresponding decline in the unemployment rate.
Aggressive policing and long prison sentences get most of the attention. Credit is also belatedly being given to the often heroic and usually unheralded crime-fighting efforts of local groups and individuals in poor neighborhoods, and to the many young people who have stepped back from the lure of drugs and antisocial behavior. 
 Now we have a study by a pair of Washington economists that appears to confirm a point that has seemed like common sense to a lot of people, but that politicians have never pushed vehemently enough: A job is one of the most effective weapons in the nation's crime-fighting arsenal.
It's not just common sense but longstanding economic theory that suggests a link between lower rates of joblessness and lower rates of crime. The new study by the Economic Policy Institute looked at crime rates and employment statistics in several regions of the country between 1989 and 1998 and found evidence to support that theory.
According to the study, "An examination of unemployment, wages, and crime rates by region shows unemployment and crime rates falling together, and rising wages and crime rates moving apart."
Looking specifically at unemployment rates for young men, the study found that since 1992 the jobless rate had fallen by at least four percentage points in each region, with the largest decline in the Northeast, which is also where crime rates fell most quickly.
The authors of the study, Jared Bernstein and Ellen Houston, wrote:
"Labor market conditions are not, of course, the only or even necessarily the prime determinant of crime rates. Over the 1990's, the U.S. sharply increased its expenditures on prisons, incarcerating a growing number of the population and passing 'get tough' crime prevention legislation. These interventions have undoubtedly played a large role in lowering crime rates. But the link between crime and labor market opportunity is too often ignored in the current policy debate over crime, which focuses almost solely on longer sentences and prison expansion."
The people at highest risk for engaging in crime are young men, primarily from ethnic minority groups, "with low levels of education and a weak attachment to the labor market," the study said.
Despite the overwhelming employment obstacles faced by individuals in that group, many have found work as a result of the current long-running economic expansion.
Ms. Houston, in an interview, said, "As unemployment fell below the level of 5 percent over the last couple of years, you can see that real economic opportunities are being expanded for those who are probably the most disadvantaged low-wage workers in society."
There is a hunger among Americans everywhere, including the poor and the otherwise disadvantaged, for meaningful employment. The benefits to be gained from putting people to work are endless, and one of those benefits is a safer society.
That being the case, Ms. Houston and Mr. Bernstein felt it was important when looking at the problem of crime to pay more attention to labor market policies and the value of employment.
They say in the study, "The Federal Reserve can play a decisive role here by focusing on its full-employment mandate with at least the same fervor it devotes to interest rates."
And there are other issues -- for example, the importance in a time of unprecedented prosperity of approving a boost in the minimum wage; and the need for no-nonsense education and training for low-wage workers and for ex-criminal offenders, many of whom are released into communities across America each and every day.
When you consider the factors crucial to building a safe and secure society, employment is right there at the top. The idea is to get as many people working for a decent wage as is humanly possible, rather than searching for excuses as to why this person can't be paid a living wage and that person can't be allowed to work at all.

HEADLINE: On the Avenue, Off the Avenue: Saks Is Getting an Annulment

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
The answer to the question of whether a country peasant can marry a Park Avenue swell and live happily ever after appears to be no.
Saks Inc., previously called Proffitt's, with headquarters in Birmingham, Ala., announced late yesterday that less than two years after it acquired Saks Fifth Avenue and renamed itself, its board had approved a plan to split again into two separate public companies. 
 The spun-off entity will be called Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises Inc. and will include the luxury-oriented stores of Saks Fifth Avenue; the Saks Direct, which includes catalog and Internet operations; and Saks Off Fifth, its upscale outlet business. Saks Inc. will retain the rest of the department store business -- including such regional stores as Proffitt's, McRae's and Parisan -- and will eventually be renamed. Shareholders are expected to receive one share of Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises common stock for every three shares of Saks Inc. stock that they own.
Since the Proffitt's-Saks merger in September 1998, skepticism had abounded about the logic of combining mid-market department stores, which rely on staple brands like Liz Claiborne and Levi's, and the tony retailer, best known for offerings like Prada and Gucci.
Many stock analysts and consultants argued that the businesses were too dissimilar to produce real compatibility benefits, and they accused the company chairman, R. Brad Martin, of being blinded by his desire to own a glitzier property -- with opportunities to hobnob with socialites and celebrity designers.
"It was a mistake to buy Saks Fifth Avenue," said Robert F. Buchanan, a retail analyst at A. G. Edwards, "and it makes sense to undo the mistake."
Designers who counted on Saks stores to showcase their newest creations also worried that the corporation was running the upscale emporium like a mundane department store -- starving it of necessary resources for inventory, remodeling and staff training to hit its financial targets.
"This merger went off because there was a lack of understanding on what it takes to run a first-class luxury operation," said Arnold Aronson, a former Saks Fifth Avenue chief executive. "It is better that the realization came late rather than never."
The spinoff is clearly a bid to improve the Saks Inc. sagging stock price. Before acquiring Saks Holdings and changing its name, Proffitt's was an industry leader in buying businesses at a rapid pace and making them profitable. But soon after the purchase, it became apparent that the former Proffitt's had hit a block in integrating the disparate parts of its empire.
Last summer, the company said it would miss earnings estimates for the fiscal year 1999 by a mile, in part because of disappointing growth in its credit business and because of lower-than-anticipated revenue growth at Mercantile Stores, a chain of bargain-priced apparel stores that it bought from Dillard's Inc. in 1998. Then, this spring, sales were lower than anticipated in the department stores, and the company yesterday forecast an operating loss for its fiscal second quarter, ending July 29.
Saks Inc. had already missed earnings estimates for three quarters in a row, and its stock price has crumbled by more than 50 percent since the merger was announced. The stock gained 68.75 cents, to $12.50, yesterday ahead of the spinoff announcement, which came after the financial markets had closed.
The company stopped just short of saying that the purchase had been a mistake but acknowledged that winning Wall Street's favor was a motivating factor in the plan announced yesterday. "I will let others critique whether I lost my focus," Mr. Martin said. But this deal was necessary, he said, "to get the appropriate focus on each business as well as the appropriate capital structure."
Of the two new companies, Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises appears to be in stronger shape, according to stock analysts. Because of a booming economy, the luxury market has been soaring, and sales at Saks Fifth Avenue have been growing at roughly 10 percent a year. The prospects for Saks Inc. and the midlevel department stores in general seem grimmer, reflected yesterday in the news that Mr. Martin will eventually relinquish his position with the department store group to remain on as chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises, although he will continue to own a stake in both.
Philip Miller will continue as chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue, and Christina Johnson will remain president and chief executive of the Saks Fifth Avenue stores division. The department store group will start a search for a new chief executive.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Plan Would Curtail City Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
Acknowledging that the city's projected deficits were "too large," Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that he would severely curtail tax cuts he planned for this year, impose a partial hiring freeze and reduce some agency spending.
The most immediate impact of Mr. Giuliani's proposals would be the delay of a planned reduction in the city's personal income tax, originally scheduled to go into effect retroactively to July 1. That was to save city taxpayers an average of about $99 a year, city officials said. Now, the tax cut would most likely be put off until January, city officials said, and even at that point, it might be smaller than planned. 
 The announcement came after a growing chorus of criticism by budget monitors of Mr. Giuliani's spending plan for the just-started 2001 fiscal year, which anticipates unusually large budget deficits of about $3 billion a year starting in 2002 and extending through 2004 -- after the mayor leaves office.
The city, at least three years into an economic boom, remains in good financial condition, the mayor told Gov. George E. Pataki and the other members of the New York State Financial Control Board yesterday at its annual meeting on city budget affairs. The city has had record surpluses in the last three years that have wiped out projected deficits, and no one anticipates that the city will actually wind up, in the near future, in the red.
But Mr. Giuliani -- not wanting to leave the city in the same financial bind he inherited when he arrived in office in 1994 -- said he felt compelled to take steps to reduce the projected deficits, which he attributed in part to actions by the state to increase pension benefits for government employees.
"Whatever gaps that you see, we could make disappear by playing a game," the mayor said, noting that he could merely increase revenue estimates -- reducing the projected deficits -- for future years. "But it would be a dangerous game, but it is a game the city has played in the past."
Instead, the mayor wants to lower those deficit numbers by eliminating about 75 percent of the about $410 million worth of tax cuts proposed for this fiscal year, City Council finance staff estimated yesterday.
Aside from postponing any reduction in the personal income tax, the city also may scale back or delay a reduction in the tax paid by businesses that rent office or other commercial space, city officials said. Details of the changes in the tax cut plan must be negotiated with the City Council and approved by it.
The City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, who in recent months has gone to great lengths to avoid budget squabbles with the mayor, made clear late yesterday that he disagreed with Mr. Giuliani and wanted the tax cuts the mayor and Council agreed to last month adopted as originally planned.
"I just spoke with the mayor and told him I was perplexed by the reversal on tax relief," Mr. Vallone said in a statement. "New Yorkers deserve these tax cuts now."
Additionally, Mr. Giuliani announced yesterday that he had told city department heads -- with the exception of the schools, police, fire and sanitation -- to temporarily fill only one of every four vacant positions, except jobs supported by grants, mandated by law or necessary to maintain health or safety. The hiring freeze will remain in effect until agencies identify about $200 million worth of cuts in their budgets through June.
Officials from the New York Public Library, the Parks Department, the Health Department and the Human Resources Administration said yesterday they had not had time to evaluate the hiring freeze and would not comment on the impact it would have on services.
But Adam L. Barsky, Mr. Giuliani's director of Management and Budget, said he was confident the hiring freeze and spending reductions -- which are similar to measures imposed in previous years of Mr. Giuliani's tenure -- would have a limited effect on city government.
"We do not expect any reduction in services," Mr. Barsky said.
The city has for many years had a practice of projecting deficits in future budget years, predictions that for at least two decades have proved to be unfounded, as the city has ended up collecting more tax revenues or grants or has cut its spending to ensure that the budget has been balanced.
The challenge in 2002, the mayor said, results from the fact that tax cuts that he, the Council and the State Legislature approved in past years have reduced revenues expected in the next several years. Additionally, the Legislature voted last month to give retired government workers automatic annual increases in their pensions, a package that is projected to cost the city $98 million this year and $586 million by 2005.
Given these and other actions, the city's projected deficits have jumped by 70 percent since April, deficits that the mayor yesterday said "can be remedied, but they are going to require a pretty strict financial plan." He has proposed a series of cuts and revisions in this year's $37.6 billion budget that would reduce the projected deficit by $1.1 billion for 2002.
The mayor's actions came yesterday after several budget monitors -- including State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi -- had expressed concern about the rate of spending growth projected for next year, which they estimated would be at least 7.5 percent, a figure the mayor disputes.
Mr. McCall said yesterday that he welcomed the mayor's plan, but wanted to see if the mayor actually followed through. "This is a proposal; the question is does it become a fact," he said.
The Control Board, set up during the fiscal crisis to oversee the city budget, did not hesitate to unanimously approve its annual resolution declaring the city financially fit enough to maintain its financial independence.

HEADLINE: White House to Delay Move To Breach Northwest Dams

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
In a decision on an issue politically charged in the Pacific Northwest, the Clinton administration will postpone by at least five years a plan that could have led to the breaching of four major Snake River dams for the benefit of wild salmon.
Instead, the administration will propose a menu of smaller steps intended to protect the salmon and other fish from a dozen endangered species, in part by placing logs along riverbeds to provide the fish with an illusion of home. 
 The new steps, which are to be made public next week, were outlined today by administration officials. The proposal was portrayed as an alternative to more severe measures that faced opposition by elected officials in the Northwest. But it will also reverberate across the politically important region.
The dams, in Washington State, are part of a cluster on the Snake River and the Columbia River that interrupt the fishes' migratory path. But they also generate enormous quantities of electricity, and in the debate over their fate, the potential cost to consumers of electricity in the region has weighed heavily.
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, has already declared his opposition to any breaching of the dams. By contrast, Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic nominee, has refused to comment directly on the issue.
An administration move to put off any decision about breaching the dams could insulate Mr. Gore from criticism from environmentalists, who have argued that more needs to be done soon to repair the damage to the habitat of the endangered fish.
The decisions about the dams are being weighed by several federal agencies, including the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation, with the ultimate decision being made by the White House.
The vice president has cast himself as an environmentalist, but a decision made in the name of federal agencies could help to shield him from attack by those who might seek to portray the administration as an enemy of economic development.
Asked about the administration's decision this morning, Mr. Gore told reporters that he was "going to bring all of the parties together to come up with a solution that respects the environment and does not cause an upheaval in the economy."
Asked whether he agreed with the administration's decision, Mr. Gore sidestepped the issue. "I'm going to review it carefully. I think that what's needed is to bring all of the stakeholders together."
Later, the Gore campaign released a statement from the vice president that said, in part, "I feel it provides a solid foundation for restoring the salmon while strengthening the economy of the Pacific Northwest."
The statement also says that "if sufficient progress toward recovery is not being made, we may then have no choice but to pursue options such as dam breaching. But we must first exhaust all reasonable alternatives."
Still, news of the postponement prompted expressions of concern from Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee who is running well in Washington, Oregon and other Northwest states where polls have shown the race between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush to be extremely close.
Mr. Nader made it clear that he was eager to join the debate. "Everybody knows the dams cannot be removed overnight, but you have to move toward that goal," he said.
The decision to postpone any breaching of the dams was reported today in USA Today. Details were discussed by administration officials who cited testimony that was to have been given before Congress today.
In remarks prepared for those sessions, which were postponed, George Frampton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, tried to explain why the administration had elected not to recommend that the dams be breached as soon as possible. Mr. Frampton said such efforts "may not be essential" to recovering salmon habitat "and may not be sufficient."
As an alternative, at least for now, the new proposal calls for several other measures, including steps aimed at making it easier for fish to overcome the Snake River dams.
The progress made by the salmon and other fish toward recovery is to be monitored for the next five years. If it is not sufficient to remove the fish from the list of endangered species, other actions would have to be taken, including a renewed review of whether to breach the dams.
A spokesman for American Rivers, an environmental advocacy group, said the group would be watching to see whether the final plan provided adequate guarantees both now and in the future.
"The science shows that the dams need to be removed to save salmon," said the spokesman, Justin Hayes. "And if we delay too long, salmon runs, and even extinction, are at stake."
In interviews, administration officials have signaled that a preferred course might have been to have directed that the dams be breached.
But such a step would require the approval of Congress, including members of the Northwest delegations who have been steadfastly opposed to such an overhaul.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore, Switching Campaign Plans, Heads for Texas to Focus on the State's Budget Woes

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE with JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: RAYTOWN, Mo., July 19

 BODY:
Seizing what he views as a golden chance to pierce the heart of Gov. George W. Bush's campaign, Vice President Al Gore said today that he would ride into Governor Bush's backyard in Texas on Thursday to highlight the state's budget woes.
The Gore entourage had planned to travel from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, back to Washington, but this morning Mr. Gore announced that he would diverting his campaign to San Antonio Thursday afternoon. 
 The Gore campaign can hardly contain its glee over the daily headlines out of Texas describing a budget shortfall and its attendant problems. The Gore campaign can be expected to hit the air with television commercials on the subject soon, and will milk the budget problems for maximum publicity for some time to come, particularly as a competing story line about the Bush campaign in the days leading up to the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
"We believe that how the governor runs Texas says important things about how he'd run the country," said Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for the Gore campaign.
Mr. Fabiani added that the Gore team perceives the Texas budget shortfall as politically devastating for Mr. Bush as the pollution of Boston Harbor was to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts when he ran for president in 1988.
"It's a surprising weakness," Mr. Fabiani said. "The thing that hurt Governor Dukakis the most is that people thought a Democratic governor ought to be strong on the environment, and when questions were raised about the harbor it undermined one of his strengths. If a Republican governor can't effectively manage his state budget in a period of tremendous prosperity, it is just as bad. This is his Boston Harbor."
Mr. Gore told reporters tonight that the Boston Harbor comparison "never crossed my mind." But when asked whether he hoped his attacks on Mr. Bush would be as effective as the attacks on Mr. Dukakis, he did not answer directly. Instead, he criticized the administration of Mr. Bush's father, which he said "squandered" money on a tax cut that could have been used on a cleanup.
There is a special irony for the Gore campaign in being able to turn the Boston Harbor strategy so forcefully against Governor Bush since his father, in seeking the presidency in 1988, had turned Boston Harbor into a weapon against Mr. Dukakis.
The Gore campaign has already been using bits of this strategy by pointing to a variety of problems in Texas, but the vice president's advisers said the budget offered a graphic opportunity to bring various threads of the Texas story together. These threads, as Mr. Gore described them today, run from Mr. Bush's "unaffordable tax cuts for powerful interests, coupled with vague promises that the numbers will somehow add up in the future."
One Gore aide exclaimed, "It's a metaphor for everything!"
The announcement of Mr. Gore's trip to Texas comes amid growing fights among Texas lawmakers and public officials over the state's budget. Earlier this week Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander announced that the state would see an estimated $1.1 billion surplus -- more than enough, she said, to pay for the estimated $610 million in cost overruns that has pushed the state over budget.
"There's not a shortfall," said Ms. Rylander, who will release a final figure for the surplus on Friday. "There are budgeting adjustments."
She said she made the announcement to reassure Wall Street investors. But Democrats questioned the timing of Ms. Rylander's announcement of the surplus, noting that the comptroller usually projects revenue at the end of the fiscal year.
The controversy became public last week when state budget officials confirmed that unanticipated cost overruns, particularly in Medicaid and in state prisons, had thrown the state $610 million over budget. Mr. Bush's aides quickly responded that cost overruns were routine during any two-year budget cycle, and that the surplus would more than make up the difference.
But several Texas Democrats are pouncing on the issue, blaming the $1.7 billion in tax cuts championed by Mr. Bush for the shortfall, and portraying the governor as having put short-term political interests ahead of the state's fiscal stability.
An internal memorandum leaked from the Texas Department of Health has only fueled the controversy by predicting that Medicaid shortfalls alone could reach $633 million by Aug. 31, 2001. Ultimately, the Legislature must approve an emergency appropriation next year to keep the state in the black.
The sudden scrutiny of the Texas budget has also focused attention on the $84 million in the state's Rainy Day Fund, an account established in the 1980's after the oil boom ran out of steam. Dick Lavine of the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin said the Rainy Day Fund, as it stands, could pay for state government services for about 16 hours.
Mr. Bush's spokesman, Dan Bartlett, said that the Rainy Day Fund had only $8 million when Mr. Bush took office in 1995 and that the account has since grown tenfold.
Mr. Gore has been mentioning Mr. Bush's budget problems every day since the issue emerged last Friday, although his main focus has been another set topic.
At the City Hall here, where he announced a proposal to help local communities hire 10,000 more prosecutors, Mr. Gore began with a minor tutorial on the Texas budget.
"Several days ago, we learned that under Governor Bush's leadership, Texas has suddenly gone from its biggest budget surplus ever to a budget shortfall, the most serious budget problem in almost a decade," Mr. Gore said in a speech at the City Council chamber here.
"Now, we learn at a time of national prosperity -- indeed, the longest economic boom in the history of America -- that Texas has saved less for the future than almost every other state in America," Mr. Gore continued. "The state's so-called Rainy Day Fund could barely withstand a drizzle. It's now so small that by this fall there will be only enough money to run the Texas state government for a single day. You know, there'd be a real problem if Texas had a rainy season."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Internet is lowering the cost of advertising and searching for jobs.

BYLINE: By Alan B. Krueger 

 BODY:
IF you considered changing jobs lately, chances are good that you consulted the Internet to explore job opportunities.
The Internet is rapidly changing the way workers search for jobs and employers recruit workers. The resulting speed and ease of filling jobs have significant implications for unemployment, pay and productivity. 
 Internet job boards took off after Monster.com and HotJobs.com advertised during the 1999 Super Bowl. There are an estimated 30,000 job boards worldwide, ranging from Monster.com, which says it has 3.9 million resumes and 397,000 job postings, to more specialized job boards, like Accounting.Com and utah-jobs.com.
The arcane field of economics known as "search theory" is well suited for considering the economic impact of e-cruiting. The key concept is the "matching function," which governs the speed at which workers fill vacancies. Search costs slow down job matching, which contributes to unemployment and job vacancies.
Think of a game of musical chairs. Lower search costs are akin to playing the music faster, which enables players to find their chairs sooner.
The typical job board posts help-wanted ads or collects resumes; some do both. The cost of placing an ad on a job board is about 5 percent as much as the cost of placing a classified ad in a major newspaper for 30 days, and the reach can be as great or greater. Other advantages are that ads can be searched for listings in any desired occupation or location, and employers can continuously update and edit ads.
Job seekers can often apply for jobs simply by pressing a button that instantly zaps their resume to prospective employers. Some job boards match job seekers to job vacancies with computer algorithms, and automatically notify workers of potential matches via e-mail each morning.
Many employers, including Sprint, also find it advantageous to screen job candidates by administering employment tests directly on line, with the assistance of companies like eTest.net, a unit of the Management Psychology Group of Atlanta.
The bottom line is lower job search costs for both employees and employers, and less time required to fill a vacancy or find a job -- trends that are expected to continue.
Job boards are in part substituting for help-wanted ads placed in newspapers. The number of such ads usually increases when the unemployment rate declines, yet the Conference Board finds that newspaper help-wanted advertising fell last year, when unemployment reached its lowest level in 30 years. And the volume of help-wanted ads has been flat throughout the booming 1990's.
Unemployed workers were two-thirds as likely to surf the Internet to search for work as to look at traditional help-wanted ads, according to a new study of the December 1998 Current Population Survey by the economists Peter Kuhn of the University of California at Santa Barbara and Mikal Skuterud of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.
Who uses the Internet to search for work? Professors Kuhn and Skuterud found that 15 percent of unemployed job seekers and 7 percent of employed workers regularly used the Internet to search for a job. Among those with access to the Web from home, these numbers swelled to half of the unemployed and 15 percent of the employed.
The study also found a digital divide: 16 percent of white unemployed job seekers used the Internet to search for work, compared with just 7 percent of Hispanics and 9 percent of blacks. Among those with Internet access, however, blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to use the Internet for job searches.
More than a third of professional, managerial and technical unemployed workers used the Internet to search for work, compared with 5 percent of manual workers.
Surprisingly, although the Internet allows for faster and cheaper job searches, this might not lower unemployment. If workers can search for jobs more easily, they may become choosier and may require a higher salary before they will accept a job. Likewise, employers may become choosier and search until they find a more productive employee.
Implications for worker turnover are also ambiguous. On the one hand, many workers will be induced to enter the job market and switch jobs more often. On the other hand, if workers and employers invest more in learning about each other, presumably the quality of worker-job matches will improve, and resignations and firings will decline. Because many job boards are aimed at passive job seekers -- those who are not sure they want to move and who are not actively looking -- the former effect is likely to dominate.
One prediction is unambiguous: Productivity should increase as a result of lower search costs. This is good news because the labor market is dynamic, with more than 30 million workers and jobs turning over each year. The increased productivity would be divided by employees and employers in the form of higher pay and profit.
Although average pay is expected to rise, not all paychecks are expected to rise equally. Workers who settled for jobs paying less than they could get elsewhere should get a raise. Also, greater access to salary information over the Web should lead to more uniformity in pay. But Daron Acemoglu, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, expects that a wider electronic job market will enable employers to replace less skilled workers who previously were hired because it was too costly to search for more qualified workers.
Professor Kuhn raises another concern: lower search costs could reduce the prevalence of long-term implicit contracts, which tend to spread risks and reduce wage dispersion.
Perhaps most important, those who lack access to the Internet job bazaar will suffer restricted job opportunities. The digital divide has been hard to bridge, and efforts to provide Internet access and search assistance are increasingly critical. One new effort that may play a valuable role is America's One-Stop Career Center System, the central focus of the Labor Department's employment and training network.

HEADLINE: A Tax Cut in Small Slices

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
In early January, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert told the Republican leadership to abandon its effort to pass a single, hugely expensive tax-cut package in the face of opposition from President Clinton. Instead, he ordered up a series of narrow tax measures that could rise or fall not on their price tags but on their political appeal.
"People understand these in individual bites," Mr. Hastert said in an interview today. In one sense his strategy has played out as well as he could have hoped. 
 Following the lead of the House, the Senate has passed the two biggest tax bills of the year, one that would repeal the federal estate tax and another that would provide a tax cut to nearly all married couples. And today the House overwhelmingly passed a measure that would increase the allowable level of tax-deductible contributions to individual retirement accounts and 401(k) retirement programs. Page A20.
In every case, the measures have attracted significant support from Democrats, who at this point are arguing not about whether tax cuts are justified, only about how big they should be. Flush with success, and bolstered by sharp upward revisions in the projected federal budget surplus, Republicans said Mr. Hastert's strategy had proved that tax cuts still packed a political punch.
But in another sense, Mr. Hastert's strategy has led nowhere.
With an exception for the legislation that removed the limit on how much people over 65 could earn before losing part of their Social Security benefit, Mr. Clinton has refused to go along, and in recent days the administration has unleashed a sharp attack on the Republican tax cuts as a fiscally irresponsible giveaway to the wealthy. Vetoes are almost certain for the estate tax and marriage tax bills.
The result is a continuation of the ideological standoff that has defined fiscal policy since the Republicans took control of Congress in 1994. And it has led both parties to bet that the political benefits of conflict in this election year will outweigh the risks of any backlash from voters who might prefer to see compromise.
Most Republicans seem confident that they will get credit from voters for having passed the tax cuts. They say Democrats in Congress and Mr. Clinton, and by extension Vice President Al Gore, will come off as obstructionist, out of sync with the politics of prosperity and on the side of the Internal Revenue Service.
"Americans increasingly see the tax code as unfair or even stupid," said Frank Luntz, a Republican poll taker."The context that Republicans are trying to set up is that if George W. Bush is elected president, there will be no marriage penalty, no death tax."
But some Republicans, including Mr. Hastert, are concerned that the party not be seen as totally unwilling to compromise. As the House and Senate prepare to hash out the differences between the bills they passed to cut taxes for married couples, Mr. Hastert is pushing for the final legislation to look more like the House bill, which is less expensive and does less for upper-income taxpayers.
"We don't want to give the president any excuse not to sign it," Mr. Hastert said. "It's not good enough to pass a bill and send it to the president's desk and have him veto it."
Some analysts go even further and say that the Republicans have missed an opportunity to get all they could realistically hope to accomplish on tax cuts and to neutralize the charge that they are running a do-nothing Congress. They say that Democrats, nervous about being caught on the wrong side of the changing politics of taxation, have offered alternatives that should have been very attractive to Republicans.
In debating tax cuts for couples, Democrats in the Senate offered a plan to all but eliminate the marriage penalty paid by many two-income couples, though only for couples earning less than $150,000. Democrats in the House and Senate both offered plans to reduce the estate tax substantially. But Republicans brushed those offers aside.
Republicans "won't take yes for an answer," said Bruce Bartlett, an economist at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative research group.
"Democrats have moved a long way in the direction of the Republican agenda," Mr. Bartlett said. "But Republicans seem to have made their plans six months ago and bulled their way through without taking into account any change in circumstances. The makings of a deal are there, but they seem to be rejecting it in favor of an all-or-nothing approach, which is pig-headed."
The calculation from the Democratic side is that voters will see that the individual tax bills add up to the same big package that Republicans abandoned last year.
Taking their cue from the White House, Democrats in Congress are seeking to portray Republicans as working on behalf of a thin slice of the wealthiest taxpayers and ignoring the concerns of lower- and middle-income people who need tax breaks for child care, health care and college tuition costs.
"Their base is that rich 2 percent, our base is the rest, and that will be the fight," the Democratic leader in the Senate, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said this week.
But a growing number of Democrats are siding with Republicans, reflecting both the growing surplus and the fact that their base in the middle class is seeing its tax bill rise as it becomes increasingly affluent. To some extent, Democrats are trying to insulate themselves from assertions that they remain mired in their tax-and-spending past.
Among the Democrats who voted for both the estate-tax repeal and the tax cut for couples was Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, a state where taxes have been a critical political issue. Mr. Torricelli said today that he was interested in running for governor.
"Tax cutting is not the sole domain of the Republican Party," said Richard McGrath, the senator's spokesman. "Middle-class families with two incomes still have to struggle to pay basic expenses and should be given a break."

HEADLINE: Clinton Leaves Peace Talks; Arafat and Barak Stay

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ and DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: THURMONT, Md., July 19

 BODY:
In a dramatic turnaround, President Clinton announced early this morning that the Middle East peace talks that were described by his spokesman as having failed to reach an agreement, would remain intact, and that the Israeli and Palestinian leaders would stay at Camp David to continue meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
Mr. Clinton said that after the announcement late Wednesday that no agreement had been reached, there had been a substantial change of mind. "We all thought it was over," Mr. Clinton said at an elementary school here, five miles away from Camp David. "Then we discovered nobody wanted to give up. And that should be encouraging." 
 The president had met repeatedly with the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, who were at Camp David for nine days. Mr. Clinton then left for Japan, where he is to attend a meeting of the leaders of the seven major industrial nations.
The swing from announced failure to a renewal of talks came in just over two hours. The presidential spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said that the motorcade taking Mr. Clinton to the White House and then the airport was set to leave Camp David when word spread around the delegations who had never stopped negotiating that it really was over.
"As we were getting ready to leave, it became clear there was a willingness to stay and an unwillingness to let it break down," Mr. Lockhart said. Mr. Barak, who was preparing to give a midnight news conference before leaving for Israel, cancelled his departure plans. Similarly, Mr. Arafat, who was ready to go too, decided to stay.
Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat will meet with Dr. Albright over the next four days to try and close the gaps on the main issues, Mr. Clinton said. On his return from Japan, Mr. Clinton said he would assess the progress.
Mr. Clinton, who spoke in a hoarse voice, said the two sides had made an "intensive effort" and though the gaps remained "substantial," there "has been progress." He declined to say what the major stumbling blocks were, maintaining that the news blackout that has been in force would remain in his absence.
The last hours before Mr. Lockhart's announcement just before 11 p.m. that the summit meeting had ended without agreement involved an intensive round of consultations by Mr. Clinton with the two leaders and a series of discussions with their delegations. Just before the public announcement of no agreement was made, Mr. Lockhart said that word was passed to the two parties.
"The president made the judgment that it was time to leave," Mr. Lockhart said. Then in the following 90 minutes the reversal emerged, he said.
Mr. Clinton called the summit meeting in a sweeping effort to close the 52-year conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians and put on the table the major issues that the parties had been unable to resolve.
The question of the sovereignty of Jerusalem was reported to be the main obstacle. And earlier in the evening, according to Radio Israel, Mr. Clinton unsuccessfully proposed that Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat accept a partial agreement that did not include Jerusalem. This accord would have dealt with the territorial shape of a Palestinian state and brought a solution to the fate of three million Palestinian refugees scattered through the Middle East.
Mr. Clinton and his aides appeared relieved that they had been able to pull the summit meeting from the brink and push it into a new, second phase. But Mr. Lockhart warned: "I don't know if a few more days will help the process."
Wednesday was a day of high tension and rapidly shifting moods. Late into the evening Mr. Clinton was still making an effort to salvage the talks, shuttling between the two sides.
Throughout the day, President Clinton shuttled between Prime Minister Barak and Mr. Arafat -- who did not meet directly with each other -- fending off an Israeli initiative to leave early and turning repeatedly to his advisers and to the negotiators in search of some formula that would save the talks.
During the nine days of talks, Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat apparently dealt with every issue in the conflict -- from borders and the fate of Jewish settlements to the right of return of Palestinian refugees to the status of Jerusalem. But it was unclear whether the ultimate stumbling block was a single issue, like Jerusalem, or the trade-offs needed to fashion an overall agreement.
Each side seemed to be gearing up to lay the blame for a failed summit meeting on the other, and each leader appealed privately to President Clinton in letters written in the last 48 hours.
The mood of the high-tension, high-stakes day seesawed. At midday, it seemed certain that the talks were fizzling out.
The day built to an unexpectedly quick first climax, when the Israeli journalists accompanying Mr. Barak were ordered in the afternoon to rush to their hotels for a security check so that their luggage could be shuttled to Andrews Air Force Base for an 8 p.m. departure for Tel Aviv.
As the clock ran down, expectations were rife that there had been a breakdown. Israeli television reported, and an American official later confirmed, that Mr. Barak had sent a letter to Mr. Clinton announcing the Israeli prime minister's departure and laying the blame for the meeting's failure on the Palestinians.
"The Palestinian side is conducting negotiations insincerely and is not willing to negotiate in a serious and practical manner for a permanent peace between us," an Israeli reporter cited as a direct quotation from the letter.
But a senior Palestinian negotiator, Abu Mazen, who himself was heading to the airport to fly home to his son's wedding, brushed off what he saw as an 11th-hour Israeli tactic to increase pressure on the Palestinians.
Mr. Lockhart said that Mr. Clinton had also received a letter from Mr. Arafat, which arrived on Tuesday, before Mr. Barak's. He did not characterize its contents, but Palestinian officials said that Mr. Arafat had reached a summit of frustration on the eighth day.
If news of the letters lowered expectations of a deal, Mr. Lockhart reported that Mr. Clinton had managed by late afternoon to keep the leaders from walking out. "They are still there, they are all still talking," the spokesman said.
Mr. Lockhart made clear that the two leaders were having trouble making concessions on deeply emotional issues.
"The leaders both want to go home with an agreement," Mr. Lockhart said. "The problem is the substance and structure of the agreement." But he added that the extended deadline would have to stand. "There comes a time when you have to put a time limit on discussions," he said.
During the day, Mr. Clinton telephoned other leaders in the Middle East to brief them on the developments. They were the first such contacts since the meeting opened.
Inside Camp David, cabin fever combined with exhaustion and the anxiety intensified as the day lengthened into night. Discussions went on, Mr. Lockhart said, at the "leader level, the negotiator level, between teams and within teams."
It appeared that an ultimate sticking point concerned the future status of Jerusalem, the most divisive issue and one that has never before been negotiated by Israeli and Arab leaders. It was seen as the make-or-break issue, but it is possible that other stumbling blocks remained.
The issue of Jerusalem, long regarded as the most emotive and difficult of the questions separating the Israelis and Palestinians, was brought up in detail for the first time in negotiations.
After conquering East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, Israel declared that the city would "eternally" remain united and under exclusive Israeli sovereignty.
The visit of the Egyptian leader, Anwar el-Sadat, to Jerusalem in the fall of 1977 was interpreted by the Israelis as recognition of Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital. But a year later, at the first Camp David summit meeting between Mr. Sadat and the Israeli prime minister, Menachem Begin, the question of Jerusalem threatened to scuttle the entire conference.
President Carter tried to find some sort of symbolic solution -- such as flying Muslim flags on the Temple Mount -- but the suggestions were rejected by the Israelis.
In the Oslo agreement of 1993, under which Israel recognized the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Palestinians renounced all violence against Israel, the future of Jerusalem, along with the fate of Palestinian refugees, final borders and some other issues, was left for "final status" talks. The official position of the United States has been that the fate of Jerusalem must be negotiated between the parties.
Over the last seven years, diplomats, professors, demographers and officials from both sides have tried to come up with various arrangements that could satisfy the demands of both sides, including ideas that involved autonomy for Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem and would allow the Palestinians to claim the neighboring village of Abu Dis as their Jerusalem.
But these ideas were dismissed by the Palestinians as a "Jewish solution." Abu Dis, they argued, is not Jerusalem.
Those who have watched Mr. Arafat over many years say that he always set a benchmark: he would not be the Palestinian who went down in history as the one who gave up Arab claims to East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state.
Mr. Arafat, they point out, was not asking for a divided city but rather shared sovereignty in an open and undivided city. Offering municipal control over some neighborhoods, they said, fell far short.
Conversely, for Mr. Barak, making concessions on a city that many Jews regard as their capital by divine fiat was extremely difficult.

HEADLINE: Brewed in China, Envied Abroad;
Tsingtao Outsells Intruders Even as It Courts Anheuser

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: QINGDAO, China, July 14

 BODY:
When Stephen Burrows of Anheuser-Busch traveled here recently to meet the general manager of the Tsingtao Brewery, he saw it as a chance to get acquainted with the boss of China's most famous beer company. His host, Peng Zuo Yi, saw it differently.
"I told him why so many foreign brands have failed in China," Mr. Peng said. "They can't run their factories in China any longer. They're all losing money." 
 Anheuser-Busch may be the largest brewer in the world, but in this seaside city where Chinese beer was born, Mr. Burrows was treated more like a vanquished intruder than a fellow beer merchant.
"We have struggled," Mr. Burrows acknowledged. "Struggling is something that happens when you go into a volatile market like China."
Mr. Peng's solution is an alliance between Anheuser-Busch and Tsingtao (pronounced CHING-dow), in which the companies would distribute each other's beer in China and the United States. Mr. Burrows, the chief executive of Anheuser-Busch International, called it premature to talk about such a deal. But he agreed that Tsingtao had changed markedly -- and for the better -- in the last five years.
"Tsingtao is a different company," he said. "It seems like they've got a clearer strategy."
As China stands nervously on the threshold of World Trade Organization membership, it will need companies like Tsingtao to push through the open door. Once a bloated state-owned enterprise, Tsingtao has transformed itself into a confident competitor. By learning marketing skills from its foreign rivals and exploiting its home-field advantages, Tsingtao has managed to stake out a dominant position in the crowded and chaotic Chinese beer market.
In a twist on the much-feared foreign invasion of China, Tsingtao is now negotiating to buy three breweries from their foreign owners. While a rarity, Tsingtao is not the only Chinese company to make it in the global economy. The Haier Group, an appliance maker also based here, began exporting refrigerators in 1992. It now has more than a quarter of the small-refrigerator market in the United States, and recently built a factory in South Carolina. Almost bankrupt in 1984, Haier had $3.2 billion in sales last year.
"People think that with China's entry into the W.T.O., Chinese national industry will be completely destroyed," Mr. Peng, who is 55, said. "I don't think so. I think the success of Tsingtao shows that competition can make us better."
Haier's chairman and chief executive, Zhang Ruimin, puts it differently. "We decided we didn't want to be eaten by the wolf," he said. "We wanted to dance with the wolf."
To be sure, many Chinese companies will be eaten by the wolves, which is why China's joy about the world's club of trading nations is tinged with apprehension. In the most sclerotic state enterprises, the feeling is closer to dread. Yet, in this upwardly mobile city on the country's northern coast, the big brewery and Haier are held up as models of how China can pull down the walls that surround its economy and still keep the predators at bay.
"We have a rich variety of manufacturing companies in this city," said Wang Jiarui, Qingdao's business-like mayor. "Some will jump into the world market; others will be edged out of it. But I still think there are more opportunities than drawbacks to joining the W.T.O."
Qingdao's namesake company, Tsingtao Brewery Ltd. -- the company retains the old transliteration of the city's name -- was founded by Germans, who colonized the place in 1903. The original brewery sits across the street from a park where German soldiers were once quartered; company lore has it that the beer was meant to slake the men's thirst.
Tsingtao was China's first beer, and it is still highly prized here. Critics praise the freshness of its water, which is piped from the Laoshan, the mountain nearby. Qingdao is steeped in the folkways of the German beer industry. The company built an ersatz German village on the outskirts of town for its annual beer festival. And if you squint, Qingdao's sturdy stone houses with steeply slanted roofs look almost Bavarian.
In 1979, as China was opening again to the outside world, Beijing made Tsingtao the official export beer. It is now a staple in Chinese restaurants from Seattle to Stuttgart.
The Chinese government capitalized on this fame in 1993 by selecting Tsingtao as one of the first companies to be allowed to sell shares on the Hong Kong stock market. The initial public offering was successful, but Tsingtao's state owners ordered it to give some of the proceeds to other troubled state companies. This made it an emblem of the dangers of investing in corporate China.
Shortly after that black eye, Tsingtao started facing competition from another quarter. Enticed by the prospect of more than a billion beer-swilling Chinese, more than 60 foreign brands -- including Budweiser, Foster's and San Miguel -- poured in. Teaming up with Chinese investors, they bought and built breweries all over China. They also spent millions on splashy advertising and marketing campaigns, next to which the Tsingtao name seemed faded.
The foreign brewers priced their beer anywhere from 60 cents to $1 a bottle, compared with about 40 cents for Tsingtao.
Around the same time, local governments began brewing beers that were even cheaper than Tsingtao and popular with frugal consumers. For example, Yanjing, a beer brewed in Beijing, sells for only 30 cents a bottle. Some lesser-known local beers go for as little as 12 cents. After decades of dominance, Tsingtao found itself overtaken in market share by Yanjing.
Adding to its problems, Tsingtao relied on an outdated network of distributors who did not push the brand hard enough.
"Our sales agents tended to focus on fancy restaurants while ignoring the needs of the common drinker," said Mr. Peng, a plain-spoken man who wears short-sleeve shirts and acknowledges that he does not really like beer.
The trouble is that 70 percent of China's consumers fit the definition of common drinker. They make enough money to buy beer, but will not pay for a premium brand. So Tsingtao was squeezed both ways: at the high end of the market by Budweiser and Foster's, and at the low end by the likes of Yanjing.
While China's beer market grew tenfold in the 1990's, Tsingtao's production increased by just 20 percent. From 1994 to 1996, the company lost money.
On a visit to Qingdao in 1996, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, then a cabinet member, became alarmed that China's flagship beer seemed to be going down the drain. Qingdao's leaders plucked Mr. Peng out of a successful state-owned food company and sent him on a rescue mission. He promptly got rid of most of the senior managers and set about overhauling the brewer.
Mr. Peng set up a new sales network, with 45 branch offices, to promote Tsingtao aggressively. And he started buying breweries to produce the flagship brand, as well as lower-cost local brands. Buying breweries in the hinterland enabled him to avoid one of the pitfalls of the Chinese industry: protectionism by local authorities who jealously guard their home brew.
Tsingtao, which reclaimed the No. 1 position last year, has acquired 22 breweries from Shenzhen in the south to Beijing in the north. Owning more breweries has allowed Mr. Peng to bypass China's clotted distribution channels. Tsingtao beer used to sit on store shelves for months. Now, people in Tsingtao's home province, Shandong, can buy it within a week of brewing.
"In effect, he's consolidating the industry," said Jack Perkowski, the chief executive of Asimco, an Asian investment company that owns two small Beijing beer companies, Five Star and Three Ring. "They want to be the first Chinese company to have a truly national presence."
While Mr. Peng was whipping Tsingtao into shape, the foreigners began discovering some hard truths about the Chinese market. The premium segment, in which the non-Chinese producers compete, accounts for barely 7 percent of overall sales. And as price deflation has rippled through the economy, Chinese drinkers have been more reluctant than ever to pay extra for an upscale brand.
The foreign companies also made heavy investments upfront. Mr. Burrows said Anheuser-Busch paid $52 million for its brewery in the central city of Wuhan. The company spent millions more to upgrade the factory, plus plenty on advertising and marketing. Although its main brand, Budweiser, is quite popular here, the sales are too small and costs are too high to turn a profit.
"You can't get enough volume," Mr. Perkowski said, "particularly if you set up a brewery that looks like a brewery in the United States."
Mr. Burrows said sales of Budweiser improved this year, after two lackluster years. He predicted that the parent Anheuser-Busch would turn a profit in China in five years, adding that with 200 sales agents in 31 cities, Anheuser-Busch was determined to stay in the Chinese market.
Other foreign brands, however, are sounding a retreat. Foster's of Australia sold two of its Chinese breweries last year, keeping one in Shanghai. Lion Nathan, a New Zealand brewer, said it may leave altogether. By the end of August, Tsingtao will announce three acquisitions of foreign-invested breweries -- two in Beijing and one in Shanghai. Mr. Peng declined to name the companies.
Clearly, though, he is looking beyond the breweries to a partnership with Anheuser-Busch. He said a deal would cut Anheuser's costs because it must now transport all its beer from its Wuhan brewery. It could avoid those long shipments by using Tsingtao's plants in Beijing and Shanghai. In return, Tsingtao would brew its beer in Anheuser's factories in the United States.
An alliance with Anheuser-Busch would carry some symbolism. Five years ago, Anheuser bought a 5 percent stake in Tsingtao, and the two companies discussed ways to cooperate. But the Americans were put off by the Chinese company's balky managers. Coming back to the table to make a deal would send a clear signal that Tsingtao is a global player.
It would also help Mr. Peng realize his dream of making Tsingtao one of the world's top 10 brewers by 2003, its 100th anniversary.
"The top leaders of China were worried that Chinese beer would collapse because of all the competition," Mr. Peng said with a mischievous chuckle. "But five years later, it turns out the Tsingtao has succeeded. Our attitude has changed from fear of the foreigners to driving them out of the market."

When Horses Could Roam The Heavens

BYLINE: By Wendy Moonan 

 BODY:
The Scythians, the fierce nomadic tribes of Central Asia that swept as far west as the Danube from the eighth to the fourth century B.C., did not limit themselves to plundering Europe. Skilled horsemen, they rampaged across ancient Eurasia as far east as China. "Their country is the back of a horse," Herodotus wrote.
The Chinese did not like what was happening. "The Chinese finally realized that those who controlled the cavalry controlled the world," said Jim Lally, a Manhattan dealer in Chinese art. "It was a whole new technology." So they formed their own mounted cavalry. 
 "The most important Chinese appropriation from its nomadic neighbors was horseback riding and mounted warfare," said Bill Cooke, director of the International Museum of the Horse at the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, Ky. So, Mr. Cooke said, "to explore the significance of the horse in the unification of China and in the exchange of culture with the Western world along the Silk Road," he organized "Imperial China: The Art of the Horse in Chinese History." The exhibition runs through Aug. 31.
Four years in the planning, it is one of the largest shows of Chinese artifacts ever seen in the United States. It includes more than 350 artifacts valued at $100 million, with terra cotta tomb sculptures, a reconstructed chariot with its original bronze fittings from about 200 B.C., horses in carved jade, gilded bronze and porcelain, and colorful scroll paintings.
By 307 B.C., Bill Cooke said, King Wu Ling of the State of Zhao, near the present-day northern border of China, issued an imperial decree that soldiers stop wearing their long robes and adopt nomadic dress so they could ride astride in battle just like their enemies. The soldiers protected their homeland, and before long the horse became an object of great affection in Chinese culture.
In fact, the horse has had a special place in China's social, religious, economic and military life ever since the Chinese domesticated it for meat, milk and hides about 3000 B.C. "Throughout China's long and storied past, no animal has impacted its history as greatly as the horse," Mr. Cooke said.
The Chinese believed the "heavenly horse," like the dragon, was capable of flight, even of carrying his rider to the "home of the immortals" in the next world. The noble horse inspired ancient philosophers, poets, writers and artists.
Although the Chinese were not the first to ride horses, they are credited with perfecting two of the most significant inventions in terms of world history: the harness and the stirrup, which ultimately became as important as China's two other fabled creations, paper and gunpowder.
In the exhibition are some of the earliest life-size sculptures of Chinese horses and their riders. Excavated from a tomb in Shaanxi province in 1977, a cavalryman and his horse are part of the terra cotta army commissioned for the tombs of the Qin dynasty (221 to 207 B.C.). The unglazed horse is saddled up, with studs and tassel decorating his saddle. His master leads him by the reins. The cavalryman wears a tight cap, a short robe, an armored vest, tight trousers and boots. The duo is among 116 cavalrymen and horses discovered in the same excavation.
By the time of the Han dynasty (206 B.C. to A.D. 220), Chinese emperors realized the need to import horses of superior stock to beat back the barbarians' ever more daring raids. "China's very survival relied on its equestrian prowess," Mr. Cooke writes.
Obtaining better horses by importing them was not easy, however. In the second century B.C., Emperor Han Wudi sent an expedition to Turkmenistan (then called Ferghana) to buy that region's prized Akhal-Teke, an ancient Eurasian breed of desert horse that was tall, fast, strong and required little food or water. (It is thought to be the forerunner of the English thoroughbred.) The Chinese called them "horse of heaven" or the "thousand-li" -- that is, a horse that could run 1,000 li -- a li is about a third of a mile -- without tiring.
The ruler of Ferghana refused to sell his horses and killed the envoys. The emperor decided to take the horses by force. He sent 6,000 cavalrymen and 20,000 soldiers to Ferghana. The campaign was a disaster. Half the force died in the mountains and deserts en route; the rest were badly defeated in battle. They straggled home two years later, only to face a furious emperor.
Undaunted, the emperor decided to send yet a larger army. As Mr. Cooke explained, this expeditionary force of 60,000 soldiers and 30,000 horses went West with a herd of 100,000 cattle to sustain them.
After a 40-day siege of Ferghana, the Chinese collected 3,000 horses, 2,000 of which perished on the return journey. It turned out that only 50 of the captured horses were of the prized breed.
Nonetheless, the subjugation of Ferghana persuaded other tribes to cooperate with the Han rulers, ultimately resulting in the opening of the Silk Road. Thereafter, the Chinese traded silk and tea for horses.
The artistic depictions of horses most associated with China are the magnificent terra cotta horses of the Tang dynasty (A.D. 618 to 907), which remain treasured works of art in the West today.(The record price for one is $6.1 million at Sotheby's London in December 1989.)
To the Tang, the horse was not only a military necessity but also a status symbol. The Tang used horses for battle, hunting, dressage and polo. Women were allowed to ride. One particularly charming figure in the show is a painted female tomb figure on horseback. She sports a wide-brimmed black hat and a red flowered jacket. Her yellow horse has a red mane and red spots like a modern appaloosa.
"For the Chinese, who were a sedentary civilization, the horse was a source of joy and pleasure," Mr. Lally said.
Asked about another Tang horse with a female rider in the exhibition, this one glazed in rare blue as well as green and gold, Mr. Lally said: "The flying-hooves stance is unusual. These horses are from the great artistic center Xian, which was to Tang China what Paris was to Napoleonic France." Xian is near the site of the terra cotta army.
Torkom Demirjian, director of the Ariadne Galleries in Manhattan, pointed out the quality of the Chinese bronze horse trappings in the show. Mr. Demirjian sells some Tang horses, but he is a specialist in Scythian and Thraco-Scythian objects, including horse trappings. He noted the similarities, saying, "The Chinese had extensive relations with these nomadic peoples long before we think they did." He is so impressed with the workmanship of his gold Scythian horse and chariot trappings that he is taking them to Paris to sell at the Biennale des Antiquaires in September.
Mr. Cooke said 80,000 people had visited the Kentucky exhibition since it opened on May 1. He said arrangements with Chinese officials have been problem-free from the start. When he first went to China to discuss doing a show, he was introduced to Zhang Ting Hao, director general of the Administrative Bureau of Museums and Archaeological Data of Shaanxi province, at a banquet. He told Mr. Zhang his ideas, and Mr. Zhang replied that he had written his master's thesis on the role of the horse in Chinese history. "That was it," Mr. Cooke recalled. "In 24 hours, we went from an idea to a 10,000-square-foot installation.'

HEADLINE: Earnings at Gillette Were Up 2.1% in the Second Quarter

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 20

 BODY:
Gillette, the world's largest maker of razors, said today that its second-quarter earnings rose 2.1 percent on increased sales of its Mach 3 blades in the United States.
Profit from continuing operations rose to $296 million, or 28 cents a share, compared with $290 million, or 25 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 2 percent, to $2.25 billion from $2.21 billion. 
 The results matched analysts' estimates, according to First Call/ Thomson Financial.
Gillette, which also makes of Duracell batteries and Right Guard deodorant, said it was continuing talks to sell its Paper Mate, Waterman and Parker pens' business to Newell Rubbermaid. Shares of Gillette had declined after the company said it would retain its Braun appliance unit. Gillette declined to say whether it had received any offers for Braun. In the latest quarter, Braun's profit more than doubled, while sales rose 11 percent.
A loss of $427 million, or 41 cents a share, from the pens' business, which Gillette listed as a discontinued operation, resulted in a net loss of $131 million, or 13 cents a diluted share. In the quarter a year earlier, profit from the pens' business of $10 million, or a penny a share, resulted in net income of $300 million, or 26 cents a share.
Gillette fell $1, to $32.3125.
Gillette warned in May that sales would be only slightly higher than those in the period a year earlier because of the euro's 11 percent drop against the dollar the last year. Gillette has been hurt the last two years by slowing economies and currency declines in Asia, Latin America and Europe.
Sales of razors and blades, Gillette's biggest business, which accounts for most of its profit, rose 8 percent in the quarter on higher Mach 3 sales in Europe and North America.

HEADLINE: Higher Rates Are Slowing Housing Starts

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
Housing construction fell to its lowest level in more than two years last month, responding to the Federal Reserve's string of interest rate increases, government figures showed today.
Builders began work on new homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.55 million units in June, down 3 percent from the level in May, the Commerce Department reported. The rate last month was down 1 percent from the June 1999 rate of 1.56 million units. 
 The decline left housing starts at their lowest level since May 1998, when the seasonally adjusted annual rate was 1.54 million units.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today that it was inevitable that home building, which is highly sensitive to interest rates, would markedly slow down.
"There is no way to avoid the fact that we have ups and downs" in the housing market, Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee as he presented the central bank's midyear economic report to Congress. "It was inevitable, in my judgment, for housing to quite considerably slow down."
The housing market has been an engine of the vibrant economy. Even with higher interest rates, activity has remained healthy.
The Fed's rate increases are intended to slow the economy gradually to a pace that the central bank regards as more likely to be sustained without igniting inflation -- a rate between 3.5 and 4 percent. In the first quarter of the year, the economy grew at a 5.4 percent rate.
In a second government report, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week fell 9,000, to 311,000.
The housing report showed that new building permits -- a barometer of future activity -- for single-family homes fell to a rate of 1.11 million, down 3 percent from May and the lowest level since December 1997.
New building permits for all types of housing were unchanged in June at 1.51 million, suggesting that future construction activity may slow.

HEADLINE: Easing Back on Tax Cuts

 BODY:
No longer campaigning for the Senate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani now seems to be directing his full public energies to running New York City. Such renewed focus could bode well for the city's fiscal stability. The mayor who once said he loves cutting taxes, a particularly good stance for a Republican candidate, has now said that he needs to scale back this year's promised tax cuts. A look at the city's potential deficits shows that he is on the right track.
Mr. Giuliani argues that the budgetary equation has changed since he proposed in January to eliminate the city's personal income tax surcharge. He says that state legislators, eyeing the city's fat surplus during an election year, have made expensive demands about how the city must use it. But if the State Legislature was up to more than its usual mischief, the city's rate of spending growth is also more than twice the rate of inflation. Moreover, the city's borrowing has increased so much that the state had to raise its approved debt ceiling. With such strains on the city's budget, Mayor Giuliani should also consider ways of paying down the municipal debt as part of his effort to scale back future deficits. 
 The mayor should not be swayed by those Democrats who suggest that his revenue estimates are too conservative, thus making the projected deficits unreasonably large. Mr. Giuliani put it well when he addressed the New York State Financial Control Board on Wednesday. Tinkering with the numbers, he said, would be "a dangerous game." At present, his administration estimates unusually large budget deficits and lower revenue estimates that, in effect, presume a dip in the city's current boom-time fortunes.
To cut these deficits, the mayor wants to stall or skip the tax cuts, including those negotiated with the City Council and the Legislature. He also plans a hiring freeze. Both moves represent fiscal responsibility, as long as crucial city services are not reduced. The mayor says that when he leaves office after next year, he wants the city to be in better financial shape than it was when he arrived in 1994. That is a sound objective.

HEADLINE: Take the Marines Off Okinawa

BYLINE: By Jacob Heilbrunn; Jacob Heilbrunn writes often about American foreign policy.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
President Clinton's arrival in Okinawa today for the Group of 8 meeting of big industrial nations calls attention to something beyond the international economic issues that the leaders there will discuss: the debate about whether the time has come to end the American military presence on Okinawa.
The Okinawans who have used the visit of the world leaders as a stage for demonstrating in favor of American withdrawal are protesting acts like a hit-and-run incident involving an Air Force staff sergeant and the molestation of a 14-year-old Okinawan girl in which a marine was accused. The Japanese government, however, shows no interest in a removal of the Americans, because Japan's defenses are bolstered by the American base. 
 In the United States, however, the issue is most often framed as a debate between isolationists who want us to get out of Asia and champions of maintaining our presence in Okinawa as a sign of American resolve in that part of the world. Both have it wrong. The United States can afford to pull its troops out of Okinawa with no loss of our commitment to Asian security. In fact, America's position would be enhanced.
A decade after the fall of the Soviet Union, the challenges to America in Asia are a Chinese military buildup, the China-Taiwan conflict and North Korea. Yet in Okinawa, 20,000 marines remain as a relic of the cold war.
Supporters of the status quo argue that the marines on Okinawa could help move supplies in the event of a war in Korea or Taiwan and that they provide ready reinforcements for possible rapid deployment to other regions, like the Persian Gulf. The Clinton administration codified this consensus in the 1995 Nye report, when it declared that America would keep a minimum of 100,000 troops in Asia until at least 2015, explicitly including the 20,000 on Okinawa in that total.
The truth is that the United States can not only retain but improve upon these goals by removing its forces from Okinawa. Over the past decade the Pentagon has been moving toward a new strategy based on getting American troops to global hot spots by sea and air, a strategy known as maritime pre-positioning force. International seas offer complete and expeditious freedom of movement, and the Marines already have the equivalent of a division stationed on ships around the globe. The Navy is also working to improve the replenishment of ships already at sea with missiles, cannon rounds, bullets and fuel. The marines in Okinawa might be redeployed to bolster this strategy.
There are disadvantages, after all, in keeping them where they are. Okinawa is what is known as an unaccompanied tour, which means the marines cannot bring their wives. The small Okinawa base also has no room for large-scale battle training.
More fundamentally, as the military expert Paul Bracken points out in his recent book, "Fire in the East," maintaining a string of bases in Asia has rendered the American military dangerously vulnerable to chemical and ballistic missile attacks. The United States, he says, needs to restructure the military to allow it to operate at greater distances from home and become "less reliant on vulnerable forward bases."
One step would be to shift the basing of fleets so that destroyers can remain permanently stationed in the Pacific rather than trundling to and from the West Coast. Facilities in Japan are already being built up, Guam could be expanded, and most intriguingly, Vietnam might be willing to consider leasing Cam Ranh Bay back to the United States, especially as it fears growing Chinese military strength.
In an era of tight military budgets and limited manpower, such measures would improve the speed with which American firepower can reach Asia, and they would have none of Okinawa's drawbacks.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Federal Reserve Chairman's Testimony

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, presented his report on monetary policy to the Senate Banking Committee yesterday. Following are excerpts:
For some time now, the growth of aggregate demand has exceeded the expansion of production potential. Technological innovations have boosted the growth rate of potential, but as I noted in my testimony last February, the effects of this process also have spurred aggregate demand. It has been clear to us that, with labor markets already quite tight, a continuing disparity between the growth of demand and potential supply would produce disruptive imbalances. 
 A key element in this disparity has been the very rapid growth of consumption resulting from the effects on spending of the remarkable rise in household wealth. However, the growth in household spending has slowed noticeably this spring from the unusually rapid pace observed late in 1999 and early this year.
Some argue that this slowing is a pause following the surge in demand through the warmer-than-normal winter months and hence a reacceleration can be expected later this year. Certainly, we have seen slowdowns in spending during this near-decade-long expansion that have proven temporary, with aggregate demand growth subsequently rebounding to an unsustainable pace.
But other analysts point to a number of factors that may be exerting more persistent restraint on spending. One they cite is the flattening in equity prices, on net, this year. They attribute much of the slowing of consumer spending to this diminution of the wealth effect through the spring and early summer. This view looks to equity markets as a key influence on the trend in consumer spending over the rest of this year and next.
Another factor said by some to account for the spending slowdown is the rising debt burden of households. Interest and amortization as a percent of disposable income have risen materially during the past six years, as consumer and especially mortgage debt has climbed and, more recently, as interest rates have moved higher.
In addition, the past year's rise in the price of oil has amounted to an annual $75 billion levy by foreign producers on domestic consumers of imported oil, the equivalent of a tax of roughly 1 percent of disposable income. This burden is another likely source of the slowed growth in real consumption outlays in recent months, though one that may prove to be largely transitory.
Mentioned less prominently have been the effects of the faster increase in the stock of consumer durable assets -- both household durable goods and houses -- in the last several years, a rate of increase that history tells us is usually followed by a pause. . . .
Because the softness in outlay growth is so recent, all of the aforementioned hypotheses, of course, must be provisional. It is certainly premature to make a definitive assessment of either the recent trends in household spending or what they mean. But it is clear that, for the time being at least, the increase in spending on consumer goods and houses has come down several notches, albeit from very high levels.
In one sense, the more important question for the longer-term economic outlook is the extent of any productivity slowdown that might accompany a more subdued pace of production and consumer spending, should it persist. . . .
To be sure, if current personal consumption outlays slow significantly further than the pattern now in train suggests, profit and sales expectations might be scaled back, possibly inducing some hesitancy in moving forward even with capital projects that appear quite profitable over the longer run. In addition, the direct negative effects of the sharp recent runup in energy prices on profits as well as on sales expectations may temporarily damp capital spending. . . .
As I have already noted, to date costs have been held in check by productivity gains. But at the same time, inflation has picked up -- even the core measures that do not include energy prices directly. Higher rates of core inflation may mostly reflect the indirect effects of energy prices, but the Federal Reserve will need to be alert to the risks that high levels of resource utilization may put upward pressure on inflation.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Investors Weed Out Thorns From Greenspan's Message

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Are investors looking at Alan Greenspan through rose-colored glasses?
They may have done just that yesterday, focusing on all the positives of the testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman before the Senate Banking Committee and sending stock and bond prices sharply higher and interest rates lower. 
 The Nasdaq composite index jumped 3.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.4 percent, led by a 12 percent surge in I.B.M. after it reported strong second-quarter profits late on Wednesday.
What investors and analysts saw, to their surprise, was Mr. Greenspan offering encouragement for the view that the central bank would be able to slow economic growth enough to contain inflation, without risking a recession and, possibly, without any more interest rate increases.
"What has captured the markets' attention here is that Greenspan has raised the possibility that the Fed is done," said Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates.
Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said the Fed's aggressive stance of last spring had mellowed. "The tone is one of a Fed that is going to be in a watchful, waiting mode, but doesn't see any catalyst for acting," he said.
But investors may be too optimistic, and this could trip up markets in the days ahead, when the euphoria created by a mellow Alan Greenspan wears off.
First, even some Wall Street analysts who were surprised by Mr. Greenspan's optimism still say more Fed rate increases will be needed in the future to finally slow economic growth to a manageable, noninflationary pace.
While the chances of a rate increase in late August, when Fed policy makers next meet, are diminishing, Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, expects at least one more rate rise before the central bank is finished.
But there may be an even bigger problem lurking for investors if Mr. Greenspan's remarks bring a lot of bulls back to the stock and bond markets. Strong rallies in both markets, on the belief that the worst of a yearlong series of Fed increases is over, could make slowing economic growth much more difficult and require more increases than now expected. Stocks rising to new highs could set off a burst of consumer spending -- through what is known as the wealth effect -- of the kind that has reignited economic growth the last several years. Declining interest rates will help spur both businesses and consumers.
"If we were to rally 15 percent or 20 percent from here, that would negate some of the Fed's tightening pressure," Mr. Berner said.
Because of this threat to a successful slowdown, or soft landing, "most of us didn't expect him to be this market-friendly," Mr. Crandall said. "This was the surprise."
Mr. Greenspan also warned that a soft landing for the economy was not assured. But that message seemed to be drowned out yesterday by the market applause for Mr. Greenspan's unexpected optimism.
In the stock market, the Nasdaq index jumped 128.93 points, to 4,184.56, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.61, or 0.9 percent, to 1,495.57. The Dow rose 147.79, to 10,843.87. I.B.M., which had announced a 12 percent earnings gain, accounted for half the Dow's rise. I.B.M. rallied in after-hours trading on Wednesday, but that did not show up in the Dow until yesterday, when the stock rose $12.84, to $117.
In the bond market, prices were higher as yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 6 percent, from 6.15 percent on Wednesday, while the price rose 1 3/32, to 103 19/32. The yield on the 10-year note has been fighting to move back below 6 percent for five weeks. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.81 percent from 5.91 percent.
One significant monitor of concern about Fed rate increases did ease yesterday. The yield fell on the futures contracts on the federal funds rate, the central bank's short-term interest rate target, for August, October, November and December.
In his testimony on monetary policy, Mr. Greenspan pointed out several factors restraining consumer spending, including rising consumer debt, rising oil and gasoline prices and the flat performance of the stock market so far this year. And he said that this consumer slowdown, if it continued, might be enough to bring economic growth down to the noninflationary pace Fed officials want. That is somewhere around 3.5 percent, well below the 6 percent pace of last year's fourth quarter and this year's first.
"Should this favorable outcome prevail," he said, "the immediate threat to our prosperity from growing imbalances in our economy would abate."
But Mr. Greenspan also warned that it was too early to declare victory. "It is much too soon," he said, "to conclude that these concerns are behind us. We cannot yet be sure that slower expansion of domestic final demand, at a pace more in line with potential supply, will persist."
In past years, the economy has reaccelerated after slowing in the second quarter, a fact that Mr. Greenspan mentioned. The next key economic report is the Employment Cost Index, which measures worker compensation and is one of the Fed's favorite inflation barometers. It will be released Thursday.
The next several days ought to indicate if investors have become Fed-happy. The stock and bond markets have often responded nicely on the day some positive news is released, only to settle back after investors realize that they -- and the Fed -- still need to see more positive data before they know they are out of the woods. But if investors conclude too early that they are out of the woods, their optimism, and the rallies it creates, may put them back in again.

HEADLINE: The Fed Chief's Treatment;
Slower Growth, but Don't Rule Out Rate Increases

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today that there was not yet enough evidence to conclude that the economy had slowed to a noninflationary pace, and he left the door open to further interest rate increases as soon as next month.
In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan delivered an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand assessment of the economic outlook, noting clear signs of slowing in recent months but warning that growth could rebound and that inflation by some measures appeared to be creeping up. 
 Given the uncertainties, Mr. Greenspan said, it was "much too soon to conclude" that the threat of a destabilizing surge in prices and wages had receded. His remarks suggested that Fed officials would continue to focus on incoming economic data before deciding whether to raise short-term interest rates again at their next meeting, on Aug. 22.
Stressing that the economy was still characterized by a combination of steady growth, low unemployment and an expanding trade deficit, he said the Fed would "need to be alert to the risks that high levels of resource utilization may put upward pressure on inflation."
But even as he kept his options open, Mr. Greenspan indicated that he saw no need for a prolonged series of rate increases that might leave the economy flirting with recession. Asked if achieving price stability would require the Fed to drive the unemployment rate up toward 5 percent from its current level of 4 percent, Mr. Greenspan said he did not think so.
"I think the evidence indicating that we need to raise the unemployment rate to stabilize prices is unpersuasive," he said. He quickly added, however, that he was not sure and the issue was the subject of considerable debate among economists and Fed officials.
With much of the steam having gone out of Wall Street in the winter and spring, Mr. Greenspan hardly mentioned the stock market, which he had singled out early this year as a prime source of the imbalances in the economy that could lead to higher inflation.
Investors, perhaps being overoptimistic but apparently relieved that Mr. Greenspan had not explicitly called for higher interest rates, sent stock prices up. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 147.79 points for the day, to finish at 10,843.87. The Nasdaq composite index closed at 4,184.56, up 128.93.
"There was relief in the markets because he said nothing very severe in terms of future rate increases," said Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at National City Bank in Cleveland. "But in terms of what he actually said, he left his options completely open."
The central bank has raised its benchmark short-term interest rate by 1.75 percentage points, to 6.5 percent, in six steps the last year. After growing at a torrid pace earlier this year, the economy cooled off considerably, but the Fed has left the financial markets guessing whether the slowdown has been sufficient for it to declare an end to this cycle of interest rate increases.
If analysts and investors were hoping for a clear answer from Mr. Greenspan today, they were disappointed. Because his testimony was intended to reflect the thinking of the Fed's entire policy making committee, what they got instead was a glimpse at the debate within the central bank about the economy's path and how many more rate increases, if any, it would take to squelch the emerging inflationary pressures and assure the continuance of the long expansion.
Growth in general and consumer spending in particular have "slowed noticeably this spring from the unusually rapid pace observed late in 1999 and early this year," Mr. Greenspan said.
From one perspective, he said, it would be a mistake to put too much stock in the slowdown, since previous episodes of cooling during this business cycle have been followed by sharp accelerations in growth. But from another viewpoint, he said, there are bits of evidence that this slowdown could be longer-lasting.
The stock market is no longer rising at a rate that would lead consumers to spend freely. Households are burdened by rising debt levels. Higher oil prices are putting the brakes on the entire economy. And after buying homes, cars, refrigerators and other big-ticket items at a prodigious pace for the past several years, consumers could be expected to take a break.
Mr. Greenspan did not say which camp he puts himself in. But he said that the real question might prove to be what happens to the economy's improving efficiency if the slowdown proves to be real, and on that score he gave an optimistic assessment.
In the past, slowdowns in growth were often accompanied by a falloff in the growth rate of productivity, or output per hour of work. As productivity drops, inflation tends to rise, putting pressure on the Fed to continue raising rates.
But if productivity growth should remain strong as the economy slows, it would help keep inflation in check, giving the Fed more leeway to hold down rates. Mr. Greenspan said the evidence is that productivity is holding up well.
"So far there is little evidence to undermine the notion that most of the productivity increase of recent years has been structural and that structural productivity may still be accelerating," he said.
Mr. Greenspan appeared before the banking committee under an agreement that calls for the Fed to continue reporting twice a year to Congress on monetary policy despite the expiration of a legal requirement to do so.
The written report he submitted today forecast a slowdown in growth this year from the 5.4 percent annual pace of the first quarter, with gross domestic product for the year projected to run at 4 to 4.5 percent.
But the report also included a more pessimistic inflation forecast than that the Fed provided to Congress in its last report, in February. It projected that inflation this year would run at a 2.5 percent to 2.75 percent rate, compared with 1.75 percent to 2 percent under the old projection. Although the report said inflation would decline to 2 to 2.5 percent next year, it warned that at those projected levels inflation would have edged up from where it was in 1997 and 1998, when it was consistently under 2 percent.
"Such a trend, were it not to show signs of quickly stabilizing or reversing, would pose a considerable risk to the continuation of the extraordinary economic performance of recent years," the report said.
Fielding questions from senators, Mr. Greenspan repeated his call for Congress and the Clinton administration to use the federal budget surplus for debt reduction rather than for tax cuts or spending increases. The surplus, he said, provides an important buffer should the economy run into trouble.
Asked about the health of the banking system and its ability to weather a recession, Mr. Greenspan said the system could "resist fairly significant economic disruption without a major problem," although he said he was concerned that some banks have grown too lax in assessing credit risks.
The Fed chairman said he was concerned about the expansion of the trade and current account deficits. But he said the United States had not had any problem financing those deficits with investment from abroad because the country offered higher rates of return than anywhere else.
In response to a question, he criticized legislation sponsored by Senator Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, that would link China's access to American capital markets to the Chinese government's record on the spread of weapons and weapons technology.
In particular, he said, the legislation would be ineffective because capital markets essentially operate without borders and if Chinese companies were unable to raise money in New York, they would be able to borrow in dollars in London or Paris.

HEADLINE: Plywood Air Pollution Case Is Settled for $93.2 Million

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department announced today that a plywood manufacturer with 13 factories in four states had agreed to a $93.2 million settlement over air pollution violations, the largest settlement based on pollution from factories.
The accord means that the environmental agency has settled pollution cases in the last few years with companies that make up more than half the wood products industry. In a sector-by-sector campaign to enforce the terms of the Clean Air Act, the agency has also reached agreements with diesel engine manufacturers, but it is still battling with refineries and with coal-burning power plants. 
 The settlement with Willamette Industries Inc., a plywood and building materials manufacturer based in Portland, Ore., with plants in Arkansas, Louisiana and South Carolina as well, follows settlements with Louisiana-Pacific, Georgia-Pacific and Weyerhaeuser; the government is still pursuing Boise-Cascade.
In addition to a civil penalty of $11.2 million, Willamette will spend $8 million on environmental projects, and $74 million on new pollution-control equipment, government officials said. Carol M. Browner, the E.P.A. administrator, said that the company had saved money for years by not installing equipment to reduce emissions but that with the settlement, "the economic benefit has been captured in the penalty, and then some."
In a statement, Duane McDougall, the company's chief executive officer, said the company had reached the agreement "to resolve certain historic air permit questions." Willamette will install emission control equipment that is "well beyond what is required," he said.
The E.P.A. says factories that emit pollutants into the air must have permits to make changes in the plants. Ms. Browner said, "These guys didn't even say they needed a permit." Mr. McDougall said that Willamette had consulted with state authorities as it made changes to its factories over the years and had been told that no permits were required but that the environmental agency had "revisited these decisions based on a revised interpretation of long-established standards and practices."
The company's defense is similar to the one still being raised by electric utilities companies that the agency last year accused of not seeking permits for changes they had made to their plants.
Willamette makes plywood and composite panels. The adhesives used to bond sheets of plywood together, or form composites, give off pollutants, volatile organic compounds, that react with nitrogen compounds in sunlight to form smog.
Under the settlement, the company will install equipment to reduce emissions of the compounds, as well as cut emissions of small particles and carbon monoxide. The company will spend money to improve municipal sewer systems, acquire parkland and build ethanol fueling stations to encourage companies that own fleets of vehicles to use clean fuel.

HEADLINE: Plans to Build Paper Recycler In South Bronx Are Called Off

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO 

 BODY:
From the time the Bronx Community Paper Company was conceived, the paper-recycling venture was viewed as a model of urban manufacturing: an environmentally friendly company that would employ 400 full-time workers and create $200 million a year in revenues in a neighborhood hungry for an economic lift.
After six years of increasingly costly construction estimates, the recycling plant, which would have provided newsprint to the city's newspapers, is now dead, said its developer, Morse Diesel International. 
 "I think we originally were pretty excited about doing a project of this magnitude in New York City, with such a strong publisher base and the close availability of fiber," James MacDonald, development director for the Manhattan company, said yesterday in an interview. But he added, "We had to accept reality, that it couldn't be done in the current market and in the current market conditions."
The news was no surprise to Bronx leaders, who for years had seen plans for the plant falter because of the developer's inability to secure economical financing for the project on 22 acres of the Harlem River Rail Yards on the borough's southern tip. The construction would have cost $400 million, but interest and other costs would have raised the bill to $700 million, company officials said.
The plan, formed by a leading environmental group and the Banana Kelly community development group, also had detractors: some local churches and businesses charged it would increase air pollution.
Morse Diesel and Harlem River Yard Ventures, which manages the 96-acre rail yard for the Galesi Group, the leaseholder on the property, blamed rising interest rates for the project's downfall.
"You're talking about a financing feat that was difficult at best, and the way the bond market was turning it just wasn't feasible," said Anthony Riccio, senior vice president for Harlem River Yard Ventures.
Charles E. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, which had been working with the New York City Economic Development Corporation to provide $300 million in tax-exempt bonds for the project, said company officials also told him this week that a volatile paper market played a role in the decision to kill the plant.
The paper mill was to have been part of what has been promoted as one of the largest industrial projects in New York City in decades, the redevelopment of a once-bustling rail yard abandoned after 1971.
In 1990, Francesco Galesi won a 99-year, tax-free lease from the State Department of Transportation andset out to develop the plot near the Triborough Bridge. Today, a plant to house new presses for The New York Post is being built, and a waste transfer station and a two-mile long rail link are operating.
"The paper mill has sort of been on the railroad tracks for a long time; I guess it couldn't dodge the train this time," said the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer. "This would have been a really good fit, but it was not to be, and it was not to be for a whole host of reasons, not because of someone's intention or actions."

An empty wreck of a building since the late 1980's, the Clermont Armory in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, has sprung back to life over the last 15 months as a rental apartment complex for middle-income tenants.
When the $14 million rehabilitation project that officials call "adaptive reuse" is completed by September, the 127-year-old former armory at 171 Clermont Avenue, among the oldest in the state, will have 110 studio to three-bedroom units. They will be in two five-story wings atop a one-story base created behind the facades of the original armory and overlooking an interior courtyard. 
 There will be 11,000 square feet of ground-floor commercial space, which has been leased to the Community Partnership Charter School, as well as parking for 113 cars on the ground and basement levels of the huge structure, which stretches from Clermont Avenue through to Vanderbilt Avenue between Myrtle and Willoughby Avenues.
The apartments, averaging 507 to 1,208 square feet, some with balconies, are being leased to people with annual incomes of $30,000 to $80,000, depending on family size, at rents of $850 to $1,750 a month. The project is being developed by a partnership between Hesky Brahimy and his brother, Samy, who are principals of the IBEC Building Corporation, and John Frezza, president of the Strategic Development and Construction Corporation. Both companies are based in Brooklyn, as is the project's architect, Robert Scarano & Associates.
The Clermont Armory project is part of New York City's New Opportunities Program, sponsored by the city's Housing Development Corporation. Under it, the housing corporation provides developers with mortgages at favorable interest rates to help spur construction of middle-income housing.
Since the program began in 1998, 27 projects with 1,900 residences have been or are being created. Eight are in Brooklyn and many, like the Clermont Armory project, are bringing new uses to abandoned buildings. Others include a 100-year-old former furniture warehouse at 139 Emerson Place in Clinton Hill that has been transformed into 50 rental apartments, and an 1840 hat factory at 597 Grand Avenue in Prospect Heights that has been reshaped into 52 rentals.
"The beauty of such projects," said Russell A. Harding, president of the city's development corporation, "is that they not only help re-establish places like Clinton Hill, Fort Greene and Prospect Heights as attractive, affordable places for working families to live, but preserve some special buildings in the process." He said 10 more projects with 600 units were expected to receive financing by the end of the year.
Vivian Becker, executive director of the Pratt Area Community Council, a nonprofit community development group in Fort Greene, described the old armory as "a very visible and blighted building" and its renovation as "a long overdue project, which we support."
The developers of the armory project received a $10.34 million first loan with an interest rate of 7.5 percent from the city housing corporation, as well as a $2.2 million second loan with a 1 percent rate, "which made the project financially feasible," Mr. Frezza said. The partners also invested $1.7 million of their own money, and the European American Bank guaranteed the $12 million construction loan.
The armory was built in 1872 to house the 23rd Regiment of the National Guard, and its 130-by-180-foot drill hall, with its barrel-shaped ceiling, was then the largest built without pillars or obstructions in the United States, according to the State Office of Military History. It was extensively reconstructed in 1911, though the drill hall was not affected.
The building functioned as an armory through 1964, when it was taken over by the city, which used it as a warehouse until 1986. After that, the old armory sat dormant, becoming the target of vandals, who stripped it of, among other items, its copper roof gutters and drains, leaving it vulnerable to damage from rain.
When the developers bought the building for $300,000 at a city auction in 1995, it had gaping holes in its roof and boarded-over windows.
The next challenge, said Robert Scarano, the architect, "was to come up with a scheme that was sympathetic to the existing structure." Original details of the existing facade were incorporated into the design, he added.
That included retaining the outline of the building's Clermont Avenue pediment, which frames a Romanesque arch lined with mullions, to form a front atrium that leads to an open-air garden and then to the main entrance. The original gray masonry facades facing Clermont and Vanderbilt Avenues remain, though parts have been covered with yellow- or buff-colored stucco, and red accents have been added for contrast. Three of the wrought iron trusses that spanned the old drill hall were left exposed to the sky.
Inside, Mr. Scarano said, the building was gutted and reshaped into apartments. Apartments in the two wings have ceilings just over nine feet high, and features like hardwood floors and dishwashers. The building, with initial occupancy to begin next month, will have a 24-hour doorman.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Commercials By Bush Camp Go on the Air In 4 Key States

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
Concentrating on four states that political strategists say could tip the electoral balance this fall, the Bush campaign yesterday began running its first major television commercials of the general election, a kind of sunny prologue to the Republican convention that begins in 10 days.
The three commercials, produced by the campaign's own advertising agency, Maverick Media, went on the air in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and Washington State in what Ari Fleischer, a campaign spokesman, described as a "multimillion-dollar ad buy." Bush officials would not say how long the commercials would run, or whether more states might be added. 
 But the choice of television markets was an instant subject for dissection by Gore campaign officials, who pointed to the inclusion of Florida as a sign that some crucial states which might normally be safely in the Republican column were viewed by the Bush campaign as in need of some media triage. Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, being the brother of the presumptive nominee, gave them additional fodder.
"I think that documents the fact that Florida is really in play," said Chris Lehane, the Gore campaign press secretary. "Right now, it's a virtual dead heat."
Though Florida's 25 electoral votes went for the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1996, over the past three decades the state voted more typically for Republican presidential candidates. Republicans hold the majority in the state's Congressional delegation, and Florida is the first former Confederate state to have a legislature under Republican control.
Tony Welch, a spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party, said newspapers in the state had put the television advertising investment by the Bush campaign and the Republican National Committee at about $1 million. "You don't spend a million dollars in a safe state," Mr. Welch said.
Aides to Vice President Al Gore would not say whether the campaign would respond rapidly with commercials of its own. Up to now, spots featuring the presumptive nominees have been run exclusively by the Democratic and Republican national committees; the Democrats alone are expected to have spent about $25 million by the time they open their convention in Los Angeles next month.
Mr. Fleischer said that the 30-second spots were designed to reinforce presidential qualities of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. "The theme running through the ads is leadership. Now is the time in American history we can exercise bold leadership willing to unite America."
Indeed, the commercials concede a point that Mr. Gore has made a cornerstone of his campaign this summer, that the country is enjoying an unparalleled era of prosperity. The Bush campaign argues in the advertisements that the national economic upswing should be the foundation for a shift to Republican leadership committed to solving complicated problems like how to shore up Social Security and raise standards in schools.
In one spot, titled "Hard Things," Mr. Bush looks into the camera and says, "This is a moment in history when we have a chance to focus on tough problems. It's not always popular to say, 'Our children can't read, or Social Security needs improving, or we have a budget surplus and a deficit of values.' But those are the right things to say."
Another characterizes the election as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity "to do something good with it all." Echoing the declared themes of the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, it asks, "Shouldn't the president unite, not divide, and renew America's purpose?"
The warmest and fuzziest of the spots features close-ups of a newborn's foot and a montage of ordinary people in what the commercial makers call "found" moments. Over footage shot this month in the New York area, a narrator declares, "a lot of new Americans arrived today. They were neither Republican nor Democrat. But someone held them close and hoped. Be healthy. Learn a lot. It takes leadership to give everyone a shot at the American dream."
While political spots are sometimes tested with focus groups before being put on the air, these were not, said a Bush adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity. But in market surveys of voters, the adviser said, "consistently, for some reason, Bush scores overwhelmingly higher than Gore on the question of strong leadership."
Greg Stevens, who made the commercials for Senator John McCain of Arizona during the primaries, said the Bush campaign's selection of states for the media buy was "probably smart," in that "if they can block him in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington, Gore can't win."

HEADLINE: Mrs. Clinton Attacks Lazio Over Position On Loan Limit

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Suggesting that her opponent cared more about wealthy campaign donors than about constituents, Hillary Rodham Clinton attacked Representative Rick A. Lazio yesterday for trying to kill legislation in 1998 to expand a program that helps first-time home buyers obtain mortgages.
Mrs. Clinton questioned why Mr. Lazio had objected to the legislation, since it was intended to benefit people in more expensive areas, including Mr. Lazio's district on Long Island, by raising the limit on the size of mortgages guaranteed by the federal government. The program, run by the Federal Housing Administration, assists first-time home buyers or those with shaky credit. 
 Mr. Lazio had vigorously fought the legislation, saying that it was an unacceptable intrusion by government into private industry. The program competes with private mortgage insurance companies, which charge fees to guarantee mortgages.
Mr. Lazio and a few other senior Republicans were able to scale back the measure before it passed. Less than a month later, Mr. Lazio collected a total of $23,500 in contributions from six of the nation's largest private mortgage insurance companies. The Lazio campaign said recently that the donations were not related to the fight over the loan limit.
In an interview, Mrs. Clinton maintained that Mr. Lazio had betrayed his constituents by opposing a higher loan limit, and said that she would have championed the proposal. "His opposition meant that if he had prevailed, fewer people in Long Island and in the rest of New York would have been able to afford a home."
Asked about the donations to Mr. Lazio, which were reported in The New York Times yesterday, she said, "We are going to have to let New Yorkers reach their own conclusions about what that means."
Bryan Flood, a spokesman for the Lazio campaign, disparaged Mrs. Clinton's comments. "No one has done more for affordable housing in New York than Rick Lazio as chairman of the subcommittee on housing," Mr. Flood said. "He authored and led the fight for a number of landmark public housing and affordable housing bills. He has an outstanding record. The real question is, where has Hillary Clinton been and what has she done for homeownership in New York?"
The jousting over Mr. Lazio's record came as both campaigns continued to feud over the contents of fund-raising solicitations.
A new letter signed by the chairman of the Republican State Committee, William Powers, says Mrs. Clinton is an "ambitious, ruthless, scheming, calculating, manipulating woman," and later refers to her as an "angry woman whose political views are so far to the left, she has left common sense behind."
"She's been at the front and center of every Clinton-Gore scandal and this has been the most seedy, shameless and corrupt administration in American history," says the letter, first disclosed yesterday by The Associated Press. Mr. Powers also refers to Mrs. Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, noting that Mrs. Clinton did not send Chelsea to school in New York.
It was the second strongly worded letter from the state party attacking Mrs. Clinton to surface this month.
Mrs. Clinton has been a powerful lure in fund-raising letters, with Republicans across the nation invoking her name in an effort to generate money from people who dislike her. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Lazio's predecessor as Senate candidate, set a fund-raising record in part by tapping into this sentiment.
At a news conference in Albany, Mr. Powers said the language in the letter was not anti-woman, and was an accurate portrayal of Mrs. Clinton's character. He said he was not concerned that the letter would backfire. "I've never seen a response to direct mail like we're getting from her," Mr. Powers said.
Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, attacked the letter. "While Rick Lazio smiles for the cameras in public, his Republican allies quietly send out insult-filled letters behind closed doors," Mr. Wolfson said in a statement. "It's time for the hypocrisy to stop. These negative letters signal that Rick Lazio and the G.O.P. have no intention of running a campaign on the issues."
After Mr. Giuliani withdrew from the Senate race in May, saying he needed to concentrate on treatment of his prostate cancer, he pledged to help Mr. Lazio. The Giuliani campaign now says it has returned about $3 million to donors, with instructions to make it easy for them to send the money to Mr. Lazio. It is not clear how many have heeded the request.
Bruce J. Teitelbaum, a senior political adviser to Mr. Giuliani, said the campaign had $3.8 million left and added that Giuliani advisers would be meeting with senior state Republicans in the coming weeks to determine how Mr. Giuliani could use his political operation to help Mr. Lazio and other Republicans.

HEADLINE: Africans Fault Rich Nations On Aid to the World's Poor

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 20

 BODY:
With leaders of the world's industrialized countries gathering in Japan for their annual meeting, a handful of major third world nations took center stage today and lambasted the richest nations on behalf of the world's poor.
At a news conference in Tokyo on the eve of the Group of 8 summit meeting, which is being held in Japan's southern island of Okinawa, leaders of South Africa, Nigeria and Algeria -- three of Africa's largest countries -- said the major powers had been too slow to act on debt relief and other issues vital to economic growth in the third world. 
 "It is no longer a question of what we should do," said Nigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo, after he and the third world leaders met with the industrialized leaders. "We all know what we should do. The question is do we have the political will."
The news conference was sponsored by Jubilee 2000, a coalition of charities calling for debt relief for the poor. Mr. Obasanjo is head of a so-called Group of 77, a political coalition of underdeveloped countries, and is also head of the movement of nonaligned nations.
The comments by Mr. Obasanjo, and similarly spirited remarks made by Presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria, were among the few flickers of controversy in a minutely planned diplomatic ballet as delegations from the leading industrial nations -- the United States, Japan, Britain, Italy, Canada, France, Germany -- joined delegates from Russia.
Mr. Obasanjo and his African peers accused the industrialized powers of selfish shortsightedness in their dealings with the third world, where demands to repay heavy debts prevent the poor nations from spending money on vital services like health care and education.
The anger of the third world presidents was underscored by reports that the industrialized nations would speed debt relief for Russia during the three-day meeting in Okinawa.
Mr. Mbeki said that in addition to debt issues, representatives of rich and poor nations had discussed increasing foreign direct investment in Africa, Africa's access to foreign markets, and the transfer of information technology and biotechnology to Africa, among other things. "It is a range of things that are interrelated, and it is important that the G-8, when they address these questions, address all of these questions," he said.
The African leaders were not met separately by the Japanese prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, as they had requested. But Mr. Mori did preside over a meeting between them and leading officials of the industrialized nations, and included them in a dinner tonight.
The third world leaders also met with executives of several international technology giants, including Sony and Cisco.
After the talks, Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, standing in for President Clinton, who was arriving late because of the Israeli-Palestinian talks at Camp David, Md., said significant ground had been covered by the two sides. Among the proposals agreed upon were the expansion of debt relief programs beyond the poorest, most heavily indebted countries that had been eligible. They also agreed that the next round of World Trade Organization talks would be devoted to the problems of poor countries.
Sounding a somewhat skeptical note, Mr. Mbeki said the third world must await the outcome of the summit meetings before gauging how determined the rich nations are to provide more meaningful assistance on the problems of poverty and disease. "The question of what they will say, that can only come at the end of the Okinawa meeting," he said.
At their last summit meetings last year, the world's richest nations announced with great fanfare a $100 billion debt relief package for 40 of the world's poorest countries. But almost none of the money called for has been disbursed.
The Clinton administration narrowly averted embarrassment over this issue when the House of Representatives voted only last week to finance Mr. Clinton's request for Washington's $262 million share in providing debt relief.
Again this year, the industrialized nations are promising a number of major initiatives at their summit meeting, and the plans are as sweeping as they have ever been. The meeting itself has been billed as the "information summit," and has set as one of its goals reducing the so-called digital divide -- access to the Internet and other information technology -- between rich and poor countries.
Toward this end, Japan has pledged to donate $15 billion during the next five years to poor countries to help them spread Internet access and develop information technologies.
Major goals have also been announced in health care. The industrialized leaders have reportedly agreed on setting a target of 25 percent for reducing AIDS infection among 15- to 24-year-olds in the third world by the year 2010.
Of all the people who carry the virus that causes AIDS, 70 percent of them live in Africa.
Here again, Japan has pledged large sums of money -- $3 billion -- to battle AIDS and tropical diseases like malaria in the developing world.
This week, Washington, too, announced an AIDS initiative for 24 African countries, which will provide them with $1 billion in loans annually to pay for medicine and other treatment to fight AIDS.

HEADLINE: Sun-Drenched Okinawa Is an Uneasy Place to Meet

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: NAGO, Japan, Friday, July 21

 BODY:
Of the many locations Japan considered for the annual summit meeting of the world's leading industrialized nations, this resort town in the country's southernmost island, Okinawa, seemed a most dubious choice.
Okinawa, a backwater province plagued by a tragic past, lacked the infrastructure and know-how needed to mount an international event of such magnitude. Relations between Tokyo and the former island kingdom have never been good, and the islanders have long demanded the removal of the vast American military bases that constrict their lives. 
 In the past, meetings of the leading industrial nations in Japan have been held in Tokyo. But the late Prime Minister Keichi Obuchi, who died of a stroke in May, insisted on staging this meeting here, hoping to bolster Okinawa's weak economy and make some amends for decades of abuse and neglect by Japan and the United States.
With the Group of 8 meeting opening today, many Japanese and American officials are regretting Mr. Obuchi's well-intentioned choice and fretting about the potential for mishap and mayhem in what is ostensibly a sun-drenched paradise.
"I guess you can say that we are all on pins and needles," said a Japanese official. "Although we feel ready for the summit, there is a sinking feeling in our stomachs that it will either go off without a hitch or there could be great chaos."
To the unknowing eye, Okinawa is a haven: a subtropical slice of striking beauty, rich in coral reefs, lush forests, pristine beaches and blue-green waters.
But trouble lurks not far beneath this shimmering surface. The recent arrest of a United States marine accused of molesting a sleeping Okinawan schoolgirl has heightened outrage among islanders who have vowed to disrupt the summit meeting with massive demonstrations. Today, about 27,000 angry people formed a human chain around United States' Kadena Air Base to protest the presence of American troops on the island -- a major embarrassment to the decorous host nation.
President Clinton is the first American president to visit Okinawa since it reverted back to Japan from the United States military in 1972. Later today, the president is scheduled to make a major speech at the peace monument on this island, which at the end of World War II was the scene of fierce fighting between the United States and Japanese troops in which nearly one-third of Okinawa's population was killed.
Japanese security forces, which have deployed 22,000 officers from across the country to Okinawa, are bracing for a possible repeat of the violence that erupted during international trade meetings in the United States in the past year.
And the meeting's organizers have expressed fear that Okinawa, Japan's poorest and least-developed prefecture, cannot handle the thousands of foreigners who are expected to attend the conference. Forecasts of nightmare traffic, power and telephone failures, overbooked hotels, and seasonal typhoons abound.
Before Japan annexed Okinawa in the early 1600's, the island was the seat of the Ryukyu Kingdom, which was closely linked to China and had diplomatic and trade ties with Korea and Southeast Asia. Because of their multicultural links, Okinawans have their own art forms, dialect, cuisine and way of life that are distinct from the homogeneous rest of Japan.
"It's the door to Asia for Japan," said Ryu Yamazaki, the Foreign Ministry spokesman. "We wanted to introduce the world to this unique culture which is part of Japan."
The islands, which have a population of 1.2 million, are home to about half of the 45,000 United States military personnel in Japan. Okinawans maintain that they bear an unfair burden because their island, which is less than 1 percent of Japan's total area, contains 75 percent of the United States military facilities in the country.
The island also has its share of social problems. Okinawa's unemployment rate is twice the national average. It has Japan's lowest household savings rate and lowest per-capita income, and highest teenage pregnancy and divorce rates.
One reason to bring the meeting here was to persuade islanders to accept a much-disputed plan to construct a new United States Marine Corps helicopter base off the coast of Nago. The new heliport will replace the Futenma Air Base, which is set to be returned to Japan.
While Okinawans welcomed the closing of the old air station, which was a major nuisance to local residents, they adamantly oppose a new American military base. But the allure of acting as host to the summit meeting, with its economic benefits, proved sufficient to help persuade local Okinawan officials to accept the relocation plan.
"One cannot deny the political benefits of putting the summit in Okinawa," said Yukio Okamoto, a former Foreign Ministry official who served as an adviser to past Japanese governments on the Okinawa issue.
"However, the main reason was to bring a new era of thinking to the Okinawa mentality," Mr. Okamoto said. "Okinawa has been shackled by past history and unable to move forward like the rest of Japan. Mr. Obuchi thought the summit would be a very important turning point in the island's history."
Many Okinawans have mixed feelings: They are delighted that the conference will focus worldwide attention on them and their culture, but are worried that the meeting will be seen as a quick fix for their longstanding problems.
Although the islanders' dislike of the American bases is clear, many expressed great pride that the three-day conference has come to town.
"After the summit Okinawa will no longer be a question on 'Jeopardy,' " said Noriko Takada, a convenience store clerk. "The world will know us."
Across the island, government offices, businesses, private homes and taxi cabs are displaying the flags of the eight nations attending the meeting. The central government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to construct new conference halls, widen roads, refurbish parks and install new telephone lines.
"It's a great thing for world leaders to come here and learn about the Okinawan reality," said Yashikazu Tamaki, an Okinawan assemblyman. "It's good for Okinawan children because it will give them a sense of pride and encouragement."
"But I am worried that leaders like President Clinton will come to Okinawa and make a speech thanking Okinawans for accepting the military bases," Mr. Tamaki said. "That would be like rubbing salt into the wounds of Okinawans, because the reality is, we don't want the bases."

HEADLINE: Clinton Tries to Ease Anger At U.S. Troops in Okinawa

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: ITOMAN, Japan, Friday, July 21

 BODY:
President Clinton jumped from one delicate diplomatic matter to several other ones today as he arrived for an economic meeting of world leaders and immediately tried to make amends to residents of Okinawa fed up with the heavy American military presence on the island.
"We will continue to do what we can to reduce our footprint on this island," Mr. Clinton said this morning at a seaside memorial devoted to the more than 200,000 Japanese, Americans and others who died in 1945 during the fierce fighting of the Battle of Okinawa. "We take seriously our responsibility to be good neighbors, and it is unacceptable to the United States when we do not meet the responsibility." 
 Before flying here, Mr. Clinton left the Middle East peace talks unfinished back in Washington and aides signaled on his arrival that he was eager to return to Camp David. They said he might scale back his three-day trip here, for the annual meeting of the Group of 8.
All the same, Mr. Clinton tried to reassure the Japanese, who have poured money and attention into the summit meeting, that it was an important gathering that merited his 14-hour trip. Mr. Clinton is to join the leaders of Japan, Italy, Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Russia for a series of closed-door meetings.
Mr. Clinton's visit was the first for an American president to this sliver of land since the United States returned Okinawa to Japan in 1972. Mr. Clinton arrived during a particular rocky time in relations between Okinawans and the approximately 26,000 American troops stationed in their midst.
Okinawans, who lived under United States occupation for 27 years, have long complained that that they suffer from the heavy military presence. There are 37 United States military facilities in Okinawa, representing all the services and taking up tens of thousands of acres. Recent incidents involving wayward soldiers have added to local fury.
Mr. Clinton pointed out that the United States has begun consolidating bases on Okinawa, a process that residents complain has been far too slow. The president also emphasized the role Okinawa has played in ensuring stability in the region.
"I know that the people of Okinawa did not ask to play this role, hosting more than 50 percent of American forces in Japan on less than one percent of its land mass," Mr. Clinton said.
But some Okinawans said the president did not go far enough in his speech. "He didn't say anything concrete," complained Ryo Tengan, 28, a civil servant who was hoping for a presidential announcement of an immediate reduction in troops.
Zenko Nakamura, 53, an activist who is fighting the relocation of an American Marine base, said, "I'm disappointed that the president didn't mention what Okinawans care most about -- sexual crimes committed by American servicemen."
In advance of the summit meeting, the United States military banned its personnel from drinking alcohol or leaving their bases after midnight, a curfew that followed a hit-and-run accident involving a staff sergeant stationed at the Kadena Air Base.
Before that, the highest-ranking United States military official in Okinawa issued an apology after a marine was arrested on charges of entering a house and molesting a 14-year-old girl who was sleeping there.
Mr. Clinton's visit was reminiscent of an earlier stop by another American president almost four decades ago. While the island was still under United States control, President Dwight D. Eisenhower stopped briefly in Okinawa on June 19, 1960, during a tour of Asia and faced the same anger displayed for Mr. Clinton.
Huge crowds of locals turned out to see Mr. Eisenhower, and 1,500 of them began a snake dance to protest the presence of American troops and the failure to return the island to Japanese control.
Mr. Eisenhower ignored the demonstrations in his remarks, calling the American presence a "splendid example of the mutual benefits that result when people of good will work toward the common goal of peace and friendship in freedom."
Mr. Clinton spoke this morning from Cornerstone of Peace Park, a memorial to the soldiers and civilians of Japanese, American and Okinawan ancestry who died here.
Carved into a granite wall on a seaside bluff, which Mr. Clinton toured with the governor of Okinawa, Keichi Inamine, were the names of 234,183 victims.
"The Battle of Okinawa was warfare at its most tragic," Mr. Clinton said. "This monument built in its memory is humanity at its most inspired. For here, no grief goes unrecognized. While most monuments remember only those who have fallen from one side, this memorial recognizes those from all sides, and those who took no side."

George J. Borjas (Op-Ed, July 18) writes that Mexican workers should have only limited access to the United States labor market. 
 Why is it that a worker who was born in Nogales, Sonora, is a less deserving human being than her cousin who had the good fortune to have been born just across the border in Nogales, Ariz.?
Our own ancestors were mostly economic refugees whose arrival undoubtedly beat down the wages of the preceding waves of unskilled workers. Why do today's "huddled masses" merit any less opportunity?

HEADLINE: Many TV Stations Reject Police Union Ad

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

 BODY:
With a week of negotiations left before its contract with the city expires, the police union is stepping up its campaign for higher wages with a television advertisement depicting a fallen, bleeding officer that some stations have rejected as too graphic.
A similarly explicit advertising campaign for subway cars initially was rejected, but the union toned down the image, removing a puddle of blood beside the officer, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority might accept the ads, union officials said. 
 The 30-second television advertisement, a montage of images that the union says is meant to convey "what cops have to put up with," includes videotape of unruly crowds at the funeral of Patrick M. Dorismond, an unarmed man killed by narcotics officers in March.
It ends with the sound of a gunshot and a staged scene of an officer lying on a sidewalk next to a patrol car's open door and a pool of blood.
The advertisement is a departure from typical labor union ads, which glorify the work of union members. In the ad by the police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the union's president, Patrick J. Lynch, declares: "Most people wouldn't take this job for a million bucks. A New York City police officer does it for a helluva lot less."
The television ads are scheduled to be shown starting Monday on New York 1 and UPN's New York affiliate, WWOR, Channel 9, but they have been rejected by most other local stations, including WABC, WCBS, WNBC, WPIX and MSG, a local cable channel that focuses on sporting events, the union said. Most of the stations cited the graphic image of the bleeding officer, said Joseph Mancini, a union spokesman who also produced the ads.
Earlier versions of the advertisement also included videotape of the Rev. Al Sharpton, a frequent critic of the police, at a protest after the acquittal of four officers in the shooting of Amadou Diallo, and some stations had cited the juxtaposition of Mr. Sharpton and the image of the officer in turning down the ad, Mr. Mancini said. Some of the stations have said that they might accept a less explicit ad, without the blood, and with some other modifications, and Mr. Mancini said yesterday he was working on several versions.
A spokeswoman for WNBC said the station had relayed its concerns about the commercial to the union but had not heard back. The other television stations that the union said had declined to run the advertisement did not return calls seeking comment or had no comment. Several employees at TDI Incorporated, the company that reviews advertisements for placement in the subway, said yesterday that no one was available to discuss its dealings with the police union.
While the advertisements do not directly address the salary issue, they are all about money, union officials said. The union has long complained that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has failed to give officers a meaningful raise, despite record declines in reported crime, which the union says were won largely through the efforts of its members.
In their current five-year contract, which expires on July 31, the union's 27,000 members received no increase for the first two years, and then 3 percent for two years and 6 percent for the final year.
The union presented their demands to the city's Office of Collective Bargaining in May, and the city responded on Wednesday. Mr. Lynch, the union president, said more talks with the city were likely to be scheduled for next week, and he said he was confident that an agreement could be reached.
"At this point, of course, the city is crying poverty, and it's their job to do that," he said. But noting a large surplus in the city budget, he added, "That money is in the city's coffers because of work New York City police officers did making this a safer city." All the officers are asking is their fair share, he said.
He said the advertisements were designed to show the public what officers face in what he called an "anti-police atmosphere."
"What we're doing is trying to put a face on a New York City cop and get the public to understand the difficulties that cops face every day and the reality that death is involved in this job, that police officers take that risk and new police officers take that risk for $350 a week" in take-home pay, Mr. Lynch said.
Terrence Moran, a professor who teaches the history and sociology of propaganda at New York University, called the images "very, very vivid and very graphic," and said the reluctance of some stations to run the ads was a testament to their power. "What they have done is taken what is largely an economic issue, an issue about money, and made it tremendously emotional," he said.
He also noted that, aside from the widely publicized death this week of a police officer in a high-speed chase, most recent news articles about the police had focused on officers shooting at suspects, rather than the other way around. "This would also seem designed to take some pressure off the police because they are doing most of the shooting," he said. "And what it does is try to get to that emotional loyalty of the citizen so that they won't be outraged by whatever raise they do get."
Union officials said the advertisements were also meant to show the rank and file that the leadership was working for them. The ads follow recent radio and newspaper advertisements, and Mr. Mancini said the union expected to spend about $800,000 for all of the ads.

NEW YORK
 
MANHATTAN: ACQUITTAL IN DIVORCE CASE
A Manhattan lawyer was acquitted yesterday of charges that he bribed a court clerk to alter paperwork relating to a divorce and to speed the case through the judicial system. The lawyer, Dean Emmanuelli, had been indicted on 38 counts of bribery and charged with paying a clerk $40 for each of 37 divorce applications handled last year. Another lawyer accused of offering bribes pleaded guilty last year, as did the supervising clerk for matrimonial cases in Manhattan State Supreme Court who was accused of accepting bribes.

MANHATTAN: ARCHBISHOP HAS SURGERY
Archbishop Edward M. Egan, head of New York's Roman Catholic Archdiocese, underwent surgery yesterday to mend torn cartilage in his left knee. The 90-minute operation, performed at Saint Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, Conn., was a success, said Joseph Zwilling, spokesman for the archdiocese. The archbishop, 68, had had knee trouble since last fall, Mr. Zwilling said. (AP)
 
ALBANY: NEW STATE TOURISM PROMOTION ENACTED
To improve promotion of tourist attractions in New York State, a new law permits county tourist agencies to use state money in joint advertising programs with neighboring states and Canadian provinces. Previously, county tourist promotion agencies could seek matching funds from the state's Department of Economic Development only for promotions in New York State. The new law, Gov. George E. Pataki said on Wednesday, will enable counties that share attractions with neighboring states and Canada, like Niagara Falls, to "take advantage of joint opportunities to promote these sites." Joseph P. Fried (NYT)
 
MANHATTAN: COMPLAINTS ABOUT RATS
The city's week-old rat-complaint hot line has received more than 470 calls, mostly from Harlem, the Upper East Side and the Lower East Side of Manhattan, C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, said yesterday. The complaints go to the city's Department of Health. Ms. Fields urged Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to exclude the Department of Health's Pest Control Division from a new hiring freeze. Eun Lee Koh (NYT)
 
UTICA: MAYORAL ELECTION ORDERED
A special election must be held this fall to determine who will succeed Mayor Edward Hanna, a State Supreme Court justice ruled in a decision released Wednesday. Mr. Hanna quit on July 3, citing health reasons and amid allegations of sexual harassment. He named Timothy Julian, the Common Council president, to serve the remaining 3 1/2 years of his term. Mr. Julian said the city would appeal the judge's decision. (AP)
 
NIAGARA FALLS: LOOKOUT TOWER REVAMPED
The state will lop 60 feet from the top of the Prospect Point observation tower overlooking Niagara Falls because Gov. George E. Pataki called the tower "hideous." The State Parks commissioner, Bernadette Castro, announced a $23 million plan on Wednesday to shorten the 280-foot structure and replace the two original elevators with four that are faster. (AP)
 
CONNECTICUT
 
EAST HAVEN: SHOOTINGS AT CONCERT
An elderly man shot his estranged wife then turned the gun on himself last night in front of a crowd that had gathered for a concert on the town green, the police said. The police said the woman was seated in a lawn chair when the man walked up behind her and shot her in the head, then walked a short distance away and shot himself in the head. The gunman, who appeared to be in his 70's, died at the scene, and his victim was in critical condition at a local hospital, said Leonard Gallo, the police chief. The names of the couple were not released. (AP)
 
NEW LONDON: TROOPER SHOOTING
Lawyers for a man accused of the attempted murder of a state trooper asked a judge to dismiss a charge that carries the possibility of the death penalty. The lawyers for the man, Van Schrvyer, 18, argued that the charge of criminal attempt to commit capital felony should not apply because the trooper he shot at did not die. Under Connecticut law, capital felony charges can be filed in the murder of a police officer, murder during the commission of another felony or the killing of two or more people at the same time. Theresa Crapanzano (NYT)
 
HARTFORD: END TO PROBATION SOUGHT
Dawn March, a woman who spent time in a mental hospital instead of prison for the drowning death of her baby, has asked to be released from probation. In what became a landmark case, Ms. March, who threw her daughter into the Housatonic River in 1989, was acquitted when a judge recognized postpartum psychosis as a defense for her actions. The state's Psychiatric Security Review Board is to meet in September to report to a judge who will decide whether to grant Ms. March's petition. Theresa Crapanzano (NYT)
 
NEW JERSEY
 
NEWARK: JETS PASS TOO CLOSE
A Continental Airlines jet taking off from Newark International Airport Wednesday morning flew within 500 feet of an American Trans- Air jet on the ground, prompting an investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration. An air traffic controller was suspended for failing to order the TransAir jet to stop after it landed. Steve Strunsky (NYT)
 
TRENTON: PRINCETON SMOKING BAN
A local judge yesterday temporarily blocked a ban on smoking in Princeton Borough and Township. The ban, enacted but not yet in effect, prohibits smoking in all public accommodations, including bars and restaurants. Three borough restaurants and bars, along with the National Smokers Alliance, sued to block the ban. Kushanava Choudhury (NYT)
 
TRENTON: WETLANDS CONTROVERSY
The State Department of Environmental Protection said yesterday that it would allow a cranberry farmer to continue farming 22 acres he had illegally flooded, provided he followed the permit process. The farmer, J. Garfield DeMarco, a former Burlington County Republican chairman, was charged in September with expanding his fields into wetlands without a permit. Steve Strunsky (NYT)

Economy Still Growing

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried 

 BODY:
New York State's economy has continued to grow over the last year, with private-sector employment up and unemployment rates down both downstate and upstate, the state's chief economist said yesterday.
The economist, Stephen Kagann, said that the gains over the last 12 months continued a turnaround in the state's economy that began downstate in 1996 and upstate in 1997. He said that the upstate improvement was often overlooked in discussions of the state's economic situation. 
 Mr. Kagann said that private employment last month was higher statewide by nearly 160,000 jobs, or 2.3 percent, over June 1999. He said the increase was 2.5 percent downstate -- New York City and its suburbs -- and 1.8 percent upstate. The national growth rate is 2.2 percent.
The statewide unemployment rate, seasonally adjusted, "fell sharply to 4.5 percent in June 2000 from 5.3 percent in June 1999," Mr. Kagann said, higher than the current 4 percent rate nationally. Joseph P. Fried (NYT)

Designer Chosen for Project

BYLINE: By Terry Pristin 

 BODY:
A Miami firm, Arquitectonica, will design a $230 million residential and commercial project on 2.9 acres on Manhattan's Lower East Side in the Cooper Square area, city officials said yesterday.
The complex, one of the largest urban renewal projects in the past quarter-century, will be bounded by Second Street, the Bowery, Stanton and Chrystie Streets, and Second Avenue. It will have 618 residential units, including 90 condominiums, in four buildings, 200,000 square feet of retail space and a 30,000-square-foot community recreation center. 
 One-quarter of the apartments will be reserved for low-income residents earning less than 60 percent of the median income in the New York area, which is $32,000 for a family of four. Tenants will be chosen by lottery.
Construction is expected to begin next year. Additional information is available by calling the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development at (212) 863-8000. Terry Pristin (NYT)

HEADLINE: House Approves Easing of Embargo on Cuba Trade and Travel

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
Metropolitan DeskThe House of Representatives tonight approved measures to bar the Treasury Department from enforcing restrictions on travel to Cuba as well as on the sale of food and medicines to the island.
Critics of the 38-year-old American trade embargo on Cuba hailed the votes as a major first step in the House toward clearing the way to commercial ties and even American tourism. 
 By a vote of 232 to 186, lawmakers ordered that the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the chief bureau for enforcing sanctions against Cuba, be prohibited from spending federal funds to restrict Americans from traveling there or engaging in the sale of food and medicine.
Sixty Republicans voted in favor of the amendment on travel, which was added to the bill to finance the Treasury Department and Postal Service by Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina.
Mr. Sanford expressed elation at the vote, which he said was a sign that lawmakers are increasingly prepared to engage the government of Cuba, just as they have sought to end the isolation of governments such as China and Vietnam.
Mr. Sanford said the vote would help correct "an incredible inconsistency" in American foreign policy, and marked a victory for Americans who claim a constitutional right to travel to nations whose governments are at odds with the United States.
Moreover, Mr. Sanford said, American travel will advance the cause of democratic reforms in Cuba more surely than efforts to isolate the Cuban people.
"This marks the beginning of the an end for an outdated policy toward Cuba," he said. "We've tried 40 years of isolation. It has not worked. The will of the house is that we take this incremental step."
Advocates of sanctions against Cuba noted that it still remains illegal for Americans to travel there as tourists, even if the Treasury Department becomes unable to enforce the law.
There is no companion measure on travel currently before the Senate, the critics noted, and the overall bill faces a presidential veto on unrelated matters.
"It has little practical effect, because the law hasn't changed," said Representative Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who is one of three Cuban-American members of Congress. "What you've done in this act is to create lawlessness."
Still, the vote on travel to Cuba has particular resonance. Until the 1959 triumph of the revolution, Cuba was the leading American tourism destination in the Caribbean.
In recent years, the government of Fidel Castro has built up tourism, adding European-financed hotels in Havana and at the popular beach resort of Varadero.
Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American Republican from Florida, charged that the measure would provide revenues to "the worst violator of human rights in all of the Western Hemisphere."
The Clinton administration since last year has greatly broadened the categories of Americans allowed to travel to the island, allowing more than 200 universities to license student travelers. Such people-to-people contacts, American officials say, will enhance the prospects for a peaceful political transition to democracy.
About 135,000 Americans visited Cuba last year on government-approved trips. Another 22,000 traveled illegally through third countries such as the Bahamas or Mexico, according to Treasury Department estimates.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE POLLS;
NO CUSHIONS SEEN FOR BUSH OR GORE ON ELECTORAL MAP

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER and RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
Despite the confidence displayed by Gov. George W. Bush's campaign, the presidential election today stands as a very competitive contest, with ample time and opportunity for either him or Vice President Al Gore to surge ahead.
At a first glance of the electoral map, opinion polls show Mr. Bush is leading in enough states to assure him an electoral college victory. But in many of those states, the governor's margin is quite slim. Moreover, Election Day is more than three months off, and the contest is entering a crucial phase where the choice of running mates and the message the conventions deliver could define the race. 
 An analysis of opinion polls state by state, along with interviews with Republican and Democratic strategists in the campaigns and around the country, found enough crucial states that are so competitive that those midsummer events, and the fall debates to follow, could overturn the current standings in state after state. Or they could solidify Mr. Bush's position.
No dominant national issue is defining the race. So if the contest remains relatively tight, the outcome in crucial states could be decided by local considerations such as Republicans in the Philadelphia suburbs deserting their party over abortion -- or by Democrats in Michigan rallying to the Green Party banner of Ralph Nader.
For all the emphasis in the news media on national polls, where Mr. Bush has maintained long-standing but narrowing leads, both campaigns are paying closer attention to the outlook in individual states, because the goal for each side is to plot a path to collect the 270 electoral votes needed for victory.
The state-by-state considerations are so vital that, to a large degree, they are driving the campaigns' advertising budgets and the candidates' travel schedules.
On Wednesday, Mr. Gore's top lieutenants held a conference call to make important decisions about which states they should pump more resources into -- or not. Gore campaign officials said they had decided, for instance, not to spend as much in Illinois as they had planned because they felt confident in Mr. Gore's prospects there.
Just the same, one Bush campaign official said that Mr. Bush was doing better than he expected in Arizona, Colorado and Montana and, as a result, the campaign could scale back its spending in those states.
The state-by-state analysis shows that Mr. Gore is most potent along the coasts, while Mr. Bush has an inland foundation in the South and mountain states. That leaves the race to turn on several states in the industrial Midwest.
For now, Mr. Bush appears safe in 18 states with 140 electoral votes, from Texas to Alaska to Virginia. Another 11 states, including Florida, Michigan and Oregon -- with a combined 138 electoral votes -- seem to be leaning his way, though many of them could easily change quickly. If all these states went for Mr. Bush, it would give him 278 electoral votes, 8 more than needed for election.
The vice president looks safe in eight states, from New York to California to Hawaii, and the District of Columbia, with 134 electoral votes. Another four states, from Connecticut to Illinois, with 39 electoral votes, appear to be leaning his way.
That leaves nine states, including such powers as Pennsylvania and New Jersey, as tossups. Combined, they account for 87 electoral votes.
On the face of it, if Mr. Bush won all the states that are safe or lean his way, with a total of 278 electoral votes, he could win without taking any of the tossups. But while many more states are leaning toward Mr. Bush, polls and politicians agree that in several important states, the governor is barely ahead. It would not take a shift of too many voters to deny him Ohio, Missouri and Florida, and then his total would drop precipitously, to 221 electors.
Neither campaign agrees with this analysis. The Bush camp still insists that the Governor is comfortably ahead. Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, said in an interview that Mr. Gore had made some progress in drawing support from Democrats who had been reluctant to support him. But he said there was no sign that he was pulling any support from Mr. Bush.
"There's been some tightening, you bet, because he's bringing the Democrats home," Mr. Rove said. "But nationally, this race has been essentially stuck at five or six points for the last four months."
Republicans have also been encouraged that Mr. Nader has siphoned some support from Mr. Gore in several states, and by Mr. Bush's strength in some historical Democratic pockets, like Minnesota. The race there is a tossup.
William M. Daley, chairman of the Gore campaign, disputed the idea of even a tentative Bush advantage. "I think it's basically a dead heat, basically where it's been for months," Mr. Daley said. "People aren't into it. There's a whole slew of states out there because people aren't focused. Nothing has grabbed them yet."
But the competitiveness came through in interviews in state after state, where party heads and strategists described close match-ups.
Richard Graber, the chairman of the Republican Party in Wisconsin, marveled at polls in his state showing Mr. Bush slightly ahead. "There is a different energy and a different feel from what we had four years ago," Mr. Graber said. "We were written off very early in the process. There was no money in this state. There was no TV. It was really free ride for Clinton. That's not the case" this year.
Senator Russell Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, agreed. He said the race in his state was shaping up to be the most competitive in years. "It's going to be terribly close, and I think it could end up being one of the two or three decisive states," he said.
The competitiveness of Wisconsin helped explain why that is one of 26 states Mr. Bush has campaigned in since May. Candidates spend very little time in states they expect to lose. Mr. Gore has popped up in Indiana, for example, not once since May, or about as often as Mr. Bush has traveled to Massachusetts (once).
Sometimes candidates take an occasional tactical foray designed to befuddle the opposition. Mr. Gore traveled to Mr. Bush's state of Texas today not because he thinks he has a chance there but to draw free national publicity as he condemned the governor's record.
And unless there is money to be collected, candidates do not venture into states that they consider sure to win. They campaign, in person and on television, in the states where they think they lead or trail narrowly. For example, starting last month, Mr. Gore began spending heavily on television commercials aimed at 18 states: Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Kentucky, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin.
Republicans were on the air for two weeks, went off, and then resumed the battle of the airwaves this week. Mr. Rove said the Gore commercials had no impact. "There are now seven states where we have polling that took place before their advertising and polling that took place after," he said. "And in all seven of the states, we've held ground or moved up. The only way it may have helped is to keep us from moving ahead." He said the advertisements were "based on a flawed assumption that people are going to pay a lot of attention to advertising during the summer."
But Tad Devine, a top strategist for Mr. Gore, countered that the polls cited by the Bush camp were unreliable. "That's a little three-card monte on their side," he said, arguing that Bush operatives made a "terrible error in strategic judgment" by not keep the campaign's commercials running -- and forfeited an opportunity to build bigger leads in several states.
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, disagrees with the Bush camp as well. She is conducting the largest polling operation of the year, 100,000 interviews this year in key states night after night.
Dean Jamieson studied the eight states where Mr. Gore (through the financial fig leaf of the Democratic National Committee) spent at least $300,000 more than Mr. Bush (through the Republican National Committee). Those states were Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Oregon, and Pennsylvania. Over all, Dean Jamieson found that Mr. Gore had gained 10 percentage points on average in those states. "He was closing substantially," she said. "It is reasonable to say the ads worked."
After months in which Mr. Bush seemed to have the advantage, national polls made public this week showed the race closer than previous surveys by the same organizations. Those national polls, with their consistent methodology, provide a rough guidelines to the contours of any presidential race.
"It's close now, and the movement mainly is on Gore's end," said John Zogby, an independent pollster.
Yet experts say today's electoral snapshot should hardly be considered definitive, since the public really is not paying much attention to the campaign in midsummer. Prof. Thomas Patterson of Harvard, a student of public involvement in politics, said his surveys showed that if people were not given a name but only asked if they had a presidential choice, half say they did not. Other polls, which offer names, find the undecided numbers as low as 10 percent. As for the numbers reflecting people's preferences, Professor Patterson said, "I think they are soft."
Here is an analysis of the outlook in several important states:
 
MICHIGAN -- Leans Bush. He has campaigned hard in the state, and almost all of Mr. Nader's support, eight percent in one recent poll, is coming out of Mr. Gore's base. Hostility from the auto workers and teamsters are making it harder for him to capitalize on economic issues.
 
MISSOURI -- Leans Bush. This is always a swing state, and one that has picked a presidential winner every time since 1956, when it backed Adlai Stevenson. Bush is well-organized, and Gore has not solidified the union support.
 
FLORIDA -- Leans Bush. But this is a wild card. Gov. Jeb Bush, Mr. Bush's brother, said in an interview that he was determined not to let his state slip through. "I'm certainly not going to be embarrassed and have the state go the other way," Mr. Bush said. Nevertheless, Al Cardenas, the state Republican chairman, said he feared that Mr. Gore could pick Bob Graham, the popular Senator from the state, as his running mate, which would force a competition there. "If Graham gives him a couple of points in Florida, in a tight race we obviously would have to work a little harder," Mr. Cardenas said.
 
ILLINOIS -- Leans Gore. Brad Goodrich, the Republican Party's executive director, argues that Mr. Bush holds a slim lead and that Mr. Gore's advertisements have had no effect. But Senator Richard Durbin, a Democrat and a potential running mate, said polling information he had received from Gore headquarters showed the vice president now leading by a few points. Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago is expected to work hard for the Gore campaign.
 
OHIO -- Leans Bush. Polls in this state, which has a history of close outcomes, have see-sawed. Robert Bennett, chairman of the state Republican Party, said that while his candidate was ahead, it is not by much. He is well aware that the dynamic could change as the convention opens at the end of the month. "We could have a blow up at the convention of some sort," he said.
But David Leland, the state Democratic chairman, said it was no accident that Mr. Gore had ventured to the state at least nine times since the campaign began. "We won't lose this race for lack of attention," he said.
 
NEW JERSEY -- Tossup. For most of the century, New Jersey has been a close state in presidential campaigns -- and usually supports the winner. Democrats say their only sure shot in the state would have been if Senator Bill Bradley had won the party's nomination.
 
PENNSYLVANIA -- Tossup. Mr. Gore is cutting into Republican strength in the Philadelphia suburbs, while Mr. Bush is strong in the southwestern mining counties, and has a strong organization. Mr. Bush would be strongly favored if he chose Gov. Tom Ridge as his running mate, but Senator Arlen Specter fears Mr. Bush could lose support if it appeared that his reason for rejecting Mr. Ridge was the abortion issue.
 
WASHINGTON -- Tossup. Mr. Gore got a boost this week when the Clinton Administration decided not to blow up dams on the Lower Snake River to improve the salmon habitat. The issue had been killing him in Eastern Washington where farmers depend on hydroelectric power.

HEADLINE: Bitter Pills For Aetna;
Is Its Stringent Approach To Health Care Outdated?

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Call it bad luck, bad timing, bad judgment or all of the above: Aetna, an old-line insurance company, transformed itself into a hard-charging, tightly run health care company four years ago, just in time to become a main target of the backlash against managed care, especially the kind Aetna was selling.
This week, the company was still struggling with the consequences. Putting a brave face on it, William H. Donaldson, chairman and chief executive since a management shake-up in February, hailed "a turnaround opportunity" to put Aetna's health care business "on the right track." 
 Under pressure from investors annoyed at its stock price, Aetna agreed on Thursday to sell its lucrative financial services and international business to the ING Group of Amsterdam for $5 billion in cash. Mr. Donaldson said the new, slimmed-down Aetna, still the nation's biggest health insurer, would "redefine the company's business model."
Almost half the 19.5 million Americans covered by Aetna are in strict health maintenance organizations, which generally save money by requiring patients to get permission from a primary care doctor before seeing a specialist or taking a test.
But the market has changed. "Our world is different than it was 10 years ago," said Dr. Michael A. Stocker, president and chief executive of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. "In a tight labor market, employees are not happy about more cost-sharing. This is a luxurious time for luxurious products."
Low-cost H.M.O.'s were a big success for U.S. Healthcare, Aetna's core unit, into the early 1990's, when employers were shocked by sharply rising health costs and holding onto employees was not a big concern.
But as the economy roared and health care inflation slowed in the mid-1990's, insurers like Cigna, the UnitedHealth Group and Wellpoint Health Networks and other Blue Cross companies catered to customers who demanded more choice of doctors and fewer restrictions.
Managing health care "clearly is changing into a much more complicated business that requires absolute focus on the fundamentals," said H. Edward Hanway, president and chief executive of Cigna. "It is not any different for any of us."
Slow to change, Aetna is now playing catch up, trying to remake itself as a kinder, gentler company that causes fewer hassles for consumers, doctors and hospitals. Mr. Donaldson said it would soon offer new types of health coverage to meet consumer demand for "more flexibility and choice."
The sale to ING came on the heels of an embarrassing warning by Aetna on Tuesday that it had fallen short of expected second-quarter earnings. The cause, it said, was higher-than-expected medical costs in its core H.M.O.'s.
Analysts said the warning meant Aetna was not paying enough attention to the most important and difficult task in managed care: anticipating future costs and setting rates to cover bills that often do not show up until months later.
Investors are slow to forgive slip-ups that undermine earnings. Aetna shares dropped 20 percent this week, closing at $57.25, even though the ING deal included a payout of $35 for each Aetna share plus one share of a new Aetna Inc. Analysts said other managed care companies did not share Aetna's special problems. But except for Wellpoint, health care stocks lost ground this week.
Analysts said Aetna would have to raise its rates 13 to 14 percent next year, at a time when competitors may be raising premiums by only 10 percent.
Mr. Donaldson added that the new, more flexible coverage would be priced accordingly, indicating that rates would be higher for the new types of coverage than for the company's more restrictive H.M.O.'s.
"There is nothing wrong with being kinder and gentler," said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health care analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, "but they must charge corporate America for that strategy."
Setting up the problems Aetna faces now, Mr. Donaldson's predecessor as chairman and chief executive, Richard L. Huber, spent $11 billion on a three-year buying spree. He scooped up three big managed care companies: U.S. Healthcare in 1996, Nylcare and Prudential Health Care in 1998. Aetna is still working on having them integrated into its information systems and culture.
The latest and most problematical deal was the purchase of Prudential Health, an enormous money-loser. Investors hope to learn early next month, when Aetna reports on second-quarter earnings, whether the Prudential unit is still on track to reach break-even this winter, despite its recent rising medical costs.
Time is running out for a turnaround at Prudential because deal-sweetening post-purchase paybacks to Aetna from the seller, the Prudential Life Insurance Company of America, will end next year.
The company says it will have more to say about Prudential and other murky questions, including its latest membership numbers, when it formally reports on earnings on Aug. 4.
With the mergers, Aetna became the biggest health insurer in New York and New Jersey and among the top three in Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia, Ohio and Texas. When it bought Nylcare for $1.1 billion, it had so many Texas members that it was forced to sell health plans with 460,000 members to Texas Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Blue Cross paid $420 million for the plans.
The health care roster included 676,000 people in Medicare H.M.O.'s, which will drop to 320,000 next year when it shuts Medicare health plans in 11 states. Mr. Donaldson has said some of the plans are "egregiously" unprofitable. Suggesting further shrinkage in the membership rolls, Mr. Donaldson also made it clear that Aetna plans to discontinue other unprofitable lines in some markets.
The transformation of the company started in 1995, when Aetna Life and Casualty, as it was then called, sold its property and casualty business for $4.1 billion to Travelers and bought an H.M.O. company, U.S. Healthcare, for a price that, in hindsight, is widely deemed excessive.
Some Wall Street analysts say the price, $9 billion, was as much as three times what the company was worth. "They got taken," said Todd Richter, an analyst at Banc of America Securities. Leonard Abramson, the founder of U.S. Healthcare, "got the best deal ever done in the history of deals," Mr. Richter said.
Mr. Abramson, now 67, resigned from the Aetna board last month. Under the 1996 deal, he still gets $3 million a year as a consultant and is due $10 million more when that contract ends next summer. "There were contracts for his relatives and employees, a $25 million airplane and gas money for the plane," Mr. Richter added. Mr. Abramson did not respond to requests for an interview.
Joyce Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for Aetna, said the price paid for U.S. Healthcare was only "a moderate premium" above the H.M.O.'s stock. But analysts recall that managed care stocks soared after Aetna maladroitly said it was planning to buy an H.M.O.
"U.S. Healthcare had what we were looking for," Ms. Oberdorf said, "information systems expertise, management of the stronger forms of managed care, a strong presence in several key markets, and a model that could be replicated."
But replicating the tightly disciplined U.S. Healthcare model infuriated many doctors who were used to the more relaxed ways of the old Aetna. The U.S. Healthcare team insisted that doctors accept low-paying H.M.O. customers or give up all their Aetna patients. Doctors were paid a flat monthly fee called capitation for H.M.O. members, which put them at risk when patients had expensive illnesses.
Mr. Huber minced no words in confronting critics, and soon Aetna was fighting off lawsuits around the country.
Without giving away the store, Mr. Donaldson has tried to repair relations with the public and physicians. He announced that capitation would be dropped in several states for individual doctors and small group practices, who would be paid with the traditional fees for service.
Most senior officials from U.S. Healthcare who took over Aetna after the merger have since been pushed out. Aetna is seeking a new health care chief, no easy task considering the challenges.
James H. Dickerson, now president of Caremark Rx Inc., a pharmacy managed care company, amused analysts with an all too realistic joke back in 1997, when he moved from U.S. Healthcare to Aetna as chief financial officer.
As Mr. Dickerson told it, a new finance chief found three envelopes in his desk "to be opened in time of trouble." As trouble arrived, he opened the first envelope and read, "Blame your predecessor." The second message was "Blame industry conditions." The third was "Prepare three envelopes."
The tale was timely for Mr. Dickerson. He was shown the door a few weeks later.

HEADLINE: Truth or Lies? In Sex Surveys, You Never Know

BYLINE: By SARAH BOXER 

 BODY:
Wardell B. Pomeroy, one of Alfred Kinsey's associates in the 1940's, was interviewing a man about his first ejaculation. He asked, "When?" The man answered, "Fourteen." Pomeroy then asked, "How?" and was surprised to hear: "With a horse."
In his new biography, "Sex the Measure of All Things: A Life of Alfred C. Kinsey," Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy records what happened next. Pomeroy asked the man, "How often were you having intercourse with animals at 14?" 
 The man looked confused and said, "Well, yes, it is true I had intercourse with a pony at 14." Pomeroy, it turned out, had misheard the man's previous answer. It was "with whores," not "with a horse." So the man was stunned that Pomeroy had had the insight to ask him the horse question out of the blue.
Sex surveyors are bedeviled scientists. Beyond the problems of hearing the respondents correctly and not making imaginative suggestions themselves, they face a number of obstacles. People lie about sex. Those who don't lie often say inaccurate things. And most sex researchers aren't exactly neutral.
Two battling biographies of Kinsey, "Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public/Private Man" by James H. Jones, published in 1997, and Mr. Gathorne-Hardy's book have recently brought the issue of truth in sex into focus again. And this December a new book, "Sex, Love and Health," further analyzing the results of the National Health and Social Life Survey on sex, will be published, raising the question again: how much can we really know about other people's sex lives?
Sex surveys give "a hardened imitation of reality," says John H. Gagnon, an emeritus professor of sociology at the State University at Stony Brook who studies sex. Certain kinds of questions elicit certain answers, and certain questions are asked because of fear.
If you look back at American sex surveys, Mr. Gagnon says, you can see that most are concerned with risk: the risk to marriage, the risk to virginity, the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, violence, teenage pregnancy and child abuse.
The first sex survey published in the United States, according to Julia A. Ericksen's book "Kiss and Tell: Surveying Sex in the 20th Century," was F. S. Brockman's study of adolescent boys around the turn of the century. College-age men were asked about their boyhoods: What was your severest temptation? Did you yield? The results were published in "The Pedagogical Seminary," edited by G. Stanley Hall, a prominent psychologist who believed that masturbation depleted a man's energy. The study showed what was feared: young men were in spiritual crisis and masturbation was partly to blame.
By 1916 concerns had changed. Walter Robie, a neurologist and advocate of birth control, was worried about premarital sex and venereal disease. He believed, Ms. Ericksen writes, that occasional "autoerotism would help prevent nonmarital intercourse." His survey confirmed his belief that masturbation saves marriages.
Later sex surveys were probably no less biased; it's just that the biases had changed. Mr. Jones writes in his biography that Kinsey's sex studies were an effort "to help himself," that from childhood on Kinsey "lived with two shameful secrets: he was both a homosexual and a masochist." He was determined, Mr. Jones writes, "to strip human sexuality of its guilt and repression."
Accordingly, Mr. Jones says, the homosexual cases made up approximately one-fifth of the sample." And so Kinsey vastly overstated the incidence of homosexuality (10 percent for men).
Mr. Gagnon takes a different slant on Kinsey's bias. What affected the data, he says, is that Kinsey's subjects were "all white, Midwestern or Northeastern, young and highly educated."
The surveys that followed were even less representative: in the 1970's Shere Hite, the Cassandra of women's sex, was criticized for choosing a sample that included too many women who had emotional problems with men in the "Hite Report on Female Sexuality." The sex surveys done by Redbook, Cosmopolitan and Playboy were based on the responses of readers, a self-selected group.
But even if such biases are removed, will the whole truth out? Apparently even the sternest scientific studies -- mass surveys of randomly selected people, conducted by interviewers trained to look unbiased, unimpressed and unembarrassed -- are not beyond reproach.
Six years ago the results of the National Health and Social Life Survey were published in "The Social Organization of Sexuality" by two sociologists, Edward O. Laumann and Mr. Gagnon; an economist, Robert T. Michael; and a researcher, Stuart Michaels. The study, which was motivated by the AIDS epidemic and was supposed to be publicly financed, ended up being paid for privately when the Senate, at the urging of Senator Jesse Helms, voted against support.
Contrary to prurient expectations, the survey, based on interviews with a random sample of 3,432 people between 18 and 59, was a picture of sexual squareness: low rates of homosexuality and promiscuity, high rates of marital fidelity and connubial bliss. It showed that in a given year most Americans have only one sex partner; that the median lifetime number of partners for women is two and for men is six; that most people have sex less than twice a week and it's over quickly; that most Americans are happy with their sex lives and partners. It also showed that people most often have sex with members of their own class.
This survey was to be the most representative and accurate ever. Indeed, the researchers took extreme precautions against lying. For potentially embarrassing questions, they had the respondents give written as well as oral answers. And only written answers were given for two questions the researchers considered the most sensitive: masturbation and household income.
Despite the rigor, the study did not persuade everyone. In The New York Review of Books, Richard Lewontin, a population geneticist at Harvard, complained that the researchers still had no way of knowing how many people had lied. And even admirers of the study sounded disappointed. Paul Robinson, a history professor at Stanford University and the author of "The Modernization of Sex," says that the survey "had little resonance -- it didn't make much of a splash."
So where is the science of sex surveys now? In December "Sex, Love and Health," an extension of the project begun in "The Social Organization of Sexuality," will be published. In keeping with the concerns of the time, it will focus less on AIDS and more on teenage sex, race, class and gender, sex between adults and children, circumcision, sexual dysfunction and abortion.
But something more basic is on the horizon. It appears that researchers are abandoning the dream of quantitative carnal knowledge. "We are not in the truth business," Mr. Gagnon says. "People tell us the truth as they see it." But they forget, and the stories they tell are altered by having told the story before, by storytelling conventions, by the audience and by the news media.
Rachel Maines, the author of "The Technology of Orgasm," says sex surveys won't tell you people's deepest, darkest secrets. But over time sex studies do show changes. For example, people used to say they disliked using condoms because it suggested premeditated sex, Ms. Maines says. Now they might say that they don't like them because of the loss of sensation.
Mr. Lewontin wrote: "The answer, surely, is to be less ambitious and stop trying to make sociology into a natural science. There are some things in the world that we will never know and many that we will never know exactly."
Such reduced expectations seem to have brought Kinsey new respect. Mr. Gathorne-Hardy's biography defends him by suggesting that he wasn't really out to find sex norms. Kinsey, who started off as a biologist specializing in the study of the gall wasp, was not so much a statistician as a taxonomist, someone who classified the variety of sexual behavior.
Mr. Gathorne-Hardy notes that Kinsey never asked "have you or did you ever?" but rather "when did you first do something -- have intercourse with a woman, a man, an animal?" By assuming that everyone had done everything, he encouraged people to talk. Kinsey got 18,000 people to reveal the "details of sensitive matters like homosexuality, extramarital affairs, masturbation, child-adult sex and so on," Mr. Gathorne-Hardy writes.
Kinsey's work "probed the limits," Mr. Gagnon says. He was the first to break open the doors. In the tradition of American reformers, he believed that sexuality, if liberated, was redemptive.
But do people read sex surveys for liberation? No, says Mr. Robinson. They "want to know how many people are like me."
And for that "people want absolute truth from science," Mr. Gagnon says. "There is a desire for the gold standard, the real numbers." People want to know how they stack up. They don't want to hear stories about a boy and his horse.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Share Prices Fall as Investors Consider Quarterly Reports

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
A day after pleasant surprises from the chairman of the Federal Reserve, investors turned their focus back to corporate earnings yesterday and stocks sagged, with the Nasdaq composite index falling 2.2 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average down 1 percent.
But bond prices rallied a little as hopes persisted that new signs of slowing consumer spending and economic growth would persuade Fed policy makers to leave interest rates alone when they next meet, on Aug. 22. 
 In the oil market, the price of crude oil plunged 4.1 percent, to less than $30 a barrel, as it appeared more probable that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would go along with Saudi Arabia's call to increase daily production by 500,000 barrels.
On Thursday, both stocks and bonds rallied sharply after Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, was more positive than expected about the economic outlook. Although he clearly did not rule out future interest rate increases, he seemed to surprise investors with his detailed presentation of reasons for believing that the economy could be slowing to a manageable, noninflationary pace.
But there were some disappointments on the earnings front yesterday. Eastman Kodak reported a 4.5 percent rise in second-quarter earnings but said that its market share in the United States had slipped this year. Its stock was down 1 7/8, to 58. BorgWarner, which makes engine turbochargers, fell 15/16, to 36, after its second-quarter earnings per share of $1.51 missed Wall Street estimates by 5 cents. Lexmark International, a maker of computer printers, said that its third-quarter profit would come in below expectations. Its shares plunged 14 1/4, or 22.3 percent, to 49 3/4.
Semiconductor stocks also declined on concerns about chip sales for the rest of the year, with Intel falling 4 1/2, to 138 3/16, and Motorola sliding 1 1/4, to 361 3/16.
The Nasdaq index fell 90.11 points, or 2.2 percent, to 4,094.45, while the Dow dropped 110.31, or 1 percent, to 10,733.56. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slumped 15.38, or 1 percent, to 1,480.19.
For the week, the Nasdaq was down 3.6 percent, the Dow 0.7 percent and the S.& P. 500 2 percent. For the year, the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq are up less than a percentage point while the Dow is still off 6.6 percent.
In the bond market, prices were higher as yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 5.98 percent from 6.00 percent on Thursday, while the price rose 4/32, to 103 23/32. The yield on the 10-year note has been fighting to get back below 6 percent for the last five weeks. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.79 percent from 5.81 percent as its price rose 11/32, to 106 19/32.
The seesaw battle in the oil market over where the price is heading has been going on since July 3, when Saudi Arabia unexpectedly announced that it was ready to pump 500,000 more barrels a day if the price did not drop.
But other members of OPEC immediately opposed the Saudi plan, and reports about negotiations were inconsistent, indicating more oil to come one day and no more oil the next. Then after an OPEC official said earlier this week that there was no need to pump more oil, Saudi Arabia quietly made clear that it was shipping more oil by contacting oil brokers.
"The market finally believes Saudi Arabia," said Irene King, senior oil markets analyst at J. P. Morgan & Company. "Why it took so long, I don't know."
Yesterday in New York, the price of oil for September delivery fell $1.21, or 4.1 percent, to $28.56 a barrel, the lowest price since mid-May.

Virginia Saurwein, who was the United Nations' top liaison official with nongovernmental organizations from 1975 until 1989, died July 9 in Erie, Pa. She was 71 and lived in South Salem, N.Y.
She suffered a heart attack and a stroke in February, according to a former colleague. 
 During Ms. Saurwein's tenure, nongovernmental organizations, known as N.G.O.'s, became increasingly influential at the United Nations in fields like the environment, international law, arms control and human rights. Though their political influence is marginal, such groups play a significant role in bringing social issues to the attention of member states.
At the International Women's Year conference in Mexico City in 1975, Ms. Saurwein helped draft the first United Nations resolution on women's access to credit. Later she was a co-founder and board member of Women's World Banking, a global loan-guarantee organization. After the Mexico City conference, she became chief of the N.G.O. liaison unit in the United Nations Department of Economic and Social affairs, a post she held until her retirement.
Early in her career Ms. Saurwein worked as a program director at the United Nations Association of the U.S.A. and at the Center for War/ Peace Studies. In 1970, the United Nations Development Program asked her to help create its N.G.O. liaison office, which she led for five years.
Ms. Saurwein is survived by a brother, George Saurwein, of Erie.

China to Merge Domestic Carriers in Reorganization

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 21

 BODY:
China announced a large reorganization of domestic airlines today, merging seven carriers into the three largest to reduce the overlap of routes and the number of half-empty planes that have plagued the industry for years.
Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines will absorb the other carriers, giving each of the three surviving airlines roughly $6 billion in assets, China's state news agency, Xinhua, reported. It gave no timetable for the mergers or which airline would merge with which. 
 China's airline industry has had a turbulent ride since the country broke the Civil Aviation Administration of China's state airline monopoly into six regional carriers in the late 1980's and later allowed provincial governments to start their own airlines. The idea was to better serve the explosion in passengers that came with relaxed controls on air travel by Chinese citizens and a subsequent economic boom.
The expansion led to a series of crashes that made China the most dangerous place to fly in the early 1990's. China rectified that with increased training for pilots and a moratorium on aircraft purchases. But a second wave of expansion left the industry with too many airline seats for the number of passengers it was serving as the growth of air travel tapered off in the 1997-98 Asian economic crisis.
China's airline industry, which includes 34 airlines, lost more than $72 million in 1998 as companies cut ticket prices in a scramble for passengers. China fixed prices and banned discounts in 1999 to try to stop the bleeding. It delayed delivery of aircraft that had been ordered. It cut air routes. It even demanded all airlines pool 80 percent of their ticket revenue on specific routes and divide it among the carriers servicing that route. The industry edged back to profitability last year, but none of that solved the problem.
The country is loath to allow the market to solve the problem by letting money-losing airlines go bankrupt, a solution considered too brutal in China's socialist economy.
The airlines involved employ about 73,000 people and carry heavy debts. It is not clear how much of those burdens the three surviving airlines will be forced to assume.
The seven airlines are China Southwest, China Northwest, China Northern, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Great Wall and Zhejiang,
The consolidation would in theory create economies of scale and give the industry the potential to develop hub-and-spoke networks similar to those of airlines in the United States. China Southern is based in the southern city of Guangzhou, China Eastern in the eastern commercial hub of Shanghai and Air China in the northern capital of Beijing.
And it could prepare the industry for increased competition once China enters the World Trade Organization, expected later this year.
Foreigners are also expected to be allowed up to 49 percent stakes in China's airlines, up from the 35 percent limit now.

HEADLINE: Vast Caviar Smuggling Case Brings Guilty Pleas

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Capping a case that exposed a large-scale caviar smuggling ring, a Maryland company, two of its officials and a third person pleaded guilty yesterday to federal fraud, smuggling and wildlife endangerment charges. The company agreed to pay a $10.4 million fine, which prosecutors described as the largest ever in a wildlife smuggling case.
The guilty pleas, entered in Federal District Court in Greenbelt, Md., followed a prolonged investigation of a sophisticated black-market operation. The inquiry ranged from the shores of the Caspian Sea and the Mississippi River to the first-class cabins of American Airlines jets and upscale food stores in Manhattan, Greenwich, Conn., and elsewhere. 
 The illicit operation was part of a continuing illegal trade in the eggs of sturgeon, huge bottom feeders that live a century or more and reproduce slowly, whose high-priced roe have made them a target of poachers.
Part of the scheme, government officials said, was the illegal importing of roe from several Caspian Sea sturgeon species protected by an international conservation treaty. Another part, they said, entailed falsely representing roe from two American species -- the shovelnose sturgeon and the paddlefish -- as legally imported Sevruga caviar.
The company that admitted guilt yesterday was U.S. Caviar & Caviar, one of the largest caviar importers in the country. From 1995 to 1999, according to court records, the company channeled tons of illegally harvested fish eggs from the Caspian and other waters to its offices in Rockville, Md.
In some cases, the roe was smuggled into the country in large containers and was repackaged in Rockville, where workers placed it in caviar tins that bore counterfeit labels, some with fake Russian health agency certification seals. In other cases, the labels, printed in Rockville, were shipped to the Middle East, where Kenfood Trading, another company involved in the operation, packaged some of the roe in caviar tins and sent them on to Rockville.
In 1998 alone, the operation funneled more than 18 tons of sturgeon caviar from the Caspian. The quantity of roe smuggled from Russia by U.S. Caviar & Caviar was so great that it exceeded the total that could be legally exported from the country under international treaties.
The first hint of the operation came in December 1998, when an inspector for the Fish and Wildlife Service at Baltimore-Washington International Airport noticed something odd about the labels in a shipment of caviar tins: the labels were of the peel-off variety, said Thomas Healy, the senior inspector in the agency's Baltimore office, whereas genuine labels on Russian caviar are glued on.
The three men who entered guilty pleas yesterday are Hossein Lolavar, 46, president of U.S. Caviar & Caviar; Faye Briggs, 53, the company's sales manager; and Ken Noroozi, 42, president of Kenfood Trading, which handled some of the illegal trade through the United Arab Emirates. All three men face at least a year's imprisonment at sentencing.

HEADLINE: Chipping Away at Embargo Reflects a New Vision of Cuba

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
Successive House and Senate votes on Thursday night to ease restrictions on American travel and certain sales to Cuba are the latest evidence of a gradual but seismic shift toward normalizing ties with the Marxist-run island, according to lawmakers and experts on Cuba.
Republicans defected by the score from their party's traditional pro-embargo stance and this week handed a dual victory to the coalition of farming interests, business groups and Democrats trying to lift American sanctions. 
 Both chambers of Congress approved the sale of food and medicine to Cuba. And the House went one step further, seeking to allow American tourism to the island by barring money to the federal agencies that enforce against it.
None of the provisions are expected to win final approval before September, if ever. But they signal an important change in how American decision-makers view Cuba, possibly the most momentous shift since 1994, when the Clinton administration first decided to intercept Cuban refugees at sea and send them home.
And, the experts and lawmakers say, the change raises the likelihood that the next president and Congress will feel freer to remove the remaining restrictions on ties with Havana.
"Clearly the barriers are coming down," said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a hemispheric forum in Washington. "The people who want to hold onto the structure of the embargo are slowly losing the game."
An administration official predicted the trade ban would likely be eliminated after the November elections, no matter who controlled Congress or the White House.
The embargo-easing amendments in the House on Thursday night, sponsored by Representatives Mark Sanford of South Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas, both conservative Republicans, passed with votes of 232 to 186 in favor of the travel provision and 301 to 116 supporting food and medical sales. Within an hour, the Senate overwhelmingly approved -- 79 to 13 -- an agriculture bill that also approved food and medicine sales but barred American credits to facilitate the trade.
The votes are likely to strengthen the prospects for a separate measure by Representative George Nethercutt, Republican of Washington, to allow food and medical sales, which moves into a conference committee in September.
Republican leaders and Cuban-American lawmakers who have sought to stymie the Nethercutt proposal will have to rethink their stance, said John S. Kavulich II, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, a clearinghouse for American businesses interested in trade with Cuba.
"It used to be Democrats fighting Republicans on wanting to expand the relationship with Cuba," Mr. Kavulich said. "Now, it's Republicans fighting Republicans, with the Democrats standing to the side waiting to see what happens."
Cuba watchers say several factors have changed the perception of Cuba and the United States policy of diplomatic isolation and economic boycott.
The bruising battles over trade with China and the Clinton administration's rationale that engaging Beijing is in America's strategic interest have invited charges of hypocrisy over Cuba.
In advocating greater contact with Cubans, Mr. Sanford invoked a conservative icon, former President Ronald Reagan, saying his decision to let American students travel to Eastern Europe helped bring down the Berlin Wall.
"The rhetoric behind this was that you change societies by contact, and that Americans can make a difference by being there," said Pamela Falk, a Cuba expert at the City University of New York's law school.
But some supporters of sanctions say Fidel Castro has shown himself much more impervious to liberalizing reforms than China's leaders.
"The American public believes Cuba has changed because the world has changed," said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey. "It's an assumption that unfortunately is contradicted by reality."
Another significant factor influencing Americans' shifting perceptions of Cuba came in the Elian Gonzalez case. From the morning news through the nightly talk shows, Americans were forced to think about Cuba -- and Cuban-Americans -- for months.
The administration's decision to return Elian to Cuba over what many saw as the strident objections of the 6-year-old's Miami relatives undercut the image of the well-financed Cuban-American lobby as invulnerable and not to be challenged.
In a recent interview, Joe Garcia, the newly appointed executive director of the Cuban American National Foundation, a lobby that long exerted virtual veto power over United States policy, acknowledged losing critical ground.
"Probably the most important thing we realized was we have to depend on ourselves in this struggle to educate the American people," Mr. Garcia said.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore, With Gusto, Attacks Bush on Budget

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
Cramming several weeks of attacks on Gov. George W. Bush of Texas into one speech, Vice President Al Gore asserted today that the governor's handling of the state's budget proved he would be an incompetent steward of the national economy, inclined to squandering the surplus on tax cuts for the rich.
Brimming with confidence in a speech before the leaders of 30 transportation unions, almost all of which have endorsed him, Mr. Gore wove together themes he had spun out separately in recent weeks, creating a tapestry of harsh questions about his Republican rival's fitness to be president. 
 Mr. Bush, the vice president said, had frittered away a $6.4 billion surplus in Texas on tax cuts favoring the wealthy, leaving the state with a $610 million budget shortfall because of cost overruns in some programs. The governor, Mr. Gore said, could be expected to do the same in Washington, leaving no money for government programs that are particularly important to working people, like Social Security and Medicare.
"One year ago, Texas had the biggest budget surplus in that state's history," Mr. Gore said. "Governor Bush's top priority was a big tax break for the powerful interests. And now, in the midst of the strongest national economy ever in history, Texas has virtually eliminated that surplus and has a budget shortfall.
"Now, Governor Bush wants to bring those same budget-busting tax policies to the nation as a whole," Mr. Gore continued. "Which do you think is more important, his rhetoric or his record?"
The vice president sarcastically accused Mr. Bush of having misplaced his priorities by using the surplus for tax cuts instead of improving services.
"If you were governor of a state that had the worst record of any state in giving health care to the families of your state, and then all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest budget surplus in the history of your state, don't you think you would consider using some of that surplus to maybe move your state from No. 50 to, say, 45 or maybe even higher?" Mr. Gore said, eliciting titters from his audience. "I would, of course, and shoot higher than that."
Mr. Bush's aides said the Texas budget was firmly balanced and would actually finish the coming fiscal year with a $1.4 billion surplus. The $610 million shortfall, caused by unexpectedly high expenditures on Medicaid and prison programs, will be quickly resolved with supplemental appropriations, they said. And the aides said much of Mr. Bush's tax cut was devoted to reducing sales and property taxes for middle-income Texans, not just the rich.
"If this election comes down to Governor Bush's fiscal leadership versus Al Gore's credibility, we're going to win in a landslide," said Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign.
Mr. Gore, wearing a conventional red tie with white shirt and black suit instead of his trademark khakis and polo shirt, seemed especially relaxed and confident today as he addressed his enthusiastic audience, which repeatedly interrupted him with standing ovations.
Echoing the view of his aides that he has had a good few days on the stump, after many bad ones, the vice president said, "I think that this week will be looked back upon as a turning point."
Working to pump the labor leaders, whose help will be vital in getting out the Democratic vote this November, Mr. Gore ticked off a series of pro-union pledges: raising the minimum wage, enacting legislation to remove obstacles to organizing unions, making health insurance more accessible, ensuring that women receive equal pay for equal work.
And in a subtle response to the criticisms of Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate for president who contends that Mr. Gore is virtually a carbon copy of Mr. Bush, the vice president urged the crowd to "fight off any cynics who say that they're all the same and it doesn't make any difference."
"It does make a difference," Mr. Gore continued. "It makes a difference whether or not we're going to fight to keep Social Security or not. It makes a difference whether or not working families are going to get health care and their kids are going to get good public schools."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS BUDGET;
After Months of Thrust and Parry, Gore Finally Seems to Draw Blood

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI with ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., July 21

 BODY:
For much of the late spring and summer, on issues ranging from education to the environment, Vice President Al Gore dissected and disparaged Gov. George W. Bush's record in Texas, and the Texas governor never failed to fight back. He stood before television cameras to dismiss what he said were gross distortions, and his advisers churned out news releases that contradicted Mr. Gore's claims.
But never has the Bush campaign mounted as furious a counteroffensive as it did day after day this week, in response to the vice president's latest salvo: that the Texas governor had mismanaged his state's finances, creating serious cost overruns that jeopardized the state's fiscal health. At long last, the Gore campaign seemed to hit a nerve or at least stoke an outrage that suggested the emergence of a line of attack that might have some staying power. 
 The Bush campaign set up conference calls between reporters and Republican and even Democratic lawmakers who said that an estimated $610 million in unanticipated expenses in Texas would be more than covered by a budget surplus of more than $1 billion. The campaign arranged for Mr. Bush to read a statement publicly denouncing Mr. Gore's tactics on a day when the governor had not planned to make any public appearances. His aides approached major television networks about booking Mr. Bush's senior advisers on weekend news programs. And the language Mr. Bush used to castigate his Democratic rival grew sharper than ever.
"I now know what Bill Bradley meant when he said, 'How can we trust this man as president when we can't trust him as a candidate?' " Mr. Bush told reporters today at his ranch near Crawford, referring to Mr. Gore's opponent in the Democratic primaries. "I'm beginning to get a feel for why he uttered those words."
But was he also beginning to get a little nervous? Republican and Democratic strategists said that Mr. Gore's attack on Mr. Bush's experience and ability as a fiscal manager marked an important moment in the presidential race for several reasons, a situation clearly reflected by the Bush campaign's aggressive reaction.
These strategists said that by calling Mr. Bush's aptitude for fiscal responsibility into question, Mr. Gore was challenging Mr. Bush on an issue -- the ability to manage the economy and sustain prosperity -- on which Republicans have often maintained an advantage over Democrats in voters' minds. Additionally, Mr. Gore was doing it in the context of the ever-expanding surplus projections that have become one of the brightest legacies of the Clinton administration.
"Bush's two main strengths are education and the economy, and you don't give when your opponent strikes at your strengths," said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. "This is still a race about pocketbook issues, and it's where Bush's strengths really lie."
Other Republican strategists said that while voters often had difficulty making sense of competing education proposals and seldom supported candidates on the basis of rival philosophies about the environment, they understood money, and Mr. Gore's claim that Mr. Bush was not managing it properly amounted to perhaps the boldest attack yet on Mr. Bush's Texas record. That record, several strategist said, was perhaps the principal credential that Mr. Bush carried into this race.
"Polling shows that the view of him as a successful governor is an essential reason why people believe he has the capacity to be a good president," said one Republican strategist. "The Bush campaign can't afford to have that pillar shaken."
Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said that the vigor that the Bush campaign was bringing to the rebuttal of Mr. Gore's charges about the Texas budget was an offensive of its own, aimed at showing voters how readily Mr. Gore would alter facts to tear down his opponent.
"The question's going to turn on Al Gore's credibility," he said in an interview today. "This is so clear-cut. In the post-Clinton era, one of the key questions is whether voters want four more years of honesty problems."
But Mr. Gore and his aides were bubbling with confidence today, saying that the questions they had raised about the Texas budget embodied and brought into vivid relief the larger concerns they had been trying to highlight about Mr. Bush's experience and what they see as his nonchalant approach to governing.
To hammer home that last point, the Gore campaign has been repeating one of Mr. Bush's quips about the Texas budget. Asked about the budget recently, Mr. Bush alluded to his presidential hopes and said, "I hope I'm not here to deal with it."
And Mr. Gore, in a speech before labor leaders in Washington today, said, "I think that this week will be looked back upon as a turning point."
The Gore campaign also clearly saw its current line of attack in the context of Mr. Bush's campaign proposal for an enormous tax cut, something that voters have not demonstrated a sharp appetite for and that Mr. Gore has said would endanger continued prosperity.
The budget situation is portrayed differently by the two campaigns.
The Gore campaign cited recently released estimates about the cost overruns, primarily in its Medicaid and state prison programs, as evidence that the state budget was out of whack. Mr. Bush's aides said that the state's expected surplus of $1.1 billion would take care of the expenses, and on Thursday, when Mr. Gore came to Texas to denounce Mr. Bush's record on the governor's home turf, the state's Republican comptroller held a news conference in which she raised the surplus estimate to $1.4 billion.
But Mr. Gore did not seem to be cowed, and the Bush campaign stepped up its fight today. Mr. Fleischer said that it had asked Republican members of the House and Senate budget committees to hold news conferences in their districts and talk to reporters to make the case that Mr. Gore was playing fast, loose and dishonest with the facts.
The Bush campaign also arranged a conference call so that reporters could talk to Representative John Kasich, an Ohio Republican, who is chairman of the House Budget Committee.
"There's no deficit in Texas; there's a big surplus, and the vice president has the gall to try to distort this," Mr. Kasich said. "Texas has had six consecutive years of budget surpluses, balanced budgets, increased funding for education and tax cuts."
"By contrast," Mr. Kasich continued, "four of the eight budgets submitted by the Clinton-Gore administration over the past eight years have left the budget in deficits."
Several strategists said that part of what the Bush campaign was doing was serving notice to Mr. Gore, at a time when the presidential race is heating up and more voters may begin to pay attention, that it would not let any charge go unanswered.
David Doak, a Democratic strategist, said that the motivation behind the response by Mr. Bush and his advisers might be pure anger, amplified by the awareness that Mr. Gore was taking a page out of the kind of assault Mr. Bush's father waged against former Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts during the 1988 presidential campaign.
"Never underestimate the possibility that he may have just made Bush mad," Mr. Doak said. "These guys are human. They have emotions and feelings and pride and competitiveness."

Nasdaq Reverses Course As Focus Shifts to Earnings
The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.2 percent as investors returned their focus to corporate earnings, a day after pleasant surprises from the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The Nasdaq was off 90.11 points, to 4,094.45, while the Dow dropped 110.31 points, or 1 percent, to 10,733.56. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slumped 15.38 points, or 1 percent, to 1,480.19.

HEADLINE: Demolishing Democracy in Fiji

 BODY:
A model effort to create an equitable, multi-ethnic society in the South Pacific island nation of Fiji has been derailed by the forced removal of the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister. The United States and other democratic nations should press Fiji's new leaders to honor its Constitution, which in 1997 awarded ethnic Indian citizens the right to hold high office.
The recent upheaval was largely the work of George Speight, a part-Fijian businessman who stormed the Parliament in May with a group of armed followers and held three dozen people hostage, including Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, until last week. He accused Mr. Chaudhry of promoting pro-Indian policies. Mr. Speight says that Indians, who make up 44 percent of Fiji's population of 812,000, have too much economic and political clout. The siege ended when military leaders bowed to Mr. Speight's demands for a new government. 
 Fiji's new president, Ratu Josefa Iloilo, and its new prime minister, Laisenia Qarase, attempted to challenge Mr. Speight by not appointing rebel supporters to key cabinet positions. Mr. Speight responded by forcing Mr. Iloilo, who is elderly and ill, to make room in the administration for rebels and possibly for himself as well.
The international community should help Mr. Chaudhry's People's Coalition regain power. Britain, Australia and New Zealand have recalled their ambassadors because of the unrest, which has included looting and arson against Indian-owned stores, and are pushing Fiji to adopt constitutional rule again. Yesterday Britain went further, canceling assistance programs and military visits.
Fiji's military and new government seem intimidated by Mr. Speight and his small band of rebels. Mr. Speight is a demagogue who does not speak for the majority of indigenous Fijians. His racist, anti-democratic ideas will prevail unless Fiji's democrats and army commanders work together peacefully to renew constitutional rule.

HEADLINE: Putin Bends Clinton's Ear Hoping to Halt Missile Shield

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: NAHA, Japan, Saturday, July 22

 BODY:
At the summit meeting here of eight world leaders, where the focus was unremittingly on harmony, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met with President Clinton on Friday night to argue against American deployment of a national missile shield.
The two met during a break in the Group of 8 meeting under way here in Okinawa. National missile defense was the most attention-getting issue, because it exposed a rift in a well-scripted gathering. 
 Mr. Clinton joined Mr. Putin in a casual setting, a private dining room overlooking a hotel pool. Mr. Clinton wore a tan suit and an exhausted look. Mr. Putin, in a dark blue suit, shook Mr. Clinton's hand vigorously for the photographers but offered no Boris Yeltsin-style bear hug.
Flanked by aides, the two men spent 75 minutes discussing and disagreeing on security issues.
Of the national missile defense system, a senior administration official said, "President Clinton made clear, as he has publicly, that he has not made a decision, but he intends to make a decision during the course of this summer."
Mr. Putin, who met recently with the leaders of China and North Korea to solidify opposition to the building of such a system, briefed Mr. Clinton on an offer by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, to scrap his missile program if other countries provide him with rockets to explore space. American officials have reacted with skepticism.
"It's not entirely clear what is in Kim Jong Il's mind with regard to this possible trade-off," one official said. "A very dangerous idea would be that the international community would provide actual launch capability to North Korea."
Mr. Putin was not the only leader making the case against a United States missile shield. President Jacques Chirac of France, speaking to reporters, said the system might never work but nonetheless would prompt an arms race.
"It's of a nature to retrigger a proliferation of weapons, notably nuclear missiles," Mr. Chirac said. "Everything that goes in the direction of proliferation is a bad direction." Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany sided with the critics of the system, saying simply, "I'm skeptical."
But such disagreement was rare. Common ground was what this annual meeting was all about. For instance, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Putin issued a statement saying they would set up a center for the exchange of data between systems that provide early warning in case of a missile launching.
Leaders of the eight nations discussed other topics ranging from debt relief for developing nations and AIDS to oil prices and financial crime. "We are deeply concerned about the growth of armed conflict in the continent of Africa," said one unanimous decree.
Official events took place in a majestic seaside resort, the Cape Busena. Journalists, protesters and even top aides were stopped in their tracks at the front door. Few people with last names other than Clinton or Blair or Amato or Chirac or Chretien or Mori or Putin or Schroder could stroll easily through the metal detectors.
All of the leaders seemed to be sweating, and plainly not because of the intensity of the meeting. Mr. Chirac was wiping his forehead in the heat as he stopped in the hotel lobby to admire Okinawan schoolchildren in traditional dress who were beating drums and singing.
Mr. Clinton's schedule included the trivial, the serious and the in-between. This morning Mr. Clinton and Japan's Prime Minister, Yoshiro Mori, sat down to discuss economic and foreign policy issues. Later, they planted a tree together.
In the giant media centers set up in hotel ballrooms across the island to accommodate the thousands of reporters covering the meeting, "officials," "senior administration officials" and some people actually willing to use their real names briefed them on everything from the volatility of oil prices to the illicit trade indiamonds in Africa.
"On the area of debt reduction, there was a very lengthy and very good exchange," Lael Brainard, Mr. Clinton's adviser on international economic issues, said on Friday.
The Middle East also came up repeatedly, as leaders congratulated Mr. Clinton on his peacemaking efforts. He planned to remain here today, but his spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the president might scale back his schedule on Sunday to hurry back to Camp David.
Okinawa clearly was full of action, but Thomas S. Foley, the United States ambassador to Japan, staged a summit-related event Friday on a tinier island nearby. Reporters boarded a ferry to photograph Mr. Foley unveiling a plaque honoring the memory of Ernie Pyle, the celebrated war correspondent who died on Ie Shima during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945.

HEADLINE: Blurred Battle Lines Over Gentrification;
Son of Park Slope Seeks Share Of Boom, but Poor Have to Move

BYLINE: By DAVID BARSTOW 

 BODY:
Ronnie Fatato, the unrepentant gentrifier of Park Slope, is a man with sad, drooping eyes, and he assures you that deep down he is a real softy. But then there is that sign at the entrance to his offices. "Show Me the Money," it commands. The sign, he says, fits him fine, too.
In his office one day, Mr. Fatato -- a robust Show-Me-the-Money version -- insists that he does not care, not even a little, that a powerful neighborhood group called the Fifth Avenue Committee has branded him a destroyer of Park Slope, a landlord of uninhibited greed who evicts poor families to get twice the rent from Manhattan refugees venturing into Brooklyn. 
 What, he asks, do the do-gooders know about him? Do they know about his wife, a social worker who drives her Eldorado into Harlem? Do they know that he was born above his grandfather's beer business in lower Park Slope, or that his family hung tough back when the lower Slope was a ramshackle mess. As others pulled out, the Fatatos expanded into real estate and meatpacking. Where were the do-gooders when Ronnie Fatato, home from 14 months in Vietnam, was shoveling hamburger alongside Hispanics?
So now, as prosperity pushes the professional hordes right into Ronnie Fatato's lap, he asks another question: Why shouldn't he cash in? Where is the sin in clearing out "undesirables"? Hey, he tells you, he would love to live on Park Avenue, but he can't afford it. Do you hear him whining?
"This," he barks, "isn't Russia!"
Mr. Fatato says these things as if they were self-evident truths. Yet in truth, little is self-evident about Park Slope's latest gentrification war. It is a house of mirrors where self-proclaimed heroes extol the value of diversity, yet acknowledge their own roles in causing gentrification in the first place. Those they cast as villains profess a love for Park Slope, a hunger to improve the community -- all in the cause of raising the rents of longtime residents 50, 75, 100 percent.
Mr. Fatato, his antagonists and his tenants demonstrate the elusiveness of easy labels in the tangled economics of Park Slope, a place where the effects of gentrification were being debated long before the first latte was sold on Seventh Avenue.
The controversy found vivid new expression last fall when the Fifth Avenue Committee, a respected community development organization, declared a 36-block area of lower Park Slope a "displacement-free zone."
Warning against the evils of a monochromatic neighborhood, the committee pledged to intervene on behalf of low-income residents being forced from suddenly valuable apartments. The committee's earnest young leaders said they would try quiet diplomacy first. Where that failed, they promised noisy publicity. So they bused 70 people to picket the Long Island home of a landlord threatening to evict a pair of elderly sisters. End of eviction.
But when the committee turned its offensive on Ronnie Fatato, it encountered something else. One day the committee sent a Roman Catholic priest to ask Mr. Fatato to ease off on a 33 percent rent increase for a struggling single mother. Mr. Fatato, a Catholic, did not appreciate the guilt trip, and he says he strongly suspected that the committee hoped to raise its profile by making him and other landlords easy scapegoats. He sent the priest packing.
There is another sign on Mr. Fatato's office wall. It reads, "I'm the Boss, That's Why."
The Fatatos have deep roots in Park Slope, starting with Luigi Fatato, who opened the family business there in 1912. For decades the family lived in a small apartment above their Old Bohemian beer distributorship at the corner of Fourth Avenue and Second Street.
Today, Luigi's grandson, Mr. Fatato, commutes from a century-old Tudor in Irvington, a village in Westchester County. A 54-year-old father of four, he has the expansive, no-nonsense air of a blue-collar boy who made good. As big city landlords go, though, he is a minor player. He owns 30 units in four rent-stabilized buildings in lower Park Slope. But he also owns four walk-ups next to his meatpacking warehouse on Second Street. Because each walk-up has only three apartments, Mr. Fatato is allowed to charge whatever the market bears.
For years that was not much. In the early 1990's, he plowed money into his apartments to attract some of the same young professionals who were flocking to upper Park Slope. No one came. So Mr. Fatato continued to rent to low-income Hispanics who, over all, say they regarded him as a fair and forgiving landlord. If they fell behind on rent, he set up payment plans, or even wrote off rent debts. "They come in, they cry the blues, how you gonna throw them out?" he asks.
The market changed last year. Finally the white-collar crowds were coming, driven down the hill by $2,500-a-month rents in the upper Slope. Mr. Fatato made his move early last summer. He informed his tenants that he intended to raise rents by 30 percent and higher, knowing that they could not afford such increases. He was counting on it. To soften the blow, and avoid costly legal battles, he paid moving expenses and waived back rent.
Still, there was no sugarcoating the disrupted lives.
Mr. Fatato set up Diana Jaramillo, a single mother of four, in one of his rent-stabilized apartments. The new place has no dining room and only two bedrooms, not three. Isolda Noboa, forced to move with her three children into her parents' home, says the stress broke up her marriage. "He destroyed our lives," she says of Mr. Fatato.
As tenants moved out, Mr. Fatato sent in work crews to build new kitchens and bathrooms. But one tenant refused to go. Martha Marquez, 34, makes $19,000 a year in a Park Slope day care center. She and her 12-year-old son have lived in one of Mr. Fatato's walk-ups for nine years. Her rent had been raised once, to $750 from $700. Now it was going to $1,000.
She went to Mr. Fatato. "I was like, 'Why are you raising the rent so much?' And he said, 'Because I can get it.' And that's when I got angry. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you do it," she says. And then, "You don't cut people's throats to get ahead when you're already ahead."
Looking for legal help, she turned to the Fifth Avenue Committee, where her son's godmother works. She knew nothing of the displacement-free zone, but the committee has long been a powerful force in the resurrection of lower Park Slope. For more than two decades, it has raised millions to rehabilitate 112 buildings in the lower Slope, transforming dilapidated properties into attractive affordable housing.
It is a proud record, and yet the committee's leaders recognize the inherent economic contradiction: The nicer they make the neighborhood, the more people want to live there. This drives up rents, thus driving out the very low-income people they want to help. "In some ironic way, we're a piece of the problem," says Benjamin Dulchin, a committee staff member.
The displacement-free zone is an effort to organize a grass-roots rebellion against these sweeping forces. Throughout the zone -- between Third and Sixth Avenues, from Bergen to Second Streets -- the committee has put up posters and filled dozens of street boxes with fliers. The point, says Brad S. Lander, the committee's executive director, is to avoid the fate of upper Park Slope. His message to landlords is simple: "Don't be greedy. Honor our racial and economic diversity along with your bank account."
The committee eagerly took up Ms. Marquez's cause. When diplomacy failed -- that is, when the priest returned empty-handed -- the campaign rapidly escalated. Local supermarkets were picketed to pressure the managers into boycotting Mr. Fatato's hamburger meat. The committee asked hundreds of people to mail postcards of protest to Mr. Fatato. Volunteers handed out leaflets outside the bank Mr. Fatato uses.
"Don't let Ronald Fatato grind our neighborhood into meat patties," one flier said.
Mr. Fatato raged about "Mafia tactics," then fought back with a vengeance. To anyone who sent him a postcard, he sent back a letter revealing that he had sued Ms. Marquez repeatedly for not paying rent, that she was more than $2,600 in arrears, that she had repeatedly failed to abide by repayment plans. "When we could have thrown her out," he says, "we didn't."
Ms. Marquez blames bureaucratic foul-ups with her city rent subsidies.
"I've been there nine years," she says, "so how bad a tenant could I be?"
With Mr. Fatato undaunted by bad publicity, the committee supplied Ms. Marquez with a lawyer to fight eviction in Housing Court. This, too, failed. Ms. Marquez has until July 31 to get out.
So Ronnie Fatato has won, but what of the neighborhood? To the Fifth Avenue Committee, the price is clear: A group of Hispanics, longtime residents who contributed to the texture and stability of the community, has been forced out.
But Mr. Fatato contends that he has improved the neighborhood's diversity. His walk-ups are now a mix of black, white, Hispanic and Asian tenants, and they include a legal secretary, a box salesman and a stylist at Lord & Taylor.
The box salesman, Adam Goldstein, 29 and single, is thrilled with his new place. "It's huge," he says. "They're getting two grand in Central Slope for the same thing, and I've got the four best restaurants in Park Slope right here." He pays $1,500 a month, more than double what Diana Jaramillo paid for the same apartment.
The unrepentant gentrifier couldn't be happier. He is already thinking about his next rent increases.

HEADLINE: High-Rise Fires Stir Chaos And Doubts in Jersey City

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, July 21

 BODY:
Simultaneous fires in two new high-rises on this city's booming waterfront and subsequent safety citations at one of the buildings have prompted concern that construction could be outpacing the city's capacity to ensure fire safety, officials said yesterday.
A power surge on Thursday night caused havoc in a rapidly developing section along the Hudson River opposite Lower Manhattan, setting off transformer fires in an office building and a nearby apartment tower where residents say alarms failed to function despite thick, black smoke on the lower floors that injured four people. The surge brought blaring sirens and widespread confusion along Washington Boulevard, the main thoroughfare on the stretch of waterfront known as the New Jersey Gold Coast. 
 The skyline here has grown with apartments and office buildings in recent years as a thriving economy has generated thousands of jobs and attracted tenants to spaces less expensive than those in Manhattan. But the rapid growth has also created added fire safety concerns.
"It's very tough to keep up with the construction going on in this city," said Steven J. McGill, assistant director of the Jersey City Fire Department.
The department has started a new training program to prepare for emergencies in high-rises, Firefighter McGill said. "The simultaneous fires we had last night shows us that we do need to be diligent in maintaining good training."
Just after 8:30 p.m., officials said, the power surge caused an electrical transformer to explode at 525 Washington Boulevard, a 14-story office building that opened this year. The resulting fire set off an automatic alarm, Firefighter McGill said, and firefighters responded.
Minutes later, at 8:42 p.m., firefighters were called to Portofino, a 26-story apartment building at 1 Second Street, just off the boulevard about two blocks away. The surge also caused power failures at another apartment tower, at 20 Second Street, and at a nearby shopping plaza. A Public Service Electric & Gas spokeswoman said the utility was investigating the power surge, which occurred in three underground cables.
Firefighter McGill said the transformer fire at Portofino quickly died down, but the two lowest floors had already filled with smoke. Firefighters were unable to locate controls for the building's heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system, which carried smoke throughout the building, he said. Firefighters met several tenants in a stairwell who said an elevator had filled with smoke. They were led out, holding hands, through the smoky lobby.
"It was pretty scary," said Meredith Battin, 21, an intern at American Express in Jersey City. "The firemen were wearing gas masks when they opened the door, which wasn't very comforting."
Residents of the building, where 172 of the 282 apartments are occupied, were allowed back in at 11:05 p.m. "I'm pretty unhappy about the fact that the alarm didn't go off, seriously," said Ken Parrett, 44, a computer project manager for Barclays Bank in Manhattan. "I'm going to move out. You don't get two chances."
The apartment building, which is not 100 percent complete and is operating under a temporary certificate of occupancy, has an automatic alarm system, but it was not turned on, officials said. Under an agreement with the city, the alarm can remain off during the day, so that construction work does not set it off, but it must be turned on each night.
After an inspection today, the building's owner was ordered to correct seven fire safety violations, although none appeared to have contributed to the transformer fire, Firefighter McGill said. The building was ordered, for example, to submit a fire safety plan and evacuation procedure, make sure the alarm was on at all times, post adequate signs, and cover an exposed wire.
Laverne McCall, president of Roseland Management Company, a subsidiary of Portofino's owner, Roseland Property Company of Millburn, N.J., insisted the building was safe. She said she did not know why the alarm was off. Ms. McCall also said there was no fire, only smoke.
Firefighter McGill, however, said firefighters saw flames in the room with the transformer, which was singed.
No fire safety violations were found at the office building, he said. But fire safety violations were found at the apartment building that experienced a power failure but no fire, he said. It was inspected as a precaution.
The department's full complement of more than 100 firefighters was called out to fight the two fires, and George Geyer, president of the city firefighters' union, said the department's staffing of 595 had not kept up with the city's growth.
Tom Gallagher, Mayor Bret Schundler's chief of staff, said the department had made efforts to put as many uniformed firefighters on the street as possible but said modern firefighting was as much a matter of training and technology as of simple manpower.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: GOVERNOR BUSH'S JOURNEY;
After Yale, Bush Ambled Amiably Into His Future

SERIES: GEORGE BUSH'S JOURNEY: A Man Adrift

BYLINE: By JO THOMAS 

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
George W. Bush left Yale University in the spring of 1968 with a diploma in hand but no plans for what to do with it.
So for five years, not unlike many young men his age, he drifted. 
 He lived in three states, had at least seven apartments and at least that many girlfriends, held three full-time jobs -- one in business, one in politics and one in public service -- and learned to fly fighter jets with the Air National Guard.
"There are some people who, the minute they get out of college, know exactly what they want to do," he said in a recent interview about what he calls his nomadic years. "I did not. And it didn't bother me. That's just the way it was."
These youthful years also contain the gray areas of his biography: periods of unemployment and a hiatus of at least six months in his National Guard obligations while he worked on a political campaign.
And this was a period in which Mr. Bush has seemed to acknowledge trying drugs, if only by not denying that he did. Although he has steadfastly refused to answer directly whether he used marijuana, cocaine or other illegal drugs, he said last August that he could have passed a 15-year F.B.I. background check when his father became president, apparently ruling out drug use since 1974, but not before.
Of those preceding years, he stood on an earlier answer: "When I was young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible."
But in dozens of interviews conducted over several months, friends, former girlfriends, neighbors and roommates said they did not recall seeing any signs of drug use.
Indeed, the interviews and an examination of National Guard records create a complicated and sometimes contradictory portrait of Mr. Bush at that time in his life.
Mr. Bush sometimes seemed to inhabit two distinctly different social worlds, on some nights joining poolside parties at the Chateau Dijon, an upscale apartment for young professionals, and on others attending formal dances sponsored by an elite club of 100 bachelors.
He spent more than a year learning to fly supersonic military jets, becoming, by most accounts, among the best in his squadron. Yet he gave up flying -- and for months on end failed to show up for alternative military duty as he had promised, instead working on the hopeless campaign of a political neophyte running against one of the most powerful men on Capitol Hill.
He counted among his friends people who today say they smoked marijuana back then, and acquaintances say they saw him at a popular nightclub where pot was sometimes smoked. (Mr. Bush says he does not recall going there.) Yet dozens of people who knew him well described him as a conservative who preferred to party with beer. These friends professed to be baffled by the questions of drug use that have cropped up in his presidential campaign.
He went for months without a steady job, and the jobs he held all came from associates of his father. And he seemed to inhabit a series of successively cheaper, less exclusive apartments in Houston, a city that was about to boom on oil money. Yet friends and acquaintances recalled Mr. Bush as a stable, outgoing, hardworking, unpretentious, idealistic young man who cherished his family and was simply trying to figure out how to make his own way in the world, something he would do a few years later as he started his own business and ran for Congress.
 
At Ease in a Brooks Brothers Suit
Just before leaving Yale, Mr. Bush was accepted into the Texas Air National Guard, thanks largely to the prominence of his family. It was a path that reduced the chance of his being sent to Vietnam. After a summer of basic training, he spent two years on active duty learning to fly, first in Georgia and later at Ellington Air Force Base, near Houston.
Susan Munson, who met him at a poolside rice-and-beans party she held in 1970 and dated him off and on for several years, recalled that he was very good at arguing.
"He was conservative, and he hung around with people who were more liberal," Ms. Munson said. "Most of George's friends were the type who would sit on the floor with torn jeans and T-shirts. They were people who were well-educated and interested in making the world better."
Another woman who dated Mr. Bush at the time remembered him as "very nice, very straight. There was a little tension between the two of us. I was 'little miss liberal.' He was more conventional than people I knew." The woman, a former beauty queen who is now a lawyer living outside Texas, asked that her name not be used.
"There was a lot of counterculture stuff going on," she said, but "I've been mystified by the rumors about drugs. He wasn't using drugs. I thought he was about the straightest person I knew. He was straight in a refreshing way. He had a very good sense of humor. He had an edge, an energy, charisma. He could be wild and go to a party and drink a lot, but he was a very conventional college guy. He could have been a college guy from the early 60's."
Robert H. Gow, a colleague of Mr. Bush's father, who hired young George W. in early 1971 to work at his agricultural and horticultural conglomerate, Stratford of Houston, remembered him as "a presentable, attractive young college student."
"I've heard all this about a wild youth, but I never saw it," he said. "He was wearing a Brooks Brothers suit. He showed up on time and worked well past five, as we all did." Mr. Bush was assigned to research small nurseries that Mr. Gow hoped to acquire, a job that occasionally took him to Central America. His new boss had been an executive at the elder Bush's Zapata Oil Company and a guest at the Bush home. He gave his young employee a friendly ear.
"George liked to talk," Mr. Gow said. "He was searching for what to do. He was constantly wanting to talk about what to do with his life."
Houston itself was poised for a boom. The 1970's would bring 200 corporations and a flood of newcomers that reached 6,000 a month. As Houston expanded to cover 450 square miles, anything but zoning and mass transit seemed possible.
"It was a big change from what I knew in New England," Mr. Gow recalled. "One time, possibly at the Bushes', I went to a dinner party where one man was talking about walking on the moon. Another transplanted hearts. Another was digging for gold in Guyana. George and I were talking about drilling for oil at the bottom of the ocean. My father thought everybody in Texas must be mad."
 
The Dorm Away From College
On the raw southwestern edge of Houston in the early 1970's, just after the glittering Galleria shopping complex opened, the Chateau Dijon apartments were the place to live if you were young, ambitious and well-to-do.
The complex on Beverly Hill Street included a mock French chateau and a web of 300 semitropical garden apartments connected by walkways and set among oak trees and swimming pools. One tenant rented an extra apartment for his wine collection. Another, an inventor, used his apartment as a lab.
George W. Bush called it home.
The developer built the Chateau Dijon to be beautiful and comfortable and hired Mildred Alexander, a formidable widow with high-society credentials, as the manager who could keep it that way.
"She knew everybody's family," recalled Robert Sakowitz, the department store heir. "If you made too much noise, she'd let you know. It was a bit like a dormitory; it had that kind of feeling."
John W. Link, who lived in the apartments after law school, said, "You could literally have a whole social life without going outside the Chateau Dijon. You would date different people, and there were groups inside of groups. The guys would have contests: this week, we'll date from only this side of the street."
"Houston was on the edge of the sexual revolution," Mr. Link recalled. "It got here, but it didn't quite get here. We were not L.A., not New York. We were all young, trying to make a living."
Former neighbors at the Chateau remembered the youthful Mr. Bush as a "regular guy" who did not try to capitalize on his family name. But the Bush name was hard to miss. In the fall of 1970, his father ran for the Senate against the father of another Chateau resident, Lloyd M. Bentsen III, a member of a powerful and wealthy Texas family. Mr. Bush worked in the campaign.
"We had Bush banners stretched across the street," remembered Louis Atlas, a neighbor. "We had banners on our cars. The girls wore Bush scarves."
In an interview, Mr. Bush smiled as he recalled his days at the Chateau Dijon. "I'm a person who makes friends easily," he said. "It didn't matter whether I'd grown up there and gone to the University of Texas. There were University of Texas people there and a lot of other people. My wife-to-be was living in the apartments, although I didn't know her. She was at the other end -- I was at the sedate end, of course. But we had fun. We had a lot of fun."
"All of us had jobs," he added. "It wasn't a bunch of people hanging around." He said he did not remember attending the banana daiquiri parties for which two of his friends were famous. "That was a little sophisticated for me," he said. "I might have been more willing to drink beer."
Some of the residents of the Chateau, including Mr. Bush, belonged to a social club that was a far cry from beer parties in someone's apartment. It was the Master's Club, an elite group of about 100 bachelors that held formal dances at local country clubs, allowing its members to keep a toehold in the comfortable, exclusive world in which most of them were raised.
Jim Woodson, the club's organizer and now a Houston real estate executive, got the idea for the name from the golf tournament. The club's parties, he said, offered "a controlled atmosphere. You knew who was dancing next to you."
Ms. Munson remembers the less formal side of the future presidential candidate, the side that cared little about his appearance, for example. "George would wear his father's suit coats when he'd throw them away," Ms. Munson said. "They were obviously his father's suit coats. George wasn't as tall."
"George was interested in people," Ms. Munson said. "He seemed to like to sit around and talk about serious things in a fun way. You didn't get that with most of the guys there. He knew he wanted to own a baseball team, and he wanted to do politics," she said. "He wasn't sure how he was going to get to those goals.'
 
A Frugal, Not Prodigal, Son
In late spring 1971, Mr. Bush moved from the Chateau Dijon to an unfurnished one-bedroom garage apartment at 2039 1/2 South Boulevard, an elegant neighborhood near Rice University. Donald Ensenat, an old friend, shared this apartment for the rest of that year.
Rosemary Thornton, whose widowed mother, Georgia Corbett, rented the main house at 2039 South Boulevard, said her mother, who was 75 then, liked to sit out on her patio and would banter with Mr. Bush, who "had to walk down her driveway to get to his place."
Mrs. Thornton also recalled her mother's saying: "He doesn't seem lonesome, but you never see him with groups or other people. He's always alone."
In the fall of 1971, after a year of work at Stratford, Mr. Bush quit and was unemployed for the next five or six months. In an interview he said he spent the time flying with the Air National Guard. He was 25.
His father had given up his seat in Congress and was living with his mother in the Waldorf Towers in New York, serving the Nixon administration as its United Nations ambassador.
But according to his parents, there was never any concern about what young George was doing with his life.
In a recent interview, former President George Bush and his wife, Barbara, were both asked whether they worried about their son's nomadic period and both dismissed the question.
"He wasn't aimless," Mrs. Bush said. "I don't know why they say that."
She added: "We never worried about it. That's sort of a fiction-ary thing."
Governor Bush echoed the thought. "I think they must have had pretty good confidence in their ability to raise children," he said, "plus they had other children to worry about, too. A teenager is a heck of a lot harder to raise than a guy who has just gotten out of college."
He added that he did not ask them for financial support. "I was supporting myself," he said. "I wasn't calling them saying, 'Hey, I'm out of money again,' or 'Help!' I was making a living."
"It's not that hard to get along financially if you don't have a lot of desires," he added, "and I wasn't spending a lot of money. I think my friends will tell you I'm a frugal person. I was not living it up big time."
Even though his parents profess to have had little concern at the time, one of his father's friends came forward in May 1972 to offer him a job. Jimmy Allison, a former newspaper publisher in Midland, Tex., who had served as a political adviser to the elder Bush, recruited Mr. Bush to go to Alabama to join the Senate campaign of Winton M. Blount, a Republican novice running against a powerful Democratic incumbent, John J. Sparkman.
In a recent interview, Mr. Bush described Mr. Allison, now dead, as "an older figure who served as a mentor in a way, a wonderful friend."
Mr. Blount, a millionaire contractor known throughout Alabama as Red, had served three years as President Nixon's postmaster general but had never run for elective office. After he announced his intention to run, a newspaper columnist remarked that Mr. Blount must have decided "it's as good a time as any to go over Niagara in a barrel."
Nee Bear, who dated Mr. Bush at the time, said she was struck by how hard Mr. Bush worked for Mr. Blount.
"He wanted to be a hands-on guy," remembered Ms. Bear, who first met Mr. Bush while working on the campaign. "He put bumper stickers on in the parking lot, and believe me, that is the pits. At that time in Alabama, people would spit on you if you were a Republican."
Kay Blount Miles, who worked in the office for her father's campaign, remembered Mr. Bush as "funny and fun to be around. He was good at keeping the office up. He worked as part of the team. I never felt he was somebody from the outside coming in."
But it was an uphill battle. Former Gov. George C. Wallace heaped scorn on Mr. Blount for living in a Montgomery mansion with, as Mr. Wallace exaggerated it, 26 bathrooms. Even President Nixon, a fellow Republican, did not help for fear of angering the powerful Senator Sparkman, even though he was a Democrat.
"President Nixon did not support me," Mr. Blount recalled. "Sparkman was a leading senator, and the president needed his support."
Mr. Bush, who monitored the polls, kept the bad news to himself. Not until Election Day did he warn Devere Mclennan, who worked for him and shared an apartment with him, what to expect. "George explained to me we weren't going to win," said Mr. Mclennan, who was expecting a victory.
In an interview 28 years later, Mr. Bush remembered the numbers. "We all teamed together and helped Red get about 36 percent of the vote," he said with a short laugh, "in spite of the fact that Nixon had gotten 72 percent of the vote. The ticket-splitting was phenomenal."
When Mr. Bush went to work on the campaign he was still obligated to serve in the National Guard, and accordingly he sought a transfer to Alabama. His original request, to serve with the 9921st Air Reserve Squadron in Montgomery, was rejected because the unit would not meet his military obligation. He requested another assignment in July, and the Texas Air National Guard recommended letting him serve with another Montgomery group, the 187th Tactical Recon Group, from September to November 1972.
On Sept. 15, 1972, the head of personnel for that unit wrote: "Lieutenant Bush should report to Lt. Col. William Turnipseed, DCO, to perform equivalent training."
Questions about Mr. Bush's military service arose in May when The Boston Globe quoted Mr. Turnipseed, who retired as a general, as saying Mr. Bush never appeared for duty.
In a recent interview, the general took a tiny step back, saying, "I don't think he did, but I wouldn't stake my life on it. I think I would have remembered him. The chances are 99 percent he didn't."
In an interview, Mr. Bush disagreed. "I was there. I know this guy was quoted as saying I wasn't, but I was there."
Emily Marks, who worked in the Blount campaign and dated Mr. Bush, said she recalls that he returned to Montgomery after the election to serve with the Air National Guard.
National Guard records provided by the Guard and by the Bush campaign indicate he did serve on Nov. 29, 1972, after the election. These records also show a gap in service from that time to the previous May. Mr. Bush says he made up for the lost time in subsequent months, and guard records show he received credit for having performed all the required service.
 
Young Man Without a Game Plan
Back in Houston, Mr. Bush went to live in a four-unit apartment building at 2910 Westheimer, a busy east-west artery. His downstairs neighbor, a florist, had a dog and refused to let the landlord spray pesticides, Ms. Munson recalled, and "the roaches were just terrible."
Ms. Bear agreed: "It was little and dumpy, and there were a lot of bugs. It wasn't a nice place. He drove a white Cutlass, dirty laundry, tennis shoes, and everything else in the back of his car -- just like a guy. No Gucci loafers or things like that."
Asked about other women in Mr. Bush's life at the time, Ms. Bear said: "Not that summer. Well, I don't know. I spent a good deal of time with him. Mr. Lothario I never got the idea that he was. Do you get the impression he's a big romantic? I don't. He never was wolfish. He was a decent guy. He would never be a kiss-and-tell guy. Never."
In January 1973, Mr. Bush went to work for a Houston youth program, Professional United Leadership League, or PULL, set up by John L. White, a former professional football player who knew Mr. Bush's father.
"John had a vision of matching off-season athletes with city kids in the Third Ward, and he wanted me to come work with him," Mr. Bush said. "It was 27 years ago, so I don't remember the exact incident where John and I met each other, but I went down, and it was a great experience.
"I was coming from the west side of town, and this was in the inner city. I saw a lot of tragedy, and I saw a lot of goodness. I saw people who really cared about kids. There are some success stories out of that program, and there are some horrible failures, including this one little boy whom he and I had a very close attachment to, named Jimmy Dean, who's dead, shot on the streets of Houston."
Ms. Bear recalled that Mr. Bush "was trying to get a lot of the baseball players from the Astros and professional athletes to come there and show kids there was a way out. He spent time and energy on those children. He wasn't a dilettante who comes in and says, 'This will look good on my resume.'
Ms. Bear remembered that he liked simple pleasures. She said she never went to a night club with him. "We went to the VFW dance hall in Navasota, Tex., where you saw little old ladies dancing with each other in their housedresses and listened to Bob Wills and the Texas Troubadours. He loved it."
It was during this time that Mr. Bush applied to Harvard Business School, a move for which he thanks Mr. White. "A friend of mine sent me the application, and I really didn't seem to be that interested," Mr. Bush said. "And his attitude was, 'Well, it's a great challenge, and you ought to try it.' "
"So I filled out the application. I don't remember all of it, but I got in, and I wasn't really that excited about going. I think if you look at my full life, I have never been a person---- I haven't had a game plan. I could put it in the perspective of this race: I've never said, 'Gosh, I'll do this in high school, and then this will lead to that, and I'll end up being president.' Or, 'I will go to Harvard Business School so I can be president.'
"The truth of the matter is, I don't know what I'm going to do next, and it doesn't bother me. I do know I'm going to be the president, at least I think I am. We're about to find out in about four months. But I don't know what's after that. I truly don't."

Millionaire
 The Philanderer, Gambler, and Duelist Who Invented Modern Finance.
 By Janet Gleeson.
 303 pp. New York:
 Simon & Schuster. $24. 
 THE buzz surrounding the American publication of Janet Gleeson's book probably owes much to Regis Philbin. After all, the British edition of "Millionaire," published last year, was called simply "The Moneymaker." But that small editorial tweak+and the savvy marketing instincts behind it+speak volumes about just how drunk with dreams of instant wealth Americans are these days.
And it is precisely that delirium -Who wants to read about a millionaire?' -- that makes this rollicking tale so captivating and potentially so instructive. John Law was a charismatic Scottish playboy with a flair for finance who wielded extraordinary influence in the French court in the early 1700's. No history of banking or finance is complete without some anecdotal account of the man who introduced the French both to paper currency and to the stock-market form of "irrational exuberance."
The object of the mad desire was a banking and investment conglomerate that was supposed to enrich its shareholders by colonizing French territory in the vast Mississippi River basin. Frenzied speculation in the company's shares, a Gallic parallel of the South Sea Bubble that puffed up the British market over the same period, generated so much paper wealth in Paris that the French coined a word for the newly rich hordes: "millionaire."
But, unfortunately for Law and the investors, few Frenchmen wanted to leave their Bordelais hamlets and Parisian slums for the distant, inhospitable wilderness. When the bubble burst in 1720, Law took many of the freshly minted millionaires down with him and reinforced the hard-money bias that the French bourgeoisie carried well into the 20th century. The company's collapse allowed the American government to acquire the territory later, in the Louisiana Purchase. (It is sobering to realize that but for John Law, folks would be speaking French in Little Rock.)
This is not the first account of Law's life. Indeed, a biography was in print in 1824, less than a century after Law's death in 1729, and an account of the bubble was included in Charles Mackay's 1841 classic, "Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds." Since then, everyone from John Kenneth Galbraith (in his 1975 book, "Money: Whence It Came, Where It Went") to James Buchan (in his quirky but elegant 1997 meditation, "Frozen Desire: The Meaning of Money") has described this enigmatic Scotsman's brief moment of fame.
They have all built their stories from the same promising timber.+John Law was born in 1671, the pampered eldest son of a wealthy Edinburgh goldsmith. He came into his inheritance at the age of 12, developing over the next decade into a handsome but headstrong young lounge lizard who would have squandered his entire legacy at the gaming tables in London if his sensible mother had not rescued him. He came to his senses, after a fashion, continuing to gamble heavily but trying to reduce his risks by mastering and applying some early treatises on the laws of probability.
His self-indulgent life as a minor-league ladies' man and major-league gambler in London came to a shocking end in 1694 when he killed a man in a duel, was convicted of murder and somehow cheated the hangman by escaping from prison. Gleeson deftly analyzes the arcane court rulings and political forces that beset Law's defense, and she offers a plausible explanation for Law's seemingly miraculous deliverance from his dungeon.
Law made his way to the continent, gravitating toward Amsterdam and Italy, both fertile centers of financial innovation as well as attractive playpens for the idle rich who were his usual prey at the gaming tables. As early as 1609, the Bank of Amsterdam was receiving deposits of precious metal coins of all sorts and exchanging them for paper notes that could be used as legal tender in trade -- an important forerunner of today's paper currencies. Documentation is scarce, but Gleeson assumes that Law studied and embraced these revolutionary concepts during his travels.
By 1697, as Gleeson tells it, Law had drifted to Paris, where he spent time "in stylish salons mingling with the elite, gaining their confidence with his insinuating charm and impeccable manners before fleecing them at faro and basset, two of the most fashionable and high-rolling games of the day." The fleeced French apparently did not ban Law from their salons because he was simply so attractive -- tall, intelligent, supremely self-possessed and always elegantly in fashion.
But just as he scandalized London society with his fatal swordplay, Law shocked the jaded Parisians too -- by eloping to Venice with another man's wife, Katherine Knowles Seigneur, who left her French husband and became Law's lifelong companion and the mother of his children.
Gleeson's narrative lags a bit as she follows her hero back to Scotland, where his growing fascination with practical economics produced a 120-page pamphlet in 1705 called "Money and Trade Considered With a Proposal for Supplying the Nation With Money," which called for the creation of a national bank that could issue paper currency backed by Scotland's supply of land. But his life and Gleeson's book surge into overdrive when Law returns to Paris a few years later and gradually attracts the attention, then the patronage, of Philippe, Duc d'Orleans, the French regent after the death of Louis XIV in 1715.
Despite the successful Amsterdam bank and the fledgling Bank of England, the French were resistant to the notion of a national bank issuing paper currency at the whim of an absolute monarch. Law initially compromised with a private shareholder-owned bank. But he later sold the bank, and its subsidiary Mississippi venture, to the royal government, enriching shareholders (himself and the French regent among them) but ensuring that the bank's problems would be painfully shared by the crown. When disaster came, he narrowly escaped the gallows once again by fleeing France, leaving his adored wife and virtually all his once-dazzling wealth behind.
"Millionaire" does not throw much new light on Law's motivations, and the occasional forays into psychoanalysis are inconsistent and unpersuasive. Some historians may also argue that this account overstates Law's contributions to modern finance, given the more solid contributions of Amsterdam and British bankers. But Gleeson, whose book "The Arcanum" managed to infuse drama into the search for the industrial formula for porcelain, makes excellent use of this much more significant historic material. Her obvious passion for her story carries the reader along from crisis to crisis, and her eye for sensual detail allows her to recreate vividly the opulent world of French regency society, a world whose hunger for easy wealth and willingness to suspend common sense in pursuit of it emerges finally, chillingly, as very like our own.

SUNNYVALE
 The Rise and Fall
 of a Silicon Valley Family.
 By Jeff Goodell.
 252 pp. New York:
 Villard. $24.95. 
 It's no wonder that Darwinian models of society are so popular these days. Great technological leaps tend to leave many people behind, and citing "the survival of the fittest" is still the niftiest guilt-free way to account for those struggling in the wake of change. It's fun to talk about the visionaries, the I.P.O. tycoons, even the average person empowered by the personal computer. But what about those who are ill equipped to hop on the digital express?
"Sunnyvale," Jeff Goodell's affecting memoir, has just these people in mind. Its irony-saturated title alone might tip you off that all hasn't always been well in the California birthplace of the computer revolution, which happens to be Goodell's home turf, too. A seasoned technology journalist, Goodell has now turned his eye on his own beginnings in the land that launched a billion microchips, and it's not always a pretty sight.
"I loved the word Sunnyvale," Goodell writes. "It was different from the names of towns around us -- like San Jose and Palo Alto and San Francisco, which had a dreamy, old Spanish romance about them. And it was not a name like Silicon Valley, which Sunnyvale was right in the middle of, but which always made me think of breasts and robots." Sunnyvale, for Goodell, possessed that eternal optimism that, as his epigraph from Kafka reminds us, is the American trademark. But optimism has a price -- namely, disappointment. The first glimmerings come when Goodell, the oldest of three children, is 19; he watches his family endure a painful divorce. His father, Ray, is a landscaper and a good family man, but his penchant for substituting home improvement projects for real emotional interaction has driven the mother of his children away. She lands a new job at a computer start-up called -- you guessed it -- Apple.
"Sunnyvale" isn't, however, about those famous garage-geek prophets Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. It's about people who can't speak their hearts even as they watch the world they know spin away. Though his mother has broken up the family, it's his father whom the young Goodell grows to resent. The man's poor business decisions, and his helplessness in the high-speed economy, are too much for his son to bear. Goodell keeps his distance as Ray -- who is estranged from his own father, a celebrated engineer -- retreats further into his Stone Age faith in home, hearth and earth even as he occupies a grim condo. Meanwhile Goodell does a brief stint at Apple, too -- the company is "just I.B.M. with long hair," he believes -- before setting out for Lake Tahoe to work in the casinos. "So, basically, you're a Luddite," Goodell's boss at Apple, who is soon to be an overnight millionaire, tells him at their goodbye lunch.
But as his later career would make obvious, it wasn't fear of machines that sent Goodell packing. He needed to escape the stultification, and the heartache, he felt at home, even if home was the epicenter of a brave (and arrogant) new world. After Tahoe, Goodell attends Berkeley and then moves to New York, where he falls in love and discovers his journalistic calling. Escape is not so simple for his younger brother, Jerry, an aspiring musician. Goodell watches his brother self-destruct through drug and alcohol abuse, and he tries to pin down a cause for it: "Maybe Jerry was doomed by a clump of disfigured receptors deep in his hypothalamus," he writes. At another point, he adds: "He was an old-fashioned romantic and completely at odds with the reigning faith of the world we grew up in, which held that everything can be reduced to the ones and zeroes of computer code."
The book's attempt to contrast the cyberutopian ideal of Silicon Valley with the everyday suffering of a single family is occasionally a stretch, but Goodell's story, despite, or maybe because of, its inexorability, is riveting. When sickness and death ravage his universe, Goodell must confront what his hometown has always taught him to ignore. "It was as if by moving to a town with a deathless name like Sunnyvale, we had somehow found a loophole in life's mortality clause," he writes. Then he adds, "Our days as immortals were over now."

Command Performance
 An Actress in the Theater of Politics.
 By Jane Alexander.
 Illustrated. 335 pp. New York:
 PublicAffairs. $25. 
 Jane Alexander, the actress who was chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts from 1993 to 1997, has written a memoir of her term there, and an earnest, nave and dispiriting document it is. Not dispiriting because Alexander failed to fight a good fight; by her own lights, the simple fact that the endowment was not eliminated under her watch, just further crippled, constitutes a triumph. The true cause for despair is her picture of the blind and deaf philistinism of American politicians.
Alexander, a warmhearted liberal from the 1960's, was tapped by the Clinton administration early on. The first working artist to assume the position, she was bright, personable, famous and well-groomed enough (or so it was hoped) to disarm her opponents. Beaming with idealism, an amusingly self-styled "Jane of Art," she wooed her way to a triumphant Senate confirmation that nearly everyone, on all sides of the culture wars, applauded.
At first, while she had her troubles with Republican and conservative Democratic opponents, she seemed to be making headway. After the Republican sweep of Congress in 1994, her job became a war of attrition. She won in that the agency survived, but her hair turned white and she chose to leave at the expiration of her first four-year term.
The interest in "Command Performance" lies in its anecdotal descriptions of friends and foes: of Strom Thurmond and her hero, Teddy Kennedy, and Jesse Helms and Orrin Hatch and Nancy Kassebaum and a West Texas congressman named Charles Stenholm, leader of the 25 "blue dog" Democrats, described as moderate Westerners who were so inundated with hate mail from the Christian right, and so reflexively anti-gay, that they could not see the endowment as anything but a nest of homosexuals.
For the salvation of her soul, or at least her conscience, Alexander gradually lets her anger break through her veil of well-mannered deference and tactical discretion. She admits to despising the crude, not to say nakedly hostile, disdain for the arts in our nation's capital. The charming but elusive President Clinton essentially ignored the issue, concerned about keeping the endowment out of the news and delegating arts matters to his wife. Alexander rightly complains that Newt Gingrich would not make an appointment to meet with her, but neither would Clinton, for months on end. Yet the President never entirely deserted her, because for him the endowment was as potent a symbol as it was for the right.
Alexander's principal animus is toward the generally debased level of discourse in Congress and the Gingrich Republicans, stubbornly intent on subverting the best interests of their constituents and their own beloved local arts institutions in favor of ideological purity and party loyalty. Tom DeLay's "brain could fit in an eggcup as far as I could tell." "I was extremely angry with Congress. I felt contempt for many of the members and despair over the level to which our federal government had sunk."
Peter Hoekstra, a Republican representative from Michigan who chaired a key subcommittee, practiced "harassment pure and simple," Alexander writes. "His tactics were scurrilous and his aide Derrick Max was rude and underhanded."
"It is hard to know what a politician believes anymore because he is so beholden to the special interests of those who elected him," she adds. "The system is so corrupt that it may not ever be fixed." No wonder she's happy to be back on stage.
The title, subtitle and chapter headings of Alexander's memoir suggest that she never quite left. Other than a proper Massachusetts upbringing, what seems to have enabled her to maintain her ladylike equanimity was her ability to distance herself from her role, to see the chairmanship as another part in a play that unfortunately lacked the comforting grounding of a good script. But one could argue that such distancing limited her effectiveness as an infighter.
She could enjoy her own modest initiatives and small victories. She traveled to all 50 states and enjoyed what she saw there. She treasured her few friendships on Capitol Hill. She rested content in her simple belief that art is good and the more people it reaches, the better. She assayed some controversial reorganizations of the agency, which she does not explain very well. And she did manage to sustain the endowment's very existence in the teeth of conservative hostility and in the absence of much overt support from Clinton.
All of this is recounted in workaday prose flecked with odd errors: Mario Botta, not Robert Venturi, designed the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Americans abroad are not "ex-patriots"; and it was Gertrude Stein who famously said of Oakland, not Dorothy Parker of Los Angeles, that "there is no there there."
Politically, what is curious about the National Endowment for the Arts is how tiny its budget actually is compared with, say, a missile, yet how symbolically important it remains in a kind of backhanded tribute to the power of art. For the right, it is a fund-raising tool; apart from grisly photos of dead fetuses, nothing apparently scores more money than a lurid newsletter portraying the agency as a tool to spread artistic, moral and sexual subversion through the republic. And since the right places such weight on this issue, the center-left has to defend it, at least nominally.
In the end, it is hard not to sympathize with Alexander's despair. One wonders what might have happened -- in the arts as in so many other areas of policy -- had the Clinton administration mounted a more vigorous, impassioned advocacy for its putative beliefs. To be sure, her own decision never to comment positively or negatively on any artwork contributed to this politic distancing. "I rose weakly to the challenge," she writes of her first encounter with Strom Thurmond. A cynic would say the same for her entire tenure, but then one must remember the dire circumstances.
The endowment, founded in 1965 with bipartisan support, seemingly cannot win now. The right hates it as a subversive symbol. Multiculturalists undercut its support of high art institutions. Neo-conservatives suggest that since federal financing is so low anyway (a reduction they advocated in the first place), one might as well eliminate it. And centrists, however sympathetic they may be about the supposed moral uplift and economic advantages of culture, let the right define the debate and do not believe enough in the arts themselves to make them a priority.
The only hope an arts lover might feel is a faith in the ultimate common sense of the American people in the long run -- common sense, because even on pragmatic terms, the endowment is clearly a benefit to society, and most Americans know it. Even with its present meager budget, it is positively positioned in the tumult of the culture wars to make a comeback when political circumstances permit: still supportive of the big institutions and European traditions that define the high arts but properly cognizant of the diversity and vitality of immigrant, folk and regional arts as well.
An arts lover can cling to faith for the long run, because one can cling to the hope that the economic buoyancy that has revitalized our cities and our education budgets may eventually percolate down into sophisticated arts education and a general refinement of the national aesthetic sensibility, wherein the arts are valued as such, not just as symbols or stimuli for urban renewal. "Congress had no interest in the worthiness of the art itself," Alexander notes in passing, which might seem obvious and almost universal until one realizes what a sad comment it makes about our country. Only when the people and their politicians care about art will they start caring about its proper and legitimate support. And if eventually the endowment is reinvigorated and properly budgeted, at least Jane of Art can take some credit for helping it survive its darkest days.

A WAR TO BE WON
 Fighting the Second World War.
 By Williamson Murray
 and Allan R. Millett.
 Illustrated. 656 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
 The Belknap Press/
 Harvard University Press. $35. 
 The history of warfare is extraordinarily difficult to evoke. Leopold von Ranke, the father of modern historiography, directed the historian to find out and convey "what really happened." This is a daunting assignment, whatever the subject; it is nearly impossible when the subject is war. The evidence is always muddled and usually contradictory, the eyewitnesses traumatized; the task of the military historian is to create order -- but not an artificial order, with tidy accounts of battles and neat blocks and precise arrows on maps -- out of events characterized, even defined, by chaos. In "A War to Be Won," two of America's most accomplished military historians, Williamson Murray and Allan R. Millett, attempt to write a comprehensive account of the military operations of World War II, which means they must impose order on the chaos of not merely a battle or even a campaign, but on what the British historian John Keegan has aptly called "the largest single event in human history."
Murray and Millett juggle various aspects of the conflict -- air, naval and ground operations, changes in tactics, partisan resistance and military technology, to name a few -- as well as its various theaters and campaigns, including Russia, the North Atlantic, Western Europe, the Pacific, China, North Africa, Italy, the Balkans and Burma. And, unlike many of their peers, they bind these narrative strands together instead of considering them in isolation. They remind us that when Pearl Harbor was attacked, the Germans had just been halted in front of Moscow; that when Stalingrad was besieged, the British were winning the battle of El Alamein; and that when the British and Americans were landing in Sicily, the Russians were winning the battle of Kursk.
But if the book's scope is awesome, it is also limited. For Murray and Millett have written an operational history of World War II -- a history, in other words, of what took place on the battlefield. They are not concerned with the conflict's political, social, diplomatic or economic dimensions, or even with all its military ones. The enormous contribution of logistics -- raising, arming, equipping, moving and maintaining forces in the field -- to the outcome of conflict falls outside the book's purview, as does the role of intelligence. (In their concise account of the battle of Kursk, for example, Murray and Millett note that Russia knew Germany's plans, but they don't say how: for months before the battle, British code breakers had been supplying the Russian military with detailed information on German intentions.)
Murray and Millett's focus on the leadership of generals and on combat is also unapologetically old-fashioned. Much recent military history seems to be the history of war with the battles left out. Following the vogue of the new social history, many of today's military historians have turned their attention to topics like the role of women, propaganda, morale and social change. And even when they make it to the front lines, their emphasis is likely to be on the experiences of common soldiers, rather than on commanders and their decisions.
All of this isn't to fault Murray and Millett -- they set out to write a general operational history, a worthy goal, and they've succeeded admirably. But their narrow focus does pose some problems for a general audience. Since they don't cover politics, economics or diplomacy their book can't serve as a comprehensive survey of the war, unlike the British historian R. A. C. Parker's masterpiece of compression, "Struggle for Survival," or Peter Calvocoressi, Guy Wint and John Pritchard's considerably longer general history, "Total War." And though it's clearly written and extraordinarily well organized -- it comes with helpful appendixes aimed to explain military terms and concepts to the nonspecialist -- A War to Be Won" is also very heavy going. Large sections of the book will strike some readers as a recitation of faceless units moving in unfamiliar places. Murray and Millett also enter a crowded field: In the past 10 years or so Martin Gilbert, Gerhard L. Weinberg, H. P. Willmott and John Keegan have written general military histories of the war. Murray and Millett's account is more analytically sophisticated than these books, but it fails to match the brio and vividness of Keegan's treatment.
"A War to Be Won" falls between two stools: it's too long and detailed for many nonmilitary history buffs, but it's not long and detailed enough for those equipped to value it fully. The Second World War is by far the most written-about conflict in history -- in addition to the exhaustive multivolume official histories issued by all the major belligerents, important monographs have dealt with every theater, campaign and major battle. World War II buffs are likely to appreciate, but not be sated by, Murray and Millett's balanced and well-paced account of the Soviet Union's Operation Bagration, for example, and would probably prefer the more meticulous treatment in John Erickson or Earl Ziemke's histories of the Soviet-German front, and, if those weren't enough, Gerd Niepold's exhaustive chronicle of that specific operation, "The Battle for White Russia," to mention only the major works written in English.
Still, Murray and Millett have synthesized the massive body of operational studies and, although their clear, levelheaded chronicle offers no startling revelations or novel interpretations, they ably illuminate the differences between the popular understanding of various issues and the scholarly consensus. Most readers have been told that the German military was the most operationally skillful and that Soviet battlefield strategy was leaden and unimaginative in comparison. But, as Murray and Millett point out, echoing the conclusions of Willmott and other scholars, the Russians' brilliant use of encirclement and deep battle (whose success was in part due to the large number of Chevrolet, Ford and Dodge trucks they had received through lend-lease) constituted the most innovative and "devastating display of operational art in World War II." Soviet operations from the summer of 1944 to the winter of 1945 "were far superior to anything the Germans had achieved early in the war."
Similarly, although the received wisdom holds that strategic bombing played a relatively minor role in winning the war, Murray and Millett, drawing on the specialized literature, show that it had a significant effect on operational strength. Strategic bombing disrupted both German and Japanese logistics and communications, and slowed or halted the Axis' production of weapons like the new, faster class of U-boat. But Murray and Millett go too far in arguing that strategic bombing forced Berlin to devote its increasingly scarce resources to the production of retaliatory V-1 and V-2 missiles, weapons whose cost far exceeded their benefits. It's true that for domestic consumption the German leadership called these missiles "revenge weapons." But the Germans' primary motivation for producing these missiles wasn't reprisal but rather the hope (misguided, but similar to the logic behind much of the Allies' strategic bombing) that such weapons would break British morale and thereby force London to make a separate, compromise peace. Given Germany's strategic fortunes, the V-weapons would almost certainly have been used even without Allied strategic bombing. Murray and Millett seem to have the relationship between strategic bombing and the German V-weapons backward: if anything, strategic bombing delayed, rather than instigated, the development and production of these weapons.
"A War to Be Won" is often intimidating in its complexity and its attention to minute detail, but the abundance of information is necessary, since it illuminates what is perhaps man's most complicated and chaotic endeavor: making war. More than any other conflict, World War II was a huge improvisation; it repeatedly changed its style of combat -- the war started with cavalry charges on the plains of Poland and ended with the atomic bomb -- and its field of decisive action as it wore on, consuming over 60 million lives in the process. Although Murray and Millett don't shrink from making harsh, and perceptive, criticisms of commanders like Omar N. Bradley and Mark W. Clark, their purpose is neither to critize nor to praise but to enter the minds of military decision makers. "A War to Be Won" shows how these men saw the situation at the time, what choices they believed were available and why they made the ones they did in the fog of that especially foggy war.

 BODY:
Bone by Bone, by Peter Matthiessen. (Vintage International, $14.) The last of three novels about the life and times of Edgar J. Watson -- cane planter, entrepreneur and mass murderer -- recounts his conquest of Florida's Gulf Coast, an obsession with echoes in the imperialistic impulses of a growing America. "This is a work of genuine dignity," Sven Birkerts wrote in the Book Review in 1999.
The Clone Age: Adventures in the New World of Reproductive Technology, by Lori B. Andrews (Owl/Holt, $15.) A lawyer traces her career as an expert in the legal and moral aspects of assisted reproduction from the birth of the first test-tube baby in 1978 to the threshold of the clone age. "Hers is a fine and readable book," John R. G. Turner wrote here last year. "She has a wonderful dry sense of humor." 
 Turn of the Century, by Kurt Andersen. (Delta, $14.95.) This sprawling comedy of millennial manners revolves around a nomadic power couple -- a hypersuccessful Silicon Alley C.E.O. and a struggling television producer -- at play in the infotainment economy of Manhattan. Andersen "wins back terrain for the novel that has been ceded to new media, demonstrating that the novel is as alive and as nimble as its high-tech competitors," Po Bronson said here in 1999.
A Clearing in the Distance: Frederick Law Olmsted and America in the 19th Century, by Witold Rybczynski. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $15.) The suburban visionary who designed Central Park and other monuments of green is portrayed as a humble man with little formal training who believed in the restorative power of landscape for ordinary citizens. Last year our reviewer, Suzannah Lessard, called this an "excellent biography" that is "thorough and respectful, yet easeful in a way that is reminiscent of Olmsted himself."
Tough, Tough Toys for Tough, Tough Boys, by Will Self. (Grove, $12.) The killing of a fly imagined as blood sport. A Londoner who finds a giant rock of crack cocaine under his house. These outlandish stories both amuse and horrify as they render everyday reality plastic and absurd. Last year our reviewer, Jonathan Lethem, admired Self's "vibrantly caustic prose and his anarchic and florid satirical premises."
Byron: Child of Passion, Fool of Fame, by Benita Eisler. (Vintage, $18.) According to this biography, the poet was both an arrogant English patrician and a prodigious libertine whose devotion to sexual freedom got him into a world of trouble. "The seesawing moods and volatile allegiances of Byron . . . are reported with sensitive understanding," Claude Rawson said here in 1999. The book "astutely identifies links between Byron's defiance of prevailing moral codes and his political radicalism."
The Real Wild West: The 101 Ranch and the Creation of the American West, by Michael Wallis. (St. Martin's Griffin, $21.95.) The 101 Ranch, a vast private spread founded after the Civil War that once covered nearly 110,000 acres in northeastern Oklahoma, helped to shape popular perceptions of the American frontier for many years. Wallis "is the first writer to tie together the 101 Ranch's many stories," Allen Barra wrote in these pages in 1999. The Earth Shall Weep: A History of Native America, by James Wilson (Grove, $16) is not so much a survey of Indian cultures as it is a study of the calamitous impact of white conquest on indigenous societies and a dissection of the many myths generated by the conquerors. Last year our reviewer, Richard E. Nicholls, called this a "carefully researched and wide-ranging narrative."
Memento Mori, by Muriel Spark. (New Directions, $11.95.) In this mystery set in 1950's London, a group of elderly friends (with more than a few skeletons in their closets) is tormented by an anonymous telephone caller who informs each of them, "Remember you must die." "Spark's trim, unloitering narrative reveals a fairly complete gamut of human seaminess," Robert Phelps wrote in the Book Review in 1959. The result is "a daffily hilarious book, even though it is pervasively concerned with the importance of Death and Judgment."
Run Catch Kiss, by Amy Sohn. (Scribner, $12.) Ariel Steiner, the precocious young heroine of this first novel, is a sex columnist for a Manhattan newspaper who kicks up a citywide scandal when it's discovered she's been making up colorful material for her column. "It's hard not to be entertained by the hapless but indomitable Ariel" and her misadventures, Matthew Flamm wrote here in 1999. Scott Veale

HEADLINE: Your Kids Are Their Problem

BYLINE: By Lisa Belkin; Lisa Belkin is a contributing writer for the magazine. She writes the Life's Work column for the Workplace section of The Times.

 BODY:
Jason Gill is clocking 80 miles an hour in his green Miata convertible, heading north out of San Diego. The 31-year-old computer software consultant is doing what he often does on weekends -- looking for someplace new to live. He hates the idea of giving up his bougainvillea-covered bungalow, with its postage stamp-size patio, one block from the beach in La Jolla, Calif. But three years after he moved in, the neighborhood is not what it once was.
The couple next door have had a baby, and with the lots so close together, Gill -- who describes himself as passionately, even militantly, "child free" -- can hear every wail and whimper. The family on the other side has a baby girl and two young sons who used to peer at Gill through the grape-stake fence until he replaced it with a solid redwood one. Now the boys use that fence as a soccer goal, often while Gill is trying to read a book or have a quiet glass of wine. 
 The teenagers down the block have formed a rock band. The nice elderly woman across the street and the retired empty nesters a few doors away have sold their homes to new owners who are building Mediterranean-esque overstatements where modest cottages used to be. "And here is the lovely sand-beige palace with a turret," Gill said in his most sarcastic faux real estate broker voice while giving me a walking tour of his street. "I don't know who'll move in, but you don't build something this ridiculous unless you have kids."
Countless fences divide the American landscape, and while some, like race, loom large and visible, others are deceptively transparent, subdividing people who are the same except for the choices they have made. Mothers with jobs versus mothers without. Those who own guns versus those who would abolish them. Smokers versus nonsmokers. Home-schoolers versus public-schoolers versus private-schoolers. And, most recently and vociferously, those who have children versus those who don't. We believe we can see through these fences; we can even pretend they aren't there. But like mottled glass, they warp and distort, so that what we see from where we stand is not how things look from the other side.
As the mother of two young sons and as a writer on work-life issues, here's what I see when I look at the world: parents who are stressed. Workplace policies that try to ease that stress but can go only so far. Airplane attendants who used to be nicer to children than they are now. The cost of child care and summer camp and orthodontics, which makes it tough to save for tomorrow's cost of college. Drivers who don't slow down on side streets. Louts who wear obscene T-shirts that my kids can read and curse at baseball games where my kids can hear.
Here's what Jason Gill sees when he looks at that same world: colleagues who are stressed, yes, but only because they choose to have children. Employers who expect people like him to work longer hours so that employees who are parents can balance their lives. Benefits packages full of maternity leave, pregnancy coverage, dependent health insurance and other benefits that mean parents effectively earn more than nonparents. Infants who cry during R-rated movies. The pharmacist who won't hand over a vial with an easy-to-open cap unless Gill signs a release form swearing that he'll take full responsibility if the contents kill a child.
He is hardly the only one with that view. "Could you please try and control your brats?" a New York theater critic barks at a mother whose young children are rustling and humming during previews of "The Music Man" on Broadway. (It makes all the gossip columns.) "Your Kids Are Driving Me Crazy," blares a headline on a community newspaper on Manhattan's Upper West Side. A sign at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, a city that touts itself as a family destination, warns that children under 18 are not allowed in the hotel unless they are paying guests. (Don't even bother to ask room service for a children's menu.)
An organization called No Kidding! which schedules social events for those who remain childless, had just 2 chapters five years ago; today it has 47. And there is no way to count the number of "child free" sites online (with names like Brats! and alt.support.childfree.moderated), but together they make up a parallel and expanding universe where the printable names for children include "anklebiters" "crib lizards" and "sprogs." In this world, couples in which one parent stays home are called SITCOMS (Single Income, Two Children, Oppressive Mortgage). Those enlightened enough not to have children are THINKERS (Two Healthy Incomes, No Kids, Early Retirement).
There have always been people with children and people without. Why all this anger now? The answer lies in the confluence of nearly every major social and economic trend of the past 30 years. Start with the birth control pill, which transformed parenthood from an assumption to a choice. Add the women's rights movement, which sent women into the workplace in record numbers, forcing employers to find ways to accommodate families, particularly women who become mothers. Mix in the baby boomers (who have produced a baby boomlet of their own) and technology (which allows infertile couples and gay and lesbian couples to have children). Then there's the fact that, statistically, parents are older and more affluent, meaning youngsters can now be found everywhere -- at the theater, in upscale restaurants, kicking the back of your airplane seat. The world as we know it can sometimes seem infested with children.
Go to work, watch the news: the sound of institutions competing to be "family friendly" can be deafening. "Let us create a family lobby as powerful as the gun lobby," Al Gore says, and every issue, from gun control to tax reform, is now presented as being good for children. The unintended result of all this is that the 13 million childless baby boomers are left bristling because their lives -- whether chosen or the result of circumstance -- don't seem to count. This simmering resentment might not qualify as a "movement" (a word that is thrown around too often, as if anger does not exist unless it is organized), but it certainly represents a deep divide and a ripe opportunity for sniping between neighbors, between co-workers, between those who have and those who have no interest.
"It angers me and saddens me at the same time that my little piece of paradise is being ruined," says Gill, whose baby face belies an inner daredevil. He passes a truck with such ferocity that I grab the safety handle and do a mental review of my life insurance. He'd never be this reckless, I think -- sounding woefully like a parent -- if he had kids to worry about.
"I live with constant noise, but because it's made by childruuuuun," he says, layering sarcastic emphasis on the final syllable, "I can't even call the cops." (Although he has called the police twice about the rock band down the block.) "What's picturesque to a parent," he adds, "is annoying to someone who's trying to sit on the porch and nap."
We leave the truck in the dust and continue our race along Interstate 5. Farther north, the road leads to Legoland and, eventually, to Disneyland. I know this because I drove that route last summer with my boys. Today, of course, I won't visit either place. What Gill plans to show me is how different the same landscape can look through a different lens, in this case the windshield of a two-seat Miata.
When I first heard the phrase "child free," I rolled my eyes. Here's another politically correct and therefore politically loaded term, I thought, and a combative one at that. It smacks of eradication, like "smoke free" or "pesticide free." Those who use it, however, say it's not about hating children (some do; some don't). "Childless" has connotations of loss or regret; "child free" implies satisfaction and deliberate choice. To be child free, they argue, means giving far more thought to not having children than most parents give to having them.
"This wasn't an overnight, let's-really-annoy-the-relatives kind of decision," says Monica Ricci, who is 34 and owns an organizing business in Atlanta. "I remember being in my early 20's and thinking, I don't really want to have kids, but I'm going to have to do it and I'm going to hate it but I'm going to have to do it. Then, slowly, I realized, No, I'm not."
Melody Fohr, 30, who works as a telephone operator at a national chain store outside of Pittsburgh, has a similar story. "I knew from an early age that I didn't want to be a mommy," she says. "It just never appealed to me. I was never a kid like the other kids. It took the relatives a long time to realize that I never played with dolls. They kept buying them for me."
I have heard this tale before. In fact, I have lived this tale, to a point. I, too, was a child who had stuffed animals but few dolls and who pretended to be a rock star during playtime, never, ever a mom. I baby-sat -- once. There was a blackout that night, and the children cried, and I vowed not to try that again. When my friends began producing newborns, I held them awkwardly, and only when I couldn't find a way out. Four years into my marriage I was still waiting for my maternal urge to kick in, and when it didn't, I closed my eyes and took a leap of faith. Not until my son's first smile did I catch the fever and become a besotted parent.
It might be easy to find a moral here, but those who call themselves child free warn the rest of us to stop assuming that they will somehow see the light. "No one goes up to the goo-goo-eyed mother of a baby and says, 'I'm sure you'll change your mind,' "Gill says. In fact, he would argue that my life is an example of how society pressures people to have children against their better judgment. There would be fewer neglected children, he says, and fewer stressed and miserable adults, if more people felt free not to reproduce. "This isn't some cute stage that I'll grow out of," he says. "It's a legitimate life choice."
Monica Lightner, a 25-year-old newlywed in California, fought to prove exactly that late last year when she asked a doctor at her H.M.O. to perform a tubal ligation. First he tried to talk her out of it, she says, "insisting that I would change my mind one day." Then she was told that she would have to undergo a psychiatric exam, which she refused, because the suggestion that she was crazy to want a life without children was "absurd and insulting." Eventually she was referred to a second doctor, who told her that the last tubal ligation he performed was on a woman who later regretted having it and, as a result, took her life.
Finally, six months after her initial request, she found a doctor willing to do as she asked, and her surgery was done on April 26. She is outraged that she had to fight so hard. "Have you ever heard of a woman being told to take a psychiatric exam before she was permitted to have a baby?" she says. "They kept telling me this was a permanent choice, as if that hadn't occurred to me. Having a child is an even more permanent choice, but no one would have dreamed of talking me out of that."
Pressure also comes from closer to home. Gail G. (who works with adoptive parents for a living and asked to remain anonymous because they might resent her decision never to have children) began to dread conversations with her mother, who could not believe she would never give her a grandchild. "If I said or did something that made her proud she would sigh and then get this pitiful look and say, 'Too bad you'll never have kids to share this with.' And then when I did or said something she didn't like, she would say, 'Well it's a good thing you're never having kids, you're too selfish.' "
In self-defense, Gail "made a deal with Mom." She set up "appointments" -- every few months -- and declared that these were the only times she would answer questions about being child free. "If she brings it up between appointments," Gail says, "I am justified in hanging up on her or walking out of the room, neither of which I have had to do since we set up the arrangement."
Anne Noble, a graphics artist in New Jersey, has tried in vain to find a similar way to silence her co-workers. One recent lunch hour, tired out by a late-night party (people without children get to go to those, she points out), she took a long nap in her car. Returning to the office she was ribbed by colleagues who had seen her feet jutting out of her rear window. They wondered if she needed the nap because she was pregnant.
"I have made it fairly clear to my office associates that we don't plan on having children," she seethes, explaining that the choice was one she reached after a long internal struggle. "I also made a point of telling my friends at work that I just started my Depo shots. Yet I still get this question and it just infuriates me. As if there couldn't possibly be any other explanation for an upset stomach, feeling fatigued, whatever. I always answer definitely not, but I really want to say, 'What a rude question.' "
It is the last day of school at Prior Lake High School in suburban Minneapolis, and Elinor Burkett wanders the halls, gossiping with the graduating seniors. "Did you hear Justin didn't show up for detention, so he won't get his diploma?" "Did you hear Roger didn't pass Phys Ed?"
Burkett, 53, has the voice of a serious smoker, and hair that is, by her own description, a most "unnatural" shade of red. The students clearly trust her, and she just as clearly adores them, which is somewhat surprising to me because she is the author of "The Baby Boon: How Family-Friendly America Cheats the Childless," a book that accuses parents of wanting "their child and their Lexus, too" and describes having children as "squirting out spawn." (Burkett doesn't actually use that term herself, but approvingly quotes someone who does.)
Burkett's next book will be about a year at Prior Lake, which means she has spent an entire year with teenagers. When I comment on the fact that the "Betty Friedan of the childless" has surrounded herself with children, she dismisses it as missing the point. Too many childless people, she says, focus on the wrong things -- the undisciplined toddler at the next table; the insensitive comment by Aunt Marge. "This isn't about hurt feelings," Burkett says. "There are policy implications, financial implications. This is about a political and economic structure which relegates the childless to second-class citizens."
At the top of Burkett's list of targets is the federal tax code, which has long allowed a "dependent deduction" ($2,800 at the moment, which is worth about $784 to a family taxed at 28 percent). To that is added a dependent-care credit (up to $4,800 in expenses for two or more children, which is worth about $960 to that same family) or, if sponsored by an employer, a dependent-care spending account (up to $5,000, worth $1,400). Then, in 1997 -- just when political consultants became obsessed with soccer moms" -- Congress added a $500 per child tax credit.
Burkett is in favor of the deduction for dependent care. "That says that we as a society believe that those people who take care of dependent people -- children or adults -- need some help. I don't have a problem with that." Nor would she have had a problem, she says, if Congress had increased that existing deduction by $500 so that it applied to all dependents. But by creating a tax credit solely for the care of children, she explains, "we said implicitly that we think that socially that's more valuable."
How is this different, I ask, from something like a mortgage deduction, in which the tax code is used to shape behavior or reflect social priorities? It isn't, Burkett replies, adding that mortgage deductions are just as arbitrary. "There are renters who are not terribly happy about it, I can tell you that."
Even the tax credits would not infuriate her if they were not part of a definite and very recent trend. During the 106th Congress alone, she says, dozens of bills designed to lighten the tax burden of parents were introduced, including ones that would increase the child tax credit to $900. ("Who subsidizes that tax break?" she asks. "You're looking at her.") Last month President Clinton opened the door for states to allow new parents to receive unemployment insurance during the weeks they stay home with a newborn. ("So now, in this wonderful world where welfare has allegedly been reformed," she writes, "the poor lose federal benefits if they don't work, but doctors and lawyers who don't work after they have kids can receive checks from Uncle Sam.")
Most "absurd" of all, she says, is an executive order, signed back in May, prohibiting discrimination against parents in all areas of federal employment. Forget the fact that the White House could not produce a single convincing example of a parent who had actually faced such discrimination, Burkett says. More troubling to her is the fact that the law takes sides.
"If employers are refusing to hire or promote parents because they believe they won't work as hard as nonparents, that's unconscionable," she says. "But I also think that if that is illegal, discrimination against nonparents should be illegal as well. Last time I checked, discrimination law generally cut both ways. We don't bar discrimination against women; we bar discrimination on the basis of gender, and so on. So why single out parents? Why not bar discrimination on the basis of family status? Why not make it illegal to presuppose that a nonparent is free to work the night shift or presuppose that nonparents are more able to work on Christmas than parents?"
Which brings us to the workplace, which promises to be the bloodiest beachhead in the brewing war between parents and nonparents. From where I sit, the increasing insistence by employees that employers accommodate their lives has been a welcome revolution -- and I don't think that "revolution" is too strong a word. Although things like flex time, telecommuting, adoption assistance and emergency day care are hardly ubiquitous, they are at least a part of the national conversation about what workers might need to do their jobs. I am personally grateful for that conversation, because without it I could not work the way that I do -- from home, on my own schedule, available to my children and judged as a worker by what I produce, not by how many hours I log in the office.
But where I see progress, Burkett sees something else entirely. All these fancy benefits, for instance, like on-site child care, and even the most basic ones, like health insurance for dependents, are examples of perks the childless are not getting. "Parents get more than nonparents," she says. "Every childless person can tell you exactly how much money their compensation package is worth versus the person sitting next to them." She points to Marriott International, which provides approximately $5,000 per child in the form of subsidized day care at its headquarters in Maryland. "What that means," she says, "is if I worked for Marriott they would be offering fewer benefits that are relevant to my life. All this talk about how you have to have all these benefits to take care of the morale of working parents? What about my morale?"
A more rational approach, she suggests, in a voice that says, "See, I can be reasonable," is a "menu" of benefit options. Every employee would be given a dollar allotment for benefits that they might divide as they choose. A parent might spend most of those dollars on health insurance. A nonparent might choose additional vacation time. At Eastman Kodak, she says approvingly, employees can request "personal opportunity leave." You can take it to bond with your newborn or you can take it to travel. It's unpaid time off, with a guarantee of a job when you return, and it's very unusual for a childless person to take it. But it's an acknowledgment that we're going to treat all of our employees equally, and it's a real morale booster to people without kids."
Eastman Kodak, however, says that its "personal leave of absence" program is not automatically available to all employees. It must be requested and approved. They add that they don't know if childless people are less likely to take the leave, because they don't track this information.
When the conversation shifts to workplace flexibility, Burkett loses her "let's be reasonable" tone. "Every time someone takes off for that sick child or that school conference, then someone else has to pick up the extra work," she says. "And the supposition on the part of management almost always is that the person without kids is more able -- and it's true -- to do that than a parent. And it happens again and again and again. After a while you're doing two jobs for one salary."
I am tempted to argue that this doesn't really happen often, and that parents are more likely to ask other parents for help when they're in a bind, on the theory that they would be more likely to understand. But I have spoken to enough child-free workers to know that however often this happens, it is far too often for them. Melody Fohr, the Pittsburgh telephone operator, describes attending night college classes but arriving late because "the pregnant woman who was supposed to take over my shift at 5 was sick for months so she never made it in." Fohr remembers being told, "Well, you have to understand, she's not feeling well."
"I was supposed to worry about their lives, but they couldn't care less about mine," she says. "If I got one personal phone call at work, I heard about it from my boss. But nobody says anything to the parent who's on the phone every 15 minutes to the kid who's home from school."
The unwritten rule at work here, Burkett says, is that people with greater needs should receive more, and people with fewer needs should do more, which goes against the doctrine of equal pay for equal work and is a step back to the days when married men were paid more than single men because they had families to feed. Childless workers have "had it up to here" with this, she warns, and those childless workers are the one of the fastest growing segments of the work force. The childless also make up nearly 10 percent of registered voters, meaning employers and politicians better start to listen.
Already there are signs that the "child free" are taking a page from Burkett, who has become a cult figure in these circles. "The book put hard numbers to my feeling of being ignored by politicians and my vague sense of being ripped off in general," Jason Gill says. "I've gotten more politicized," he adds. "I used to keep my mouth shut to be polite, but now I'm more willing to tell people what I think."
What he thinks about a friend who was looking for a job but not mentioning that she was pregnant is this: "I told her husband she was committing employment fraud," he says. Never mind that the law says her pregnancy is not the employer's business, and that to hold it against her would be discrimination. Gill believes that the law is wrong. "She'll get the job, they'll spend money to train her," he predicts. "Whenever she has a doctor's appointment, and especially when she goes on maternity leave, someone else will have to fill in. Then she'll take months off and probably never come back."
And what he thinks about a recent family-friendly policy developed by his former employer is equally blunt. "They announced this 'great new employee benefit,' "he says, "several thousands of dollars in tuition money for the children of employees." Last he'd checked, Murphy, his 11-year-old spaniel-collie, wasn't interested in going to college, so instead of keeping his mouth shut, Gill wrote an e-mail message to the company's C.E.O.
"What about employees who want to go back to school to better themselves?" he asked. Within two months the tuition funds were made available to employees as well as their children. But Gill left the company shortly thereafter to become an independent consultant, in part so that he wouldn't "have to do all the work when all the parents left for middle school graduation."
How do you find a neighborhood that is not "infested" with children? Gill still has 20-odd years to go before he qualifies for the only type of real estate development -- those communities substantially filled by residents 55 and older -- that are legally allowed to bar children. None of the standard home-buying guides cover his problem, either, and real estate agents look either confused or aghast when he explains what he needs. "If there was someplace that said, 'You have to pay double rent but no one under 18 is allowed,"' he says, "I'd be lining up."
But there is no such place, so Gill is doing the detective work on his own. He thinks he sees clues in the real estate ads -- developers who present silver-haired models alone on a beach at dusk are hinting that children are not wanted, he thinks, while those who hold open houses featuring petting zoos and clowns are telling him to look elsewhere. He has posted the question online ("What are some good strategies for finding Minimum Breeder Quotient neighborhoods?" were his exact words. "What can I do to minimize the likelihood of landing in a noisy, sprog-ridden neighborhood?")
Some of the answers were sarcastic (I hope). "Tell the real estate agent that your brother visits you quite often and it's a condition of his parole that he not be within one block of children under 12," was one reply. Others were practical, from members who had searched, mostly in vain, for their own quiet places over the years. "Avoid homes in great school districts like the plague!" or "Live on a main road. Lots of mooomies and daddies avoid places where, if their kids play in traffic, they're road kill."
He was advised to look in "gay neighborhoods," which he would do, except that he is a surfer, and in San Diego those areas are not close enough to the beach. It was suggested that he look for neighborhoods with small yards, where children can't play, but he points out that he lives on a block with tiny yards and all that seems to mean is that children feel free to play hide-and-seek in his. He has also been told by his online pals to look for larger yards ("Lots o' land, modest houses + no trendy 'McMansions' with very spoiled sproggen") and for slightly worn, scruffy neighborhoods ("Seems most breeder-yuppie-scum are drawn to the new subdivisions").
Those last two reasons are why we are spending the afternoon in the town of Leucadia, about 25 miles north of San Diego. "It has a funkier, surf-town sort of feel," he says, "with piercing parlors here and there, and it's close to where the farm workers live, so maybe that will give pause to people with children." But as we start to cruise the side streets, eyes peeled for For Sale signs, Gill is disappointed. There are chalk drawings in front of one house. A blue swing set and a little blue pool in front of another. Like a scene in a David Lynch movie, the symbols of suburbia take on a threatening vibe.
Eventually we spot an Open House -- three bedrooms, two baths, 2,790 square feet. It is a sprawling home, on property that seems to go on forever. There's no family room, I notice, and no safety cover on the pool. The master bedroom shares a bathroom with what I call a second bedroom and Gill calls an office.
Standing by the open-brick barbecue pit I mutter, "Children with third-degree burns."
Standing by that same pit, Gill says, "What a cool place for a party." Despite the fact that, at $835,000, the house is more than $200,000 out of his price range, he adds, "I have to bring Dorothea here."
Dorothea Ragsdale is Gill's girlfriend of five years, and it is with her that his "child free" identity officially began. Gill was married, briefly, when he was 21, to a woman with two young boys whom he describes as "the spawn of the devil." When he met Ragsdale, though, he still assumed he would marry again and have children. But she was 15 years his senior and had already reared her children, who are now 23 and 25. Instead of ending the relationship over the question of children, as Ragsdale feared he would, Gill found himself relieved that he did not have to become a parent after all. Finding others online who felt the way he did was "liberating," he says. "I felt like a gay person must feel, coming out of the closet and having these people validating me."
Ragsdale, who is divorced, admits that if she could make the decision all over again, she probably would not have children. As a manager at an e-commerce company, she chafes at the expectation of today's parents that they can have it all. "There were positions I couldn't take when I was raising my children, and I sacrificed because of them," she says. "I made these hard choices, and now they're saying that other people don't have to make them. I find that insulting."
Still, the fact that she is a parent means she can never see the world exactly as he does, and when he rants about children, she has to remember "not to personally internalize that he's talking about mine." He, in turn, censors himself around her, saving the worst of his rants for the computer.
I suspect he is censoring himself around me too. I know I am censoring myself around him. Just as I didn't realize how often I ate carbohydrates until a nutritionist told me not to, I had no idea how often I talked about my boys until I tried to stop. They are, I admit, one of my favorite subjects, not only when chatting with friends, but also professionally; I think nothing of swapping "cute kid" stories during interviews.
But then I spent weeks interviewing childless people, and hearing how sick they've become of parents who chatter endlessly about their children. In fact, escape from that kind of talk was one reason Jerry Steinberg, a Canadian schoolteacher, became "founding nonfather" of the group No Kidding! in the first place. "Conversations with my child-burdened friends became monologues," he says. "I'd say, 'How's it going?' and they'd bombard me with information about the kids."
So when Gill and I talk about surfing, I don't mention that my first grader would love to learn; and when he, Ragsdale and I go out to dinner, I keep the story about my fourth grader's first taste of calamari to myself. I give everybody my cell phone number, so that my children won't answer the phone when they call. And I specifically arrange to interview Jerry Steinberg when the boys are out of the house. During that interview, he complains about how often he's subjected to the background noise of children during business calls. "They make it impossible to have a thoughtful, quiet conversation like this," he says, and I bite my tongue.
As Jason Gill well knows, the "child free" do not live in a world by themselves, and on a recent Monday those on the other side of the fence gather to make their presence known. In a wood-paneled club off Fifth Avenue, dozens of parents and their defenders nibble canapes and sip sparkling water. Their host is the National Parenting Association, whose goal is "laying the groundwork to spark and sustain a social movement" of, by and for parents. The meet-and-greet portion of the event is short -- there are baby sitters waiting at home -- and when the time comes for speeches, each participant is introduced in a way that would make Elinor Burkett cringe.
Lesley Stahl, one scheduled speaker, is described not only as an award-winning CBS News reporter but also as a mother who managed to "balance work and parenting." Stahl, in turn, introduces Ruth Wooden, the former president of the Advertising Council and current president of the parenting association, as "the mother of John." Then Wooden proceeds to introduce Sylvia Ann Hewlett, the Harvard-educated economist who founded the National Parenting Association, as "the tireless mother of four."
"There are 63 million parents" -- of children under 18 -- in the United States," says Hewlett, getting down to the evening's business, "and if they were to vote as a bloc they could swing the election."
Hewlett is the co-author (with Cornel West) of "The War Against Parents," and from her side of the looking glass parents are anything but pampered and powerful. To the contrary, she describes them as "demoralized," the victims of "a culture of parent-bashing in this country." Everywhere parents turn, she says, they are told they are doing a bad job -- simultaneously ignoring and spoiling their children so that they grow into obese adolescents whose reading and math scores are low and who are likely to blow up the school cafeteria.
Nothing represents this backlash better than what she calls that "contemptible" book. "Baby Boon" (which mentions Hewlett numerous of times, none of them complimentary) "is making my blood boil," she says in an interview in the association's offices, which are located on the ground floor of a brownstone on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Hewlett is recovering from walking pneumonia. She has been up most of the night caring for her 3-year-old daughter and helping her 16-year-old son study for a biology exam. (At 54, she also has a 19-year-old, a 22-year-old and a 28-year-old stepdaughter.) But you would never know this to look at her. She is elegantly dressed and perfectly manicured, even as she describes how outraged she is.
"This is pernicious, it's brand-new, it's gaining traction," she bristles, as she proceeds to take "Baby Boon" apart fact by fact. Yes, there is a new per-child tax credit, she says, ticking her objections off on her fingers, but that paltry $500 hardly "redistributes the nation's wealth to those with children," as Burkett claims. "The fact is that our tax code has tilted in favor of those without children," she counters, and because the standard dependent deduction has decreased as a percentage of income, parents are getting far less help from the government than they did a generation ago.
"That deduction," she fumes, "is one of the things she harps on because it's one of the few things you can hang your hat on because it's one of the few things parents do get." But look at the cost side of the balance sheet, she says. She points out that a two-parent household with an income of up to $62,000 a year will spend about $160,000 to feed, clothe and shelter a child until the age of 18. "And this figure doesn't even include college tuition," she adds. It also doesn't include income lost by women who have children. Quoting data from a 1998 study, Hewlett says that childless women now earn 90 percent of what their male counterparts earn, while mothers earn only 73 percent.
"In the face of those numbers," Hewlett says, "Uncle Sam actually does very little." (Or, as James Weikart, of Weikart Tax Associates, scoffed when I asked whether parents reaped unfair gains from the tax code, "Kids are a very poor tax shelter.")
Burkett's contention that benefits packages and family-friendly policies are de facto bonuses for parents also rankles Hewlett. How many working parents, she asks, actually receive such benefits?
According to a 1998 study by the Families and Work Institute, 46.8 percent of companies with 100 or more employees offer a family-friendly package that includes flex time, paid parental leave and child-care assistance. But, Hewlett points out, "We must remember that the majority of women work for firms smaller than this, and these firms typically offer much less."
Lisa Benenson, the editor in chief of Working Mother magazine, agrees: "The vast majority of people in this country do not have flex time, do not get to go home early." As for benefits packages, she says, childless workers are not alone in not using all available benefits. "Do you deny someone a benefit just because you can't take advantage of that benefit? Do you deny someone mental health coverage because you don't need mental health coverage? If the person at the desk next to you gets cancer, do you think of them as 'earning' more because their health dollar costs are higher?"
The limited benefits that parents do receive in the workplace, Benenson says, are a reflection of their worth as employees -- in other words, their economic clout. "Companies don't do this out of the goodness of their hearts," she points out. "This is what they need to do to keep good workers. This is economics, pure and simple." The same economic laws are why children are allowed to swarm freely at any Starbucks and why even the most upscale restaurants have a supply of polished teak high chairs. "The trend in travel now is 'bring your kids,' "says Kim Clay, corporate communications manager for Omni Hotels. "And we want to make our customers happy." To that end, the upscale chain welcomes children with a goody bag of games and candy at check-in.
This status quo, the one Burkett and Gill see as oppressive, is only a rough draft of what Hewlett and Benenson think the world should be. Look at France, they say, where new mothers are guaranteed 16 to 26 weeks of paid maternity leave, or Ireland, where children are welcomed everywhere (including the family-friendly local pub). If parents are to get all they deserve, Hewlett argues, they must flex their political muscles as well as their economic ones.
The language of politics over the past four years hints that this is happening. Gun control used to be about reducing crime; now it is about protecting children and about mothers marching on Washington. The fight against smoking used to be about lung cancer; now it is about Joe Camel's influence on youngsters. "It's absolutely exploitative and disgusting," Gill says. "Even if I agreed with gun control it would turn me off because it's all about kids. Things like car safety, food safety -- it's O.K. if I die or get sick, because I'm over 21, but to keep a kid from getting hurt we have to change the whole world?"
Hewlett, not surprisingly, sees progress where Gill sees pandering. Framing policies in terms of children, she says, is the only way to challenge the belief at the core of the "child free" worldview -- that caring for children is in no way an obligation of the childless. The dismissal of parenting as a "choice" and the concomitant belief that only parents are responsible for the stress, the cost and the complications of that choice is "outrageous," Hewlett says. "This assumes that having a child is the moral equivalent of buying a boat or getting a manicure," she says. "True, not having children is an option for each individual. In some cases it is an honorable choice. But childlessness is not a choice for society."
In other words, if no one had children, there would be no more society. Nonparents have heard that before, and point out that overpopulation is a bigger problem than underpopulation, and that parents rarely decide to be parents out of a perceived obligation to humankind. Parents have children, nonparents say, because they are selfish -- because they want a baby to coo over, or a genetic link to the future, or the family of their own childhood dreams.
In fact, this whole debate can be distilled down to the word "selfish," and Ruth Wooden, president of the National Parenting Association, throws it right back at the child free. Parenting, she says, means "realizing that someone else's needs are more important than your own." In that way, she argues, becoming a parent means becoming "a grown-up," and as the percentage of childless adults increases, the result is a society that is "not as mature."
"It's untrammeled individualism," Hewlett says. "It's all about 'I want what's good for me and to hell with the other guy.' "
The most sweeping societal clashes, are, at their core, deeply personal -- an accumulation of moments between people who didn't realize they were making assumptions until they collided with others who assumed something else. My moment came during lunch with my children a few weeks ago, at a white-tablecloth restaurant near the river on the edge of our town. It's not the sort of place I would usually take young boys, but we were celebrating the last day of school, and because there's a village playground on the restaurant grounds, I wagered that the staff had seen its share of kids.
My sons behaved beautifully. When it came time to order dessert, I didn't want to break the peaceful mood, so I tried to tell the waitress, in a kind of cryptic parent-speak, that we would take the Valrhona Chocolate Mousse Cake Served With Vanilla Ice Cream and Caramel Sauce in the form of a piece of chocolate cake for one child and a separate dish of ice cream for the other. In other words, I wanted them to share, but I didn't want them to know they were sharing.
The waitress, I soon realized, was not conversant in parent-speak. She brought two full desserts. Then we each waved the banners of our respective armies as I tried to explain -- patiently, then less so -- what I had meant to order.
"I don't have children," she finally snapped. As she turned to leave she added, "And thank God that I don't."
Watching my boys devour their sweets, I blamed myself. I imagined (as best I could) what the waitress probably saw when we arrived: a table that would demand extra plates, spill lots of drinks and leave a lousy tip. I tried to see what Jason Gill would have seen had he witnessed the exchange: an entitled parent assuming the world would understand that her precious children can't possibly be expected to share. And, I wondered, What would I have thought, in the years before I had children, if I had seen the same little scene? It's a question I've been asking myself a lot of late, and the answer is: I was a different person then. There is nothing so transforming as becoming a parent, and that fact right there is the root of this entire divide.
I understand Burkett's point. And where compromise is possible, it should be the goal. It makes sense to me, for example, to increase the dependent deduction rather than add a per-child tax credit, and I'd agree that employers should aim for a menu of benefit options, one in which "family" does not automatically mean "children."
I also sympathize with the more "social" objections. Monica Lightner should be entitled to choose a tubal ligation, Anne Noble's life plan should be accepted by her co-workers, and no one should have to tolerate rude, intrusive questions from colleagues or relatives. Life without children should be respected as a legitimate, full, admirable life, not a consolation prize or an insult to those who are parents. Children should not be allowed to play soccer outside anyone's window at dawn. I would even concede that they might not belong at the fanciest restaurant in town either.
But on some parts of this stand-off there is no compromise. Parents will have to leave work early more often than nonparents, and they will need someone to cover for them while they're gone. Parents might not be able to control their children's noise level in the supermarket, or even in the library either, because acting out is what even the best-behaved children often do.
"If I were a working mother like you," Elinor Burkett told me, "I would be demanding all these things, too." And if I had never had children, I answered, I might have written her book. But I did have children, and on these less-black-and-white questions I can't help seeing the world from this side of the fence.
My answer to those who think my life intrudes on theirs is simple: Every person with children was once a person without children, so you have to take our word when we say we can't do it without help and without spilling over into your space all too regularly. The life of any given parent is more complicated, stressful and expensive than the life of that same person would be if he or she were not a parent. Feel sorry for us if you'd like. Avoid us if you need to. And, in several decades, when the children are grown, we can all live side by side again, in child-free retirement homes.

HEADLINE: Food;
The Death of French Food, Part 1

BYLINE: By Jonathan Reynolds 

 BODY:
After mother's milk, the three greatest cuisines in the world are French, Chinese and Junque. (I have a special unpublished hot line for chauvinists from Italy, Japan and Myanmar who think otherwise.) We are a nation dedicated to novelty, and thus chaotic fusionists, vertical foodites and Those Who Would Put Mangoes on Beefsteak currently overrun our trendier eating establishments. Classic French food, once dismissed for its fussiness and barbell content, now seems simple and authoritative by comparison. Recent French food seems even more so.
Bugs Bunny once paraphrased Oscar Wilde: "Paris is where good Americans get to go when they die." And when you hit it right -- usually at the beginning of spring, the song don't lie -- Paris can indeed be Bugs's paradise, and the possibility of his theology proving accurate quickens the nervous system. 
 When I was there in May, flowers -- about which I know nothing except that they're pretty, and if Stravinsky is any judge, really tough -- were everywhere. The town was positively ikebanic. Its inhabitants, giddy with the weather, were shockingly polite; the exchange rate was so favorable that the city's Expensive rating could be downgraded from the Insane to the merely Staggering, and the three-asparagus soup from the restaurant Rue Balzac was the happiest welcome to any world capital since Cleopatra opened up her gates to Caesar.
Unfortunately, the bistros and brasseries are not quite the relative bargain the rest of the city is. It's not just the bracing invisible surcharge -19.6 percent VAT, 15 percent gratuity. Oh, no, there's more.
Bugs could not have had politics in mind when he equated this place with Nirvana. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin decided that he could create jobs if no person in France working for a company with more than 20 employees toiled in excess of 35 hours a week. This in itself wasn't all that radical -- since 1981, the French have been, on paper, restricted to working a 39-hour week. What is radical is that Jospin, dunce cap askew and apparently unaware that there is a French word for productivity -- productivite -- has chosen to enforce it. Battalions of humorless little meddlers with briefcases and green eye shades now swarm over company books with that festive compulsiveness so beloved of socialists, checking how many hours employees work and generally taking the fun out of life.
Now, I know less about economics than I do about flowers, but I know a restaurateur foaming at the mouth when I see one. Owners are livid, and so are their staffs. No more 50-70-hour weeks; no more overtime; no lowering of salaries -but no raising of them. The unions are thrilled, of course, since their membership and power, at least in theory, have doubled overnight.
This most recent attempt -- about the 83rd since the Revolution -- by the government to destroy its own country bears out the old adage that politically, a Frenchman is born with three feet -- two to walk with and one to shoot himself in. But the French cling patriotically to their contrariness, buoyed no doubt by their recent defiance of all Western, Eastern and alternative medicine in being the one country that can laugh at heart disease as its people ingurgitate the red wine, triple-cr<heart>me cheeses and foie gras that kill everyone else. And true to character, while the rest of the Western world works its collective fanny off, reaping the benefits of unprecedented economic largess, France chooses to work less.
This is particularly troubling to the feeding business, which simply can't afford to pay two people for the job one person did just five minutes ago. Many of the larger establishments thought the government must be kidding, and some have paid the price. Although the extremely luxe Plaza Athenee Hotel claims it closed its elegant two- star La Regence until September for renovations in honor of new chef, Alain Ducasse, word has it they may have been forced to because, according to government rules, its employees were working too hard.
Tirade over, could we move on to the food, please? Well, O.K., except for one more, how you say, eccentricite. Owners have never liked the VAT. But the government placed its thick finger further up the collective restaurant nostril by decreeing that takeout establishments need pay only 5.5 percent. This has the curious effect not only of subsidizing fast food at the expense of its better, but also of subsidizing American takeout, since McDonald's and other American culinary dumbers-down are omnipresent.
Fortunately, the rancor of the owners and chefs hasn't reached the palates of the diners (though if I shined Jospin's political shoes, I'd sure hire a taster). The bookkeeper trolls have allowed the Plaza Athenee's other room, the graceful Grill Relais Plaza, to remain open, and Chef Philippe Marc regularly turns out surprising and exceptional fare.
And at Rue Balzac, a delightful newcomer whose principal owners include the restaurentrepreneur Michel Rostang and the French Elvis, Johnny Hallyday, the dishes sparkle with inventiveness and simplicity. They are also a visual delight; many are artfully (but simply) arranged on rectangular green glass plates, only slightly larger than the food, making for a cheery, unpretentious presentation. Rue Balzac opened its doors in February, and unlike most eateries keeps them open seven days. With the young chef, Yann Roncier, wearing the white hat, there is much originality here, particularly the delightful asparagus soups, two hot, one cold -- and the pineapples Victoria, which had never before passed these lips.
I found everything pleasurable. (Well, except for the turbot. I've never had anything but dry, tough turbot when it's grilled; poached, it's voluptuous. But be encouraged to order anything else.)
And so Bugs and I have chosen to ignore current governmental schizophrenia to focus on the food, the flowers and the new gentility, bravely, if idealistically, believing that should we Americans be judged good enough to make it to this heaven, the two most certain things in life will be of the past.
 
Three Little Asparagus Soups For Spring
(Adapted from Rue Balzac)
The most daunting aspect of serving three asparagus soups is finding 18 little bowls. But unless you're having Nathan Lane to dinner, who cares if they match? Coffee cups, old-fashioned glasses, mugs, pairs of cupped hands -- all are fine.

2 pounds asparagus, ends trimmed
6 tablespoons butter
4 cups chicken broth
2 pints half-and-half
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 cup Arborio rice
2 cups water
 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1egg, beaten
 1/2 cup bread crumbs
Vegetable oil for deep frying
3 ounces raw salmon fillet, skinned, cut into 1/4-inch dice
1. Peel 4 asparagus stalks and slice the remainder crosswise into 1-inch pieces. In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat and add the sliced asparagus and 2 of the peeled stalks. Saute 5 minutes or until soft.
2. Add chicken broth, bring to a boil and add half-and-half. Simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the 2 stalks. Continue to simmer for 10 minutes more, stirring occasionally.
3. Pour the soup through a coarse sieve set over a large bowl, pressing the asparagus through with the back of a large spoon. Scrape the pulp into the soup, whisk and refrigerate 1/3 of it.
4. Cut the 2 cooked asparagus stalks into 1/4-inch dice. Set aside. Slice the 2 raw asparagus stalks into 1 1/2- by- 1/8-inch julienne. Set aside.
5. For a risotto quenelle garnish, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and saute the onion until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the rice and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the water, 1/3 cup at a time, adding more as water is absorbed, cooking risotto about 10 minutes in all. Add the diced asparagus and cook for 3 minutes, stirring constantly, until rice is al dente. Spread risotto on a plate to cool.
6. Place the flour, egg and bread crumbs in separate shallow bowls. Shape the rice into quenelles (small footballs) with 2 teaspoons, lightly roll in the flour, then the egg, then the bread crumbs.
7. Heat 2 inches of vegetable oil in a small pot to 375 degrees and fry the risotto quenelles until brown and crisp. Drain on paper towels.
8. To serve, remove the cold soup from the refrigerator and remove any solidified butter to larger portion of soup. Heat the unrefrigerated soup till hot and pour into 12 small bowls, adding the reserved asparagus strands to 6 and the quenelles to 6. Pour the cold soup into 6 small bowls, adding the chopped raw salmon to each. Serve each diner with 3 different soups.
Yield: 6 servings.
 
Pineapples Victoria
This creme brulee is much easier to make than most, and because it is poured over the top of the pineapple, it is more forgiving.
 
Creme brulee simple:
2 pints heavy cream
Beans scraped from 2 vanilla pods
10 large eggs
 1/2 cup granulated sugar
 1/4 cup soft light brown sugar
 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
 
Pineapple:
3 gorgeous small pineapples
4 tablespoons butter
1/3 cup honey
1/3 cup light rum.
1. The day before serving, make the creme brulee by preheating the oven to 325 degrees and bringing the cream and vanilla seeds to a simmer. Whisk eggs and granulated sugar until blended. Add the hot cream in a steady stream, whisking the egg mixture constantly. Pour into a 2-quart souffle dish set in a roasting pan of hot water that comes 1/4 up the side and bake about 45 minutes -- the custard should be firm but not set. Cool to room temperature and refrigerate.
2. Cut pineapple in half lengthwise, scoop out flesh and chop it into bite-size pieces.
3. Preheat the broiler. Melt the butter, stir in the honey and add the pineapple and its juice. Saute until liquid evaporates. Add rum, warm it and set it on fire. Divide the mixture among the 6 pineapple shells, cover each with cold cr<heart>me brlee and sprinkle with the sugars. Broil until the sugars are caramelized, watching carefully.
Yield: 6 servings.

HEADLINE: A Quintet of Jerusalem Hotels

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.; WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. is a correspondent in the Jerusalem bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
ON Israel's independence day this May, the electricity in our Je rusalem apartment suddenly blew out. We knew the holiday would make it impossible to get an electrician until the next morning.
So it seemed like a good time to check out the city's new hotels, the 300-room Olive Tree and the 400-room Novotel, part of a planned four-hotel complex near the venerable American Colony Hotel in East Jerusalem. Our children, Emma and Adam, ages 6 and 4, were out of school anyway, and both hotels featured swimming pools and moderate rates, according to their advance publicity. My wife, Debbie Sontag, chief of the Jerusalem bureau of The New York Times, was to join us later.
 
Royal Plaza Olive Tree Hotel
At the Olive Tree, run by the small local Royal Plaza chain, the three of us were greeted warmly by the front desk staff, who were outfitted in Ottomanesque finery. The kids particularly liked the mirror-spangled brimless caps. The Olive Tree opened late last year, just in time for the anticipated millennial tourist boom here. Aimed mainly at Christian tour groups, it is a Holy Land theme inn, constructed around an ancient olive tree said to have marked a traditional stopping place for pilgrims to Jerusalem's Old City. The Damascus Gate is just 15 minutes by foot, along a route that passes the Garden Tomb -- a tranquil spot that Victorian archaeologists insisted was Jesus' true burial place -- and a brace of souvenir shops, the best of them being the Armenian-run Palestinian Pottery. 
 The rates were reasonable by Jerusalem standards: $180 for a double (including a kosher buffet breakfast, a feature of most Israeli hotels). I knew from a previous quick look around that the rooms were clean and well appointed, if a bit small and spartan. But none were available. The children's disappointment was tempered by the news that the indoor pool area was still under construction.
So we walked next door to the gleaming new Novotel. An airport-terminal-like lobby and dining room seemed utterly unpopulated. There was no one at the front desk, and, aside from a few kitchen workers in the middle distance, no hotel employees at all were visible.
Following signs, the kids quickly discovered the small outdoor pool, but the shaded and unheated water was rightly pronounced too frigid. When we returned to the lobby, a pleasant young woman at the reception desk explained that the hotel had not yet published a rate list. Rooms were available, but we could not be told the cost until the next day, when the off-site reservations office, closed on holidays, could be consulted by telephone.
Her guess, though, was about $250 for a couple and two children, who could share a pull-out couch.
Hmmm. That wasn't much different from the gracious and tasteful American Colony Hotel, a short stroll away, which I had originally ruled out for economy's sake.
 
American Colony
A cloistered compound developed from a 19th-century pasha's manse, the American Colony boasts some of the most pleasing public spaces in Jerusalem: an open dining courtyard with burbling fountain, a luxuriant "summer bar" garden, and -- the main attraction for my charges -- a sheltered, grassy pool area, including a wading pool.
The American Colony has, in fact, only one real competitor, though it is utterly different in style and scale: the King David, the lodging of choice for state visitors to Israeli West Jerusalem and high-end tour groups.
We were welcomed by the courtly porter, George Qumssiyah, who had retired after 50 years on the job only to return months later as a part-timer. While I registered, the manager, as he whisked by my tired and thirsty children, summoned a waiter to serve "our young guests" two fruit-juice cocktails.
Jerusalem is essentially a small town, and we were hardly anonymous visitors. A year and a half before, we had stayed in the hotel for a week, and since then, as with the other major hotels here, my wife and I had been in and out for meals and meetings dozens of times.
The photo ID required by hotels of local residents like ourselves was in my case the government press card carried by all correspondents based in Israel. So the front desk receptionist knew from a glance at the card that I was a reporter (though not my specific affiliation, which wouldn't have been of much interest to them anyway). That alone entitled us to a 10 percent discount, since the American Colony actively courts foreign journalists, who constitute a distressingly large share of Jerusalem's business travelers. And local residents are routinely given discounts at the city's better hotels.
An "executive" double room -- with the desks and data ports that are not included in all standard rooms -- listed for $250 a night. Children under seven (our present category) are free. Shortly afterward we were upgraded to a third-floor suite. They extended this courtesy, they said, because the suite happened to be free that evening, and we were a family of four seeking one room for one night.
Room 6 turned out be an enormous stone-and-tile Orientalist fantasy. Filling a strategic interior corner overlooking the leafy courtyard, it was bathed in light from the south and west. Down an interior flight of limestone stairs from the small entry hall were two quilt-topped queen beds; a couple of petite antique writing desks; an oversized armoire; and a formal sitting area with six mosaic-inlaid straight-backed chairs, arrayed as if awaiting relatives on a chaperoned wedding night.
And then there was the bathroom, a suite in itself, with a huge Jacuzzi-rigged tub. And a separate stone shower stall with multiple jets. And terry-cloth robes. And slippers. And fresh fruit. We were home.
After an afternoon swim, we had a room-service meal served quickly and decorously: a crisp Margarita pizza ($11) for the children, and a succulent "Persian" lentil soup ($7) for me -- good value by Jerusalem hotel standards.
The cozy Cellar Bar and grassy outdoor Summer Bar are perhaps the best stocked and most aesthetically pleasing drinking spots in the city, and it is all too easy to order one of the fine cognacs or single-malt whiskeys. But inquire first. I once paid a breathtaking $50 for an ounce and a half of Bowmore. Not that it wasn't delicious.
Comparing almost any hotel in Jerusalem to the American Colony is inherently unfair. This is an institution, rich in history and character. It is imbued with a sense of intimacy -- there are only 84 rooms -- not shared by any major Jerusalem hotel, upscale or otherwise. The independently managed gift shops include the city's best English-language bookstore. A string quartet offers regular recitals in an airy upstairs salon. The Middle Eastern food is excellent. Though proudly and distinctly Arab, it is a studiedly neutral meeting zone between the city's Palestinian East and Israeli West (as one of the area's few nonkosher luxury hotels, it operates fully during the Jewish Sabbath, making it a popular Friday dinner spot for secular Israelis).
 
Novotel Jerusalem
A few weeks later, feeling that I hadn't given the Novotel a proper chance, I returned, this time alone. The front desk could now give rates, and the previous estimate wasn't too far off: for my wife and me and two children the base rate would have been $227; a standard double is $151, but children 3 or older cost an additional $38 each.
I was quickly and courteously booked into a seventh-floor room at a single rate of $131, a bargain by Jerusalem standards. It was an odorless, colorless, compact rectangle with a firm queen bed and adjacent fold-out couch.
But it was not unpleasant: the room was bright, and impressively soundproofed. From the single large plate-glass window, I had a sweeping view over the Old City to Mount Scopus and the Mount of Olives. A room-length desktop featured built-in shelving, a telephone with a data port, and a new flat-screen color television set.
The four of us would have fitted easily, if tightly. Facilitating multiple occupancy, the small bathroom was separate from the small shower room.
But two months after its opening, the Novotel was not yet ready for prime time. There was a room service button on the telephone but no room service menu. The minibar was humming but empty. Cable television choices were limited to a few Israeli channels and international news networks; there were no movies, pay-per-view or otherwise. There was no shop on the premises for newspapers or sundries, though one is scheduled to open sometime this summer. A small gym was still under construction, but it has has since opened. Heading for the pool for a pre-breakfast dip, I was surprised to find it locked; the pool area is open only from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m.
Still, the Novotel was well scrubbed, well situated, and reasonably well run. And the buffet breakfast, in a basement dining hall, was abundant and tasty, with a good Mittel europa-meets-the-Middle East array of salads and cheeses and hummus and smoked fish.
 
Jerusalem Hilton
This hotel, which opened three years ago, has been encroaching on the King David's official-entourage business, especially for American delegations -- either because of buy-America-first policies, or because one too many Secret Service agents has seen the King David's film clip of its fire-bombed west wing.
The 385-room Hilton is a short walk from both the Old City gates and modern Jerusalem's pedestrianized center. Its cool austerity, the hard-edged creation of the ubiquitous Moshe Safdie, Israel's celebrated architect, is appealing to some, off-putting to others. The basement-level commercial gallery has a convenient assortment of trinket dealers, travel and car rental agencies, beauty parlors and a fast-service photo shop.
The pool area, stark and sunlit, with comfortable chaise loungues and lots of fluffy towels, includes an outdoor Jacuzzi and a large wading pool for toddlers. You can swim from the main pool under a glass barrier directly into the small but well-equipped gym, used by President Clinton during his recent visit (there is an $11 daily gym fee).
The rooms are standard American chain deluxe: strong on bathroom fixtures, short on charm, with pay-per-view movies and data ports. At a base rate of $350 for a single, $390 for a double, this is not bargain lodging. Add another $40 a night for rooms directly facing the terrific view of the Old City: if you traveled any distance to get here, you deserve to gaze on those massive floodlit walls. With our two kids and the Hilton's no-more-than-three-humans-per-room policy, we would require a "family room," for $490.
Yet few customers pay the full freight. Israeli citizens, as in almost every hotel in the country, are charged 25 to 50 percent less than foreign tourists. Package tours and other regular group customers also get preferential rates. The State Department, for example, negotiates a $230 rate for a standard single, my wife learned when she stayed there for a couple of nights covering a visit by Madeleine Albright last fall.
There was some spoiled fruit and a mold-covered room-service dinner abandoned in her room. It took three calls to the front desk to get it removed; rooms where guests checked out after noon could not be adequately cleaned before the next check-in, it was explained.
The room itself was clean and functional, as it had been when I stayed there a few months earlier, with a king-size bed and a good work space, though surprisingly dim lighting. Its Old City view was dominated by the construction site for a long-delayed retail and office complex next door. But the bathroom, with its marble tub and separate high-pressure shower stall, was big, brightly lighted, and well stocked with plush towels and Ahava lotions and shampoos. Here was some of the deluxe pampering that might be expected from the location and price.
 
King David Hotel
For true self-indulgence, right up the street is the King David, the city's first and still its best full-service luxury hotel. Until I stayed there, though, I wasn't convinced. There is an off-putting air of officiousness to the place, an inevitable byproduct of playing official host to Israel's A-list guests for half a century. Its grand-hotel air seemed at odds with the country's essentially informal culture. And it can take half an hour to get a cup of coffee in the ornate Baghdad Deco wood-inlaid lobby.
But to be a guest, we discovered, was to be treated cordially and expeditiously, all the time. Which one has a right to expect: standard rooms start at $398 for a double. For our family of four, the most economical option was a studio room listing for a heart-stopping $604 a night.
Yet when we stayed one night in November the 300-room hotel, unusually, was not nearly full. Our Israeli residency, as verified again by a glance at my government photo ID card, brought the suite down to $400 a night.
Then we were upgraded to a luxurious two-room "club suite" -- Room 338 on the southeast corner, with the unmatched King David view of the floodlit Old City walls and the great lawn and pool area that is the city's biggest and best-kept private green space. The listed rate for a club suite was $840, more than twice what we paid.
Impeccably redecorated with inlaid woods and fine fabrics, the bedroom and sitting room were spacious showcases of subtle lighting and high-grade cabinetry. The big desks and two-line telephones and large-screen television sets in each room made it easy to work.
Our full-course room-service dinner came in 15 minutes; it was excellent, as was the service, though the menu was mostly of the rootless Continental variety. The empty table disappeared quietly a couple of hours later -- and a small Easterish basket of plush toys and sweets appeared in its place. It was my daughter's birthday, which I had mentioned to a doting doorman; from then on, everyone working in the hotel seemingly knew that Emma had just turned 6.
The most striking thing about the King David is not its opulence but its personnel, who have become an integral part of local history. Flip on the television and you are confronted with one of those welcome-to-the-hotel films one would normally click past without a thought. But this one is different. It is the story of Israel, as lived and told by the waiters and cooks and chambermaids and doormen of the King David Hotel.
The video doesn't pull punches: it shows July 22, 1946, in all its destruction and carnage, when Menachem Begin's underground Irgun movement blew up its west wing, killing 91 people, most but not all of them members of the billeted British forces who were Irgun's targets. Employees vividly recall the fierce Arab-versus-Israeli fighting within rifle range of the hotel in 1948 and again in 1967 -- but they also remember the elaborate pyramid-motif cake they baked for their cherished guest Anwar el-Sadat in his historic visit in 1977.
History, after all, is what Jerusalem is all about. The open rear verandas of the King David are the perfect spot to take it all in: the 16th-century Ottoman city walls, the 7th century's great gold Dome of the Rock and the many visible remnants of the far older city underneath, from Herod's massive stone foundations to the tombs and alleys of the Mount of Olives above. It is no ordinary hotel, and it is no ordinary city.
 
Sleek new lodgings and venerable classics
For the past few centuries -- or at least the past few years -- Jerusalem's innkeepers had been braced for a millennial tourist crush. New hotels rushed to open their doors, and older establishments spruced up lobbies and hired guides versed in Holy Land pilgrimage sites.
But the results fell short of expectations. Though Jerusalem had a third more visitors from January to March than in the same period last year, the supply of rooms still exceeded the demand. For tourists, that was the good news. The bad news was that prices, already high for less than posh lodgings, were raised past Midtown Manhattan levels, and there they have stayed. But few people pay the full listed rates.
Jerusalem is tour-group land, and whether the travelers are Christian pilgrims or furrow-browed academics or an extended family on a bar-mitzvah junket, they are probably paying a third less than do walk-in foreigners. (Israelis, by dint of nationality, get steep discounts.)
Our hotel requirements are also somewhat atypical: we want a room with a well-lighted desk with a telephone, plus a port for a computer modem, plus play space for small children. We consider a pool another necessity in this hot, dry climate. Reliable room service, morning newspapers and drinkable coffee round out our list of non-negotiable demands.
Forgo some or even most of that, and there are a dozen or so Jerusalem hotels that offer good to superior service. But none come cheap.
In most of Jerusalem's hotels, the "high season" includes the entire summer; winter break from Hanukkah to the Epiphany; and the mini-seasons of Passover, Easter week and Succoth. These rates are for standard rooms as of this month. They include breakfast buffet. Food is kosher in all hotels listed except the American Colony.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Taking Infants Onto the Plane

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
DR. PHILIP FISCHER, a specialist in pediatric and adolescent medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, believes there is no age at which an infant is automatically too young to travel by air. He and some of his colleagues take issue with a report in a British medical journal depicting perils to the very young in flight.
The issue arose last month when Edward Lister, owner of the Travel Medicine Clinic in Rancho Mirage, Calif., a nurse belonging to the International Society of Travel Medicine, asked the members' e-mail forum if there was any reason not to let a family take a 3-week-old infant on a 2,000-mile air trip to visit relatives. Plentiful dialogue followed, with almost all the medical experts supporting Dr. Fischer, a leader in the field of children's travel, in his statement: "I would personally not restrict air travel because of a child's age." 
 Dr. Fischer had one caveat. "A 2,000-mile air trip probably involves a big transition and some physical challenges for a postpartum mother and for a family adjusting to a new baby," he said. "I would hope the scheduled itinerary is appropriate for all involved." Dr. Sheila Mackell of Oakland, Calif., a pediatrician and member of the society, said she likewise asked patients whether they were ready for such a journey.
 
A Need to Hurry Home
In the travel medicine dialogue, many experts pointed out reasons that parents often undertook long air journeys with newborns: the family may prefer to have the delivery someplace other than where they live, or, commonly these days, the family may have adopted a baby in another state, or another country, and want to hurry home and settle in.
Dr. David R. Shlim, a specialist in high-mountain illness and traveler's diarrhea, who has a clinic in Jackson Hole, Wyo., said: "Many women who live in a developing country will leave that country in the last month of pregnancy in order to deliver in a safer environment. Often they have to leave their spouses behind and even children who might be in school.
"They are understandably anxious to get back to their life in Nepal, or India, or Africa, as soon as possible after delivery. It is this group that is most likely to want to travel with a newborn baby. We flew home to Nepal from Bangkok with our first child when he was 8 days old."
Gail Rosselot, a nurse practitioner and public health expert who directs a clinic in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and her husband took their adoptive daughter on an air trip when she was 9 days old. The couple flew to California to meet her when she was 2 days old, then flew to Houston and on to San Antonio to complete adoption formalities before returning to New York through Houston.
Ms. Rosselot said that on her trip, Continental Airlines asked her how old the baby was, but said that 9 days was old enough and let her board. Clients of her clinic now tell her they have received conflicting information from an airline on the phone and then at the boarding gate, and sometimes aboard, and have met varying rules when they took connecting flights from California to Texas and home to New York.
 
'Yellow Book' Warning
Among the sparse material published on the subject is a notation in Health Information for International Travel 1999-2000, the "yellow book," published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Under "Air Travel During Pregnancy," there is this: "Women traveling with infants should keep in mind that newborns under 6 weeks old should not fly because their alveoli are not completely functional."
Dr. Phyllis E. Kozarsky of the Emory University Travel Clinic in Atlanta, who helped write this guideline, said that the 6-week age limit represented a theoretical consensus "since there are really no firm data to support or refute."
Dr. Mackell in Oakland characterized as inconclusive a report published in the British Medical Journal in 1998 saying that infants who traveled by air were more likely to be victims of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. She said that this study had raised wide concern in the travel-medicine community.
She and Dr. Kozarsky both said, however, that when an infant was involved they usually asked "is this trip necessary." Dr. Kozarsky said: "Occasionally we see adoptive parents who will be traveling to pick up their babies from overseas or even within the country and wish to bring the child home as soon as possible, and thus the question arises. If there is no urgency, however, one might be a bit more conservative."
On the issue of transmitting infections, Dr. Mackell said that the air in planes was perfectly good but that the passenger sitting next to the baby might be carrying something, and long proximity could be a problem. One participant in the dialogue, Dr. Alison Clough of the Travel and Geographic Medicine Clinic in Tucson, Ariz., a family doctor, said that studies had shown airline air to be quite clean and she believed that most post-air-travel colds and flu she had seen were picked up in airports and restaurants.
 
Age Rules Differ
Of seven major domestic airlines, three are concerned with minimum passenger age. Continental will not accept a child who is under 7 days old, according to Julie Gardner, a spokeswoman. United, according to Chris Nardella, a spokeswoman, wants a doctor's letter saying a child under the age of 7 days is able to fly. If American Airlines is asked the question, according to John Hotard, a spokesman, it replies that it does not accept infants under 3 days of age. But he said: "If someone arrives with a baby in a bassinet, our agent is not going to say, 'Excuse me, ma'am, may I inspect your baby?' "
Trans World Airlines, US Airways, Delta and Northwest Airlines report no restrictions.
Dr. Karl Neumann of Queens, a travel-medicine expert who specializes in pediatrics, had a few suggestions for parents taking infants -- or young children -- on planes. First, he said, parents are sometimes told their children need copious liquids in flight, and this is not the case. "It just gives them a stomachache," he said. However, he said, the swallowing involved in breast-feeding or taking a bottle will often relieve earache in ascent and descent.
"Lap children," that is children under the age of 2, can travel free domestically, but the experts said these babies traveled most safely in a rear-facing child seat strapped into an airline seat. This means buying a ticket for the child.
In April, Northwest instituted a "special delivery" fare for parents going overseas to adopt a child. In company with KLM, it has a reduced fare to 100 destinations the lines serve in Asia, Africa, Europe, India and the Middle East. Information may be found on the Northwest Web site at www.nwa.com. Enter "adoption fare" in the inquiry box. For special services: (800) 322-4162.
British Airways created special adoption fares in April. These too provide a 65 percent discount on the full economy fare from 21 United States cities to any point on the line's main routes. The line does not have a minimum age for passengers, according to John W. Lampl, its spokesman. Information: (800) 247-9297.

HEADLINE: To See Japan, Try Rail Pass And Ryokan

BYLINE: By PERRI KLASS; PERRI KLASS is an assistant professor of pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine.

 BODY:
THE most triumphant moment of the whole trip to Japan occurred on the grounds of the stupendous 16th century "white heron" castle of Himeji.
There, with the castle towering above us, we encountered three men dressed as samurai, and my 4-year-old son, Anatol, knew his Japanese dreams had come true. Using gestures, the three samurai invited the American child to pose with them, and even put a sword in his hands, while his two siblings snapped photos. For the rest of the trip, Anatol mentioned casually, many times a day, that he had met real samurai, and held a real samurai sword. 
 It started with the frequent-flier tickets. My older children had two weeks of school vacation, and we had this vague idea of going somewhere exciting. But where do you take a 10th-grade boy (Orlando), a sixth-grade girl (Josephine) and a 4-year-old, not to mention two well-meaning and reasonably well-traveled parents? We had initially thought of Greece -- all that classical heritage, lots of ruins to climb on. Everyone was fairly enthusiastic about that, though the older kids were wary about being taken to too many museums.
It turned out that for our miles we could get only three tickets to Athens. But I was told about a special sale on tickets to Tokyo, and we had enough miles for five free tickets.
We discussed this with our usual thoroughness: "Japan?"
"Cool!" said Orlando, the 16-year-old. And we booked the tickets. (It subsequently turned out that we had been given incorrect information about this "sale" and were not actually entitled to the tickets, but Delta honored the offer.)
As a family, we have no special connection to Japan. Orlando has a brown belt in karate and can count to 10 in Japanese. That and a certain familiarity with "The Mikado" was about the sum of our cultural and linguistic expertise. We worried about the language barrier and the possible expense -- our goal was a decidedly budget-level trip.
Before we left, we bought Japan Rail Pass vouchers, giving us unlimited train travel for one week.
We also booked just one hotel room for our first three nights in Tokyo, using a brochure from the Japan tourist office in Manhattan that listed the members of the Japanese Inn Group throughout the country. This consortium of inexpensive Japanese-style inns provides mostly ryokan accommodations -- you sleep on futons, you often share a bathroom, and you take off your shoes before entering the inn. I called one of the inns in Tokyo and talked with a helpful man who spoke a little English and said he had a room big enough for the five of us.
And so we flew from Boston via Atlanta to Tokyo, a fairly easy flight, though a long one. We watched a bunch of movies. Ate meals at what seemed like random moments. Orlando and Josephine studied the phrase books, occasionally informing us; we learned, for example, that an unmarried woman over 25 used to be referred to as "Christmasu Cakie" because nobody wants to eat Christmas cake after Christmas.
Parentally, we suggested practicing greetings and numbers and directional words. And when in Tokyo, we found our way onto the cheap train and then the subway to our hotel, the Ryokan Kikuya, where there was indeed a big room waiting for us with four folded futons. Each hotel we stayed in in Japan assumed that a 4-year-old would sleep with his parents, and Anatol obliged, cheerfully occupying the space on the futons between us until by morning he had wiggled between the mattresses and onto the tatami mat floor.
We spent two days in Tokyo, sightseeing as hard as we could. The subway system lived up to its reputation: complicated, at times amazingly crowded, spotless and unbelievably efficient. There are some subway maps with only Japanese characters, some with English names for stations; at major stations there are attendants who can answer questions. We got pretty good at using the vending machines to buy tickets, and at following the signs from line to line.
Up early one morning, we took the subway to the Tsukiji district to see the famous fish market, in the process getting a taste of Tokyo rush hour, complete with its gloved "pushers" stuffing people into the trains. The fish market was overwhelming: what seemed like miles and miles of fish from bins of the tiny to huge slabs of the gigantic. We found food ready to eat in the city market nearby: round, fresh octopus fritters; skewers of grilled eel; cold sliced omelet with duck meat.
We wandered in the neighborhoods of downtown Tokyo, visiting the Sony building in the Ginza district, where we tried on glasses that projected videos in front of our eyes and played very advanced PlayStation games (well, some of us).
We visited the Tokyo National Museum in Ueno Park and admired Buddha statues and painted screens (well, some of us). Our hotel was in the Asakusa area, one of the older Tokyo neighborhoods, and right nearby was the seventh-century Sensoji, the oldest temple in Tokyo. It is approached down Nakamise Dori, a lane of what you would have to classify as Japanese temple tchotchke shops. We bought hot little cakes flavored with green tea, and Orlando got his fortune told in the temple, shaking a box until a stick fell out, then matching the number on that stick to a little drawer and extracting a paper fortune, complete with English translation.
And then we activated our rail passes, having previously exchanged the vouchers at a special office at Tokyo Station, and for the next week we zipped around the island of Honshu, obeying the universal rail pass imperative of making it pay by traveling as much as possible. The trains were almost all Shinkansen, the famous bullet trains. From Tokyo to Kyoto, then on to Nara, Hiroshima, the castle town of Himeji, the mountain village of Takayama, and finally, the historic resort city of Nikko.
AS soon as we arrived in a new city, we would reserve train seats to the next city, communicating with the officials in the train office by pointing to the trains we wanted on the timetables and showing our passes. Sometimes they spoke some English; they were always patient, and the little pasteboard reservation cards they gave us always turned out to be for the right trains at the right times on the right tracks.
We reserved hotels by calling ahead to the next city as well; the Japanese telephone system was easy to use with the phone cards we bought along the way. We slept extremely comfortably on the ryokan futons, usually paying just over $100 a night for the five of us, although we were traveling in low season. Japanese yukata (robes) were provided, as were thermoses of green tea, and we were made to feel very welcome.
These are not the elegant traditional ryokan inns that feature Japanese antiques and beautifully arranged meals, but they generated a certain kind of family togetherness and good humor as we tried to remember the rules about shoes (leave your own at the entrance and put on slippers, leave the slippers at the door to your room, and be sure to change into toilet slippers when you visit the bathroom).
In Kyoto one morning, we started out to sightsee in the rain, and the proprietress of the Ryokan Murakamiya insisted on supplying us with umbrellas, one apiece, taking great care to select the appropriate umbrella (size, color, importance) for each family member.
We visited Nijo Castle, built by the first Tokugawa shogun, Ieyasu. The building, constructed of cypress and decorated with painted wall panels and screens, is famous for its nightingale floors, which "sing" when you walk on them -- a security measure that made it impossible to sneak up on anyone.
At Kinkakuji, the Temple of the Golden Pavilion, we wandered in the temple garden, admiring the pavilion in its lake setting. There were many Japanese high school students, in uniform, and it turned out that their assignment was to practice English by finding foreigners and conversing with them. Since foreigners were in short supply, each member of our family patiently went through several rounds of the set questions. All the students were reading from the same script: May I ask you some questions? What do you think of Kyoto? Shall we take a picture together?
Also in Kyoto, we visited Ryoanji Temple, where the famous Zen rock garden in all its harmony of rock and sand survived the energy of our family's visit. At Nara, the site of the first permanent Japanese capital (in 710), there were sacred deer in Narakoen park; you buy special "deer cookies" to feed them.
Another rainy day, in Hiroshima, was oddly divided between the memories of the atomic bomb and the pace of the modern city that has risen since 1945. We started with a visit to the Peace Memorial Museum in Peace Memorial Park, with its careful re-creation, in models and pictures, of what the city looked like before the bomb was dropped, and then after. The exhibit has been expanded to take more cognizance of the course of the war prior to 1945, in particular of Japanese military activities and war crimes in Asia.
We walked across the park to the cenotaph, the flame burning beneath it, and Anatol rang the peace bell. We saw the thousand cranes statue in honor of a young leukemia victim and, across the river from the park, the skeletal A-Bomb Dome. In the afternoon, we were wandering in a vibrant city, through streets and streets of arcadelike shopping districts and restaurants, thinking inevitable thoughts about human resilience and rebuilding.
In Takayama, after a beautiful ride through the mountains on a special train with enormous windows, we visited old wooden houses. At the morning pickle market along the river, all kinds of unusual mountain vegetables were for sale in pickled form, and samples on toothpicks were freely offered.
Oh yes, we ate. The food was terrific everywhere in Japan. Among the five of us, there is a range in what you might call adventurous seafood eating -- Josephine, who is 10, eats pretty much everything, even if it's still moving. The rest of us are ranged a bit behind her. But everyone liked the food -- big bowls of noodle soup, sushi, shabu-shabu one night at an all-you-can-eat joint where you just kept bringing your tray back and getting more raw meat and vegetables to cook.
In Hiroshima, the local specialty is okonomiyaki, a complex omelet involving vegetables and meat and seafood and Worcestershire sauce. We found our way to okonomiyaki stands, dozens of them, where we sat at a counter, watching a highly skilled cook put our omelets together. All over Japan, we patronized the many excellent French pastry shops for breakfast, and I discovered my ideal breakfast confection: a large flat pastry topped with flakes of dried fish and seaweed. I still yearn for it.
We also did very well at conveyor belt sushi establishments, where you sit at stools along a counter and take plates of whatever interests you off the moving belt; a spout on the counter dispenses green tea; someone counts up your empty plates to calculate your bill. One night, we also tried robatayaki, little dishes of food cooked to our order and served to us on a long wooden paddle: sardines, snails, pork skewers, pumpkin. Everywhere in Japan there are window displays of plastic food, showing you exactly what you'll get. We quickly got over any embarrassment about leading the waitress outside the restaurant and pointing at the window.
In fact, we pretty quickly got over all embarrassment about everything, even the 10th grader and the sixth grader, who have been known, in their home country, to be mortified by any public utterance made by a parent or sibling.
IN Japan, it was just too obvious that we were the completely clueless, linguistically impaired strangers that we were. It became a family joke: whenever we beckoned the waitress out into the street to look at the plastic food displays, one of the children would hiss loudly, "Now they're going to think we're tourists!"
Our last major stop before returning to Tokyo was Nikko, 90 miles north of Tokyo, site of the tombs and shrines of the first Tokugawa shogun and his descendants. There we spent the day seeing shrines and admiring the colorful and ornately carved architecture of the shrines and gates set among the cedar groves. These buildings are very different in style from the other temples we visited; they teem with animals and figures and colors, ornate and elaborate and liberally gilded.
We had reserved rooms at the grand old hotel, the Nikko Kanaya, founded in 1873. We had asked for their cheapest rooms, with no private bath, but they kindly upgraded us. In the evening, we gave ourselves a taste of grand hotel life. We descended on the main dining hall and ate local rainbow trout, grilled with soy sauce, and Larry and I had sake. We wandered the halls of the hotel, looking at photos of former guests, of roadsters and ice skating parties, of registers signed by everyone from Helen Keller to Eleanor Roosevelt to Charles Lindbergh to Indira Gandhi.
And then it was back to Tokyo for a couple of days, with that odd sensation of coming back to a completely foreign city that now seems oddly familiar and comforting. We let Orlando lead us through the electronics district of Akihabara, where the neon was nonstop and the video games were wall to wall, took the elevator to the top of the Metropolitan Government towers for the view over Tokyo from the 45th floor, visited the enormous Takashimaya Times Square department store. And finally home, where the first order of business was to develop the pictures of Anatol with the samurai so he could relive the moment as often as possible.
We ended up using one of those pictures as the invitation to his fifth birthday party. That moment -- with his hand on a real samurai sword, posing with three men whose language he could not speak, and the white heron castle looming above them -- may have been a high point of his year, if not his life to date. It was a moment when travel and history and story all came together, and the strange and exotic opened up to include him and welcome him in.
 
And it doesn't have to cost a year's salary
 
Resources
The Japan National Tourist Organization's office is at 1 Rockefeller Plaza, Suite 1250, New York, N.Y. 10020; (212) 757-5640. It will furnish information and mounds of literature about hotels and transportation.
We relied heavily on a directory we found at the tourist office put out by the Japanese Inn Group (members.aol.com/jinngroup), whose ryokan are as economical and hospitable as the booklet describes.
Japan rail passes can be bought only outside Japan by those who hold non-Japanese passports. The passes are available at travel agencies in the United States; the national tourist organization can provide names of agencies that specialize in Japan. Vouchers are sold for a one, two, or three-week pass, which is exchanged at a Japan Rail Pass office at a station in Japan. (There also is one at Narita Airport outside Tokyo, if you want to start your pass immediately upon arrival.)
The passes make train travel in Japan affordable, although the costs change weekly. Last week a one-week pass cost $367 for first class and $275 for coach (by comparison, a round-trip ticket from Tokyo to Hiroshima was $470 first class and $362 coach, and a round trip to Kyoto was $364 first class and $264 coach). A two-week pass cost $594 first class and $438 coach.
Children ages 6 to 11 travel for half price, with any two children 5 and under riding free if accompanied by an adult. A nongovernment agency that sells passes is the Japan Travel Bureau at 810 Seventh Avenue (between 52nd and 53rd Streets) in Manhattan. It's wise to call in advance on the latest prices (212) 698-4919.

What to Read
We carried Frommer's Japan guide (Macmillan, 1998) as well as Lonely Planet's Japan (1997). We also took a pile of Japanese-themed books, some new, most not. In addition to Roland Barthes's "The Empire of Signs" (Noonday, 1983) and "Dave Barry Does Japan" (Fawcett, 1993), we had several works of history and sociology, but what we really read was fiction, and it added a great deal to the trip. This included James Clavell's "Shogun" (Dell, 1976), Arthur S. Golden's "Memoirs of a Geisha" (Vintage, 1999), Yukio Mishima's "The Golden Pavilion" (Vintage, 1994), and Junichiro Tanizaki's "The Makioka Sisters" (Vintage, 1995).
And, of course we read aloud Anatol's book, "Sayonara, Mrs. Kackleman" (Puffin Books, 1991). This beautifully illustrated work by Maira Kalman follows a brother and sister on their trip to Japan (to avoid a piano lesson), and we were all delighted whenever we came across an experience that matched one in the book.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
A Dutch Moment of Genius in Its Full Glory

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: AMSTERDAM

 BODY:
A TINY country that over a short period produces artists of the stature of Rembrandt, Vermeer, Frans Hals, Jan Steen, Jacob van Ruisdael and Pieter de Hooch has good reason to wax proud over its golden age of painting. Indeed, the Netherlands is doing so yet again with "The Glory of the Golden Age," a "best of" exhibition of Dutch 17th-century art that is being held at the Rijksmuseum here through Sept. 17 to celebrate the museum's 200th anniversary.
The Rijksmuseum is itself, of course, a monument to the golden age and, as such, has been able to provide around half of the items in the show (with Rembrandt's "Night Watch" the pivotal work in the exhibition, just as it is the iconic painting of the permanent collection). But for this occasion, to complement its own masterpieces, it has also borrowed essential works from other Dutch museums as well as from collections elsewhere in Europe and in the United States. 
 In the main part of the exhibition, some 200 paintings, sculptures and works of decorative art have been organized both chronologically and around themes, some obvious ("Sky and Water," "Masters of Landscape," "The Delft Light"), others more quirky ("Whims and Drolleries," "Extravagantly Decked Out," "Deceptively Realistic").
Until July 16, 96 drawings and prints were also presented in a dimly lighted gallery on a lower floor, but their fragility prevented their being displayed through September.
The package is impressive: with such raw material, how could it be otherwise? But the show's organizers have also done their bit. By placing sculptures and decorative arts in the same area as paintings, they underline how different art forms were flourishing simultaneously. And with the thematic hanging, they demonstrate how many different schools of paintings were busy at the same time, from portraiture to landscapes, from still life to genre painting.
Yet perhaps most crucially, the show offers a salutary reminder that, for all the renown of Rembrandt, Vermeer and their like today, it was not artists who created the golden age. Rather, it was a special moment in Dutch history, characterized by political enlightenment and economic prosperity, that generated a veritable boom in artistic creation.
In other parts of Europe, art was still reflecting the power of kings and popes. In the Netherlands, it mirrored the emergence of a new kind of civil society, one largely run by and for its Protestant mercantile burghers.
Even more remarkably, for more than 30 years until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, the Dutch Republic, as the United Provinces of the north became known, was fighting to consolidate its independence from Spain, which had inherited the Netherlands from the Holy Roman Empire. Yet even during this time, its fleet was establishing new colonies and opening new trading routes that turned Amsterdam into an opulent port city: its population jumped from 50,000 in 1600 to 200,000 in 1650. And with prosperity came a demand for fancier homes and art to put in them.
Amsterdam, which drew Rembrandt from his native Leiden, was at the center of artistic activity, but it was not alone. Haarlem, Utrecht, Delft and Dordrecht, as well as Leiden, had important guilds of artists, in many cases working independently of one another. For example, in Utrecht, which remained largely Roman Catholic, a tradition of religious paintings was kept alive by painters who had studied Caravaggio in Rome. Elsewhere, paintings were everywhere except churches -- in town halls, guild houses and private homes.
Thus, relieved of the need to paint royal portraits and biblical scenes, many artists became unconscious chroniclers of the social history of the era. Important burghers, with their black satin suits and frilly lace collars, were natural subjects, but so also were maritime battles and elegant cityscapes. Domestic interiors, in which the nouveaux riches took special pride, were presented with revolutionary realism, with the paintings on their walls duly reproduced. Indeed, with still lifes decorating every self-respecting home, it was an enviable time and place to be an artist.
"Thousands of painters of varying talents were active during this century, producing several million paintings altogether," Jan Piet Filedt Kok writes in an introduction to this exhibition's catalog. "The production of decorative art -- ceramics, glass, silver and furniture -- achieved new heights, too; only sculpture lagged behind at first."
"The Glory of the Golden Age" starts by introducing the "New Faces" of Dutch portraiture through Thomas de Keyser's "Syndics of the Amsterdam Goldsmiths' Guild" (on loan from the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio) and Hals's bucolic "Marriage Portrait of Isaac Massa and Beatrix van der Laen." This leads to the "Extravagantly Decked Out" section, where carefully painted accessories, from leather gloves with gold thread, pearls and sequins to delicate lace headwear, are both examples and symbols of wealth.
"Deceptively Realistic" is of course dedicated to still lifes, with Ambrosius Bosschaert's "Bouquet of Flowers in a Vase" of 1618 reminiscent of the tulipomania that gripped the Netherlands in the early 17th century (until the speculative bubble burst in 1637).
But the fascination with still lifes went far beyond flower arrangements: with just a handful of works, the exhibition illustrates the virtuosity of painters who took special pride in portraying, say, cheese or fish or feathers or oysters, in each case as a realistically as possible.
SEEMINGLY EVERYDAY" is particularly interesting since it mirrors the ambivalence that the Protestant Dutch felt about their own affluence ("The Embarrassment of Riches," as Simon Schama entitled his acclaimed book on the Dutch golden age). Painters evidently enjoyed showing people having a good time, but they justified this by suggesting they were warning of the perils of decadence. "In Luxury Beware" by Jan Steen, for instance, shows a party in full swing, while the bare-breasted women and drunken men in Nicolaus Knupfer's "Brothel Scene" could be portrayed in the Calvinist Netherlands only as an admonition against immorality.
Subsequent sections -- there are 23 -- underscore how, at the same time as they kept one eye on the market, Dutch painters of the period were also interested in exploring new techniques. For instance, chiaroscuro -- the strong use of light and shadow -- was initially borrowed from Caravaggio, but the Delft painters took it further, creating a more natural sense of drama. Vermeer's mastery of this technique can be seen here in "The Glass of Wine," on loan from the Gemaldegalerie in Berlin, and in the Rijksmuseum's own "Kitchen Maid."
Yet for all the array of treasures proffered by the golden age, the exhibition cannot escape the dominating presence of Rembrandt and Hals. Three Rembrandts on loan to the Rijksmuseum -- "The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicholas Tulp" from the Mauritshuis in The Hague, "Flora" from the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg and "The Wedding of Samson" from the Gemaldegalerie in Dresden -- show the broad range of his techniques. Similarly, in the section called "Militia Companies," paintings of citizens' military units by other artists point up the remarkable composition of Rembrandt's "Night Watch."
The section dedicated to Rembrandt and Hals includes numerous portraits by both men, but their styles can best be contrasted in two large oils that hang side by side: Rembrandt's 1662 "Syndics," owned by the Rijksmuseum, and Hals's 1664 "Regents of the Old Men's Almshouse in Haarlem," on loan from the Frans Halsmuseum in Haarlem. While Rembrandt's painting of five burghers and a servant from the drapers' guild offers six detailed and well-lighted portraits, Hals's seven regents -- dressed in black against a black background, with only their faces, hands and white collars immediately visible -- reveal how he achieved his effect with a few hurried brush strokes.
Scattered throughout the exhibition are stone and marble sculptures (mainly busts of worthy burghers), embroidered chairs, wooden cabinets, glass and silver goblets and a good selection of Delft pottery.
Most unusual, perhaps, is an 11-foot-tall copper candelabrum made by Joost Gerritsz in 1640 and donated that same year by the Dutch East India Company to Japan's shogun as part of a successful campaign to curry favor with the Japanese ruler: from 1641 until early in the 19th century, the Dutch enjoyed a European monopoly of trade with Japan. The candelabrum, now permanently on display in a complex of tombs and temples at Nikko in Japan, returned to the Netherlands for the first time for this show.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
Architecture's Claim on the Future: The Blob

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
DARWIN is in the air. Mark C. Taylor, a theology professor at Williams College who writes frequently on architecture, brought this to my attention earlier this year. I was saying I wanted a break from my Freudian-Marxian routine. Taylor leaned closer. "Darwin," he said, sounding like a doctor prescribing a pill.
Meanwhile, Adam Phillips, whose DNA strands should be studied by medical science for the key to higher intelligence, has come out with "Darwin's Worms" (Free Press), a book about the parallels between Darwin's thinking and Freud's. Add the popularity of "Survivor," top it with the mapping of the human genome, and you have something more than hula-hoops. You have survival of the fittest hula-hoops. 
 Computer technology is rapidly changing the environment for architects as well as for businesses and nations. How are they adapting to it? In what form will architecture survive?
The Venice Biennale's Seventh International Architecture Exhibition, which opened last month and runs through Oct. 29, is right in step with these evolutionary times. It features the latest strain to emerge in architecture in recent years: "blob" design, so-called, produced with the aid of computer animation software. Biomorphic and invertebrate, with seldom a trace of the T-squares most architects long ago abandoned, blobs look like things you would expect to see rising from an electronic version of the primordial ooze. As if to signal the origin of a species, previously lurking in the depths of the Lagoon, the Biennale rounds up blob projects by Greg Lynn, Lars Spuybroek, Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos, Jesse Reiser and Uneko Umamoto, Hani Rashid and Lise Ann Couture, and other pixel prodigies. Lynn, in particular, was ubiquitous. It was trilobytes, trilobytes, everywhere you turned.
Venice is an ideal setting for examining architecture in Darwinian terms. The city is a pageant of survival and adaptation, of triumphant resistance to climate, conquest and time. Even in Ruskin's day, Venice was an inhabited skeleton. The city's economic and military power had mutated into a pink and gray romance. Its more recent rebirth as a center of art and tourism prefigured the transformation now taking place in cities throughout the post-industrial world.
Architecture, too, has lately come to resemble the inhabited shell of an extinct beast. Architects are heirs to the heroic tradition of pyramids, temples and cathedrals. Yet many of the most talented among them are lucky if they are hired to design a loft. There has never been more building in the world, nor a lower ratio of architecture to junk. Architects now are day-trippers in their own domain.
This year's Biennale should lift their spirits. Usually, this event is the poor, abject cousin of the Art Biennale, the glitzy career fest with which it alternates every other year. This year feels different. The European press turned out. The cameras and notepads seemed to confirm architecture's increasing prominence on the cultural map. Compared with the Art Biennale, it remains an event where ideas matter more than dollars. It appears that in the year 2000, a certain cachet has attached itself to ideas. People may be awakening to the fact that it takes ideas, as well as money, for great cities to survive.
Organized by the Roman architect Massimiliano Fuksas, this year's Biennale is called "The City: Less Esthetics, More Ethics." New Yorkers may find it hard to get behind this proposition. Unless theme park lampposts are your idea of frisky urban design, it will probably not occur to you that New York is suffering from aesthetic overload. Fortunately, the show contradicts its theme at every turn. Congestion, pollution, urban decay, homelessness, even xenophobia and racial intolerance -- social conscience here gets the high art treatment. Welcome to Italy, where every fashion editor carries a Marxist membership card in her Prada purse.
Ethics are wearing bright colors this season. That's the fashion message at the Italian pavilion, the main attraction in the village of national pavilions laid out in the Giardini, the city's public gardens. Visitors enter through a gantlet of monitors displaying famous talking-head architects shot against vivid pink, orange, green and blue electronic backgrounds. The heads look so aged against the pop-up video colors. They must be addressing issues of great ethical import. Never mind. The volume is too low to hear them.
Meanwhile, in the Arsenale, the ancient naval yard where Venice launched the ships that patrolled her maritime empire, there stretches an immense video wall, two stories high and several football fields long, representing la Citta. To a snappy soundtrack, streaming video images hurtle by -- scenes from the global metropolis projected by cameras stationed in two dozen cities. Crowds wait at Asian intersections to cross streets bathed in neon. Trains whoosh past shantytowns. Night falls over a nameless skyline. Waves crash. Desert dunes billow. Heaven knows how these natural features got into the city. The idea must be that the city is getting into them.
I went to Venice with a question in mind. There are now two generations of architects below the age of 50. Are they developing new forms of practice?
Ours is not an era when the government, private patrons, professional organizations or the press can provide architects with cultural connective tissue or unite them behind common causes. In the cities, our most talented architects are spinning freely within professional vacuums of their own devising. Their ethic is that of shipwrecks: every office for itself. No wonder architects have been so ineffectual in confronting the pressures of global urbanization. To reckon with the monoculture, the shape of practices will have to change more radically than the shape of buildings. Flexible working relationships must be built across geographic and corporate borders. At least, I see no other way out of the present moral impasse.
The national pavilions are signposts pointed in the wrong direction. It feels so dated, in the era of mass tourism, the Internet and the E.E.C., to wander through this display. Fortunately, nationalism is not a major problem afflicting architecture today. Jet lag is a bigger issue. Architects spend as much time on planes as State Department envoys. Their far-flung projects are agents of cross-cultural fertilization.
This idea was evident throughout the Biennale, but nowhere more clearly than in the Austrian Pavilion, of all places. Organized by Hans Hollein, the presentation focused on Vienna but highlighted recent work by non-Austrian architects, including Zaha Hadid, Greg Lynn, Peter Cook and Colin Fournier. An elegant installation in dove gray, white and black, the exhibition included a large map of project sites. The map conveyed the message that cities can foster solidarity among architects, not only in matters of style, but also in resistance to stupidity.
The message was clearly aimed at the nationalists among us. It was even more explicit in a separate gallery, an "Area of Tolerance," that presented architect-designed agitprop posters attacking Austria's Jorg Haider and his anti-immigration policies. But the main part of the show offered a more lasting polemic. With graceful understatement, it suggested that city lovers are an embattled species. We have more in common with one another than with the rest of our respective nations. The ethical fiber that binds us is the cosmopolitan belief that the function of a city is to refuse everything less than the best.
Elsewhere, Hollein has contributed a project of his own design. "Dencity" is a floating raft that holds a contemplative garden inspired by Ryoanji, Kyoto's celebrated temple garden of rock and sand . East and West, war and peace, water and land: these surrealist juxtapositions compose a haunting meditation on the architect's role in a shrinking globe.
The German show is shocking. The exhibition focuses on Berlin, logical for the first Biennale held since the government returned there. The theme is the capital's transformation over the last catastrophic century. One gallery displays huge black and white street maps that track the city's development at 10-year intervals. In the second gallery, we segue smoothly from moral neutrality to moral equivalency. The wall is hung with photographs of Berlin landmarks as they are transformed or destroyed, by wars hot and cold. Captions are limited to name, address and year. This presentation confuses chronology with history. The result is that history is brutalized.
IF I hadn't known that Arata Isozaki was the Japan Pavilion's commissioner, I would have thought the project on view there was the handiwork of Madame Butterfly's marriage broker. Titled "City of Girls," the project was organized by Kazuko Koike and designed by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa. The theme is gender. Specifically, it presents the Japanese adolescent female as a model of sensibility for the 21st-century city. The architects see her as a figure not yet fully indoctrinated by cultural tradition. Her response to beauty and ugliness is visceral.
To Western eyes, the display looks as dubious as it sounds. The entire pavilion, and a large swath of the garden around it, has been whitewashed, including the trunks of trees. The floor, on several levels, is lined with white gravel. It is noisy and hard to walk on. A square of gravel is planted with rows of tiny plastic daisies. Very cute. A second square has been excised from the floor, creating a well you can peer into. People walk around down there beneath a cantilevered section of the building. Ahh. From the ceiling hangs an overcoat, titled "Mother," designed by Kosuke Tsumura for homeless women. Oh! Oh!
But this work does not fit neatly into Western grids of comprehension. I enjoyed the mixture of sentimentality and sophistication, but felt that I was missing a lot, as you do when you travel to any foreign city. In the era of monocultural familiarity, that sense of strangeness is not only to be savored but also to be trusted.
My favorite work is a perfectly straightforward rendition of the Biennale's theme. Designed by two young Finnish architects, it is a small floating park set within the cargo hold of a rusting freight barge. Moored off the quay of the Arsenale, the barge is partly filled with the city's sludge (the effluent has been treated and doesn't stink). The sludge is covered with a thick layer of gravel, from which rises a small stand of oaks. The leaf crowns are partly visible from the quay, but you can't see the park itself until you climb a gangway to the deck of the barge. From there, you descend another gangway into the trees. Benches line the sides of the barge. A crane, looming above like an enormous sculpture, heightens the serenity of the place. The key to the project is the relationship between two exterior spaces, one enclosed by walls, the second given scale by the crane.
The project retrieves the modern concept of the architect as problem solver. You can see it as a prototype for a community garden on an industrial waterfront, but what is mainly on view is an intelligence that can be applied to different conditions. The fusion of public space, sustainability and visual imagery can take many forms.
Heightened awareness can be ethics enough. This is the moral foundation of Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio's work. They build on it here with a project displayed at the show of international work at the Italian pavilion. "Pageant" is a seven-minute computer animation loop on corporate logos. Using black figures on a white field, the loop lines up the icons of the usual monocultural suspects: Disney, Nike, Baby Bells, Texaco, Shell, McDonald's.
This, too, could be considered an example of blob design, as each logo morphs into the next, an endlessly mutable contrast in black and white, signifying nothing. Of course, the power of this nothingness is immense and growing. What ultimately won't be branded? It is astounding to recognize how much nothing we now hold in our heads. The consumerist blob is inside us, competing for market share.
ArchLab, the offering at the United States Pavilion, raises the ghost of the Ugly American, that figure of cold war fun. Members of the European press, among others, have interpreted the show's massive deployment of computer technology as a flashy display of imperial power in the post-cold war era. No doubt computer and military hardware are equivalent on some plane. But I saw the ArchLab as an urbanist, not a nationalist manifestation.
Organized by Max Hollein, Hans Hollein's son and a senior staff member of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in New York, the project brought together students and faculty from two architecture schools, Columbia University and U.C.L.A. The two groups were assigned different wings in the pavilion, a red brick kiosk of Jeffersonian aspirations, where they worked for four weeks in full public view.
John Hockenberry, the NBC correspondent, was quoted recently in Sony Style on the difference between real innovation and technological illusion: "Innovation changes lives; illusion offers empty promises." Perhaps architecture schools can't afford to patrol the line between innovation and illusion too fiercely. Thought cops could inhibit freedom of research. But the laxity creates an environment in which many illusionists come to believe that they're actually sawing the lady in half.
Hani Rashid, the team director of the Columbia group, has been working the hocus-pocus angle for some time. With his partner in the New York-based Studio Asymptote, Lise Ann Couture, he has cornered a modest niche as a maker of hybrid designs that supposedly fuse architecture with computer technology. As I see it, the only fusion going on here is the old one of smoke and mirrors.
On one monitor, a stick figure gymnast tumbles toward the viewer, morphing the surrounding space into gray ripples. This is supposed to signify the advent of Moving Man, a contemporary replacement of Vitruvian Man, the measure of all things classical. But what we actually saw was a classical, axial cartoon with wavy-gravy walls. Computers could be an invaluable tool for exploring the kinesthetic sense, but this project didn't scratch the surface. The visuals were sexy but vapid.
Another room contained a giant pipe cleaner construction, executed in glowing blue wires. You couldn't get inside it. The wires, which were rigid, were supported by grids of transparent fishing line. I asked Rashid about the grid. I thought the point of using this software was to get away from grids. "This is the grid in a computer model. It shows what it would be like if you were inside the screen." But in a computer model, the grids are curved. And if we were inside the screen, we would be inside the model. "That's a technical limitation." Perhaps. But it's a limitation that others, like the Ocean group from Scandinavia, have got beyond. Also, this model doesn't move. "But it does. See? It vibrates against the blue background. It draws on the tradition of Op Art." Oh. Silly of me not to notice that.
Rashid is a very talented fellow. And I don't doubt that one day we'll all be spending lots of time in virtual space. What's missing here is a sense of real, historical time. Cities are still social condensers. Bodies still require bricks and mortar structures. If they don't concentrate on developing new forms in the material city, today's architecture students could end up as low-level technical consultants at Industrial Light and Magic.
Greg Lynn, who led the U.C.L.A. team, is not yet an innovator. He has still to make the major breakthrough many in the architecture world are expecting of him. But Lynn's experiments with software-driven design are more than technological illusion. U.C.L.A.'s presentation, titled "The Embryonic House," was the more solid -- and Darwinian -- of the two.
Lynn's assignment was simple: be fruitful and multiply. Using Alias Wavefront's Maya software program, the students produced an open-ended essay on the theme of abundance. Given guidelines for a single-family dwelling, their task was to develop variations. The complex, curvilinear computer images they produced were sent to an adjacent model shop where a jig-saw cut them into wood and plastic modules. These were then fashioned into scale models and displayed, along with the modules and computer renderings, in a gallery. The purpose of this exercise is to transfer the blob from the still largely virtual to the physical.
RUSKIN would have loved this. So, I suspect, would Paco Rabanne. One of the designs on view recalls Rabanne's metal disc dresses from the 1960's. It lacked only a fluorescent Dynel wig and a splash of Metal to complete the retro ensemble. And you didn't have to be told that it was in the Pop Tart tradition. But this was a Platonic performance. Ambition was within shouting distance of achievement. Lynn pushed the students to venture further than he has gone in his own work.
It has been said that despite the emphasis on variation, blob designs all look the same, and that blob designers haven't fully reckoned with the realities of construction. I see this work as a genuine mutation, a natural response to the displacement of bricks and mortar by virtual space. It is not possible, at this point, to know where this response might lead. But Lynn is encouraging his students to emulate nature: to throw a bunch of combinations out there with the expectation that some of them will survive and mutate further in an environment that is also rapidly evolving.
ArchLab's format was a mutation itself. I can't recall a presentation that placed greater emphasis on process, not to mention one that incorporated architects into the display. I didn't see the interaction I had hoped for between the East and West Coast teams. Each kept pretty much to its own game. Still, the latent competition between Rashid and Lynn underscored the idea that New York and Los Angeles had volved into the east and west sides of a single metropolitan condition.
The Biennale's strongest message is that this interurban linkage will accelerate at the global level. A struggle has already emerged between large corporate offices and independent "star" architects, operating as independent contractors with skeletal staffs, who are available for hire much like actors or choreographers. The star system is not going to wither away. There will be more and more stars. They could become a counterculture to the monoculture, or they could become the icing on its cake. Enlightened clients will hire them. What they will bring to the table is risk. Risk is their brand. Clients will demand the brand as they recognize that risk is a more valuable commodity than safety, even in purely commercial terms. The blob may turn out to be more significant as a metaphor for this development -- a logo for risk -- than for the formal qualities of blob designs.
That is the first answer to the question I took to Venice. (An extended treatment of these concepts can be found in Ben Van Berkel and Caroline Bos's book "Move," a manifesto published last year by UN Studio and Goose Press.) A second was suggested by a Venetian friend, Franca Coin. Ms. Coin is president of the Venetian Foundation, the outfit that runs most of the city's major museums. She lives in the Palazzo Barbaro, a Grand Canal mansion of fabled cosmopolitan pedigree. Henry James stayed there for five weeks in 1887, and later used it as the setting for "The Wings of the Dove." I ran into her a few hours after she'd paid a visit to the United States Pavilion.
"They're here! They're here!" she exclaimed, with a look of delight. I assumed she was referring to the pavilion's new breed of wired-up, net-surfing artists, more talked about than seen in a rear-view mirror city like Venice. Ms. Coin was talking about that, in part. But she was more impressed by the ethnic diversity of the students: not just that one was black, or another Asian, but that she couldn't tell, just from looking at them, what their racial ancestry was.
I would have overlooked this if my friend hadn't mentioned it. New Yorkers are supposed to take racial diversity for granted. We tend to think it's racist to take note of someone's race. But there are times when overlooking race amounts to denying reality, including one's own.
Returning to New York, I ran into Ms. Coin at the airport. She was off to Greece. I noticed that she had taken the names and phone numbers of some of the students. She said she wanted to invite them to lunch when she got back. "We are starved for conversation about today," she said.
So are we, it struck me, as I headed to the gate. In New York, the conversation about today -- about architecture, about race, about contemporaneity itself -- has been squelched since the 70's, never more brutally than in the past seven years, as the reactionaries have dug in their heels. This has been suicidal as well as unjust. Diversity is the greatest asset of cities worldwide as well as the common thread between us. More ethics. More aesthetics. More genetics. The splicing of these strands will continue well beyond the Biennale.

One Man's Faith in Destiny

BYLINE: By ROBERT WORTH

 BODY:
HAL BECKOFF is that rare thing in the quiet towns of Westchester: a prophet. "I believe the veil has been lifted from my eyes so that I can see," he said in the Mamaroneck apartment where he lived with a friend for most of the last two years.
Mr. Beckoff, who is 60 and unemployed, does not hear voices or see visions, and he has never suffered from mental illness. He is not a member of any church or organized religion. But he believes that he has discovered the truth about God and the Bible, and has written up his beliefs in a book titled "Mystery of God Revealed." 
 It is his second book. The first, self-published several years ago, is also titled "Mystery of God Revealed."
"It was such a good title, I couldn't resist using it again," he said. But the new book represents his latest thoughts about God's mysteries, which he believes could change the world.
If all this sounds a little unusual for Westchester, so is Mr. Beckoff's life story. After a solidly middle-class career as a legal typist in Manhattan, he was unable to make the shift to using a computer at work. The firm he worked for, Garbarini & Scher, was patient with him for years, and finally began docking his pay. He left, and when his savings ran out he struggled unsuccessfully to find a new job. Finally, he was evicted from his apartment and was on the verge of homelessness almost two years ago.
He was taken in by Robert Suval, whom he had met when both were working as extras on the film "The Siege," and who lives in an apartment owned by his parents in Mamaroneck. Mr. Suval, who grew up in New Rochelle, has had his own struggles with work. He sells ice cream from a truck seven months a year and works part time in a pizza parlor the rest of the year. He was married and had two children, but his wife left him, he said, because he was unable to provide a home for her.
Mr. Beckoff and Mr. Suval represent the kind of downward mobility that has become all but invisible in recent years, at least in wealthy communities like Mamaroneck. The economic boom of the past decade has created the illusion that anyone can find work, making life harder -- or more humiliating -- for those who are falling out of the middle class.
And in a sense, Mr. Beckoff's religious beliefs -- like those of many prophets before him -- represent an effort to transcend the struggles of his life. The mystery he claims to have discovered in the Bible can be boiled down to one word: reincarnation. He believes that we will all have a chance to redeem our failures in a future life, or many future lives.
Mr. Beckoff is the first to admit that he is no scholar and that his discoveries are sheer intuition. "God does some truly outrageous things," he said, like causing people to suffer in famine and war. "But if you impose reincarnation on the Bible, you can see how God can tell people to do such horrible things -- they will have to face that karma somewhere down the line." For the last year and a half, Mr. Suval and Mr. Beckoff have spent much of their time discussing God in Mr. Suval's apartment.
Mr. Suval, who was raised Jewish but does not attend any synagogue, said he had found Mr. Beckoff's faith inspiring. "Being with Hal, I was able to see a way of being saved -- I can see a way to go out with my head held up high, even though I didn't have any accomplishment," he said.
Unlike Mr. Suval, Mr. Beckoff never doubted that his failures were providential. When he did not find work he did not despair. "I realized I was being held back, that I was not supposed to find work. Instead of hitting my head against the wall, I decided God wanted me to trust."
In fact, Mr. Beckoff's trust in God may have gone too far. In early May he left Mamaroneck for a homeless shelter in Manhattan. "I know something is going to rescue me," he said in an interview a few days before he left. "I know my book is meant to get out there. I know I'm protected."
So far, he has not found a job, but he has found friends at the homeless shelter where he has been living at 41st Street and Ninth Avenue. And his faith in his destiny has not wavered.

HEADLINE: Q&A/Senator Joseph I. Lieberman;
Seeking a 3rd Term (And Maybe More?)

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIZEL

 BODY:
SENATOR Joseph I. Lieberman recently came back to his old Stamford neighborhood to officially announce his intention to run for a third term representing Connecticut in the United States Senate.
But in kicking off his bid for re-election in the backyard at his 85-year-old mother's house, Mr. Lieberman could not quell growing speculation he is on a short list of high-profile Democrats who will be seriously considered as a running mate for Vice President Al Gore at the party's Convention Aug. 13-17 in Los Angeles. 
 A centrist Democrat who stunned former Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. when he beat him by 10,000 votes in 1988, Mr. Lieberman has gained a national reputation as one of the stronger moral voices in the Senate.
Mr. Lieberman, who is an Orthodox Jew, was the first Democrat to publicly criticize President Clinton for his "morally reprehensible" behavior in the affair with Monica S. Lewinsky -- though he voted against removing the president from office.
In the United States Senate, Mr. Lieberman, 58, became the ranking Democratic member of the Governmental Affairs Committee in January 1999. Since 1995, he has been chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council.
Mr. Lieberman served as majority leader of the Connecticut Senate for six years during the 1970's and as the state's 21st Attorney General from 1982-88.
Recently, Mr. Lieberman raised concerns in a highly publicized letter to United States Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt over an issue of growing concern to Connecticut residents -- the petition process for Native American tribes seeking federal recognition. Mr. Lieberman, who attended Yale, also has a strong interest in the environment, having helped to establish a Long Island Sound office in the Environmental Protection Agency, promoting a national wildlife refuge along the Connecticut River, and helping to strengthen federal Clean Air standards.
Recently, Mr. Lieberman took some time out during one of his regular "diner stops" in New Haven -- the city where he lives with his wife, Hadassah -- to have a bagel and a cup of coffee and talk about his 30-year political career and future. Following are excerpts of that conversation.
 
Q. Considering your recent announcement of seeking a third term in the United States Senate, what are you most proud of accomplishing during your first two terms?
A. Perhaps the most remarkable transition that has occurred during the past 12 years is to watch the economy of this state and country. We have gone from real deep recession to the boom period we're in now where most people are living better lives than before. I am also proud of strides we have made in environmental protection areas, keeping our defenses strong, and having been an advocate for the Connecticut defense industry and jobs.
Q. There are still many people who haven't benefited from the economic boom. What can be done to help them?
A. One of the key goals of the next period of our history will be not only be to continue the strong economy and sustain economic growth, but to make sure that some of the people who have been left out of the rising tide of our economy are included. You do that with better public education and a much more aggressive program of job training and re-training, for people who are unemployed -- to match them up with the jobs that do exist.
Q. You have been heavily involved in environmental issues. What are the most important environmental issues facing Connecticut?
A. The two most pressing environmental priorities for Connecticut are cleaner air and water. Smog remains a serious problem for us in Connecticut. We still haven't met our goal of going a full year with satisfactory air quality measured by levels of the six worst pollutants in the air. Reports say 41 percent of Hartford school children have asthma -- the highest rate in the country.
It's equally important that we address a major threat to our water supply -- the gasoline additive MTBE, which is potentially toxic and has leaked into our ground water supply and has contaminated the water we drink and bathe in.
Q. There has been a lot of speculation about the vice presidency, that you are on a short list of potential running mates for Vice President Al Gore. What have you heard about your chances?
A. Obviously I'm honored to have my name mentioned for the vice presidency and I would have to seriously consider such an offer. It makes my mother proud just to be mentioned as a possibility. But I don't expect it to happen. Right now the only office I intend to seek this year is re-election to the U.S. Senate.
Q. You are an Orthodox Jew. Is the country ready for a Jewish vice president, or even president?
A. I think this is a remarkably tolerant country at this time. I honestly don't think any candidate for national office will lose because of his or her religion, race, gender, or nationality. I think the public is so fair and sophisticated they are going to judge candidates for national office based on his or her qualities and capacity to do the job.
Q. If elected vice president, would your duties in any way be curtailed by being an Orthodox Jew, for example not being able to work on Saturdays or high holy days?
A. I have always tried to separate pure politics on the Sabbath, which I don't do, from governmental responsibility. It seems to me my religion, as I understand it, not only permits me to fulfill important work associated with being a public servant, but actually requires me to do so because people are depending on me. I don't see that as an issue at all.
Q. What led you to so strongly criticizing President Bill Clinton for his involvement with Monica Lewinsky?
A. It was one of the hardest decisions I've ever made in my public life because President Clinton is a friend and I have tremendous admiration for him for the job he's done as president. But I was so upset by what he had done and the fact he hadn't leveled with the American people. I felt it wasn't going to get better until somebody who was his friend and supporter came publicly with honest and open criticism.
Q. You knew Bill Clinton in the early 1970's when you first ran for elected office in the State Senate and he was a student at Yale. Any recollections about the president at that time?
A. In 1970, when I first campaigned for office, I was the reform candidate running against the incumbent Democrat, and most of the political organizations -- most of the grown-ups -- were supporting the incumbent. I had a bunch of kids working for me.
In the middle of that campaign, Bill Clinton, then a Yale law student, walked into my headquarters and offered to help. I do remember him and we always kept in touch after that.
Later, I think I actually may have been the first Democrat to come out and support him.
Q. Why did you support Bill Clinton so early in his presidential campaign?
A. Most importantly we agreed on ideas, that the Democratic party had to move back to the center and had to express new ideas instead of following policies that were two, three and four decades old and no longer working either for our party or for the country.
Q. In your latest book published this year, "In Praise of Public Life," you strongly defend public service and write about how important it is to serve. Does it dismay you there are so many Connecticut legislative races this year that are uncontested? Is it apathy or are people afraid to challenge incumbents?
A. It concerns me a great deal. I am very surprised at how few state legislative races in Connecticut are uncontested this year. I think that is partly an expression of the broader problem of people generally being less interested in politics or political involvement. But I think a lot of these legislative districts have become pretty strongly included toward one party or the other, so people in the out party don't want to run.

Foundering Ocean Township Mall Is Bulking Up

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

DATELINE: OCEAN TOWNSHIP

 BODY:
FOR much of its 23 years, the million-square-foot Seaview Square shopping center here has been overshadowed by the area's older and larger Monmouth Mall, five miles north in Eatontown.
Last month, however, new owners bought the foundering shopping center, at the juncture of Routes 35, 66 and 18, and plan to convert both the way it looks and the type of stores that give it its character. The cost is estimated at $67 million, including the $17 million purchase price paid to the seller, the Equitable Life Assurance Society of Manhattan. 
 The mall is being converted into what merchandising specialists call a "power center," which is defined by the International Council of Shopping Centers in Manhattan as an open-air retail strip with at least 250,000 square feet and three or more large discount specialty outlets, or so-called big box stores. Seaview Square's conversion to such a center will be made through a process called demalling: replacing most of a mall's smaller stores by large tenants, eliminating its common area and turning it inside out so that its stores face the road.
Ocean Township officials have rezoned the Seaview Square site for the conversion. And Starwood-Heller L.L.C., the new owners, will retain the two active anchors -- Sears and Value City, with 200,000 square feet each -- and convert them to free-standing buildings. The more than 3,000 existing parking spaces will also be retained.
But the mall's remaining 600,000 square feet will be razed. That space includes what had been a third anchor, a 180,000-square-foot building that was a Stern's, and a separate movie theater, as well as some 40 smaller stores, about half of which are vacant. The remaining retailers lease their stores on a month-to-month basis and will relocate, according to Starwood-Heller, which is a joint venture between G. Heller Enterprises of Edgewater, a developer of residential, office and retail properties, and the Starwood Capital Group of Greenwich, Conn.
The owners will demolish the old mall once all approvals from the township are secured, which is expected this fall. Construction of the new center will follow in the next year.
As now envisioned, the new center, which will keep the Seaview Square name, will have three big-box retailers, including Target, a discount department store, and Lowe's, a hardware store. Both have signed on to lease land on the site for 150,000-square-foot stores, which they will build themselves, said Gene Heller, a partner at Starwood-Heller.
There will also be a supermarket of up to 60,000 square feet, a central food court and about a dozen smaller stores, totaling 150,000 square feet. Annual rents are expected to be $13 to $20 a square foot. Future plans may also include a 400,000-square-foot office structure, if a tenant to occupy the building can be found.
"The existing mall is nearly desolate," Mr. Heller said. "But the cost to buy so large a piece of land at the intersection of three highways was a good value and a good start. We think added value can be accomplished here."
Those prospects please Terrance D. Weldon, the mayor of Ocean Township, who said the mall was the largest taxpayer in his 14-square-mile community of 28,000 people. Over the years, as the mall lost its tenants and panache, he said, successful tax appeals by the owners cut the revenue to the township from more than $1 million a year in half. Once the mall is converted, Mayor Weldon said, estimates are that the lost annual tax revenue will be restored.
Many retail brokers said Seaview Square's chances of success this time were enhanced for several reasons. Among them is that the population in that eastern section of Monmouth County has increased enough over the years to support more stores, said Jonathan Schultz, president of the Schultz Organization TCN, a real estate services company in Woodbridge.
A demographic study done by Equitable showed that as of 1998 there were 144,000 people with an average annual household income of $61,614 living within a five-mile radius of Seaview Square.
Its conversion is also taking place as the state's economy is healthy and the retail market relatively strong. "Though retailers are expecting sales to be down 1 to 2 percent this year, the numbers will still be good," said Ted Kraus, who heads TKO Retail Advisors, a consulting firm in Mercerville. He said the weakness was due to a leveling off of the consumption frenzy of the last few years. Still, he said, rental rents are rising and the overall retail vacancy rate in the state is less than 3 percent.
The planned conversion of Seaview Square makes sense, Mr. Kraus said, because it reuses a large tract of suitably zoned land, a dwindling commodity in the state. And the popularity of such "power centers," he added, continues to be fueled by the expansion of big-box retailers like Target and Lowe's.
Matthew Harding, a vice president at the Levin Management Corporation, a retail management concern in North Plainfield, added, "These are tough times for moderate-sized enclosed regional malls, which need to be up-to-date to compete." He said that as a power center Seaview Square would complement rather than compete with the 1.4-million-square-foot Monmouth Mall, and with newer retail centers like the 10-year-old, 1.4-million-square-foot Freehold Raceway Mall in nearby Freehold Township.
When Seaview Square opened in 1977, it was seen as a "a major benefit to the township because it was constructed on the site of a former closed landfill, ridding us of an eyesore," Mayor Weldon said. It was built by Equitable in partnership with the Goodman Company of Philadelphia. The insurer bought out its partner in 1981.
The mall was successful at first, only to lose momentum when just three of the four planned anchors opened up.. Its downward slide continued as the Monmouth Mall siphoned off shoppers. In 1992, Equitable renovated Seaview Square, but that did not succeed in turning the mall around. In 1996, Stern's and the movie theater closed, spurring many of the smaller retailers to leave.
Last month, Equitable sold the mall. The sale was part of "Equitable's strategy to reduce its equity investments in real estate to a core group of assets," said Mary Beth Lally, an associate at Lend Lease Real Estate Investments in Manhattan, which advises the insurer on real estate.
Mr. Heller of Starwood-Heller said his company was working with township officials on the design of the new center to meet their concerns that it "be extensively landscaped and intelligently done."
Under preliminary plans drawn by Keith Michaels, the company's architect, the two existing anchors will be bookends to the new Seaview Square. In between them, the Target store will rise, as will a two-story retail component housing the smaller stores. The other two big-box stores will be to the north of them where the site significantly rises, enabling all to be visible from the highway.
Mr. Michaels said that the areas around the buildings would be landscaped and that although all the stores would have their own exterior entrances they would be connected by walkways. There will also be a two-story food court that he said would be the center's focal point.
"The concept," he said, "is to thread together all these disparate big pieces to create a community, rather than a power center where each big box is an island onto itself."
Mayor Weldon said community reaction to the project "so far has been positive" because it will revitalize a failing center and be built on recycled land, not pristine property. But there are worries over increased traffic.
To address those concerns, Mayor Weldon said talks were under way with Starwood-Heller to help pay for enlarging an intersection at Route 35, which will be a fourth entrance to the site. He said that the township had received a $175,000 grant from the state for the $300,000 highway project and that he hoped Starwood-Heller would contribute the rest.
Mr. Heller said that his company "knows the conversion will work" because of the initial responses of retailers like Target and Lowe's. When asked if keeping the Seaview Square name would be a deterrent, given the mall's history, he said: "The mall may have been known for all the wrong reasons, but it was certainly known. And when we change it, people will want to see what it has become."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In /Essex, Conn.;
A Colonial Sense of Community Endures

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
THE deep coves of the Connecticut River provided the protected harbor that made Essex the region's predominant shipping and shipbuilding port from before the Revolutionary War to the advent of the railroads in the mid-1800's. Situated six miles upriver from the Long Island Sound and safe from its stormy tides, this town of 6,000 continues to bond with the water, but now for pleasure rather than for commerce.
Although some people consider a boat a virtual necessity here, a small house and a well-worn canoe may lie next door to a mansion with a pier and a 60-foot yacht. Since the mid-1600's development has reflected a colonial sense of community, minimizing the number of neighborhoods based on income or architectural style. 
 "People don't put as much value here on how big your house is, what car you drive, or how many things you've acquired," said Terry Smith, a "newcomer" who moved to Essex, about 30 miles east of New Haven, from Oyster Bay, N.Y., five years ago. "If you want to have an extravagant birthday party for your child, you can. But if you want to keep it simple, that's not an issue."
Her husband, Brant Smith, is a senior partner in Smith Hanley Associates, an executive search firm in Manhattan. Like many people, he has been freed from a daily commute by the communications revolution. "I go into New York once a week now," he said. "I enjoy Essex immensely. It has people from every walk of life, and they are heavily involved as volunteers with the running of the town."
Vintage homes lining the narrow village streets have been restored in a low-key style. One reason for the number of such homes, said Donald Malcarne, the town historian, is that "poverty preserves." He explained that when the railroads replaced boats, Essex suffered a long economic downturn. "Those houses are still standing," he said. "Nobody wanted them until they got discovered by Fairfield County and Westchester County and New York City."
Richard T. Weiner, an associate broker at the Mitchel Agency, a local real estate company, said: "Essex is the sort of community people are looking for these days. "Good schools, light traffic, beautiful scenery, no 'cookie cutter' homes or stores, access to the water, and crime is almost nonexistent." There is one traffic light, one resident state trooper and three constables. The volunteer fire department has a roster of 56 firefighters and a new $2 million firehouse.
Talbot's is the only chain store. The local shops along Main Street bear names likeHastings House Asian and English Antiques, the Clipper Ship Independent Bookstore, Debbie's Restaurant and Drugstore, and the Essex Coffee & Tea Company.
"You have to go out about three miles to find a dry cleaner or a supermarket," said Skip Hubbard, the publisher of The Main Street News, the local weekly. Here, the emphasis is on old-fashioned service. For example, Bennie's, a 65-year-old family-owned market, cuts meats to order (no prepackaging), does not mist the lettuce and roasts beef and chicken daily for takeout lunches.
The Town of Essex is made up of three parts. Essex village, which lies along the river, bustles with shops and restaurants. The Town Hall can be found here, plus a number of yacht clubs, marinas and boat launches. Its homes date from the 18th century.
TO the west of the village, in a triangle bounded by Routes 604, 602 and 153, Centerbrook has a number of commercial and light-industrial buildings in and around Essex Industrial Park, but it is also growing as a retail and residential location.
Ivoryton, to the north and west of Centerbrook, was named for the 19th-century Comstock-Cheney factory where most of the world's ivory piano keys were made until plastics took over 50 years ago. The factory has now been converted to a multiuse commercial building.
Of the total of 2,900 dwellings in the town, most are single-family homes. About 65 houses and a couple of condominiums are currently for sale in what is generally characterized as a tight market. Roger Parkman, a broker in Essex office of DeWolfe New England, said: "People coming here from outside want to be in the village or within walking distance, where house prices start in the low $300,000's. Prices in Centerbrook and Ivoryton may be 5 to 10 percent less."
Among the highest-priced homes now on the market is the $1.2 million mansion built in 1830 by E. E. Dickinson, the founder of the witch-hazel distillery that operated in Essex for 150 years (the factory has been converted to mixed commercial uses). Overlooking North Cove and the Connecticut River, the house has 26 rooms and 10 fireplaces.
For people who want a new house, there are three subdivisions available. "At Farm Hill Estates in Ivoryton, 22 one-acre home sites are available and one spec house has been built for $459,500," said Cathy Schellan of Prudential Connecticut Dunham Realtors, which is handling the sales.
At two other developments, Southwinds, off Route 153, and Windswept Ridge, off Old Dobbin Road in Ivoryton, seven houses are available at each, at prices ranging from $320,000 to $550,000. The DeWolfe office in Old Saybrook, Conn., is handling the sales.
Future development may be curtailed if a zoning proposal that would raise the minimum lot size from one to two acres is approved and implemented this summer. "There was not one speaker or letter in opposition at the public hearing," said Peter B. Webster, the first selectman. "It's a major change that will preserve enough good soil for septics and wells."
Weston and Sharon Bray, who now live in Wilton, Conn., with their two children, ages 7 and 9, are moving to Essex, but doing it gradually to accommodate business and family adjustments. "We're concerned about how developed Fairfield County is getting, so we bought a 5,000-square-foot house on the water in Essex," said Mr. Bray, the chief executive of Marketing Drive Worldwide, a global marketing services company with headquarters in Wilton. "We'll move our two children, two dogs, two cats and two birds over the course of three years," he said. "We like the distinctive seafaring heritage of Essex, and the Gris has the best bar in Connecticut."
The Gris (pronounced Griz) is short for the Griswold, a historic 32-room inn and tavern built on Main Street in 1776 and now owned by the three Paul brothers, Doug, Geoff and Greg. The Griswold bills itself as the oldest continuously operating inn in the state, and its taproom, built in 1748 as the town's first schoolhouse, has a domed ceiling made of a clamshell plaster strengthened with horsehair.
Dinner for two with wine, tax and tip can run to $125, and rooms are $90 to $195 a night. At Christmastime, the menu features game -- venison, moose, pheasant and quail -- served by a staff in colonial costumes while diners are serenaded by madrigal singers.
ANOTHER well-known Essex hostelry is the Copper Beech Inn, built in the 1880's by the Comstock family, the co-owner of the piano key factory, as their residence. Most of the 23 rooms in the house and converted barn have Victorian furnishings. A favorite dish in the restaurant is bouillabaisse made with local fish. Dinner for two with wine, tax and tip runs around $120, and rooms are $105 to $175, including breakfast.
The Essex schools emphasize individualized instruction, and the pupil-teacher ratio is about 15 to 1. Essex Elementary School has an enrollment of about 500 students in kindergarten through the sixth grade. From there, students go on to the regional John Winthrop Middle School and to the Valley Regional High School District No. 4, both in Deep River, Conn.
In College Board tests last year students' verbal scores averaged 530 and math scores averaged 523, compared with statewide averages of 510 for verbal and 509 for math. About 80 percent of the 87 graduates in the class of 2000 are going on to college.
"The high school operates on a four-period day with 80-minute classes," said Dr. John Gillespie, the superintendent of the Valley Regional School District No. 4. "This enables students to complete a year's work in half a year and take a greater variety of courses. And it allows teachers more flexibility."
The Essex Yacht Club, the largest of five private yacht clubs, has 40 slips, 70 moorings and a restaurant; its waiting list now runs about a year. Among the numerous marinas are Brewer's Dauntless Shipyard and the Essex Island Marina, which occupies a 13-acre island in the Connecticut River and offers a restaurant, pool and dockage for boats up to 200 feet at $2.65 a foot.
One of Essex's cultural landmarks is the venerable Ivoryton Playhouse, a year-round theater where Katharine Hepburn, Marlon Brando, Tallulah Bankhead, Mae West and other stars have performed.
Baseball, soccer and tennis are available at four town fields and four town tennis courts at no charge. The operation of recreational activities, including instruction, is left to community volunteers. "That's how we keep the tax rate down," said Don Mesite, who volunteers as the chairman of the parks and recreation commission.

HEADLINE: Subletting: From Stopgap to Cash Cow

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
SUBLETTING of co-ops -- not so long ago a possible indicator of a building's dire financial straits and even, for some shareholders, the last gasp before abandoning their apartments -- isn't what it used to be. For one thing, it's become increasingly profitable.
Take, as an extreme example, the recent sublet of a sublet of a sublet of a sublet. 
 "It started with an original lease of $2,200 a month for a one-bedroom in the East 40's," said Roger Novatt, the managing director of Sumitomo Real Estate Sales. "The people were transferred out of town, and the owner would not let them break the lease. So they sublet the apartment for $2,750."
 "And the same thing happened to the $2,750 people -- a business transfer out of town," Mr. Novatt said. "So they sublet for $3,250 a month."
The apartment is now renting to a fourth tenant for $4,000 a month, with the profits going, after each switch, to the previous sublettor. "It's totally illegal in terms of board regulations, but some buildings just don't pay attention to what's going on," Mr. Novatt said. "The shareholder could rent to a nice, quiet young lady and end up with trapeze artists."
Subletting of sublets, Mr. Novatt added, "is happening all over the city, in fancy buildings as well as walk-ups, but primarily in the Midtown area."
New York City's rental market has become so tight and jarringly expensive, particularly in Manhattan, that subletting is an increasingly alluring prospect for some shareholders -- individual owners as well as sponsors who have retained ownership of numbers of apartments in buildings they converted -- sometimes to the chagrin of co-op boards and resident shareholders.
At the same time, with sales of apartments booming, the availability of units for subletting has dropped, exacerbating the city's housing shortage and further squeezing up rents. "Just five, six years ago when people were unable to sell but could either no longer afford the apartment or had to move, they would sublet," said Stuart M. Saft, the chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums. "It was the only liquidity in the market."
"And because of the large number of these people involved, the boards permitted it," Mr. Saft continued, "because if a board strictly imposed a 'no sublet' policy, they could find themselves voted out of office."
"Now, come forward to 2000, where the market is much stronger and selling is not a problem," Mr. Saft said. "The economics have changed because, as a result of the housing shortage, there are people who want to sublease their apartments as a profit center, a way of producing income."
Though unaware of the sublet-of-a-sublet phenomenon in the boroughs outside of Manhattan, Barbara Frechter, the president of Glenjay Realty in Forest Hills, Queens, can certainly attest to subletting's shift from act of desperation to profit plan.
"In the early and mid-90's, most people could not sell, and a lot of people who couldn't sublet walked away from their apartments, just left them," said Ms. Frechter, a former president of the Long Island Board of Realtors, which includes Queens. "The interesting thing is that people who started out subletting from necessity are now subletting as an investment, because in a lot of cases they are making a profit."
The motive is hardly peculiar to individual shareholders. Speaking as a sponsor with an interest in 1,500 apartments in 30 co-ops in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Manhattan, Westchester and Rockland, Susan Hewitt, the president of the Cheshire Group, said a major problem for some buildings is that their sponsors "are making so much money renting that they won't sell their apartments."
"And they are effectively holding these co-ops hostage as quasi-rental buildings," Ms. Hewitt added, saying that she strongly prefers to sell. "Frankly, we're in the business of increasing the value of the apartments in a co-op," she said, "and we feel that's best achieved by increasing owner-occupancy."
The shift in subletting's focus has recast, though hardly dissipated, the contentiousness that has laced the issue since the surge in co-op conversion began in the early 1980's.
There are struggles over where a board should draw the line on when and to whom to rent, and constant concerns about a co-op's quality of life. A point of continuing conflict is the ratio of owner-occupants to renters, and how that weighs against the building's ability to refinance its underlying mortgage and for prospective buyers to obtain loans for individual apartments -- commonly called end loans.
Still heard are charges of favoritism toward owner-occupants over shareholders who need or want to move -- and vice versa. There is also a recent court ruling that sent shudders through co-op boards because it held a board member directly liable for damages in a discrimination case involving a sublet.
And for would-be renters, there is the board approval process, which can rival applying for a mortgage in the intensity of financial disclosure.
Except for laws barring discrimination, a co-op board's policy on subletting is based on what is written in the development's proprietary lease. "There are some buildings," Ms. Hewitt pointed out, "that very self-consciously want to operate with few restrictions, to be analogous to condominiums, which have unrestricted subletting. And there are other buildings that restrict subletting because they want to have 'a family feeling.' "
Mr. Saft of the council of cooperatives said the courts have upheld the right of co-op boards "to limit or not permit subletting at all, or to establish conditions on subletting."
"A co-op board can say, for instance, that you can only sublet if you've lived in your apartment for, say, five years. Or you can only sublet one out of every three years," Mr. Saft said.
THE courts have also ruled in favor of co-ops when it comes to defining who is a guest or a sublettor. "People are going away for the summer or for a year," Mr. Saft said, "and are allowing someone to stay in the apartment while taking the position that that person is a guest, not a sublettor, because there is no fee being paid and no document called a sublease."
"But there are cases that hold that if someone is staying in an apartment and the owner is not there, that person is not a guest but a subtenant," Mr. Saft said, "even if no rent is being paid. People are surprised to hear that."
But it was the co-op boards that were taken aback in April when the Court of Appeals, New York State's highest court, ruled in a case called Biondi v. Beekman Hill House that a board president was personally liable for punitive damages as a result of the board's rejecting an interracial couple for a sublease.
The primary action in the Biondi case was that the couple was denied a lease under circumstances that the courts found to be racial discrimination, and that the board president had acted in bad faith. The couple won, and the president's bid for indemnification through the co-op's insurance policy was denied by the Court of Appeals.
"The underlying problem in cooperatives," said Robert Taylor, a partner in Rovegno & Taylor, a law firm in Forest Hills that specializes in real estate, "is that you need good people to run it, and if there's going to be personal exposure for actions of the board collectively, then it's one more reason why somebody might not want to risk his or her personal finances."
"It also means, as far as subletting is concerned," Mr. Taylor said, "that the boards are going to have to be very careful."
Subletting has always been a balancing act for the boards, primarily over what weight to give to preserving the co-op's sense of community against the immediate financial needs of individual shareholders and, in the longer term, the building's ability to obtain favorable rates when the underlying mortgage has to be refinanced.
By the early 90's, with the co-op market in a downward slide, "some buildings that had restrictions on subletting eased up because of those concerns about abandonment," Ms. Frechter of the Long Island realty board said.
"If a person abandoned the apartment, the bank that held the mortgage was obligated to pay the maintenance," she continued. "But a lot of banks would let the maintenance accumulate, regardless of pleas from the co-op; they would pay it, but not for months."
"In the meantime, the co-op had to make up that difference," Ms. Frechter added, "and the cash flow was definitely hurting."
Ms. Hewitt said that quality-of-life and financial issues often become entangled. "Part of the compelling reason for people to live in a co-op is stability, a feeling that they recognize their neighbors," she said. "And that's particularly important in a place like New York."
For resident shareholders, "sublets are a pain." Ms. Hewitt said. "They hate subletting, because these are the people who don't know not to put pizza boxes down the compactor chute."
It can get worse than that.
Ruth Farrago is the president of the board of Hyde Park Gardens, a 746-unit garden apartment co-op in Kew Gardens Hills, Queens. Ms. Farrago recalls too well some hellish tenants.
"There was an owner who resides in California who hired a real estate agent to sublet his apartment," she said. "The agent sublet without the owner's approval and signed the owner's name on the lease."
For the first five months, no rent was paid. Eviction proceedings started. "But by the time they got to court, the agent had put somebody else in the apartment," Ms. Farrago said, "so the legal documents were no good."
THE second subtenant was no better. "A year and a half later, we were finally able to get the second tenant evicted," she said, "and when the marshal went in to remove the furniture, the apartment had been trashed."
The walls, the floors, the bathroom had all been torn apart; garbage was strewn throughout. "When they lifted up the furniture, roaches just came flying out," Ms. Farrago said.
For the owner living in California, she said, "it was a total loss: no rent; he had to pay legal fees, the cleanup, and he was still responsible to pay us the maintenance."
Struggles over subletting can lead to "something like class warfare," said Ms. Hewitt, whose company has helped bring stability to several financially troubled co-ops in the last decade.
"We're the holders of unsold shares in a building in Yonkers where the co-op had great difficulty getting end loans, both because the market was depressed and because there were questions about subletting," she said.
Eventually, those financial problems lifted. "But the issue lived on," Ms. Hewitt said. "The central dispute at the annual meeting for two years running turned on subletting, with great hostility. The resident shareholders perceived those who sublet as having escaped, or as profiteering off their building. The sublettors claimed their economic right to their investment. Each side invoked moral authority."
Some boards face the sublet disharmony only when they refinance. They find themselves in a bind because, among other things, lenders require that their sublets be brought below a certain percentage.
"This produces all kinds of tensions," Ms. Hewitt said. "Do you grandfather people who already are subletting? Do you distinguish between investors and shareholders who outgrew their apartments? If a board reviews sublet applications on a case-by-case basis, what constitutes hardship? All of these are touchy issues for most co-ops."
Edward Howe, the managing director of the National Cooperative Bank, which has provided underlying mortgages for more than 2,000 buildings in the metropolitan area, said much of that pressure has been reduced in recent years.
"Five, six years ago, if a property was less than 75 percent owner-occupied, it was extremely difficult for the building to get financing and for individuals to get end loans," Mr. Howe said.
Today, if a co-op is 25 percent owner-occupied, financing is "readily available" at about 8.5 percent, Mr. Howe said. And for a building that is 90 percent owner-occupied, the rate is about 7.75 percent -- a three-quarter percentage point difference.
A typical underlying mortgage in the boroughs outside of Manhattan might be $1.5 million, he said, "so the difference would be about $9,500 a year in payments."
"The real difference, however," Mr. Howe said, "is that five years ago, a building that was 25 percent owner-occupied couldn't get financing."
Most co-ops are now "seasoned," pay their bills and are selling units because end-loan financing is available, he said. The current rate for an end loan in a building that is only 25 percent owner-occupied would be about 9.5 percent, while in a building that is 90 percent owner-occupied it would be about 8 percent. "For a $100,000 apartment with an $80,000 mortgage, that's about $1,000 a year difference in payments," Mr. Howe said.
"Five years ago, subletting was really taboo, and it's not the case anymore because the rental market is so strong," he said. "But this could all change again. It's kind of like being married -- one day it's good, one day it's not."
If the pressure is off the boards in these heady times, it is surely on the renter.
PEOPLE have to demonstrate mortgage-level disclosure, and it's driving them crazy," said Douglas Wagner, the president of Benjamin James Associates, a Manhattan brokerage company that specializes in rentals.
The demands certainly vary in the other boroughs, but at least in Manhattan, Mr. Wagner said, "It's worthy to note that when an applicant submits a complete board package, they've also submitted the first month's rent, a security deposit usually equal to two months' rent and some sort of co-op fees, which would include application fees of $200 to $500, nonrefundable, even if they don't get the apartment."
Then, typically, there are annual sublease fees of perhaps $600 to $1,200 that are passed along to the subtenant.
"So just to get out of the gate, the person has put down 30 pages of personal information, rent security and related co-op fees, which usually prohibit them from putting money down on anything else," Mr. Wagner said. "And then they have to wait three to six weeks for the approval meeting."
David Ellingrud, 24, has run the gantlet.
Mr. Ellingrud, an analyst for a management consulting firm, graduated from Dartmouth two years ago and with four friends from school, rented a $5,000-a-month duplex in an Upper East Side brownstone.
Now he is "tired of living like the dorm at school," he said.
Initially, Mr. Ellingrud and one of his roommates began looking for a place to share. "We bought one of those lists where you think you're going to find something and avoid the broker's fee," he said. "We looked on our own, and, I swear, one day we probably visited 40, 50 buildings, no exaggeration" -- studio after studio for $1,800, $2,000.
"But two people in a studio?" he said.
"When we did see a one-bedroom, it was for like $2,200," Mr. Ellingrud said, "and when you go there it's more like a studio where they put up two walls to make a bedroom and a living room where if you were sitting on a couch, the TV would be in your lap."
Then, on his own and working through a broker, Mr. Ellingrud submitted his application to sublet a studio on East 71st Street for $1,500 a month.
"There's a lot of paperwork," he said. "I have a personal information form. You need a letter from your job, which is standard; a lease application form, bank statements.
"Then I needed my W2's for the last two years, my full 1040's for the last two years. I had to complete an asset statement. I had to have my bank certify that the amount of money I had in my account was actually there; had to have a bank officer sign my form. Then I also needed three letters of recommendation; co-workers, friends, that I'm a clean, quiet guy." The package was submitted at the end of June.
Finally, on Wednesday evening, Mr. Ellingrud met with the admissions committee. "I dressed conservatively," he said, "one of my better shirts."
He got in.

Look Out. Here Come The Checkbook Years.

 BODY:
WHEN my daughter, Marian, turned 13 in May, I asked her what she wanted for this special birthday. "Anything within reason," I said. She thought about it a bit, then replied, "I want to see a show on Broadway."
That sounded reasonable. 
 Then she asked if she could bring a couple of friends. She also wondered if we could go out to dinner before the show. Finally, shortly before the event, she told my wife that she really didn't have anything appropriate to wear to a night on Broadway.
Reason went out the window. By the time the evening was over, the birthday party cost about $600. I suppose I should be happy that she didn't ask for a pony.
Marian has been a teenager for only a couple of months, but I am already wondering what the next few years will be like. After all, while children are undoubtedly expensive to raise, teenagers are the most expensive. Their clothing costs jump, as do their costs for entertainment and, of course, food. Did I mention birthday parties?
According to recent figures from the Agriculture Department, a family with pretax income of more than $61,900 will spend an average of about $290,000 to raise an only child through age 17, with the heaviest expenses -- $85,000 -- during the teenage years. And that money, of course, just gets parents to the start of the horrific college years.
"Children have many benefits, but they are expensive," said Mark Lino, an economist at the department. "Teenagers are the most expensive because they are very food-intensive, and they have the highest transportation expenses. These are the years they begin to drive."
The average 16-year-old, Mr. Lino said, consumed about $3,000 in food in 1999, compared with about $2,320 for an 8-year-old. When it comes to clothing, he said, parents spent almost $1,300 for the 16-year-old, versus $855 for the 8-year-old.
Jane Distler, 50, a high school teacher in Shawnee Mission, Kan., said she was amazed at what she spends on her 16-year-old daughter, Kate. "I wasn't used to paying $60 for a pair of jeans that looked like they were already worn out," Ms. Distler said. "My husband has sticker shock. We spend about $2,400 in clothes a year."
Then there are the hobbies. Another mom from Kansas, who asked that her name not be used, said she had spent about $5,000 on fencing lessons, equipment and trips for her 18-year-old daughter.
"You take them shopping once a week and you get a little outfit," this mom said. "Then there's the video and DVD rentals, about $15 a week. That adds up. We keep telling ourselves that we would be rich if we hadn't had kids.
"Some weeks it can be overwhelming," she said. "Like the prom: that was a lot of money. You think it's not going to be a big deal, and it snowballs." She said the total bill for prom night was about $570.
Karin Humbolt, the author of "I Want to Be Rich: A Teenager's Modem to Money" (Reynolds Publishing, 1998), says there are ways to mitigate the costs. For one, she said, parents should get their teenagers financially involved in the family. She said a child who works or gets an allowance should be encouraged to chip in, maybe by paying for entertainment expenses. The children should also understand where the family's money is coming from and what it takes to support them.
"I don't think they realize what it takes to get up day after day, punch that time clock and deal with work," Ms. Humbolt said. "Tell them how much it does cost to support the family. The child will be able to relate to that, and understand why he won't be able to afford that $100 pair of Nikes."
I think that is why my daughter understands that we're not sending her to boarding school in Europe for the eighth grade. That surprising request came soon after the Broadway trip. She wanted an adventure, she said, and being an "A" student in Spanish, wanted to immerse herself in another language.
A commendable request, and I admire her maturity, but the school she had picked out, in Switzerland, costs $35,000 a year.
"I don't know how people are doing it, because it's such a struggle and it's so expensive to raise a teenager today," Ms. Humbolt said. "Parents really have to plan. It takes a fortune and six credit cards."
I wonder if Marian would settle for a pony.

HEADLINE: In a Drug's Journey to Market, Discovery Is Just the First of Many Steps

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and JEFF GERTH 

 BODY:
Pharmaceuticals are a risky, but lucrative, business. Drug companies turn scientific advances into life-saving medicines that can generate millions of dollars in sales each day, but the process takes time -- an average of 12 to 15 years -- and money.
Through a recent wave of mergers and acquisitions, the prescription drug industry is increasingly global. But the companies earn most of their profits, and do most of their basic research, in the United States, the last drug market free of price restraints. The industry consistently ranks as the most profitable among Fortune 500 companies. 
 In this election year, with prescription drugs now the fastest-growing component of the nation's health care bill, the political debate is centered on how to help elderly people pay for their medications. So politicians and consumers are taking a close look at the drug industry, a business that closely guards its financial and scientific secrets.
 
Drug Discovery
Pharmaceutical companies spend more than $20 billion annually on research and development, a figure that has nearly doubled every five years since 1970, according to industry data. The industry estimates that the average cost of developing a successful drug is more than $500 million.
The actual cost of developing a particular medicine -- the laboratory equipment, the raw materials, the researchers' salaries, the clinical trials -- is just a small percentage of the $500 million. The rest is the cost of lost opportunity: years and dollars spent on scientific leads that prove fruitless, and research money that could have generated interest had it been invested elsewhere.
The $500 million figure is extrapolated from a 1991 study by researchers at Tufts University. Some experts say the estimate, drawn from confidential industry data not subject to outside review, is inflated.
Companies spend more on drug development -- the D in R & D -- than they do on research. While clinical trials account for the biggest development expense, experts say some development costs, like consulting fees paid to doctors, are more appropriately categorized as marketing than research.
 
Clinical Testing
For every 5,000 to 10,000 compounds the industry screens as potential new medicines, 250 make it to the stage of testing in animals. Of these, the industry says, five enter testing in people, in clinical trials.
The trials have three phases. First, the drug is given to a small number of healthy volunteers to test its safety and establish the proper dose. The second trial tests for effectiveness and looks for side effects in a larger number of patients who have the condition the drug is meant to treat.
The costliest clinical trial is the Phase 3 study, in which thousands of patients may be tested, so that scientists can assess the drug in a diverse population, over an extended period. Depending on the drug and the amount of medical care involved, experts say, a Phase 3 clinical trial can cost $10,000 to $20,000 a patient.
 
The Regulators
For years the drug makers complained that the Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency that regulates medication, took too long to approve new treatments, eating into the valuable life of a patent. That changed in 1992 when Congress passed the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which enabled the agency to speed drug reviews with the help of industry money.
Between 1992 and 1997, the industry paid the agency $327 million to hire 600 new reviewers. Today, the average drug approval time has dropped to 12 months, from about 30 months before the law was passed. And the number of new medicines the agency approves each year is rising.
But critics say that in relying on drug companies to supplement its budget, the F.D.A. has become too close to the industry. They point to a rash of drugs withdrawn in recent years after serious side effects surfaced once the drugs were in pharmacies.
 
Patenting
Patents, as much as science, are critical to the success of a new drug. A patent is a property right. It confers a government-authorized monopoly for a set period -- in the United States, 20 years from the date the application is filed. During this period of market exclusivity, the patent owner can recover the costs of its original investment.
Patents were not always of paramount importance in medical research; many academic scientists once believed that knowledge should not be treated as proprietary. After Jonas Salk invented a polio vaccine, the journalist Edward R. Murrow asked him who owned the patent. "There is no patent," Dr. Salk replied. "Could you patent the sun?"
And when a Rutgers University professor, Selman Waksman, invented a breakthrough antibiotic, streptomycin, in the 1940's, he patented the drug, but gave away the rights. The result: many companies sold streptomycin, keeping prices -- and profits -- low.
The picture is far different today. Drug companies often derive the bulk of their sales from a handful of top-selling medications, so the pressure to invent the next blockbuster, and maximize its time under patent, is intense. In the industry, this is known as "life-cycle protection"; one way the drug makers protect their products is simply to file more patents.
The F.D.A. keeps a registry of all drug patents. But the agency does not evaluate whether the patents are valid; it simply takes the company's word. So the listing creates a barrier to rivals, which often wind up challenging patents in court.
Drug companies have also fought hard to win patent extensions. In 1995, an international trade agreement pushed back the expiration date of patents. Several companies benefited handsomely from a loophole in that extension.
While drug makers say they need longer patent protection to generate profits for research, some experts say that patent expirations, not extensions, spur innovation. Eli Lilly & Company, for instance, is pursuing new antidepressants now that the patent on its best seller, Prozac, is about to run out.
"The Prozac patent expiration," the company's 1998 annual report said, "is serving as a catalyst to bring greater intensity to everything we do."
 
Generic Competition
Prozac is not the only blockbuster drug threatened by the loss of its patent. In the next five years patents are due to expire on some of the most lucrative drugs in the history of medicine, among them Prilosec, the ulcer medication; Claritin, for allergies; and Zocor, for high cholesterol.
Generics can erode a brand drug's market share within months. A 1999 report by the Boston Consulting Group, which advises the industry, predicted that the average top drug company would lose 30 percent of its sales to generics by 2003.
If the threat of generics creates angst on Wall Street about the industry's profitability, it creates even more inside the companies, where scientists, patent lawyers and business executives are taking a variety of steps to beat back competition.
When a drug produced by a joint venture of Dupont and Merck, the blood thinner Coumadin, faced a generic challenge, the companies hired a battery of lobbyists to press state legislators and pharmacy boards to adopt rules that, in effect, restricted the ability of pharmacists to substitute the generic for the brand drug.
Claritin's maker, Schering-Plough, has taken its lobbying efforts to Washington; it has asked Congress to insert a provision into a spending bill that would extend the drug's patent.
When generic makers tried to sell a version of Taxol, a leading breast cancer drug, Taxol's maker, Bristol-Myers Squibb, sued for patent infringement -- not on the drug, but on the method of delivery, which the company had also patented. Courts in Britain and this country found for the generics earlier this year, but the case is on appeal and there is still no generic on the market.
Fewer than 20 percent of all prescriptions were filled with generic drugs in 1984. That year Congress passed a landmark law, the Hatch-Waxman Act, intended to facilitate generic competition. By 1996 generics had captured 43 percent of the market and were saving consumers $8 billion to $10 billion annually, according to a study by the Congressional Budget Office.
But because generics cost much less than brand drugs, they account for only a small fraction of the industry's total sales. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the combined prescription sales of the top 20 generic drug makers in 1998 totaled $7 billion, less than a tenth of those of the top 20 brand companies.
 
Coming to Market
The United States is the last free market for pharmaceuticals: other developed nations control drug prices, as in Japan, Canada, and France, or drug company profits, as in England. So Americans typically pay higher prices for new medications than people anywhere else in the developed world.
How the drug companies set prices, though, remains something of a mystery; they do not discuss their pricing strategies. The drug makers say price is dictated by the high cost of research. But the calculus behind any single pricing decision is complex, and largely shaped by market forces.
Does the new drug offer therapeutic advantages over existing medicines? How big is the patient population? Is there generic competition? Paradoxically, the arrival of generic competition often results in raised prices for their brand-name counterparts, as companies seek to maximize revenue in a shrinking market.
And despite the industry's emphasis on R & D costs, the top drug makers in 1998 spent, as a percentage of sales, three times as much on marketing and general and administrative expenses as they did on research and development, the Kaiser Family Foundation said.
There is no set price for a single drug in the United States: health plans, the government and individual patients all pay different rates, depending on their power in the marketplace. More than three-quarters of Americans younger than 65 have prescription drug coverage; their insurers typically negotiate discounts. But the size of those discounts is kept secret.
Among elderly Americans, who account for 13 percent of the population but roughly one-third of all drug expenditures, it is a different story. One-third of the nation's senior citizens lack drug insurance, and must pay out of pocket for their pills. As a result, they typically pay the highest prices.

HEADLINE: BRIEFING: UNEMPLOYMENT;
LOWEST SINCE 1970

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
State unemployment dropped to 3.4 percent in June, the lowest record since the 3.3 percent unemployment mark set in March 1970. The state's record low is 3.2 percent, which was set in January 1970.
The June mark was well below the national unemployment rate of 4 percent and was the largest one-month drop since the state's unemployment rate slipped below 4 percent in March. 
 The tightness of the labor market and its duration set off a warning that New Jersey employers may soon begin to find it so difficult to fill high-technology, high-skill jobs, and will begin toning down their ambitions to expand.
"What has happened with this shortage of labor is that it is now impacting economic output," said James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers. "It is what would be expected after 97 months of economic expansion in New Jersey: After 97 months, were have essentially run out of labor."
New Jersey employers had 3.931 million people on their payrolls in June, which is actually down 3,500 positions since May, a drop largely attributed to layoffs by the Census Bureau as it scales back its temporary field workers. Manufacturing also fell by about 1,000.
But the unemployment rate is not measured by jobs. It is measured by polls asking people if they are working or looking for work, then comparing those numbers and adjusting the results to project the trend.

In China, a Management Maverick Builds a Brand

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: QINGDAO, China

 BODY:
AT first, you notice the balloons. Thousands of them, lining the sides of the road from the airport. Tethered at the end of long strings, they bob and weave, the name Haier emblazoned on each side. Then you notice the road signs, which say Haier Expressway.
You pass the Haier Industrial Park, with its sprawling factories and a skyscraper with a sign on the roof that also says Haier. Once in Qingdao, there are still more balloons and billboards. A giant lighted Haier sign twinkles from the far side of the city's crescent-shaped bay. 
 To pay a call on the local Communist Party boss, you go to the modern city hall, where the lobby has been transformed into a showroom for Haier's refrigerators, dishwashers, personal computers, mobile phones and flat-screen television sets.
To say that Qingdao is a company town understates the degree to which a single corporation, the Haier Group, has imprinted itself on the landscape. Qingdao may be most famous as the home of Tsingtao beer. But when you spy the brewery's red, green and blue logo on a sign or storefront, it is a bit like finding an image of Deng Xiaoping in a sea of Mao posters.
Haier's exuberant self-promotion -- even more showy than usual during a recent trade show here -- reflects the ambitions of its chief executive, Zhang Ruimin. In an interview, Mr. Zhang said his determination to put the Haier name everywhere was inspired less by heroic images of Chinese leaders than by the brand marketing practiced by Western corporations.
"Chinese companies have a problem because the label 'Made in China' means low quality and low price," Mr. Zhang said. "In 1996, we started exporting products under our own brand name. We were told it wouldn't work, but we insisted. Now we're successful with the Haier name all over the world."
Indeed, the Haier Group, a sprawling enterprise ultimately controlled by the city government here, has become China's largest appliance maker, with sales of $3.2 billion last year. It is also one of China's largest exporters, selling $1.4 billion of products in 160 countries. This year, it opened a $30 million refrigerator factory in Camden, S.C. -- becoming one of the few Chinese companies to have an American beachhead.
MR. ZHANG'S overseas focus might make sense, given the cutthroat price war raging in China. On July 14, one of Haier's main rivals, Guangdong Kelon Electrical Holdings, warned that its first-half profit would be lower than expected because of the price pressure. With deflation still ravaging the Chinese economy, stores are full of unsold appliances.
But why make fridges in South Carolina when China is much cheaper? Mr. Zhang said he wants Americans to think of Haier as an American company. Designing and making products in the United States, he said, will allow Haier to be more responsive to American consumers.
"In an era of globalization, you can't separate domestic and international markets," Mr. Zhang explained. "We've got to learn how to compete with General Electric and Whirlpool on their home turf. Otherwise, we'll lose the Chinese market."
Such confidence -- not to mention worldliness -- is rare in a Chinese executive. It is even more remarkable from one who spent his career in the parochial confines of the Qingdao municipal government. At 51, Mr. Zhang has become a symbol of how Chinese businessmen can remake themselves to meet the global economy's challenges.
"I would rank him as the Jack Welch of China," said Fred Hu, chief Asian economist for Goldman, Sachs. "In a country that has been dominated by central planning and state control, he really stands out."
T. L. Tsim, a consultant who studies Chinese state enterprises, says marketing like Haier's is crucial to the country's development. "What China needs today are brand-name products," he said. "It takes years of work and millions of dollars of investment."
By creating one of China's first genuine brands, Mr. Zhang himself has become a marquee attraction. He is invited to speak at conferences here and abroad. His views are sought by government officials and journalists. And the story of how he built Haier from the ruins of a state-owned factory has become a legend -- a businessman's equivalent of the Long March.
The short version: In 1984, Mr. Zhang was asked to run the Qingdao General Refrigerator Factory, a lethargic, nearly bankrupt plant where erratically paid, demoralized workers turned out shoddy products. The Haier name, adopted in 1991, is a Chinese approximation of Liebherr, a German appliance maker that supplied technology to the factory in its early days.
Mr. Zhang was not a likely candidate to produce a turnaround. A bureaucrat who missed out on college because of the Cultural Revolution, he worked his way up the Qingdao hierarchy in anonymity. But he also devoured Western management books, which taught him heretical ideas like the unfairness of paying every worker the same wage, no matter his ability.
Early in Mr. Zhang's tenure at the company, a customer complained about a broken refrigerator, prompting the boss to stalk through the factory pulling out 76 defective ones. He piled them up and handed sledgehammers to the workers who had assembled them. At his signal, they all set upon the fridges, reducing them to shards.
That singular act of destruction impressed on employees that poor quality would no longer be acceptable. Mr. Zhang has reinforced the message with an aggressive Western-style quality-control program. "We cannot expect to smash refrigerators every day," he said. "But actually, I think about doing it every day."
Once Mr. Zhang had improved the quality of Haier's products, he set about exporting them to every corner of the world. Starting in developing countries and then to developed markets, Haier now has 62 distributors and 30,000 sales outlets. Its small refrigerators are especially popular in hotel minibars; it has a 25 percent share of the small refrigerator market in the United States.
Haier says its exports and a diversified line that runs to 9,000 goods in 42 categories have allowed it to avoid the downdraft in domestic prices that has afflicted its rivals. Because Haier's shares are listed in Shanghai -- where financial disclosure is not as rigorous as in Hong Kong -- analysts say it is difficult for outsiders to assess the impact falling prices have had on Haier's performance. "It's hard to imagine Haier has escaped it," said Charles Cheung, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong.
HAIER would like to list its shares outside China. But it has put off its plans because of volatile Asian markets and the need to streamline its baffling amalgam of dozens of holding companies and joint ventures.
When Haier does make its pitch, analysts say, it will have to answer some hard questions. First, why is it building factories overseas? For all of Mr. Zhang's explanations, analysts say that it is squandering its advantage as a low-cost producer.
Second, why does Haier need a soup-to-nuts product line? Guangdong Kelon makes refrigerators, air-conditioners and washing machines. Mr. Zhang wants to supply every electrical appliance in the household. Doing that while maintaining quality is tricky.
A few years ago, Haier branched into pharmaceuticals. Mr. Zhang did so because he is convinced that biotechnology will be one of the great industries of the 21st century. But he acknowledged that Haier had struggled so far. "We may fail in that field," he said without a hint of defensiveness.
Risking failure, after all, is the mark of a modern company.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Press Role for a Media-Shy Mogul

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: SANTA BARBARA, Calif.

 BODY:
FEW cities do a better job of smoothing the rough edges of movie moguls and business gladiators than this quaint, impeccably groomed seaside paradise 100 miles north of the shark-infested studio commissaries of Hollywood. The wealthy often come here not to forget who they are, but to take a break from some of the forces that made them rich.
Which is why the recent announcement that the local newspaper, the 145-year-old Santa Barbara News-Press, had been sold by a large publishing company -- The New York Times Company, as it happens -- and acquired by a local philanthropist was received in some circles as a victory of community spirit over the homogenizing influence of a distant corporate overseer. "It has to be quality before the bottom line," said Wendy P. McCaw, the buyer, who paid roughly $100 million. It seemed that an act of public spirit had drawn one of the wealthiest, if not best known, women in America out of her shell. 
 And yet, Ms. McCaw, 48, demonstrated the hard business acumen that she uses to manage a fortune that Forbes magazine has estimated at about $1.5 billion, most of that a product of her divorce from Craig O. McCaw, the telecommunications entrepreneur. When it was suggested in an interview -- she supplied written answers to written questions -- that she may have made the investment for altruistic reasons, she crisply shot down the notion.
"This acquisition fits with my investment philosophy and meets my I.R.R. targets," said Ms. McCaw, using the Wall Street language for internal rate of return. "I don't invest in assets for purely sentimental or other nonbusiness reasons."
Ms. McCaw's acquisition stands in counterpoint to a trend in which large chains have been gobbling up small publications and using economies of scale to wring out higher profits. She has said not only that she will avoid layoffs and leave the newsroom alone, but that she will also explore environmentally sound alternatives to using newsprint made from tree pulp.
THE acquisition will also provide an opportunity to find out just what Ms. McCaw is made of as she cautiously -- so cautiously that an assistant leapt at a photographer snapping a shot of her near her unmarked office on a quiet street here -- steps onto a stage she has long avoided.
She gave a rare personal interview to her own newspaper after the deal was announced, but insisted that no photographs be taken. When she first visited the newspaper after the purchase, she casually strolled the five or so blocks from her office and introduced herself to the staff. But it was on a Saturday, when the offices were all but empty.
Ms. McCaw is an avid jogger and a vegetarian,well known for her divorce from Mr. McCaw. The two met while undergraduates at Stanford, where she was known as Wendy Petrak. She was at his side as he cleverly assembled a nationwide cellular communications empire, which he sold in 1994 to AT&T for $11.5 billion.
The two separated shortly afterward, in January 1995, and then engaged in an expensive divorce battle that ended in her placing business ownership over cash. She became something of a business partner of her former husband, taking large stakes in several companies in which he had invested, including Nextel Communications, in which she now owns 4 percent, according to public filings, and Nextlink Communications, in which she owns a reported 14 percent through her investment company, Ampersand Holdings.
SHE has said she protects her privacy in large part because of security concerns, but in response to a question she added that being a woman was also a factor. When it was pointed out that billionaires from Steve Jobs to Donald Trump lead public lives, she responded: "They are all men -- some of them happen to enjoy the spotlight. I'm not and I don't."
And though she is quiet, she is not anonymous. She formed the Wendy P. McCaw Foundation, which has more than $53 million in assets, to finance some of her favorite projects. These have ranged from returning Keiko, the killer whale that starred in the movie "Free Willy," to the waters around Iceland, to preserving architectural drawings.
Ms. McCaw was so involved in freeing Keiko that in January 1996, when the animal was flown from Mexico to a temporary home in Oregon, she was on board the chase plane.
"Wendy was very personally involved," said David Phillips, executive director of the Earth Island Institute, which managed the project. "She'd come up to see him when we had him in a sort of rehab in Oregon. She has continued to provide funds to help in his eventual release."
He added that when a reception celebrating the journey included platters of seafood, she was incensed.
"What's going on?" Ms. McCaw demanded to know, said Mr. Phillips. "We're supposed to be saving this stuff, not eating it."
Her stewardship of the newspaper could prove a challenge. Most experts agree that the paper is likely to be a reliable if unspectacular investment. It is expected to take in about $30 million in revenue this year and earn pretax income of $4.5 million to $6 million, company officials say.
"We'll have good, steady growth, but it won't be explosive," said Allen Parsons, the publisher.
Or, as Edward J. Atorino, a media analyst at Wasserstein Perella Securities, commented, "It's in an affluent area, but there's limited growth."
Ms. McCaw said she would do well, while respecting the paper's independence.
"I will not have any role in the news-gathering or reporting process," she said. "I would hope that no friend or acquaintance of mine asks me to intercede with the paper; but if they did, I would tell them what I just told you."

HEADLINE: Taxed, Over and Over

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Soaking the Rich Isn't What It Used To Be" (Week in Review, July 16):
You perpetuate a dangerous myth that the estate tax somehow is unique in constituting "double taxation." In fact, every dollar is taxed an infinite amount of times as it circulates through the economy. I pay payroll and income tax on an earned dollar, sales taxes when I spend it and tax on interest earned when I put it in a savings account. When I buy a compact disc, the store, the manufacturer and the store clerk are all taxed on it. 
 Wealthy people pay zero percent on unrealized capital gains (if they have no need to sell their stock portfolios), and 98 percent of estates pay a zero percent rate, so in most cases the wealthy pay zero percent on their money. In most cases, income that is unearned is taxed at a much lower rate than income that is earned by the sweat of one's brow.

HEADLINE: Polar Opposites? Not Where It Counts;
Warren Buffett Gets All the Attention, But Hank Greenberg Is Posting Better Returns

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
ONE plays the part of the hayseed, the other the quintessential New York tough guy, complete with flinty stare and a vocabulary that might stun the crowd at a hip-hop concert. One loves bridge and jokes that he reluctantly drags himself around a golf course; the other is a bundle of energy whose idea of relaxation is rocketing down a frozen ski trail.
Look deeper, though, and these two men -- Warren E. Buffett of Omaha and Maurice R. Greenberg of Manhattan -- have more in common than what sets them apart. By dint of intellect and Olympian drive, each has built a far-rearching empire that for decades has delivered immense value to shareholders. Each rules his company -- Mr. Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Greenberg at the American International Group -- with imperial authority, in gracious defiance of the conventions of good corporate government. 
 More to the point, Mr. Greenberg, who is 75 and known as Hank, and Mr. Buffett, who will be 70 in August, are giants in the same game. Though both Berkshire, quite famously, and A.I.G., less obviously, have other operations, each is mainly in the insurance business; it represents nearly 80 percent of Mr. Buffett's revenue, and, along with related financial services, nearly all of Mr. Greenberg's. Glamorless? Unexciting? Maybe -- until you understand that both see it as the business of deploying assets to the greatest possible gain. "We think alike," Mr. Buffett said recently. "If you showed us 10 deals, we would probably come to pretty similar conclusions on most of them."
And that makes all the more extraordinary this simple fact: For 10 years, Mr. Greenberg's company has, for investors, been the better bet.
Berkshire, of course, has been a spectacular long-haul investment. A stake of $10,000 sunk into Mr. Buffett's holding-company-cum-investment-fund in 1965 has grown to about $39 million. Built for long-term investors -- Class A shares, never split, now sell for $53,300, a price that discourages trading -- Berkshire has minted many a millionaire and has made Mr. Buffett an investing icon.
Yet an investor who plopped down $10,000 in Berkshire on June 30, 1990 -- a lifetime ago, by today's market standards -- would have had $25,600 less on June 30, 2000, than one who bought an equal stake in A.I.G.: $74,700 versus $100,300. Over five years, the gap is even greater: $10,000 invested in A.I.G. in June 1995 would have grown to $44,100 through June 2000, while the same amount in Berkshire would have grown to just under $23,000.
Mr. Buffett's recent underperformance of both the stock market and his own historical record is no secret. Last year, Berkshire's gain in net worth was less than 1 percent -- the "absolute worst performance of my tenure," he has acknowledged. And he offers his investors little reason for optimism. Unbending in his value discipline, Mr. Buffett says he finds it increasingly difficult to uncover companies or stocks worth buying. Over the coming decade, he says, Berkshire's gains will probably only modestly surpass those of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Mr. Greenberg makes no such concessions. He has been averaging annual earnings growth of about 20 percent since taking A.I.G. public in 1969, two years after he rose to chief executive; the stock has gone up at about the same pace. As for the future, "I don't see anything that's going to rock that boat," Mr. Greenberg said in a conversation this month at the company's Art Deco skyscraper on Pine Street in Manhattan's financial district.
That may be hubris on Mr. Greenberg's part, and Mr. Buffett's modesty may be misplaced: his protestations of fallibility have often preceded stellar performance. Indeed, the fading of technology stocks this spring and the revival, at least temporarily, of the consumer and financial sectors he favors have helped Berkshire Class A shares rebound about 30 percent from a low of $40,800 in March.
But the long-term numbers don't lie. A.I.G. -- today the pre-eminent American commercial insurer, with operations in more than 130 countries -- has earned comparison to Berkshire as a vehicle for long-term investors. And it is high time, too, to examine Mr. Greenberg's legacy in the same light as Mr. Buffett's.
A.I.G. is not as well known on Main Street as Berkshire. But on Wall Street, said Doug MacKay, a portfolio manager at Oak Associates, a mutual fund company that holds more than seven million A.I.G. shares, "Maurice Greenberg is just legendary."
 
Opposite Styles of Investing
Mr. Greenberg may act like the tough guy, but when it comes to investing A.I.G.'s capital, he turns cautious. The company, which has $268 billion in assets, making it the largest American insurance company, has a classic insurance securities portfolio, heavy with high-quality bonds and constructed to produce steady gains. His acquisitions and new ventures generally amplify the successes of the past.
For his part, Mr. Buffett invests like a riverboat gambler, limiting his market plays to a few big bets and buying up companies with little in common except that they are moneymakers with superb managers and products that he personally likes.
"Berkshire will buy businesses with very volatile earnings if the returns are high enough," said Alice Schroeder, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter who has studied both companies. "A.I.G. wants companies that produce predictable earnings over time."
A.I.G., she added, "likes to have its capital fully allocated at all times; Berkshire is an opportunistic investor."
Trained as an investor, not as a businessman, Mr. Buffett was first drawn to the insurance business in the mid-1960's by the money -- other people's money, that is. The float on premium payments can be put to work earning investment profits until a claim is filed.
Mr. Greenberg is an insurance man from the ground up. An Army veteran of the Normandy invasion, he got a law degree and returned to front-line service in the Korean War. Back in New York in 1952, he walked into the office of the Continental Casualty Company and asked for a job. The personnel manager showed him the door, but Mr. Greenberg tracked down the head of the New York office, who liked his spunk and put him to work as an underwriting trainee. In late 1960, he joined the insurance company that would become A.I.G. as a senior executive. Seven years later, at the age of 42, he became chief executive.
Nothing illustrates the differences between the two men's investing personalities so much as their biggest single acquisitions.
Two years ago, Mr. Buffett moved into the big time in insurance with the purchase of General Re, one of the world's leading reinsurers -- the companies that take on other insurance companies' biggest risks for a share of the premiums.
Most years, reinsurers collect substantial premiums without having to make big payouts; the float can be very attractive. But the risks of Mr. Buffett's investment quickly rained down on Berkshire: big earthquakes in Turkey and Taiwan contributed to an underwriting loss of more than $1 billion at General Re last year.
Still, Mr. Buffett loves the company. It has everything it needs, he says, "to become the world's most profitable reinsurance company."
Mr. Greenberg is no stranger to the wild, caroming fortunes of reinsurance; A.I.G. owns 60 percent of TransAtlantic Re, another global leader in the field. But far from a walk on the wild side, his biggest acquisition -- made shortly after Mr. Buffett bought General Re -- was of a company built to be a safe bet.
That company, SunAmerica, is a leader in variable annuities, which combine mutual funds and insurance and are blazing new sales records as baby boomers fret about retirement. The business itself is one giant annuity for A.I.G., piling up money in long-term investments from customers and throwing off management fees.
"We could have bought a commercial bank," Mr. Greenberg said, "but commercial banks, to us, have more volatility in earnings."
Still, as Mr. Buffett notes, the two men follow similar disciplines in analyzing a deal. Each carefully studies the financials himself, rather than relying on staff summaries. Mr. Buffett is famous for spending days reading annual reports; Mr. Greenberg seldom leaves the office without two big satchels full of papers.
"My weekends are playing tennis and reading," he said. "And on the telephone. That's generally my weekend."
 
Reins, Loose and Tight
As a manager, Mr. Buffett says he tries to keep his hands off Berkshire's companies. But Mr. Greenberg is totally hands-on. As Mr. Buffett puts it, "He knows when the sparrow falls, and he even knows when the sparrow is thinking of falling."
Once a month, Mr. Greenberg assembles his division presidents around a rectangular table in a large, plain room on the 16th floor of A.I.G.'s headquarters. To start "the chairman's meeting," as it is known, he swings his eyes around the room and, like a stern law professor putting students to a test, finally lets his gaze rest on one executive.
That person has a minute or so to rattle off current sales, expenses, profits and any unusual developments. Then, moving clockwise, each of the other subordinates reports. It can be a crisp, charged atmosphere. Mr. Greenberg tells his people that he wants them to be entrepreneurs. And he wants performance.
"If they believe you are doing everything you possibly can, they might accept some performance slippage," said Susan Rivera, the president of an A.I.G. division that sells workers' compensation and other business insurance. "But if you're not performing and it's perceived you're not doing all you can, it is a short-lived life."
Mr. Greenberg often recruits specialists from other fields and teaches them the insurance business -- as long as they are quick studies. He signed up Joseph L. Boren, who spent years in government and business solving pollution problems, to develop new coverages in his field.
Mr. Boren, now president of A.I.G. Environmental, has been attending the chairman's meetings for four years. Mr. Greenberg, he said, is "not denigrating; he's penetrating."
"He doesn't say, 'You must be the biggest dope I've ever seen,' " Mr. Boren added. "But he might say: 'You're alarming me. You don't sound like you're in control.'
"In the scheme of things, you'd rather walk into a meeting and have people say to you, 'How are you today? Did you have a nice weekend?' But that isn't how our business works, which is why our business is so successful."
A few months ago, when A.I.G. acquired an 8 percent stake in Risk Labs, a dot-com start-up in Atlanta, Mr. Greenberg sent in one of his executives as acting chief executive. That is not the Buffett way. Mr. Buffett says that one reason he buys a company is for its management; when he takes newcomers into the Berkshire fold, he leaves the managers alone. That is his plan for Justin Industries, the maker of Tony Lama boots; Berkshire said last month that it was acquiring the company.
Indeed, said a senior executive of one of Mr. Buffett's companies, "if you want to get him involved, you practically have to drag him into it."
But he has ways of letting his managers know what he wants done. Years ago, after he acquired 50 percent of Geico, the discount auto insurer that Berkshire now owns entirely, A.I.G. offered to buy the business.
As John J. Byrne Jr., then Geico's chief executive, tells the story, Mr. Buffett agreed only reluctantly to join him for lunch in Mr. Greenberg's private dining room at A.I.G. Mr. Greenberg and Felix Rohatyn, a friend who was then a senior partner in the Lazard Freres investment banking firm, tried to aim their conversation at Mr. Buffett. "You're looking at the wrong side of the table," he told them. "You've got to speak to Mr. Byrne."
Mr. Byrne felt the chill. The next day he told Mr. Greenberg that Geico was not for sale.
Another time, though, Mr. Buffett showed that he can lose his cool as readily as any hands-on boss. Mr. Byrne had shifted much of Geico's investment portfolio into long-term bonds -- at precisely the wrong moment. Interest rates were starting to rise, which meant that he would not only soon be locked into below-market yields, but that the value of his bonds would be falling.
As Mr. Byrne recalls it, Mr. Buffett invited him to play golf at the Burning Tree Club outside Washington. Rather tentatively, Mr. Buffett started to talk about the economy, and Mr. Byrne defended his decision. As they played, Mr. Byrne could see Mr. Buffett becoming agitated. On the ninth hole, he noticed Mr. Buffett gritting his teeth, the veins in his neck pulsing. Unleashing a furious swing that clipped the top of the ball and sent it dribbling about 14 feet, Mr. Buffett wheeled on Mr. Byrne in a rage. "Only a fool would lend long at this point in time," Mr. Byrne recalls him shouting. "Only a fool."
Mr. Byrne managed to stay on as chief executive. But he immediately hired a specialist to run his investment portfolio.
 
Governance and Succession
If Mr. Greenberg and Mr. Buffett run their companies like owners, it is not without a certain logic. Mr. Buffett owns more than 30 percent of Berkshire's stock; Mr. Greenberg owns 2.2 percent of A.I.G.'s, but he estimates that top management and the board control about 30 percent of the shares. And each is accorded complete authority as the builder of his enterprise.
Of course, each man has aligned things in his favor. In defiance of the norms of governance for public companies, their boards are heavy with insiders. Neither man is interested in hearing about mandatory retirement; both say they plan to go on leading their companies indefinitely.
Mr. Greenberg had to face a few hecklers on such issues at A.I.G.'s annual meeting in May. But their reward for speaking up was chilly glares from other shareholders and employees who had crowded into the modest company cafeteria. As Mr. Greenberg was detailing yet another stellar year and announcing yet another stock split, one protester rose to argue that earnings often suffer at companies with less-than-independent boards. Mr. Greenberg lobbed a soft reply: "Are you sure you're in the right place?" And the room, full of loyalists, chuckled and clucked.
Professional financial analysts tend to melt before Mr. Buffett and Mr. Greenberg, too.
At Berkshire's annual meetings in Omaha, reporters ask Mr. Buffett for autographs; instead of trying to poke holes in his strategies, many securities analysts admiringly quote Buffett aphorisms. When Mr. Greenberg invites insurance analysts once a year to what they refer to as a fireside chat, the questions are gentle. They have all heard the tales of how Mr. Greenberg has called analysts and read them -- and their bosses, who covet A.I.G.'s investment banking business -- the riot act.
"You don't mess around with Hank," one analyst said on condition of anonymity. "He could squash me like a bug."
It is no surprise that such a leader would have dynastic dreams, and Mr. Greenberg intends to keep the future of A.I.G. in the family. His eldest son, Jeffrey, had been regarded by A.I.G. watchers as the heir apparent, but he resigned abruptly five years ago, later becoming chief executive of Marsh & McLennan, the giant insurance broker. Now Jeffrey's 45-year-old brother Evan, A.I.G.'s president, has been designated as next in line to run the company, where he has worked for 25 years.
Apart from the confidence of his father, it is hard to tell, at this point, how well Evan Greenberg might perform. Subordinates earnestly describe his thoroughness and command of the nuances of the business. Some say he is brilliant. But industry executives who know him well are noncommittal.
"As far as I know he's a competent fellow," said Barber B. Conable, a former congressman and past president of the World Bank who is one of six directors on A.I.G.'s 18-member board who are neither company executives nor contractors. "This is not an issue we've been worrying about," he added, "because Hank shows every sign of continuing as the leader."
In any event, Mr. Conable said, after the senior Mr. Greenberg dies, there is nothing to stop the board from choosing whomever it decides is best suited to run the company. Mr. Conable said he once told Mr. Greenberg: "You must understand, your son will be tested by the board at such time as you step down."
At Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Buffett has installed a seven-member board that comprises his wife, Susan, who lives apart from him in San Francisco; his son, Howard G. Buffett; Charles T. Munger, the company's vice chairman, who has long been Mr. Buffett's confidant; a law partner of Mr. Munger's and two other longtime business associates of Mr. Buffett's.
After Mr. Buffett dies, his wife is to receive nearly all his stock. But she will not run the company; instead, he has designated two Berkshire executives to take his place -- one to handle investments, the other operations. Neither has been publicly named, but there has been speculation that Louis A. Simpson, who is in charge of investments at Geico, would take over the investing side. Buffett watchers mention several candidates for the operations job, with little conviction.
Whoever they are, Mr. Buffett's successors will be hard pressed to preserve Berkshire's unique place in the investment pantheon. The market does not value Berkshire as it would an insurance company, even though that is what it mainly is. Rather, it is priced largely on the performance of its chief executive's stock picks. Whether the cult followers will remain in thrall to Mr. Buffett's successors is anybody's guess.
A.I.G. certainly revolves around Mr. Greenberg -- "If you don't have a relationship with Hank Greenberg, you don't have a relationship with A.I.G.," said an insurance executive who has known Mr. Greenberg for years. But analysts say an A.I.G. without Mr. Greenberg is a surer bet than Berkshire without Mr. Buffett: There are more units, more decision makers, a broader playing field.
 
Comparing the Scorecards
In the meantime, neither Mr. Buffett nor Mr. Greenberg shows any sign of slowing down. Indeed, their business strategies put them face to face more and more, inviting the comparisons that previously were not so obvious. For example, will Mr. Buffett's Geico or Mr. Greenberg's A.I.G. Direct reap the most rewards in the competition for bargain-minded auto insurance customers?
Both are pouring money into advertising and expansion. Characteristically, Mr. Buffett is going for broke; he wants Geico to become one of the giants in the business. Mr. Greenberg wants to grow, too, but earnings in car insurance fluctuate too much to suit him, so he will keep the line from dominating A.I.G.'s portfolio of businesses.
Ultimately, do you bet on the Manhattan tortoise or the Omaha hare? Ms. Schroeder, the Morgan Stanley analyst, finds it difficult to choose. "That's like asking whether to buy a Van Gogh or a Monet," she says.
 
From Rivalry to Cooperation
AFTER decades of rubbing shoulders around the casino tables of finance, Warren E. Buffett and Maurice R. Greenberg have come to admire each other warmly.
"The vibe between us is not competitors," Mr. Buffett said. "The vibe between us is friends." Envious friends, but friends. "I wish I had done some of the deals he's done," Mr. Buffett said, "and maybe he wishes he'd done some of the deals I've done."
Indeed, Mr. Greenberg said, "we have a great relationship."
But things have not always been so rosy. Fifteen years ago, they exchanged verbal punches. Mr. Buffett criticized the way the American International Group, of which Mr. Greenberg is chief executive, used reinsurance, and Mr. Greenberg fired back that Mr. Buffett had "a peanut-sized book" of insurance business -- which was true at the time -- and that he was a fine one to be telling him how to run his company, already a giant in the industry.
But that was a long time ago. Now they are doing business together; A.I.G. is one of the biggest customers of General Re, Mr. Buffett's main insurance holding. And they are keen competitors: TransAtlantic, the big reinsurer that A.I.G. controls, goes after some of the same business that General Re does, and the two titans are pursuing the same customers in their car insurance businesses.
They have collaborated on some joint projects, but their biggest idea -- the attempted rescue and takeover of Long Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that nearly failed in 1998 -- came to nothing. Others on Wall Street beat them to it.
But they're still thinking. "It's logical that we would team up on something," Mr. Buffett said. "We and they have enormous capital resources." JOSEPH B. TREASTER

HEADLINE: Officials Say Skeptical U.S. Plans to Work With Fujimori

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
After harsh denunciations of Peru's recent presidential election, top Clinton administration officials say they do not have enough leverage to force a new vote and will work with President Alberto K. Fujimori while continuing to press for reform.
With less than a week before Mr. Fujimori is to be sworn in for a third term after an election and campaign widely criticized for gross irregularities, administration officials say they will send the American ambassador in Lima, John Hamilton, to attend Mr. Fujimori's inauguration next Friday. 
 Mr. Hamilton's presence will signal "the reality" that Mr. Fujimori "is going to head the government of Peru at least for the foreseeable future, and we acknowledge that we have mutual, bilateral business to conduct," a senior administration official said.
Critics in Congress and human rights groups say the softening of the American stance sets a troubling precedent in a hemisphere where several elected leaders have recently taken steps toward more authoritarian rule.
Peru is perhaps the United States' best-performing ally in the fight against the illegal drug trade in the region, and administration officials privately acknowledged that concerns about maintaining antinarcotics cooperation played a hand in their decision-making.
They also attributed the shift to a number of other factors: resistance from key Latin American governments to tougher action; Mr. Fujimori's ample financial reserves, which would make sanctions less effective; and discomfort with the leader of Peru's opposition, Alejandro Toledo, whom they see as too weak and inexperienced to lead a successful drive to restore democracy in Peru.
Congress eliminated $42 million in aid to Lima last month and the Senate approved a provision to cut off more funds for Peru if the president reports that Mr. Fujimori has failed to make "substantial progress in improving its respect for human rights." But exemptions for counternarcotics and humanitarian help left the actual amount of aid at stake at less than $10 million.
While American officials acknowledged having doubts that Mr. Fujimori is prepared to make key democratic reforms, they say that in the end they decided to follow the lead of the 34-nation Organization of American States, a consensus-driven groupthat has called for negotiations with Mr. Fujimori and has ruled out more forceful action, like sanctions.
In a scathing report on Peru's election, the group's own monitors denounced the harassment of opposition candidates, government control of the media, arrests of would-be voters and the mutilation of ballots in the first round. Mr. Toledo ultimately asked to have his name scratched from ballots in the May 28 runoff, charging he could not get a fair vote.
But at the O.A.S. annual assembly last month in Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela steered the region toward negotiations with Mr. Fujimori, administration officials said. A high-level O.A.S. delegation then drew up proposals aimed at "strengthening democracy" under the current Peruvian government and appointed an envoy to monitor any progress.
Administration officials said they favored a call for new elections in Peru using the threat of multilateral economic sanctions as leverage. "There's a little bit of uncertainty as to how to proceed," said one State Department official. "The U.S. was hoping the O.A.S. would take the ball and run with it." Instead, the official said, the O.A.S. "has taken new elections off the table."
While withholding some aid to Peru could set back United States efforts to eradicate drug crops and disrupt trafficking, critics of the administration decision say the greater risk is tolerating stolen elections.
"The risk here is sending a message to the rest of the hemisphere that if you cooperate with us on narcotics interdiction, everything else you do including the suppression of democracy is fine," said Representative Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat.

HEADLINE: The World;
A World of Scavengers On the Fringes of Wealth

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: MANILA

 BODY:
ROBERTO AQUINO, 14, says he finds "false gold" in garbage. A scavenger on Manila's garbage mountain when he is not in school, he specializes in copper wire. On a good day he can earn half as much as his fifth-grade teacher.
Hundreds of people died here two weeks ago when the seven-story-high mountain, loosened by monsoon rains, collapsed on their shantytown. Like their neighbors, they lived here amid the filth and flies and degradation because the living was good. Mostly upwardly mobile migrants from the barren countryside, they were feeding their families and putting their children through school. Like Roberto, they had struck gold. 
 "Say you have a family of four," said Matthew Westfall, an urban development specialist with the Asian Development Bank, which is based here. "The kids go to school part time and pick trash part time. You could get up to 15,000 or 16,000 pesos a month, possibly." That sum, about $400, "puts you above the poverty line," he said.
The people of the dumpsite, which they call Promised Land, are not an aberration. They are part of the changing face of poverty -- a vast population shift taking place in much of the world, from the joblessness and hunger of the countryside to the comparative wealth of the cities. But for most of these migrants, that comparative wealth is found in places like this dumpsite, part of a growing sea of poverty that laps at the edges of small, high-rise islands of urban affluence.
In Asia, where cities of 10 million people or more are spreading as fast as anywhere in the world, this urban landscape is replacing the fields and trees of the villages for an increasing proportion of the population.
Thirty-five years ago, Mr. Westfall said, only one in five Asians lived in cities. Today the ratio is one in three. Twenty years from now, more than half the population will be urban. In 1990, he said, the region's cities needed a total of $38 billion a year to provide urban services like water, sanitation and transport. In 20 years that figure is expected to rise to an impossible $292 billion.
These huge "megacities," groaning with their burden of the disenfranchised poor, will dominate the next century, it is said, the way the nation-state dominated the last century and empires ruled in the century before.
Urbanization, of course, is not just an Asian phenomenon. Nor is the misery of the poor. Garbage mountains rise in Latin America and Africa as well. But it is in Asia, perhaps, with its enormous population pressures, that the issue is drawn most strikingly.
Manila today, for example, has 13 percent of the Philippines' 74 million people but generates 30 to 40 percent of the nation's wealth. Bangkok has 10 percent of Thailand's population but generates 40 percent of its wealth. "People in rural areas have no alternative but to migrate," said Anil Deolalikar, a professor of economics at the University of Washington in Seattle.
But garbage dumps aside, said Naved Hamid, a senior policy planner with the Asian Development Bank, these poor see little of the cities' wealth.
There is no one pattern for urban poverty and therefore no single cure. In China, the pattern is predominantly one of a vast floating population of migrant workers who follow jobs from city to city. In Manila, where many urban services have broken down, it also includes people like civil servants and teachers, whose pay puts them above the poverty line but who often have no alternative to living in the ugliest of slums.
The urban underclass for the most part lives apart from the social and economic structure of its city, invisible to most residents and without the political weight to demand their share of services. So they create their own separate -- though dependent -- economies. Some 80,000 squatters cluster around Manila's garbage mountain, for example. They include perhaps 3,000 scavengers and another 9,000 or so people whose livelihoods depend directly on what urban experts call "the recycling waste chain."
As planners seek new ways to address the growing disaster of urban poverty, the world's millions of slum dwellers find their own ways to survive. The art of scavenging, it appears, is one of the great tributes to human inventiveness. There are children who dive for golf balls in the water hazards of golf courses and there are daring teenagers who scurry for brass shell casings on military firing ranges.
In Laos, people use old bombshells to construct their houses. In America, the urban poor dig for aluminum cans (and cold slices of pizza) in garbage bins.
In Nigeria this month -- in a tragedy that is a companion to the garbage landslide in Manila -- hundreds of scavengers died in an explosion and fire while trying to earn their living by puncturing a pipeline and siphoning off gasoline.
PEOPLE like this not only make a living; they make a home for themselves. The shanties at Manila's dump are hung with flower pots and posters of soccer teams. There are tiny barbershops and ice cream stands. There are births and weddings and school graduations.
Nine people in the family of Jennifer Gino Evangelista died in the landslide, including her parents. Twenty-one survived. None of them want to move away.
In the 1980's, said Mrs. Evangelista, 27, her father brought the family here from the countryside after taking them from place to place in search of a living. "Every year we would move," she said. "We never had a permanent address. We were tourists in our own country."
That homeless life ended here on the fringes of the Promised Land dump.
"This is where we've stayed the longest -- 12 years," she said. "This is where we've multiplied. This is where we've put down roots. So this is our home now."

HEADLINE: The Nation: The Classroom Ceiling;
Making Sense of a Stubborn Education Gap

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
FOR all the curative powers of a booming economy, the overflowing prosperity of the last four years has failed to raise the second-class incomes of the one-third of American adults who have not gone beyond high school.
Just as near-universal high school education was one of the great achievements of 20th-century America, politicians and business leaders have long sought to lure more students to college, reasoning that the college-educated would earn more in a "new economy" that now more than ever rewards a bachelor's degree. College, they believed, could help close the gap between the economic haves and have nots. Yet the proportion of Americans who have only a high school diploma has barely budged for 30 years, through good times and bad. 
 Where many saw college as the answer, nearly everyone also counted on the booming economy as a way to narrow the income gap. Prosperity created a tight labor market that drove up wages, which have indeed risen faster than inflation for everyone. But as college graduates' earnings rose even more quickly, the wage gap widened, not shrank.
These stubborn education and income gaps are barely mentioned on the campaign trail. Politicians and policy makers speak mainly of sending more people to college, without recognizing that a steady third of adults 25 and older have only finished high school -- and that percentage does not seem likely to come down soon. For a host of reasons -- age, lack of tuition money, inadequate secondary schooling, reluctance to study, discouragement from family and friends -- college is not a viable option for a significant portion of the population.
The data suggest that neither a robust economy nor policies that try to push people through college can significantly narrow the income gap.
Harry J. Holzer, a labor economist and a visiting fellow at the Urban Institute, would improve the lot of the lower-paid through greater "institutional support" -- more government subsidies for health care, for example, better unemployment insurance, a broader earned income tax credit and larger subsidies for child care and housing.
The Clinton administration endorses some of these steps, while Gov. George W. Bush emphasizes tax cuts that would leave low-income workers with more take-home pay. But college has become the favored approach, the one that business most applauds. Nearly $13 billion in federal funding has gone this year into college scholarships and tax credits for college tuition. Mr. Bush favors similar subsidies and so does Vice President Al Gore.
"There are people who do not go past high school, and that will always be the case," said Martin Bailey, chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. "Over time, however, the goal is to reduce that proportion, because in this new economy, a college education is increasingly important."
Half of the nation's 131.6 million jobs are classified by the Labor Department as not requiring a college education. Yet for many employers, high school diplomas are simply not enough.
"You need a bachelor's degree just to apply for the best jobs," said Stephen Rose, a senior economist at the Educational Testing Service. "That is as it should be for doctors, lawyers, scientists, engineers, computer specialists. But look at middle-level managers. In 1960, only 40 percent had a bachelor's degree and today it is 80 percent." Many such jobs don't necessarily require a B.A., he said.
Perhaps. But in the high-technology economy, employers say they value a college degree as evidence that a job applicant has learned to think and to master new ways of working, and is also sufficiently disciplined to work hard. The high school diploma no longer sends that message to employers.
Education has always raised incomes. For more than a century, the college educated have been at the top of the earnings pyramid, the masters of each new, complicated technology. High school prepared hundreds of millions of ordinary workers for the modern workplace and helped to lift their incomes, shrinking the gap between their pay and that of the college educated. But since 1980, that gap has widened again. The economic boom did narrow the earnings gap a bit in the mid-1990's, as employers competed to hire low-wage workers. But starting in 1997, the wages of college graduates pulled ahead, according to the Economic Policy Institute's latest figures.
HIGHER-LEVEL jobs for the college educated are among the fastest growing, the Labor Department reports -- those for computer analysts, engineers, upper level executives and secondary-school teachers. But lower-paying jobs that require only high school training are also among the fastest growing -- jobs for retail sales people, cashiers, truck drivers, office clerks and home health care aides.
Despite this demand, the wages of people with only a high school diploma -- rather solid in the days of unionized blue collar factory work -- have fallen steadily behind for 20 years, making college seem the only route to the $20.58 an hour that college graduates earned, on average, last year, according to the Economic Policy Institute. By comparison, the high school educated averaged only $11.83; adjusted for inflation, the earnings gap has risen nearly 70 percent since 1980.
The gap has widened partly because union strength has declined, and with it many of the higher-paying jobs once available to high school graduates. And the minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, is not as high today as it was in the late 1960's. "The deterioration of unions and the minimum wage probably explains up to one-third of the increase in the earnings gap in the past 20 years," Mr. Holzer said.
These financial pressures have indeed pushed more Americans into college. College graduates now represent nearly 25 percent of all adults, up from 17 percent in 1980. The proportion of workers with only a high school diploma has correspondingly fallen to 34 percent from 39 percent in 1988.
Yet if one-third of the population continues to balk at moving past high school, then one solution is to raise the quality of that education. More than 40 states are now requiring students to pass achievement exams at various stages of their schooling. In the attempt to raise standards, governments and school districts have stepped up spending to train teachers, reduce class size, improve courses, provide vocational training or apprenticeships, expand Head Start and link schools to the Internet.
THERE is a downside, however, to raising standards and then failing students who don't meet them. A system could emerge that is less forgiving than American public schools have traditionally been, less willing to give poor students a second or third or fourth chance, says Paul Attewell, a sociologist at the College of the City University of New York. "It has not happened yet, but in such a system you are likely to produce a large number of poor kids and minority kids who drop out," he said.
New York City, he added, may be a case in point: hundreds of young people failed qualifying exams but didn't show up for compulsory schooling this summer. Richard Murnane, an economist at Harvard's Graduate School of Education, acknowledges the risk. "That is a problem," he said, "but the alternative of graduating students without stronger skills will penalize them for a lifetime."

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends;
The Latest Fashion: Fear-of-Crime Design

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
WALK into a department store these days and you can buy a holster for a cellular phone that looks just like a holster for a snub-nosed pistol. Visit a consumer electronics store and you'll find that the computers are no longer boxy and cheery-looking but dark, sleek and faintly menacing. Stop at an auto dealership and there will be an array of tall sport utility vehicles designed to intimidate other motorists.
Designers of a wide variety of consumer products say that the American public is increasingly entranced by styling that suggests a high level of aggression. They point to the popularity of black, red and white as colors, the prevalence of crisp, even sharp, edges for many products, and a declining emphasis on personal comfort in everything from furniture to clothing. 
 "It's sort of like 'sex sells' -- in this case, violence sells," said William Stumpf, a Minneapolis-based designer best known as the inventor of the Aeron chair. "There's a meanness aesthetic being developed."
Bruce R. Hannah, a professor of industrial design at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, said his young design students were particularly captivated by ideas that emphasized rawness and even pain over comfort. One student, for example, was interested in spiky jewelry that would be painful to wear and light switches with sharp edges. And Mr. Hannah sees the same extremism at work in young people's fashion. "There are these big, black, chunky almost storm-trooper shoes and crisp trousers; there isn't the rumpled look of the 60's and 70's," he said.
Some older designers complain that there is little on the market that they want to buy. Clyde Foles, the 56-year-old chairman of the industrial design department at the Center for Creative Studies, a design institute in Detroit, said he had been unable to find a radio for his summer cottage because the clean, rectangular, Bauhaus-style designs he was looking for had given way to alarming combinations of curves and sharp edges. The prevalent design these days, "looks like Darth Vader's helmet," he said.
Where this aggression is coming from is a mystery. Designers and market researchers most commonly cite video games, with their emphasis on violence and exotic yet menacing shapes for androids, space aliens and other threats. Others point to Jung's observation that people behave worse when times are better, and suggest that the end of the cold war and the nation's economic boom have left Americans freer to explore their deepest psychological feelings, including the fear of violence.
Some designers single out the wealth of research showing that Americans remain very much afraid of crime, even though crime has actually fallen. Federal crime surveys show that violent crime dropped 22.7 percent between 1993 and 1998. Rates for other crimes have fallen even more sharply, including a 43.2 percent plunge in motor vehicle thefts. But Gallup polls since 1989 have consistently found that a majority of Americans believe that crime is worsening, although the size of that majority has shrunk over the last decade.
The trend toward playing on fears of crime is most noticeable in transportation products, Mr. Stumpf said. Powerboats are now often low, lethal-looking craft influenced by the stealth fighter's design. Bicycles have studded, off-road tires instead of racing tires. Skateboards have images of fire-breathing dragons instead of racing stripes. And tall, large sport utility vehicles have replaced sleek, low sports cars as the favorite choice of image-conscious buyers.
Archetype Discoveries Worldwide, which is based in Boca Raton, Fla., does psychological consumer researcher for many large clients, including Seagram, Procter & Gamble, DaimlerChrysler, Ford and General Motors. Dr. Clotaire Rapaille, the company's founder and chairman, contends that the United States is in some ways becoming a medieval society, in which people live and work in the modern equivalent of castles -- gated communities, apartment buildings with doormen and office buildings with guards -- and try to shield themselves while traveling between them. They do this by riding in sport utility vehicles, which look armored, and by trying to appear as intimidating as possible to potential attackers.
In a recent study for Ford, for example, Dr. Rapaille concluded that "bigger is better" by itself was not enough for sport utility vehicles. The reason the immense Ford Excursion, which is the world's largest S.U.V., was not selling well, Dr. Rapaille said, was that it didn't look menacing enough. "It's like a big, fat elephant that's a little dumb," he said.
DR. Rapaille has also been involved in the design and advertising of Chrysler's PT Cruiser, an extraordinarily popular new model that combines a minivan with a 1930's gangster-movie roadster. Customers perceive it as "Al Capone's car," Dr. Rapaille said approvingly. "The message this car gives is: 'Don't mess with me. I might have a machine gun inside.' "
This kind of research, which has revealed the consumer's desire for aggressive products, has also contributed to tension between auto marketing executives and safety engineers. The safety engineers worry that tall sport utility vehicles are more likely to roll over, more likely to override the bumpers and doorsills of lower-riding cars and more likely to blind other drivers with high-mounted headlights.
Dr. Rapaille, incidentally, only half exemplifies the results of his research. While he lives in a gated community outside New York, nary a bulked-up S.U.V. is to be found in his garage. He owns instead two Rolls-Royces and a Porsche, partly because he worries more about the danger of rolling over in a tall vehicle than he does about carnaping.
Americans may consciously or unconsciously fear crime when they go for a drive, Dr. Rapaille said, but "this is definitely not the reality, it is the perception."

HEADLINE: A Quieter Immigration Debate

 BODY:
The politics of immigration, though less prominent than in 1996 when anti-immigrant policies were ascendant in Congress, remain an important element in this year's presidential campaigns. Over the last decade, for example, California has registered one million new voters, most of them Hispanic. Next year it is expected to become the first big state where ethnic and racial minorities are the majority, a shift driven largely by new immigrants from Latin America and Asia.
So it is no surprise that Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore are making overtures to immigrant communities that may provide the swing vote in California, Texas, Florida and New York. But they are doing so in an atmosphere far calmer than in the mid-1990's, when immigrant-bashing was in vogue and Gov. Pete Wilson of California pushed successfully for Proposition 187, which prohibited illegal immigrants from attending public schools and getting social services. 
 A few years of prosperity, a tight labor market and growing activism by immigrant groups have forced a change in the political rhetoric. Increased enforcement, including a recent doubling of the size of the border patrol, has also tempered fears about an unlimited flow of illegal immigration. But there is still a need to examine whether current policies adequately meet the demand for skilled workers and humanitarian goals like family reunification.
Much of the debate in the 1990's focused unproductively on the size of legal immigration. Whether the number of people allowed in is cut by 100,000 or increased by 100,000 is not the most crucial question in a nation of 270 million. More important is whether and how the roughly 800,000 legal immigrants who come annually can join the economic mainstream once they arrive. Some immigration experts would welcome more skilled workers who can enrich the economy through their talents and tax revenues. Others would reduce the low-skilled immigrants whose presence helps drive down wages of low-skilled native workers. Cutting the total number of unskilled immigrants would probably mean reducing family-based immigration quotas, a change that would trouble Hispanic and Asian Americans.
A more politically viable approach may be to increase visas for skilled workers without cutting family quotas. Ultimately, reducing the impact on low-skilled native workers means improving their education and skills, a priority that should be met regardless of immigration policy.
Meanwhile, there are several important changes needed in existing laws that deny basic legal protections to immigrants. In 1996, Congress made it harder for asylum seekers to enter the United States. Congress also stripped the courts of their power to review arbitrary decisions by immigration officers and mandated the deportation of legal immigrants for even minor criminal offenses committed decades ago. Immigrants whose countries refuse to take them back are now locked up indefinitely in federal detention.
So far, the candidates have focused mostly on useful proposals to reform the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Mr. Gore also supports legislation to grant permanent residency to some 500,000 immigrants who have been in legal limbo since the mid-1980's. But if Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore are concerned about fairness, they should be pushing hard to repeal cruel laws that deny immigrants due process of law, impose hardships on thousands of immigrant families and make America less hospitable to asylum seekers fleeing persecution.

HEADLINE: Protesters Warm Up; Mayor Upset; Los Angeles Ready for Democrats

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 22

 BODY:
Scores of would-be protesters have bivouacked in the Malibu mountains at a training camp featuring vegetarian cooking and classes in climbing skyscrapers. The mayor has published a stern warning against violent protest and nonviolent civil disobedience, with tough talk about rubber bullets and pepper spray, stiff fines and jail. And a federal judge has ruled that the police department's initial plan to keep demonstrators fenced far away from the entrance to the Democratic National Convention was unconstitutionally restrictive.
Welcome to Los Angeles where, as usual, worlds collide. 
 Two years ago, when civic leaders fought to get their first national political convention since the Democrats nominated John F. Kennedy here in 1960, they promised it would be a chance to celebrate the city's comeback from the plagues of the early 1990's with a four-day, internationally televised fiesta of the first order. But since then, practically nothing has gone as planned and the convention, Aug. 14 to 17, is shaping up as the biggest test in years for this sprawling, congested, divided city's mettle and its perpetually searching sense of itself.
The City Council, all but 3 of whose 15 members are Democrats, has sought to block using city money to pay expected convention cost overruns, largely out of enmity for the convention's chief booster, Mayor Richard J. Riordan, a Republican whom many of them loathe. The billionaire businessmen who promised to sponsor the convention have fallen to feuding in public. And no one knows just what mischief a loosely connected confederation of protesters whose concerns range from economic globalization to capital punishment, abortion, environmental justice, homophobia, housing and campaign finance might wreak.
"The way to understand it, as one law enforcement official who I will not name told me, is like managing a week of peaceful, unlawful activity in order to keep it peaceful," said State Senator Tom Hayden of Santa Monica, the "Chicago 7" alumnus who says he finds in the protesters echoes of his 1960's radical roots. "That's the challenge. The lawlessness is in the eye of the beholder, because it will be mostly misdemeanors, like blocking traffic and crossing against the light. I think it can be managed."
City officials, mindful of the recent protests in Seattle and Washington, have been less sanguine, and they went to federal court to fight an effort by the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union to overturn the security zone around the convention site at the downtown Staples Center as impermissibly broad. This week, in a sharp rebuke, Judge Gary Feess ruled that the city's plan to seal off a 186-acre site around the convention, and keep protesters penned in a parking lot out of earshot and direct sight of the convention delegates, was unconstitutional. The judge also ruled that the city's permit application process for parades and use of public parks for protests, which requires a 40-day advance application, was unconstitutionally restrictive and vague.
Judge Feess said the security zone "burdens speech more than is necessary," but he suggested that some relatively minor modifications to the northeast corner of the zone, near the arena entrance, could satisfy his concerns. The city, the police, the Secret Service and convention planners were scrambling to come up with an acceptable alternative, to be presented to the Civil Liberties Union over the weekend and reviewed on Monday, though they warned it would require more officers.
Meantime, Mr. Riordan surprised many of his top aides and appalled convention planners 10 days ago with a sharply worded op-ed article in The Los Angeles Times that even some of the mayor's strongest supporters called a miscalculation likely to inflame the situation and rile potential demonstrators. Mr. Riordan denounced an umbrella organizing group of protesters called D2KLA as anarchists bent on violent disruption and property destruction, when in fact the group's Web site pledges nonviolence.
"Don't stick your head up and make yourself a target," said one convention planner, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "And don't get your facts wrong."
Protest groups were particularly incensed that Mr. Riordan not only vowed not to tolerate violence or vandalism but also said that "we cannot tolerate nonviolent civil disobedience, such as the blocking of access to roads or buildings," time-honored protest tactics.
"He is making a concerted effort to criminalize people of conscience, particularly the peaceful activists," said John Sellers, director of the Ruckus Society, a group based in Berkeley that co-sponsored the five-day training camp for 200 demonstrators in the Santa Monica Mountains this week. "He's making every effort to marginalize us, vilify us before we even get into town, and therefore to make it easier for us to be dismissed and brutalized in the streets of Los Angeles and to scare more everyday folks away from being out in the streets with us with their concerns."
While protesters at past conventions have been confined mainly to designated areas, such areas have usually been directly across from the convention arena, and most big city police departments, including New York's, typically try to negotiate a certain amount of permitted civil disobedience (like blocking part of a street) in exchange for avoiding greater unplanned disruptions.
But the Los Angeles Police Department has a reputation for comparative high-handedness, and several local politicians said it should have been clear from the start that the plan for keeping protesters across the street from the Staples compound, behind a 14-foot fence, with their view to the arena blocked by a parking lot full of temporary trailers and television equipment, would never pass muster. At the same time, the Los Angeles department is comparatively small, about one-third the size of New York's. Los Angeles has just 9,346 officers (including supervisors) while the convention is expected to draw 5,000 delegates, nearly 15,000 journalists and an unknown number of demonstrators.
A police spokesman, Lt. Horace Frank, said the department was confident that its planning for convention security, in progress for more than a year, would be up to the task. The department has canceled all vacations and regular days off for officers and civilian employees alike, and has worked out cooperation agreements with the county sheriff's department, in which its deputies will handle transportation security for delegates, and be available to process the arrests of protesters in the event of mass arrests. He said state officials had also assured the department of additional help if needed.
"It's been a massive endeavor, Herculean to say the least," Lieutenant Frank said. "But it's one that we feel very good about and very confident of. We recognize that the majority of protesters are legitimate groups who are going to be behaving in a legal and lawful manner, but we also know that there are those groups who are going to inject themselves and try to do harm, and we're prepared."
Mr. Hayden acknowledged that 50 to 200 protesters might actually be from anarchist groups bent on destroying property to make a point, and based on the experience at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle last year, city officials' biggest fear is that such groups might blend in with more peaceful ones and cause trouble when it is least expected.
The Secret Service was worried enough about the difficulties in securing Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles that it moved Vice President Al Gore from the Biltmore Hotel there to Century City, several miles away from the convention site. And the federal court hearing on the security zone was so crowded with demonstrators this week that even some news organizations could not get in to cover it.
For their part, Democratic Party officials and aides to Mr. Gore are having to walk a delicate line between making sure their typically fractious party is not seen as trying to stifle peaceful protests, while exercising diplomacy with a police department and local establishment whose help they need to have a successful convention.
"We feel the real action of the convention is going to be in the hall, and we're real excited about it," said Peter Ragone, speaking for the party's convention committee. "We recognize the possibility of demonstrations and protests and we're confident that the joint security team has the plans in place to deal with potential situations."
Mr. Hayden, who visited the protesters' training camp to lend moral support, said the biggest potential problem remained the city's unavoidable traffic and sprawl.
"On a normal day here, we're congested," he said. "For God's sake, the Indiana Pacers couldn't get from Santa Monica to the Staples Center in time for the first game of the playoffs. In my view, if the convention is shut down, it'll be simply because L.A. itself is this great, congested colossus and it grinds to a halt."

HEADLINE: In Azerbaijan's New World, An Old Fox Clings to Power

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: BAKU, Azerbaijan, July 21

 BODY:
At 77, President Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan is a wily veteran of Soviet politics and of the K.G.B., an 18-year leader of Communist Azerbaijan and, for the last seven years, president of the newly independent country of the same name.
He has some advice for his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin, a comparative political novice and former K.G.B. agent: deal with former Soviet republics as equals, not as client states with interests and policies subservient to those of Moscow. 
 "President Putin's program to have a closer cooperation among the countries in general is useful, but it is to be based on the principles of equality and mutual benefits," Mr. Aliyev said in an interview. "It cannot allow the hegemony of any country, including that of Russia."
Moscow's recent push to regain control of far-flung Russian regions and to recapture lost influence in former Soviet republics presents a new challenge for Mr. Aliyev, a crafty survivor of Kremlin intrigue.
Since Communism's collapse, he has sought to align his country with the West while retaining sufficient ties with Russia and managing equally delicate relations with Iran, Azerbaijan's neighbor to the south. Some Azeris fear that Iran wants to export more radical Islam to this Muslim nation while at the same time hindering development of Azerbaijan's oil and natural gas reserves.
Mr. Aliyev has been credited with bringing a measure of economic stability to this country of eight million people, particularly by forging joint ventures with Western oil companies to exploit Caspian Sea oil and gas reserves.
He also negotiated a cease-fire in the war with neighboring Armenia over the mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, although the Armenians still occupy a fifth of Azerbaijan's territory and a peace settlement remains elusive.
Critics complain that little of the promised oil wealth has trickled down to the general population, which includes a million impoverished refugees, most from the war with Armenia. Some also accuse Mr. Aliyev of stifling political dissent by keeping opposition parties weak and substituting his strong personality for lasting institutional change.
The president, blunt and confident, scoffed at such criticism in the 80-minute interview on Friday in the presidential palace overlooking dozens of aging, abandoned oil derricks. He portrayed himself as the only leader with the ability and experience to guide Azerbaijan through the transition from Communism to capitalism, at one point comparing himself to George Washington.
Rejecting concerns about his age and quadruple bypass surgery last year, he also vowed to run for re-election in 2003, though some question whether the country's Constitution allows him another term. And he sharply chided the American Congress for blocking government assistance to his country, blaming the influential Armenian-American lobby.
Under sanctions imposed by Congress in 1992, Azerbaijan cannot receive direct financial assistance or training from the United States government. Armenia, on the other hand, receives $100 million a year in American aid. The situation rankles Azeris at all levels of society and has made it more difficult to deal with the country's refugees.
"Your Congress, which likes to give lessons to the world about human rights, ignores human rights in this instance," Mr. Aliyev said.
Despite his confidence, Mr. Aliyev has difficulties at home. In the late 1990's, the capital, Baku, was awash with dreams that huge oil strikes would transform the poor country into the next Saudi Arabia or Kuwait. But those dreams have not come true, as the biggest recent oil finds have come on the other side of the Caspian in Kazakhstan. One result is a general restlessness and concern that the country placed too much reliance on oil.
"Expectations were so high a year ago, and only now are people realizing that you have to develop other sectors of the economy, too," said Haver Kambaizadeh, a former history professor who now works for a Western oil company.
Mr. Aliyev appeared aware of the disappointment, saying that his government is working to develop other parts of the economy and that 60 percent of the foreign investment in the country last year went into sectors other than energy.
But some of that increase stems from a decrease in energy-sector money. Some Western companies, in oil and other fields, have cooled on Baku recently because of concerns about Mr. Aliyev's health and the lack of a clear successor if he leaves office.
In the interview, Mr. Aliyev also seemed conscious of those fears and completely dismissive of them. He said there was no need to worry about a successor because he was confident of re-election in 2003 and insisted that stable democratic institutions would be in place well before he ends that final term. "I have great dreams, and I know a great program from 2003 to 2008," he said.
He also denigrated the ability of anyone in the current opposition to replace him, describing how the first leadership of newly independent Azerbaijan had been able to halt a civil war in 1993 only by summoning him to become president after he had fallen from favor and been relegated to his ancestral village in southern Azerbaijan.
"Everybody turned to me," he said. "I took my people out of that harsh situation."
Despite his surgery last year, Mr. Aliyev boasted that his health was excellent, and he confirmed statements by his aides that he has not taken a day off in seven years. "I will always be the president here," he said with a laugh.
He said anxieties about succession were premature because he intended to remain in office for another eight years.

HEADLINE: Josephine Martin, Healer of Rights Workers, Dies at 84

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Dr. Josephine D. Martin, a psychiatrist who helped rootless children, troubled adolescents and terrified civil rights activists in a lifelong crusade to weld the healing of personal and social wounds, died on July 6 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84.
Dr. Martin, who lived in Manhattan and East Hampton, had long battled an autoimmune disorder, her family said. 
 She became known as the unofficial doctor to the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, or more personally, "the little lady doctor from up North." She had gone to Mississippi to work with children under a precursor of the Head Start program and diagnosed their bloated stomachs as resulting from acute malnutrition. She soon found herself holding the hands of civil rights workers as they experienced daily intimidation and humiliation.
"She was just something we had never seen before," said Unita Blackwell, one of the leaders in the fight to register black voters in Mississippi in the 1960's, and now the mayor of Mayersville, Miss. "She was a white woman who was caring and loving."
As Molotov cocktails exploded on Ms. Blackwell's lawn in the Freedom Summer of 1964, Dr. Martin sent Ms. Blackwell's traumatized 7-year-old son to Vermont to attend summer camp. An abandoned New York City child she took under her wing when he was 4 is now a lawyer who will help direct a foundation to be set up in her honor.
Josephine Diaz was born in Tampa, Fla., on Dec. 31, 1915. Her father was born in Spain, became a cigar-maker, then immigrated to Tampa. When Josephine was very young, her family moved to New York City, where she attended elementary and high school.
She contracted tuberculosis as a teenager and spent two years in a sanitarium. At 19, she married a fellow patient, a social worker named Earl Martin. They worked together organizing people who had had tuberculosis to fight for better treatment.
Meanwhile, she attended several colleges. At the State University of New York in Buffalo, she was offered a scholarship to medical school, but the couple moved because of Mr. Martin's job. She eventually graduated from Hunter College.
She then worked at jobs in medical research and marine biology. Eventually, in her 30's, she entered medical school at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, borrowing and working to pay tuition.
After divorcing Mr. Martin, she married Cedric H. Belfrage, one of the founders of the leftist National Guardian. He was forced to leave the United States because of his political views, said Dr. Martin's third and last husband, Robert J. Schwartz. (Mr. Belfrage is deceased, as is Mr. Martin.)
Dr. Martin went with Mr. Belfrage to London, where she qualified to work for the National Health System; while there, she treated W.E.B. Du Bois, the sociologist and black protest leader, for a heart ailment.
Increasingly, she felt she needed to know more about patients' personal histories and living conditions. Psychiatry seemed a way to bridge the gap.
Back in New York, she entered a psychiatric residency at Bellevue Hospital and stayed on as a full-time psychiatrist working with children and adolescents. She started a day program for mentally ill youths, and, because public schools often refused to accept them, she also set up an educational program for them at Bellevue.
In 1967, after her divorce from Mr. Belfrage, she married Mr. Schwartz, a banker who had helped her with financial matters. Mr. Schwartz was also an economist who organized members of his profession to push for arms reductions. He became a leading advocate of investing in socially responsible enterprises.
"All my husbands were wonderful men, each appropriate for his time," Dr. Martin liked to say.
On July 4, 1963, she and Mr. Schwartz went to Baltimore to participate in a demonstration against an amusement park that refused to admit blacks. They spent the night in jail. On July 8, the Baltimore City Council passed an emergency resolution to set up a human rights commission to mediate the park's racial problems.
"What better way to spend the Fourth of July than to go to jail in the war for independence for millions of Americans whose freedom from tyranny did not come with the Declaration of Independence of 1776?" she wrote in the National Guardian at the time.
In 1964, Dr. Martin took an extended vacation from Bellevue to go south, where she worked in the Mississippi Child Development Center, the forerunner of Head Start. Her interest in the South dated to 1950, when she became friends with Claude Williams, a white preacher working to integrate his church in Fungo Hollow, Ala.
She quickly became involved in the civil rights movement as tensions were escalating. She contributed her medical knowledge in teaching sessions and her psychiatric skills in individual sessions with frayed and frightened campaigners.
"Some, more disturbed, under constant stress, decompensated or engaged in provocative behavior, putting themselves and others at risk," Dr. Martin wrote in an autobiographical essay. "On occasion, hospitalization became necessary."
She sent the troubled civil rights workers to Manhattan, to Gracie Square Hospital, where she had contacts, for fear of what might happen to them in Southern hospitals.
In his 1972 book, "The Making of a Black Revolutionary," James Forman wrote a personal inscription in the copy he gave Dr. Martin. It said that she "helped me to unravel many of the conflicting tendencies caused by a very active life, enabling me to bring focus and greater clarity to this head."
Mr. Schwartz said that several times Mr. Forman, a leader in the Southern struggle, would arrive at their Manhattan apartment saying it was impossible to return to Mississippi. He would consult with Dr. Martin, and "10 days later he was back again," Mr. Schwartz said.
Likening the situation to a M.A.S.H. unit, Ms. Blackwell said, "She was the doctor who was on the battleground."
Dr. Martin soon found other battlegrounds back home. Working for St. Luke's-Roosevelt, she set up an innovative home care psychiatric program for residents of welfare hotels. At the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, she worked with troubled adolescents, homeless families and others who needed help.
At the same time, she socialized in Mr. Schwartz's world of Wall Street financiers. During a pause in the conversation, she would say, "How about giving some clothing to the poor kids at Bellevue?"
Boxes would soon arrive at the hospital's door.
Dr. Martin said her life added up to simply doing the next right thing. "I had never had the notion that my role was to 'do good' or 'empower' anybody," she said, "but to be able to offer my skills as needed, to live my life as seemed right to me."

HEADLINE: Oil Riches, and Risks, in Tiny African Nation

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: MALABO, Equatorial Guinea

 BODY:
With no luck at all, the Spaniards and then the French long searched for oil in the waters around this tiny nation, half of which sits on the Central African mainland and half on an island in the Atlantic.
Then suddenly in 1996, after Spanish and French oilmen had left, the Americans struck liquid gold. The discovery was so unexpected that the State Department, in a cost-cutting measure, had closed its embassy in Equatorial Guinea several weeks earlier and had begun handling relations with this economic backwater from its embassy in neighboring Cameroon. 
 The embassy has yet to reopen, but American investments here are now estimated at nearly $5 billion. The figure would rank this obscure nation fourth in American investments in sub-Saharan Africa, behind only more familiar places like South Africa and the two oil giants, Nigeria and Angola.
"They said there was no interest and no possibility of finding oil in Equatorial Guinea," Cristobal Manana Ela, the country's minister of mines and energy, said of the earlier exploration companies. "But we were very optimistic about our geology. We knew it was logical that if Nigeria was producing, Cameroon was producing and Gabon was producing, here in Equatorial Guinea we could be producing."
Here in the capital, which is groaning under the weight of an influx of foreigners, there is heady talk of Equatorial Guinea -- population 465,000 -- becoming a Kuwait of Africa. There is also an acute awareness that the same term was applied decades ago to countries like Gabon, which despite a small population and huge oil reserves remains dependent on foreign aid because of mismanagement and corruption.
So Equatorial Guinea stands at a crossroad: significant oil production started two years ago, and it will be two more before the government's coffers begin filling with piles of cash unimaginable until now.
People in Africa and the West will watch closely what the government does with its money, and how the oil companies, especially Exxon Mobil, the main producer, operate here. The scrutiny will be greater than it has been elsewhere because Equatorial Guinea's oil production comes when governments and human rights organizations in the West have rallied around the reality that Africa's riches -- diamonds or oil -- have seldom improved the lives of average Africans and often enriched only corrupt African leaders and their Western partners. Indeed, African oil has perhaps never been as politicized as it is now, as suggested by the fierce debates about the World Bank's endorsement of a $3.7 billion pipeline between Chad and Cameroon.
In an interview, Mr. Manana, who was accompanied by Gabriel Nguema Lima, the secretary of state at the Ministry of Mines and Energy and a son of Equatorial Guinea's president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, said the government had already held a conference to examine how and why its neighbors had squandered their oil dollars, "to evaluate what to do not to have the same thing happen here."
An international development official who has been in Equatorial Guinea for three years said there had been some positive changes.
"The government and the country are much more open to the outside than when I first arrived here," the official said. "But so far there have been few positive effects on the lives of Equatorial Guineans. That has been the case for all of Central Africa. A country's natural resources are regarded as the patrimony of the head of state. We'll have to wait and see if things will be different here."
The outside interest will be a big change for Equatorial Guinea, which long remained severely isolated for a number of reasons. Its capital lies on an island connected to the mainland only by irregular flights, most of them aboard rickety second-hand Soviet-era planes. As the only sub-Saharan country to have been colonized by Spain, its Spanish-speaking citizens are surrounded by people who speak French or English.
And then its first post-independence president, Francisco Macias Nguema, ruled with a brutality comparable to that of tyrants like Idi Amin of Uganda, driving a third of the population into exile. He was overthrown in 1979 and executed by a government led by his nephew, the current president, Mr. Obiang.
Mr. Obiang cautiously opened up the country, building links to France and French-speaking African nations. But there is still little political openness, and other legacies of the country's isolation survive. In Malabo, there is not a single newsstand.
The country's leaders would have probably continued ruling quietly, unnoticed by the rest of the world, had it not been for the oil found in 1996. In 1997, gross domestic product shot up 76 percent, according to the African Development Bank, and has kept climbing by two digits since then. Today, Exxon Mobil pumps 112,000 barrels a day. A new $560 million platform started production last month, even as another American company, Triton Energy, announced a big find. Other American companies are expected to arrive this year to search in unexplored waters.
Ken Keag, the director general here of CMS Energy, a Houston oil company, described the oil companies' interest in Equatorial Guinea as intense. "It's not unreasonable to imagine Equatorial Guinea producing one barrel per person per day in a few years," Mr. Keag said, alluding to production of half a million barrels a day.
CMS Energy, which pumps a modest 9,000 barrels a day, and two other American companies are building a $420 million methanol plant here scheduled to be completed next year. As an indication of how ill prepared Equatorial Guinea was for all this new investment, the plant's builders have had to be completely self-sufficient. They have built a camp to house about 800 foreign workers because of the severe shortage of hotels and housing in Malabo; they have their own electrical power and their own fresh water filter and sewage treatment systems.
On weekdays, this city of Spanish colonial buildings now buzzes with car and pedestrian traffic. It is nothing on the level of a typical African capital but enough that every day recalls the activity seen only on payday before the oil boom.
More than anything the city buzzes with the intangible, the promise of oil and its potential benefits. "Bar Internet," said the sign on a hole in the wall here with plenty to drink but not one computer.
Only a few people in the government and the oil companies know how much money Equatorial Guinea has earned so far from oil, and they are not saying. Mr. Manana, the mines and energy minister, pointed instead to the improvements made in the last two years in Malabo: the new paved roads and a new electricity plant that provides reliable power for most residents of Malabo, whose population has topped 50,000 since the oil boom started. Before being the host for a conference of Central African nations last year, the government built a convention hall and 17 villas for visiting dignitaries.
But there are other developments the government shies away from publicizing: the new presidential wing at the airport, a shiny glass structure with a dozen parking spots that sits incongruously on the side of a simple airport made up essentially of a runway and a small building. A drive through the rich neighborhood known as Little Spain shows construction workers busy on new villas -- houses that pale in comparison with the villas of, say, Nigeria, but dwarf the shanties in the slum of Newbuil across town.
Newbuil, whose name is short for "new building," is a sprawling collection of wobbly houses jammed together beside open gutters. The neighborhood was created some four decades ago to house mostly Nigerians who had come to work on Equatorial Guinea's cacao plantations. It enjoyed a certain seedy reputation -- to describe someone as a "Newbuil girl" or "Newbuil guy" still amounts to an insult.
Newbuil's dirt streets were muddy from the rains on a recent Friday. Still, there were signs that the oil money had begun trickling down. Antennas rose from aluminum roofs, above houses in which there had been no television sets until a year or two ago. "There were no traffic lights before and now we have electricity 24 hours a day," said Nicanor Obama, 22, who was selling medication by the pill at the Botiquin drugstore in Newbuil. "It is a development that should accelerate."
But the arrival of a greater variety of goods at the main market, especially second-hand clothes with "Nike" and "Adidas" tags from Europe, had taken away business from Emil Epee, a tailor. Voicing a simmering resentment that most were still afraid to express, Mr. Epee said: "All I know is that I have to eat, and it is you who are eating our oil money. We are not eating any of this oil money. The only money I eat is from my clothes. It's our oil, but it's you Americans who are eating our oil."
Whether those feelings become more widespread will surely depend on how wide the distance between Newbuil and Little Spain becomes.
Politically, the reforms have been mixed. Most people acknowledge that years of repression have given way to greater freedom. Soldiers do not harass ordinary people as openly or frequently as they once did.
"People can walk freely," said Isabel Tonka, 25, who is a member of the Bubi ethnic group, the indigenous people of this island, which is now dominated by Bantu people from the mainland. "It is not like before. I can go to my village and come back to Malabo without hassle."
Raimundo Evemba Melenga, the director of a private publishing group, and others recalled applying for a permit to start a newspaper. The application languished for two years, Mr. Evemba said, so they submitted an application for another newspaper. To their surprise, both applications were approved by the government a few months ago.
"We have published several times since then without any government interference," Mr. Evemba said of the two newspapers, Tiempo and La Opinion, which locals and foreigners in Malabo said have been sharply critical of the government.
But opposition leaders said that in other ways the government's control had grown tighter. Before oil was discovered, the government often yielded to foreign pressure to allow some degree of political openness, said Placido Miko Abogo, the secretary general of the Convergence for Social Democracy party and the country's best-known opponent of the prevailing political order.
"Now that they have money, they don't care what the outside thinks," Mr. Miko said. "Oil has made them more arrogant, more intolerant."
The government argues that municipal elections last month, won overwhelmingly by the president's party, were free and fair. Foreign observers agreed, but pointed out there was no real political opposition.
Truly independent parties boycotted the election. Mr. Miko said others were bought by the ruling party. "There's a lot of oil money that the government can use simply to buy people off now," he said. "It's a new strategy, but the end is the same. We are returning to a situation with only one political party."

HEADLINE: U.S. RECOMMENDING STRICT NEW RULES AT NURSING HOMES

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Federal health officials have concluded that most nursing homes are understaffed to the point that patients may be endangered. For the first time, the government is recommending strict new rules that would require thousands of the homes to hire more nurses and health aides.
In a report to Congress based on eight years of exhaustive research, the Clinton administration says that understaffing has contributed to an increase in the incidence of severe bedsores, malnutrition and abnormal weight loss among nursing home residents. Many of the patients end up hospitalized for life-threatening infections, dehydration, congestive heart failure and other problems that could probably have been prevented if the homes had more employees, the report says. 
 Nursing homes with a low ratio of employees to patients are "significantly more likely to have quality-of-care problems," the study says, and "substantial increases" in staff may be required to ensure that homes do not endanger the safety or health of patients. The 200,000-word report is to be sent to Congress this month.
It recommends new federal standards to guarantee, for example, that patients receive an average of two hours of care each day from nurses' aides. It says that 54 percent of nursing homes fall below this "proposed minimum standard."
The quality of care depends not only on the number of nurses' aides, the lowest-skilled workers, who help feed and bathe patients, but also on the number of registered nurses and licensed practical nurses, who supervise the aides, the study says.
Accordingly, the report says that nursing homes should have enough registered nurses to provide at least 12 minutes a day of care to each resident, on the average. But, it says, 31 percent of nursing homes do not meet that standard.
The government emphasized that the proposed levels of staff were not the optimal levels, but the minimum needed to prevent patients from being exposed to "a substantially increased risk" of poor-quality care.
The report, from the Department of Health and Human Services, was required by a 1990 law and was originally supposed to be completed by Jan. 1, 1992. But health officials experienced many delays, and the scope of the project grew as they conducted more research and analyzed huge amounts of data from nursing homes around the country.
Federal researchers said they found that staffing levels were much higher at nonprofit nursing homes than at for-profit homes. Large nursing home chains that had financial trouble in the last two years, including chains that filed for protection under the bankruptcy law, have cut staff to control costs, the report said.
The cuts come when nursing home residents are typically sicker than in the past, with more serious disabilities. Hospitals have reduced the length of stays, releasing patients "quicker and sicker." Many people with less severe conditions, who might have gone to nursing homes 15 years ago, now receive care at home from visiting nurses and aides.
Nursing homes said it was unrealistic for the government to specify minimum levels of staff when it was providing what they called inadequate payments under Medicaid and Medicare, the programs for low-income people and those who are elderly or disabled.
In addition, nursing home executives said it was hard to attract and retain good workers in a booming economy, when the unemployment rate is at a 30-year low and other industries offer less demanding, better-paying jobs.
The American Health Care Association, a trade group for the industry, said it could not support "minimum staffing ratios" unless the government agreed to help pay the additional cost, which could total several billion dollars a year.
About 1.6 million people receive care in 17,000 nursing homes nationwide. Ninety-five percent of the homes participate in Medicaid or Medicare and are therefore subject to federal standards. But, the report says, the federal law and regulations are "too vague" to guarantee an adequate number of employees.
The law, adopted in 1987, says nursing homes must have enough staff to provide services enabling each patient to achieve "the highest practicable physical, mental and psychosocial well-being." Neither the law nor the rules indicate the minimum or appropriate numbers of employees.
Congress could amend the law, or health officials could revise the rules to set more explicit standards.
Nursing homes, like hospitals and other health care providers, are lobbying Congress to restore money cut from Medicare in 1997. Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, said he would consider earmarking some of the money to ensure that nursing homes hired additional workers.
"More than half of the nation's nursing homes don't meet a minimum benchmark for staffing," Mr. Grassley said. "That means residents don't get fed enough. They don't get turned to prevent bedsores. They end up in the hospital much more often than they should."
The report found that nursing homes with low staffing levels tended to have large numbers of residents with nutrition problems. Many frail elderly patients need help with meals but do not receive it, and their health declines, the study said.
When employees are in short supply, they often prod patients to eat faster, forcing "huge spoonfuls of food into their mouths," so the patients cough and choke, the report said.
Statistics compiled by the government show that 47 percent of nursing home residents need some assistance in eating, and 21 percent are totally dependent on assistance.
To prevent severe bedsores, also known as pressure ulcers, patients must be turned or moved every two hours, the report said, but this is unlikely to occur in homes with low numbers of nurses' aides. The sores can become infected and damage underlying muscle and bone.
The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said last year that more than one-fourth of nursing homes had deficiencies that "caused actual harm to residents or placed them at risk of death or serious injury."
Charlene A. Harrington, a professor at the School of Nursing of the University of California in San Francisco, said, "Medicare payments are calculated on the assumption that nursing homes will have certain levels of staff, but the government does not require homes to have the amount of staff they are paid for."
Nursing homes in Delaware, Maine, Alaska and Hawaii consistently have high ratios of employees to patients, the report said. Staffing levels are low in Oklahoma, Kansas and Iowa. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut fall in between.
Medicaid pays for the care of 68 percent of nursing home residents. A 1980 law required that such payments be "reasonable and adequate" to cover the costs of "efficiently and economically operated facilities." Many nursing homes invoked that law to get higher reimbursements. But in 1997, Congress repealed the law, at the behest of states, which share Medicaid costs with the federal government.
The report said that repeal of the law had put downward pressure on nursing home payment rates in some states, like Oregon.
Several nursing home chains have filed for bankruptcy protection in the last two years. They include Sun Healthcare, Vencor, Integrated Health Services and Mariner Post-Acute Network.
In 1999, the Clinton administration gave inspectors new guidance on how to determine if a home had sufficient nursing staff to meet the residents' needs. But even with this guidance, the report said, there is "no evidence" that inspectors can actually determine whether homes comply with the general federal requirement to have sufficient staff.
Inspectors are supposed to make unannounced visits to each nursing home at least once a year to assess compliance with federal standards. But, the report said, patients "report a fear of retaliation from staff or other residents" if they express concern about the staff, and employees "have also voiced the fear of losing their jobs if they discuss staffing issues with the survey team."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Convention Planners Are Searching for the Right Role for Clinton

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, July 22

 BODY:
Democrats unveiled details today for their convention intended to gently disengage Vice President Al Gore from President Clinton and establish him as an independent leader while still celebrating the Clinton policies that have helped create the longest economic boom in the nation's history.
Over four days, from Aug. 14 to 17, the convention would build gradually from heralding Mr. Clinton's record and policies to the highlights of Mr. Gore's biography to a climax on Thursday, when Mr. Gore would be nominated. 
 Drawing lessons from the 1988 Republican convention, the Democrats will have Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore make a joint appearance somewhere outside the convention location in Los Angeles to show a changing of the party's guard.
In 1988, President Reagan symbolically passed the torch of leadership to Vice President George Bush in a brief ceremony at an Air Force Base near the convention in New Orleans.
But unlike the 1988 event, the Democrats said Mr. Clinton's appearance would be substantive and extensive. Though aides want to use the convention to move Mr. Gore out of the president's shadow, Mr. Clinton remains very popular with many Democrats, and the Gore campaign does not want to appear to be shunting him to the side.
Mr. Clinton would also address the convention in prime time on the opening day, Monday, Aug. 14.
The convention's overall themes, "Progress and Prosperity" and "People, not the Powerful," have been drawn from the oratory of Mr. Gore's recent campaign appearances, where he has attacked big oil and drug companies and his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, saying Mr. Bush is beholden to special interests.
The convention would open with a focus on the nation's prosperity. Besides Mr. Clinton, the speakers would include Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for the Senate in New York.
On Tuesday, under the theme "You ain't seen nothing yet," a favorite stump line of Mr. Gore's, some of the party's most prominent leaders would talk about the important choices facing the nation.
Prime time speakers would include the Rev. Jesse Jackson and former Senator Bill Bradley. Seeking to evoke images of President John F. Kennedy, who was nominated in Los Angeles in 1960, the Democrats would also have Carolyn Kennedy Schlossberg and Senator Edward M. Kennedy speak on Tuesday night.
On Wednesday, with the theme "The Principled Fighter," the convention would begin focusing more heavily on Mr. Gore, using testimonials and videos to highlight his biography, from his time as an Army reporter in Vietnam to his work as an investigative newspaper reporter in Nashville to his years as a congressman and senator from Tennessee. "The vice president is famous but still not well known," said an adviser to Mr. Gore. "We believe that the more people learn about him, the more they like him. And I think a lot of the things we present to people that night will be new."
His running mate would also be nominated that night.
Mr. Gore would spend the first three days of the convention campaigning around the country. Because the television networks are not planning to devote much prime time coverage to the convention, the Gore campaign planned to use the vice president's off-convention events to try to pick up additional television coverage.
The vice president would arrive at the convention on Wednesday night and receive the nomination on Thursday evening. He would be introduced by his wife, Tipper.
There may also be some cameo appearances by Hollywood stars. Barbra Streisand, for one, is scheduled to sing at an event near the convention center.

Clinton Leaves Japan To Resume Mideast Talks
President Clinton cut short his meetings in Japan with leaders of the world's largest industrialized nations to return to Camp David and the search for a historic peace in the Middle East. 10 

The peace teams at the Camp David summit meeting moved into a waiting-for-President-Clinton mode as the Jewish Sabbath imposed an informal day of small group discussions. American officials did not even divulge the daily schedule. 10
 
Azerbaijan Cautions Moscow
President Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan has cautioned his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin, that he must deal with former Soviet republics as equals, not as former client states with interests and policies subservient to those of Moscow. 8
 
Pakistani Punished Further
A special anticorruption court sentenced the country's deposed prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who is already serving a life term in prison, to 14 years of hard labor, fined him $370,000, and disqualified him from politics for 21 years. 8
 
U.S. to Work with Peru
Clinton administration officials, after denunciations of Peru's recent election, say they do not have enough leverage to force a new vote and will work with President Alberto K. Fujimori while pressing for reform. 5

Serious Problems Found In Care at Nursing Homes
Federal officials say that most nursing homes are understaffed to the point that patients may be endangered. The government is recommending strict new rules that would require thousands of the homes to hire more nurses and health aides. 1
 
Drug Firms Making Deals
Brand and generic drug companies have sometimes joined hands to keep drugs off the market. The deals, which can lead to higher prices for consumers, are part of an effort to fend off competition from generics. 1
 
Bush Seeking Safe Choice
Gov. George W. Bush seems to be steering toward the safe and solid in seeking a vice president, partly because the job is increasingly seen as more than an understudy role. 1
 
Democrats have unveiled a plan for their August convention that is intended to gently disengage Vice President Al Gore from President Clinton, while still celebrating Clinton's economic policies. 19

HEADLINE: The Fight Over Tax Changes: The Marriage Penalty, and More

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
The partisan battle over tax cuts heated up in Washington last week as Republicans pushed a measure through Congress that would cut taxes for married couples and President Clinton vowed to veto it.
 The bill, which would cut taxes by $292 billion over 10 years, was packaged by Republicans as a reduction in the marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that forces many two-income couples to pay a higher tax bill than they would if they had remained single. 
 But the bill would give an election-year tax break to nearly all married couples, even those who do not pay a marriage penalty.
 A study last year by the Treasury Department found that of 51.4 million tax returns in 1999 from couples filing jointly, 24.8 million, or 48 percent, had a marriage penalty, averaging $1,141. Couples paying the penalty tend to be those in which both partners work; the penalty is most pronounced when husband and wife make about the same amount of money.
 Another 21 million couples, or 41 percent, had a marriage bonus -- that is, they paid less as a couple than they would have if they had remained single. The bonus averaged $1,274. Couples receiving a bonus tend to be those in which only one spouse works.
 "It is not really a bill targeted at the marriage penalty per se," said Clint Stretch, a tax policy analyst at Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm. "It eliminates some marriage penalties and increases some marriage bonuses."
 The bill would immediately increase the standard deduction for couples filing jointly so that it is twice the level of the deduction for single people, meaning that it would rise to $8,800 from $7,350. For couples who take the standard deduction, the change would be worth several hundred dollars a year in most cases.
 The bill would also gradually increase the amount of income covered by the 15 percent tax bracket, the lowest of the five tax brackets. For couples filing jointly, the 15 percent bracket currently ends at $43,850; under the bill, it would rise over five years to $52,500, twice the level for single filers. (The brackets are also adjusted each year for inflation.)
 Only couples who earn more than $43,850 would benefit from the expansion of the bracket. The change would be worth up to $1,100 a year to them.
 The big losers from the bill are single taxpayers. They would get nothing. RICHARD W. STEVENSON

THE MARRIAGE PENALTY -- OR BONUS
Married couples owe different amounts than they would if they were filing as singles, depending on whether one or both spouse earns an income.
 
Other Pending Tax Legislation
 
THE ESTATE TAX
STATUS OF THE LEGISLATION
Congress finished work this month on a bill that would repeal the federal estate tax, and plans to send it soon to President Clinton, who has said he will veto it. While there is little likelihood of a compromise this year, the prospects are good for a bipartisan agreement in the long run, since Democrats are also supportive of reducing the tax, especially as it applies to family-owned farms and businesses.
 
MAIN PROVISIONS
Under current law, the tax is applied only to estates valued at $675,000 or more, a level that is already scheduled to rise to $1 million by 2006. Family-owned farms and businesses are exempt up to $1.3 million. As a result, 98 percent of estates are not subject to the tax. Above the exemption levels, estates are subject to a graduated tax with a top rate of 55 percent.
 The legislation would gradually reduce estate tax rates over the next decade, and eliminate the tax entirely starting in 2010. It would reduce federal revenues by about $100 billion over the first 10 years and $750 billion in the second decade after it is fully phased in.
 
WHO IT WOULD AFFECT
Republicans have portrayed the repeal of what they call the "death tax" as a way to allow families to hold on to farms and businesses as they pass from one generation to another. Under current law, families must sometimes sell all or part of an estate to pay the tax bill. But Democrats say the big winners would be a relative handful of extremely wealthy families. In 1998, more than a fifth of all estate tax revenue came from just 374 estates.
 
PENSIONS AND RETIREMENT SAVINGS
STATUS OF THE LEGISLATION
The House has passed, with broad bipartisan support, a bill that would increase the allowable levels of tax-deductible contributions to retirement accounts and trim back the regulations that employers are subject to when they offer pension plans. The Senate is likely to take up the issue this fall. The White House is opposed to the House bill, but the issue has enough support in both parties that a compromise bill could become law this year.

MAIN PROVISIONS
The bill would increase allowable contributions to both individual retirement accounts and 401(k) programs, and would make special provisions for extra contributions from workers 50 and over. It would increase, to $5,000 from $2,000 over three years, the maximum contribution to IRA's. For people over 50, the limit would rise immediately to $5,000.
 For 401(k) plans, the maximum contribution would rise to $15,000 from $10,500 over five years. People 50 and over would be able to contribute an additional $5,000 each year above the limit. Employers would be allowed to increase their tax-deductible contributions to the plans as well.
 The bill also has provisions that would make it easier for workers to take their pensions with them when they change jobs.
 
WHO IT WOULD AFFECT
Proponents of the bill say it would help all workers save more for retirement. But critics, including Clinton administration officials, say that only relatively well off people would be able to take advantage of the higher contribution limits; only 5 percent of 401(k) plan participants, for example, make the maximum contribution now. And the critics said the bill could actually lead some employers to drop or cut back pension coverage for low- and middle-income workers.

HEADLINE: Managing Beats Money

 BODY:

To the Sports Editor:
If winning were based mainly on money, as baseball's latest economic study suggests ("Plan Would Aid Baseball's Middle Class," July 15), why are two of the teams with the most money, the Orioles and the Dodgers, at the bottom of the standings? And why does the team with the best record in baseball, the Chicago White Sox, have one of the lowest payrolls? 
 Maybe good managing beats more money. What baseball needs to become more competitive is for Joe Torre of the Yankees and Jerry Manuel of the White Sox to give management-training seminars in the off-season.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
As Travel to Cuba Grows, Limits Gain Support

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
CUBA has been off-limits for American tourists for almost 40 years, or ever since President John F. Kennedy imposed an economic embargo on the island in 1962, and each of the next seven Presidents has maintained it in varying degrees. But unless President Clinton changes his mind, the ban on United States tourist travel to Cuba is likely to be tightened sometime this summer.
The irony is that only a few months ago support for lifting the ban appeared to be growing, eroded by time and increasing exchange programs between doctors, musicians, farmers, religious delegations and athletes. 
 In addition, American farmers are eager to export their products to Cuba, while airlines, hotel companies, tour operators and cruise ships want a share of the island's growing tourist business, which until now has gone mainly to Canada, Spain and Italy. Even the book industry signaled its belief that the ban would be lifted when within the past few weeks Fodor's, the Rough Guides and Michelin's new Neos imprint each published guidebooks to Cuba.
In the wake of this apparent groundswell, bills were introduced in both the House and Senate to make it easier for U.S. citizens to travel to Cuba, including one bill that would have allowed unrestricted travel and ended Washington's authority to regulate financial transactions involving such travel. The latter provision was aimed at that portion of the existing Treasury Department regulation that does not formally prohibit American tourists from visiting Cuba but bars them from spending any money once there.
But late last month the House of Representatives agreed to a compromise that would ease some restrictions on sales of food and medicine to Cuba, in return for writing into law the existing policy regulating travel to the island. President Clinton said he would be "inclined" to sign the bill.
Meanwhile, travel from the United States to Cuba continues to increase. While an undetermined number of American tourists enter from Canada, Mexico, the Bahamas and other countries, others go as members of cultural, educational, humanitarian or religious groups, which are allowed in with few restrictions on regularly scheduled charter flights from New York, Miami and Los Angeles.
According to Cuba's Tourism Ministry, the 1.6 million visitors to Cuba last year included 165,000 Americans, 100,000 of them naturalized Americans who were born in Cuba (still considered by Havana to be Cuban citizens). Canadian tourists accounted for 17 percent of the total, Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain together accounted for about 55 percent.
Among the Americans who visited Cuba last year was Jaimie Plog of Mill Valley, Calif., who together with a friend flew from San Francisco to Mexico City where they obtained visas, which were stamped after they arrived at the airport in Havana. As they often do to protect Americans who arrive from third countries, Cuban immigration authorities did not stamp their passports, and on their return home both women passed through United States immigration without a hitch. In the interim they spent two and a half weeks on the island "hiking, scuba diving, riding horses and, at night, dancing the merengue," Ms. Plog said.
Meanwhile, several entrepreneurs say they have figured out how to take American tourists to Cuba without running afoul of United States law. Last month, for example, the Valtur Prima, a 550-passenger Italian cruise ship, departed on the first of its weekly cruises from Montego Bay, Jamaica, to Havana with American tourists who booked through travel agents in Canada or Jamaica. (American travel agents are forbidden to book cruises to Cuba.) While in Cuba -- two days in Havana and a day at the beach on the Isle of Youth -- Valtur Prima officials arranged for all shore excursions to be "hosted" by a Canadian nonprofit foundation, thereby assuring that American passengers were within the law. Another ship, the 400-passenger Habana, is set to depart Nassau on Nov. 16 on the first of year-round four- and five-day cruises to Havana, but its strategy is somewhat different.
"An American company couldn't do it under U.S. law," said Sam Blyth, the Canadian travel agent who has chartered the Greek-owned ship (and who is the North American booking agent for the Valtur Prima). "And if foreign-owned ships got to Cuba, they wouldn't be allowed to dock in the U.S. for six months." But Mr. Blyth said that La Habana's cruises had been structured to comply with United States regulations, including not just the largess of the Canadian foundation but also shipboard lectures on Cuban culture and politics.
If the proposed ban does become law, it remains to be seen what if any effect it will have on visits by educational, cultural and humanitarian groups. In the meantime, Americans who qualify to travel to Cuba need a valid passport, visa and a license from the Department of the Treasury. Additional information, including Cuban regulations governing visitors, is available at the following Web sites: travel.state.gov/cuba .html; www.state.gov/www/regions/wha/ cuba/travel.html and www.treas.gov/ofac.

HEADLINE: Clinton Hurries To Returnto Camp David

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: NAGO, Japan, Sunday, July 23

 BODY:
Turning from what has become anannual ritual the gathering of leaders of the largest industrialized nations -- President Clinton today shaved short his meetings here to plunge back into the fervid search for peace in the Middle East.
The president left at midday and was scheduled to arrive at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington by late afternoon Eastern time, then board a helicopter for Camp David. 
 Mr. Clinton, who arrived in Japan on Friday, a day late, from the Camp David summit meeting with the leaders of Israel and the Palestinians, received several briefings a day on their continuing talks with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, administration officials said. They said he heeded advice from aides, however, to avoid making calls from Japan to either Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel or the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat.
An optimistic Mr. Clinton said before departing today that negotiators were making headway in his absence. "Whether we get an agreement or not, they have tried," the president said. "They have really been out there working."
The president left Okinawa half a day early, after meeting Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, to rejoin the talks at Camp David this evening, said the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart.
Mr. Clinton is attending his last summit meeting with the leaders of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Canada, Japan and Russia. American diplomats said the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, had impressed the group in his debut at this venue, displaying alacrity and a lack of the ebullience associated with his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin.
With no history to be made thousands of miles from Camp David and no crises to distract them, the leaders aired issues that have traditionally taken a secondary place at the annual gathering, and released a declaration focusing on the importance of getting the developing world hooked up with the Internet.
Participants said that in discussions that often resembled philosophical discourses the leaders also pondered the human genome, infectious diseases and rain forests, reaching common ground that will be reflected in a joint statement to be released later today.
The president announced a $300 million initiative to provide school lunches to students in developing countries, which he said would not only boost nutrition but also improve attendance and performance.
 In contrast to previous summit meetings, overshadowed by crises such as fighting in the Balkans or the financial crisis in Asia, "there was not one major problem we needed to address," Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada said on Sunday. Therefore, he added, "you will see a list of subjects addressed in the communique."
Lael Brainard, President Clinton's adviser on international economic issues, said Okinawa "is shaping up as the development summit."
The leaders' new-found concern with what has become known as the "digital divide" -- between those who are part of the new computer-driven economy and those who are not -- found little sympathy from critics in nongovernmental groups that seek less sophisticated aid to the developing world.
Activists with Jubilee 2000, an organization pushing for debt relief, burned a laptop computer outside the news media center. "We can't eat computers," said Kewesi Owusu, the group's African coordinator. "People are dying."
Seth Amgot, a spokesman for Oxfam, the British charity with extensive operations in the poor countries of the world, said: "The Internet is going to have to wait until the electricity grid is extended, the phone grid is extended and more kids learn to read. The private sector is handling this computer revolution pretty well on its own."
The leaders said they would create what they called a "dot force" -- or digital opportunity task force -- to marshal public and private resources to bring the computer revolution to poorer nations.
The leaders cited statistics showing that of the estimated 332 million people who use the Internet, fewer than 1 percent live in Africa. Part of the problem is just telephone lines. The developed world has about 50 phone lines per 100 people compared with 1.4 phones in poorer countries.
The leaders also agreed in principle to revive World Trade Organization negotiations on starting another round of global trade talks by the end of this year. But they remained at odds on the details of the next round. Disagreements over that round -- principally between the United States and Europe, but also between the developed world and poorer nations -- proved so divisive at the world trade meeting in Seattle last year that it collapsed in discord.
The leaders here also discussed the importance of good health to a nation's economy and vowed to help the developing world combat infectious diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Japan led the way with $3 billion to fight diseases in poor countries, along with a $15 billion aid package to help countries take advantage of the computer age.
During a one-on-one meeting with Mr. Clinton, however, Mr. Putin gave up no ground when the president scolded the Russian in one exchange for not respecting press freedom. But Mr. Putin brought smiles to the faces of the American delegation when he told them about his visit to North Korea, en route to Japan, and the striking similarities with the Soviet Union of Stalinist times. North Korea's economic state, Mr. Putin reportedly said, reminded him of the Soviet Union in the 1950's. Mr. Putin said that a million North Koreans had turned out to see him, noting that some probably did not volunteer.
Most of the declarations and agreements came in the form of general commitments with no dollar figures attached. Mr. Blair tried to solicit funds to relieve the debt of poor nations but, in their final statement the leaders will instead restate their intention to carry out a pact they reached at their meeting last year in Cologne, Germany.

HEADLINE: CAREER ARC;
So You Want to Become a Corporate Director

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
CORPORATE boards aren't what they used to be.
The average length of tenure is dropping and turnover is rising. More seats are going to outside directors. Chief executives are joining fewer boards, the better to focus attention on the ones they choose. 
 This evolution, over the last decade, has made boards better at dispensing tough, objective advice, governance experts say, and may even be playing a role in American companies' current run of success.
But the changes also mean that there are many more opportunities than before to become a director for the first time -- if you can catch the eye of a recruiter or a nominating committee.
"In the past, boards mainly found new members through their existing members," said Peter D. Crist, the vice chairman of Korn/Ferry International, the executive search firm, who spends about half his time filling directorships. "We've tended to move away from that model, although it certainly still occurs."
Still, the competition is tough. The valuable career-building experience of serving on a board, not to mention the prestige, stock options and other perquisites that come with a director's seat, attract many more interested people than there are openings.
Experts say executives can take a number of specific steps to improve their chances. Some are obvious -- like adding overseas experience or a successfully executed Internet strategy to a resume. Others are more subtle.
Following are some strategies that management experts suggest for getting your name among the most promising candidates.
SET THE STAGE -- Most companies, and virtually all large ones, want their directors to have experience running something big -- a company, a division, a business unit -- of their own. Executives do not usually reach this level, generally executive vice president or chief financial officer, until their 40's or later. But recruiters say up-and-comers in their 30's can take steps now to help themselves in the future.
In the early 1990's, Ilene S. Gordon, then in her late 30's, was a rising executive in Chicago. She had put in some time at Boston Consulting Group, but most of her experience was in the packaging industry. "I wanted to get on a board to be exposed to broader issues," Ms. Gordon said.
So she did what she could to get noticed. She joined the Economic Club of Chicago and volunteered for the membership committee, allowing her to meet many local executives. She also signed up with two networking groups for women and, later, became a director of a hospital in Evanston, Ill.
Today, Ms. Gordon serves on two corporate boards -- at A. J. Gallagher and United Stationers -- and has completed terms at three others.
Executives recruiters say her approach -- working hard to meet people outside her company and joining the board of a nonprofit organization -- are among the most effective strategies for aspiring directors.
Nonprofit groups are often eager for advice, and may be more willing than a corporation to name a younger manager who is enthusiastic about the group's mission. A stint on a nonprofit's board yields a sense of how boards function in general and a chance to meet other director-level executives.
PUT YOUR NETWORK TO WORK -- The chief executive of almost every big company in the country receives stacks of board invitations but turns most of them down. But a growing number of bosses take advantage of the requests to refer their lieutenants for board seats.
Some are even more proactive. John Hawkins, a recruiter at Russell Reynolds, a search firm, says he has received calls in recent months from three chairmen, asking him to meet with high-ranking executives at their companies and size them up for directorships.
More than friendship is involved: the chairmen hope that their proteges will learn from executives at other companies and become stronger potential chief executives, Mr. Hawkins said.
The message for aspiring board members is clear: If the chance presents itself, tell your boss that you think that joining an outside board could make you more effective at your own job. Few bosses are likely to be put off by this, because most were once in the same position. "I felt it was important, to prepare myself to be C.E.O., to have the experience of being on an outside board," said Sidney Taurel, the chief executive of Eli Lilly, who is now on the boards of ITT and McGraw-Hill.
It also makes sense to let an executive recruiter know about your interest. But an unsolicited letter is not usually the most effective strategy, recruiters say. "I get letters every day, and I read them," Mr. Crist said. "But clearly, as you can imagine, if someone is introduced to me by a friend or someone I respect, I'm going to pay attention to that."
Karen Osar was the treasurer of Tenneco in 1997 when, during a performance review, the chief financial officer told her that joining a board would be an important way to broaden her experience, she said. Ms. Osar then called a recruiter she knew and expressed her interest. The recruiter set up a breakfast for her in New York with a colleague of his who specializes in board searches -- Mr. Hawkins. Within a year, Mr. Hawkins had connected her with Allergan, the pharmaceuticals company, which made her a director. Ms. Osar is now the chief financial officer of Westvaco, a packaging company.
SEE FIRSTHAND, AND BE SEEN -- One of the best ways for executives to learn how boards work -- and, in turn, to become attractive candidates -- is to get in front of the board at their own companies, recruiters say.
"C.E.O.'s want to know that whoever's coming on their board understands the dynamic," said Andrea Reynolds, a managing director at Russell Reynolds. That means leaping at any assignment that might result in a presentation to directors.
If all goes well, the experience may lead to an invitation to join another board -- on which one of your own company's directors already serves. At the least, the experience adds an important credential to a dossier, recruiters said.
But nothing beats actually serving on a board, and management experts say small companies can provide the ideal initial directorship for many executives. "At some point, you have to do your starter-upper board," Mr. Crist said.
Such a board, he said, lets a new director have an immediate effect by providing a perspective not previously represented.
KNOW WHAT YOU WANT -- Once elected to a first board, an executive should forswear other board assignments for a few years, recruiters said.
Being a productive director typically requires more than 150 hours a year, on top of one's day job. New directors should devote their energy exclusively to the first company that trusts them with a director's chair (unless lightning strikes and Ford or Coca-Cola calls).
When Judith A. Sprieser became the chief financial officer of Sara Lee six years ago, she was already on the board of a much smaller manufacturing company. Her promotion led to a flood of new board offers, she said, but she turned them down, choosing to focus on her new job and to wait for an invitation from a company that was similar in size.
"It was hard, because there were a lot of very, very interesting companies," said Ms. Sprieser, who last week became the chief executive of Transora.com, a business-to-business exchange for the food industry. But the forbearance paid off last year, she said, when she received an offer to serve on the board of Allstate -- which brings in more revenue than Sara Lee and is also based in Chicago, minimizing the travel time away from her family.
DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE BASICS -- Executives can increase their odds of board selection in many ways, but recruiters say the most important is also the most obvious: "The best way to get on a board is to do your job," said Ted Jadick, a managing partner in the board practice of Heidrick & Struggles in New York.
Mr. Crist added: "Just do exactly what you're paid to do exceedingly well. You will be found. I guarantee it."
A sense of serenity can help, too. The selection process for almost any board is complex and carefully calibrated, having as much to do with the group's current makeup as with the credentials of the candidates.
"One of the keys here is, be patient," Mr. Hawkins said. An executive may rise to president or chief financial officer of his company, he added, but his selection to an outside board "may not happen even in the first year."
"It's very quirky," he said.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Death, Taxes And Letting The Heirs Foot the Bill

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
AMERICANS should not be taxed when they die," declared Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, just before the House voted last month to end what opponents of the estate tax call the "death tax."
"The ancient Egyptians built elaborate fortresses and tunnels and even posted guards at tombs to stop grave robbers," he added. "In today's America, we call that estate planning." 
 Not a bad line, but what about the living? Should someone be able to inherit, say, $10 million without paying any tax on it? If you cash in $10 million in stock options from starting a new company, you face a federal tax bill of as much as $2 million on the capital gains. And someone who gets a $10 million paycheck for starring in a movie or pitching for the Yankees probably pays a tax of nearly $4 million. Where's the logic in treating these people differently?
There isn't any, argues William Gale, a senior fellow at the moderately liberal Brookings Institution in Washington, who recommends that the United States replace the estate tax with a true inheritance tax, or what he calls a "transfer" tax. This distinction is not just semantics.
"The estate tax raises all kinds of emotional arguments about the tax collector reaching into the grave," Mr. Gale said. "But if you think broadly about the tax system, it makes sense to tax all sources of income consistently. Ideally, a transfer of wealth, whenever it occurs, should be treated the same as any other source of income," with taxes on it payable by the recipient.
That's not the way the estate tax works. Today, when a wealthy person dies, his estate pays a tax on the value in excess of $675,000, an amount that is scheduled to rise gradually to $1 million by 2006. Family-owned businesses and farms are exempt up to $1.3 million. Above those limits, estates are subject to a graduated tax, with a top rate of 55 percent.
In a politically popular move, both houses of Congress have voted to eliminate the estate tax within 10 years. Lawmakers rejected a White House proposal simply to raise the exemption for family businesses and farms. For the moment, nothing is likely to change, since President Clinton has said he will veto the repeal bill.
But many economists contend that a true inheritance tax -- introduced as part of a broader overhaul aimed at simplifying the whole income tax system, closing loopholes and reducing rates as much as possible -- looks like a better approach than either of the alternatives currently on the table. Large transfers of wealth would be treated like other sources of income, with all the recipients paying taxes on their bequests at rates similar to those imposed on wages, interest and dividends. By broadening the tax base, rates could be lower, too. In the case of ongoing businesses, Mr. Gale recommends a method to make the payments more manageable.
In fact, the United States is one of only three major countries -- Britain and New Zealand are the others -- that rely solely on the estate tax to tax transfers of wealth. Most others use inheritance taxes or some combination of the two.
IT is interesting as well that some of the most thoughtful supply-siders -- those who worry that high marginal tax rates discourage work and savings -- are not necessarily opposed to inheritance taxes.
"The estate tax is a very inefficient tax," says Alan Reynolds, director of economic research at the Hudson Institute in Washington. "It's a major source of complexity, and the truth is that it is fairly easy to avoid. An inheritance tax, at a low rate and allowing for income averaging, avoids many of its problems."
Defenders of the existing estate tax argue that repeal would simply be a gift to those who deserve it least. And in a political system where there are many competing claims by far needier people, it would be.
Moreover, keeping the estate tax provides a powerful extra incentive for wealthy people to give to charity or set up foundations, helping to soften the harsher edges of a capitalist system that has rewarded them so handsomely.
But its critics have a point, too. At the top rates, a dollar of earned income left in a taxable estate yields only about 27 cents for heirs. That may encourage some high-income professionals and executives, argues Martin Feldstein, a conservative economist at Harvard, "to retire early or simply to work less, save less and take less investment risk," creating less wealth for society as a whole.
So why not impose a more reasonable tax -- on the heirs? Then they might decide to go out and pull their weight, too.

HEADLINE: American Megamillionaire Gets Russki Space Heap!

BYLINE: By Elizabeth Weil; Elizabeth Weil is working on a book about the Roton rocket.

 BODY:
This is a story about wealth and space and America and Russia, and it begins with one man, Walter Anderson -- a man with white hair and pale skin, square, gold-rimmed glasses and a physical presence so profoundly unprepossessing it's almost impossible to remember what he looks like. Anderson is 46 and worth almost a billion dollars. He lives in Washington -- the city he grew up in, a city he hates; his hatred of the government is, as he puts it, "personal" -- in an apartment adorned with a painting he commissioned based on a Smashing Pumpkins lyric, "I am still just a rat in a cage." "That's what we are," Anderson explains, "rats in a cage. And we're going to gnaw through the bars because we've got about a 30-year window here, and we'll starve if we don't get out." The cage Anderson refers to is the planet earth itself, and he has taken it upon himself to ensure we get off. In 1989, Anderson gave $80,000 to finance the International Space University; in 1991, $100,000 to found the Space Frontier Foundation; in 1994, $5 million to start the Foundation for the International Nongovernmental Development of Space; and between 1996 and 1999, $40 million to build the Roton, a manned, reusable spaceship. Then a few months ago, in one of his eriodic calls to me, he rang me up: "I'm in Russia!" Anderson was midway through three days of talks with Yuri Semyonov, president of the private Russian space corporation Energia, and in a move that would later marginalize NASA from the Anderson-Russia-America love triangle, he was arranging for a new company, called MirCorp, to lease the space station Mir.
It was not an act of open defiance. In most ways it was an act of trust, devotion and faith. Anderson had been dreaming of leaving Earth since he was a little boy. He wired the Russians $7 million before he even signed Mir's lease. Anderson put up $31 million toward the lease, which will eventually cost $200 million a year. It will give MirCorp the rights to Mir for the remainder of its lifetime, the use of two or three manned Soyuz rockets annually, as well as two or three unmanned Progress rockets, the exclusive control over Mir's visitors and technologies, 40 days of active operation and the privilege of fixing Mir up. All of this has put Anderson more cozily into bed financially with Energia, thereby creating a situation highly threatening to NASA. The American space agency, after all, was already embroiled with the Russians in the way-over-schedule, way-over-budget, politically Pollyanna-ish International Space Station, a project that was announced 17 years ago under President Ronald Reagan, that had already incurred several Congressional hearings and that space patriots in Washington were determined to make "the only space in space." Specifically, at the time Anderson leased Mir, NASA was blaming the Russians for being two years behind in launching the service module, or living quarters, for the International Space Station. (It was finally launched on July 11.) Worse, rumor had it among space experts that NASA could not technically complete the International Space Station without Russian help. And many inside the agency feared that the Russians would lose interest in the International Space Station altogether if they kept their own space station up. 
 A less brusque man than Anderson might have chosen to sweet-talk and pacify the NASA brass out of their TKTK. But Anderson, arrogant in such matters, is, as he terms himself, an anarcho-capitalist. He flies around the world in his private jet pledging allegiance first and foremost to the laws of GATT. Thus instead of calling NASA, Anderson called his friend Chirinjeev "Baboo" Kathuria, a 35-year-old megamillionaire Sikh. Kathuria told Anderson that he, too, was "interested" in Mir, which in megamillionaire-speak meant he was willing to chip in $4 million, to form MirCorp, and start upending last century's notions of relations in space.
On a Friday evening late in March, Anderson and I sit on the dully plush mezzanine of the American Hotel in Amsterdam, prepping for the coffeehouses, where Anderson likes to smoke and cavort with disaffected world youth. I first met Anderson two years ago while researching a book on the Roton spacecraft. Among his first words to me were, "Please don't make me famous." But by the spring of the year 2000, he has invited me to interview him over the course of a weekend in Holland, the Tuesday after which he'll launch the world's first privately financed manned mission off Earth. The following Thursday the two professional Russian cosmonauts he has hired will enter Mir to see if it can be repaired.
Already I know that MirCorp is registered in Bermuda, run out of Amsterdam and structured as a 40-60 partnership with the space corporation Energia (38 percent of which is owned by the Russian government). I know Anderson's plans include rehabbing the station and expanding its volume to 9 or 10 times its present size. I know he wants to sell joy rides on Mir to wealthy individuals (Dennis Tito, a 59-year-old money manager and former rocket engineer, is the first to sign on, planning to spend 10 days on Mir sometime early next year) and advertising on Mir to commercial companies ("we'll paint it up like a Nascar"). Anderson expects to offer access to Mir equipment to corporations and governments and to sell intellectual rights on Mir's considerable patents so that, as Anderson puts it optimistically, "NASA won't be able to build so much as an air lock without paying MirCorp something first." Eventually he intends to move into even more dubious but potentially lucrative markets, like in-orbit satellite assembly and satellite repair. I do not know if Anderson's vision amounts to a dream or a pipe dream, a gift or a curse. For certain, he harbors a taste for grand, most likely fantastical, visions. Once at a space conference he'd underwritten, Anderson told me he believed that more than half the American space shuttle missions carry classified cargo. "If I discover dirty satellites, nuclear wearpons in orbit," he then said with a giddy grin, "am I going to pretend they're not there? No."
Anderson is loose-limbed and gangly, with an oddly unused-looking body. He favors black jeans, casual short-sleeve shirts, suede sport coats and slippers. Ever distrustful of his fellow men, he zealously guards his personal privacy; his name is not on the marquis of his office in Washington, and neither are the names of his companies. If you take the elevator to the fifth floor, none of the people milling around the cubicles will have any idea who he is. In the alternative space underground, which Anderson has bankrolled pretty much singlehandedly, he's known for being dystopic, generous, ruthless, overimpassioned, incisive, philanthropic, libertarian and shy -- by those who know him at all.
Now, in Amsterdam, as he uncomfortably shifts his weight on a stiff leather couch, he informs me, blunt as ever, that he'd rather not talk about his personal history, that his professional history should suffice. Namely, that in 1979 he was one of the first 300 employees at MCI; that in 1984, he founded Mid Atlantic Telecom, a regional long-distance carrier, the first to integrate phone and voicemail service; and that 10 years later, he started Esprit Telecom Group, cracking into the newly regulated European market. That same year he used $6.2 million from the sale of MidAtlantic to seed a Bahamas-based holding company called Gold & Appel, named after the Golden Apple, the second volume in the 1970's, sex-and-conspiracy-theory cult pulp trilogy, "The Illuminatus! Trilogy." He has more or less doubled his capital every year since. In 1998, Anderson sold Esprit for $1 billion in stock and assumed debt. He presumed he'd need all that money to build rockets and space colonies.
"Now with this Mir thing," Anderson says, tapping the tips of his fingers together, "if it works, it's such a nice shortcut."
I ask if it won't make NASA extremely nervous -- a lone, superwealthy uber-citizen challenging its authority and dominance in space?
Anderson slips on his suede jacket -- apparently we're to head out to the clubs. "In my life," he says, his eyes lighting up like a teenager's, "if the U.S. government doesn't try to kill me, I probably won't have succeeded in meeting my long-term goals."
Among spacers -- the polite name for space obsessives -- such sentiments are not uncommon. Anderson was 4 when Sputnik flew, 15 when Neil Armstrong first stepped on the moon, 19 when Eugene Cernan left the last moon-dusted boot mark. And he still seems not to have fully recovered from the magic of those memories, from the implicit, now-broken promise that someday soon we will all be living in the heavens, shouldering power packs and wearing jumpsuits in a better, higher, lighter world. Anderson's space talk is still infused with statements that sound vaguely like clubhouse rules. ("I'm not saying it's fair, but I've been thinking a lot about human rights in space, and in my space station, people would all be peaceful or I'd throw them out the air lock.") His peers include men with Ph.D.'s from M.I.T. who have a hard time holding down jobs. One in particular, a man obsessed with the "Star Trek" -like "Babylon 5" remains haunted by a grandmother who shushed him to sleep early on the night of the Apollo 17 landing, telling him he had school tomorrow, and, anyway, we'd be landing on the moon every day when he grew up. Other spacers gather for dinner in Beverly Hills annually on June 20, the anniversary of the first moon landing. For their ritual meal, they borrow the form of the Passover Seder, only instead of commemorating the Jews fleeing the bonds of slavery in ancient Egypt, they celebrate human beings escaping the bonds of gravity here on Earth.
A few hours later, in the basement of a cramped milk bar called Bulldog, Anderson sets into exalting his latest love interest: the 14-year-old, 130-ton, third-generation Soviet space station Mir, designed to orbit only five years, now spinning almost a decade beyond its expected life. The station suffers many nicknames -- the porcupine, the dragonfly -- most referring to its ungainly assortment of modules and solar arrays. Inside, it's sorely in need of remodeling. For the past 10 years, the station has been beset by significant money problems. As early as 1992, top Russian officials were comparing their own space program to a chicken: "You cut off its head, and it runs around the yard for a while thinking it's still alive." Then, in the late 1990's, Mir suffered a string of high-profile, high-altitude disasters -- a collision, a fire, several massive computer shutdowns -- troubles so vast and so economically intimidating that Energia's president, Semyonov, decided to deorbit his outpost and call his final crew in. NASA, ever covetous of Russian resources for the International Space Station, waxed ecstatic. That is, until in a move that the chairman of the House Science Committee would call "a real kick in the jaw," Anderson flew in his jet to Moscow to meet with Semyonov, playing the board game Risk on the way. Among the first things Anderson said to Semyonov was, "I don't necessarily agree with the views of my government." Walt hunches his shoulders, looks thrilled. "Isn't that crazy?," he asks.
Anderson's first foray into the commercial space sector proved a huge debacle. He financed the development and construction of what he hoped would be the first generation of privately financed manned space transports: the Roton rocket, a vehicle initially conceived to be 65 feet tall and shaped like an upturned egg. When complete, the Roton was to be the world's first single-stage-to-orbit, fully reusable rocket. But when the project ended, Anderson had instead spent $40 million on the oddest, tallest helicopter on earth. In its last flight test, the Roton flew 1,400 yards down a runway in Mojave, Calif., at a speed of 53 miles per hour and an altitude of 75 feet.
Anderson's second foray, MirCorp, seems to be going better, thanks largely to his decision to handle MirCorp "like a business," something almost all other private space companies neglect to do. (Anderson's Roton has at least half a dozen rivals, but the dreaminess required to attempt space travel without military-industrial backing, and the discipline required to pull it off, appear to be intrinsically at odds.) To make MirCorp run efficiently, Anderson joined forces with a newcomer to the space world, his fellow telecom tycoon Baboo Kathuria, who, when I meet him the next day at noon for a cheeseburger lunch, is wearing a bright red turban and goofy print shirt. Kathuria has just flown in from Chicago, where he has been staying with his parents, sleeping in the same bed he slept in as a teenage boy. His eyes are so wide they're almost round. His long beard is tacked to his chin with bobby pins.
As he picks through his fries, Kathuria starts to giggle, his voice growing high and airy and soft. "Mir is definitely a real business," he says, "definitely undervalued," and "definitely cool." By his own estimation, cooler than his turban and his beard. Also much cooler than anything in the telecom business, which he fell into when he had a crush on the heiress to a Filipino telecom fortune and tried to impress her by privatizing India's phones.
Despite, or perhaps because of, their business successes, neither Anderson nor Kathuria seems to have much lasting luck with women. Ever reticent about personal matters, Anderson insists he's "just having too much fun" and isn't "mature enough yet to marry." Kathuria, however, the consummate sidekick, desperately wants to discuss his problems with girls. The situation has grown kind of dire in that he's already too old to advertise for an arranged marriage in the Indian newspapers: Sikh tycoon with lease on Mir seeks to marry same? After lunch -- in the brief window before Kathuria will ingest his second cheeseburger of the day, this one with Anderson at Burger King, over which the two men will commit to invest in Mir another 10 million bucks -- Kathuria and I walk along the canals to the Van Gogh Museum, and Kathuria tells me about the time he sat in a limo outside the Miss Universe contest in Trinidad with Donald Trump, who was making out with a 23-year-old woman, and Evander Holyfield, who wanted to borrow Kathuria's "hat." In the galleries, he explains that his mother has been hinting that he should get married. The sound of his cell phone ringing, the sound of his bachelor life, is beginning to drive her nuts.
As for Anderson, he finally allows his patina to crack just slightly on our last night in Amsterdam. We're sitting at a hipster bar with no name on the front -Anderson, uncharacteristically, wearing a flashy, star-speckled blue silk shirt -- when, in his own bellicose way, he decides to open up. He begins with a rather jaundiced prelude, calling Donald Trump "a weenie," claiming Trump doesn't even own his buildings and that he'd be a richer man today if he'd just left his daddy's money in the bank. Next Anderson insists that he could be as famous as Trump or Richard Branson if he only hired bodyguards and a New York P.R. firm. Then, once that's aired, Anderson settles down. Amid the house music and velour, he admits he feels "lucky to have the space thing right now" because it's "kind of important and challenging," and it saves him from "all the pretentious bull that rich people get involved in," and from "flying around on the plane, getting very depressed." He also reveals that when he was a child his father worked for the top-secret National Security Agency, and that he hasn't spoken to his father in 25 years. He will not discuss what, if anything, any of this has to do with leasing a space station.
In the morning Kathuria and I will fly to Moscow for MirCorp's first launch. If the launch succeeds, and if the subsequent docking succeeds, Anderson will be the first private citizen to send two men into space. If the launch fails, or if the docking fails, this hotheaded recluse, this financial angel in a star-speckled shirt, will be the first private citizen to send two cosmonauts to their graves.
Moscow, early April, is gray and in a state of flux, with the new Ikea out by the airport and the new mall under the Kremlin, with the spring warmth turning the vast landscape to mud and the articles, daily, in the papers about what kind of leader Putin will be. According to the Russian philosopher Grigori Pomerants, his country has slipped into "a state of mass disorientation" since the collapse of the Soviet empire. MirCorp's presence here, surely, does not help. Anderson's company comes with its fat wallets, its precocious grandmasters of capitalism, buying at deep discount the detritus of the space race, the Soviet Union, the cold war.
On the surface, the situation sounds like the setup for a joke: So there's a Sikh and an anarcho-capitalist and they want to buy a space station* . Underneath, the situation is equally gonzo. After arriving in Moscow, Kathuria and I drive to the nearby factory town of Korolev, where we will watch, via monitor, the launch of the cosmonaut-carrying Soyuz rocket and then, two days, later the docking of that rocket to Mir. Anderson is not with us -- he had wanted to fly to the Kazakhstan launch site to witness the liftoff itself, but the Russian government refused to give him clearance because of the war in Chechnya. So he flew from Amsterdam to France.
The launch goes off without a hitch. Kathuria spends 48 hours muttering repeatedly and almost semiconsciously, "This is definitely not telecom, definitely not for the faint of heart." Meanwhile, he negotiates with Energia in Energia's austere, heatless "international building" -- a square, pale, brick box with no front door, no lobby, no ornamentation -- an international building only possible to design if the architect never imagined foreign guests. Not so long ago, these same rooms housed debates about missile capability and Iron Curtain strategy so geopolitically intense that they sent schoolchildren across America scurrying under their desks during bomb drills. These days, agenda items include wiring Mir as an Internet portal and co-producing a prime-time television show, a sort of "Who Wants to Go to Outer Space?," to run for one season, following a dozen or so hopefuls through cosmonaut training, one being eliminated each week.
Had Anderson not amassed nearly a billion-dollar fortune from an offshore holding company or had he not nurtured a libertarian obsession with government evil, you might wonder if he knows what he is doing. But Anderson, a 21st-century antihero, clearly knows how to manipulate economic arrangements to produce the effects he wants. Thus you have to assume it's by design that the Russians sound swoony and triumphant about the MirCorp deal ("Investment not so good from their part," a chief Energia officer gloats, suggesting he outmaneuvered Anderson) while Daniel Goldin, the NASA administrator, sounds defensive, embarrassed and left out. "My feelings are bruised. I have a hurt," Goldin uncorks in a particularly effusive moment from his office in Washington. "I'm not saying MirCorp shouldn't have done what they did. I'm just saying I'm in the book, they've got my number and it might have been nice if they called."
Goldin, who speaks in a thick Brooklyn accent, sounds conflicted and disrespected, like a sidelined mafioso. Conflicted because, theoretically at least, he favors space commercialization. "Competition is great!" rings one of his mantras. Under Goldin's watch, NASA has contracted out some $3 billion annually with fledgling space businesses (Anderson refused to accept such funds on the Roton project, and he would refuse to accept them for Mir).
At the same time, however, his lumbering bureaucracy has burned through, almost literally, some $60 billion on the International Space Station. In 1999, NASA suffered one of its worst years ever, losing two robotic Mars landers. Newt Gingrich credited Goldin with making "space as boring as possible." The Economist magazine dubbed the International Space Station "the black hole in the sky." Thus Goldin is sincere in saying, "If MirCorp can finance Mir and get an unsubsidized positive cash flow, I think that's fabulous!" He is also deeply humiliated to have to explain to Congress why (a) he lacks the clout to force the Russians to abandon Mir and meet their International Space Station milestones, and (b) a certain international financier is able to negotiate far better prices with the Russians than he is.
"I'm not saying that money is being diverted," Goldin protests, intimating that the Russians may be siphoning money from the International Space Station and dumping them into Mir. "I'm just saying the arithmetic doesn't add up. I read in the papers that private United States investors paid $20 million for six weeks of operation of the Mir space station, a Soyuz vehicle, a Progress vehicle. They got the operations center. They got the training. And now I understand they're going to get another flight up there? The Russians charged us, last year" -- on an International Space Station-related matter -- $65 million for one Soyuz vehicle! $135 million for two! I'm just saying that it's frustrating, year after year, when the Russian government doesn't give us any vehicles to work with. So like I said, I have some bruised feelings. And the arithmetic! I'm confused."
In Korolev, the morning of the docking, television crews trail muddy tracks as they push through the command-and-control center's drab marble foyer. Everyone's in a hurry -- who are these rich investors? -- and no one is wiping his feet. Upstairs, the control room proper resembles an aging 1950's college lecture hall -- rows of concentric half-circles, a projection screen up front. Old men fill the back landing, clasping hands and taking pictures. The engineers and cosmonauts of years past are on hand: Boris Chertok, 89 years old, who commanded the first space docking ever; Sergei Krikalev, still young and mustached, who in 1991 orbited overhead in Mir while the Soviet Union dissolved below, asking, "Is it true that Russia is going to sell the Mir space station, together with us?" All have seen communism, perestroika and failed capitalism; all regard Anderson's impassioned, impertinent largess with irresolute, blank stares.
Nearly 200 miles above it all, two men careering at 18,000 miles an hour are trying to catch a decrepit space station doing the same. Below, we watch, onscreen, the spinning earth captured in the cross hairs of the docking portal. The image is haunting -- it speaks of power -- and causes you to wonder where Anderson is right now. Presumably he's making money on phones in France. Or perhaps he's in Spain, pursuing another of his far-out ventures, like the thermo-protected rocket-powered space skydivingsuit a friend of his is trying to build. (Anderson hopes to take dives from Mir.) It's hard to say. In part because nobody has a cell-phone number that works for him in Europe. In part because Anderson's cleft personality is hard to resolve. The devil in Anderson, it seems, is trying to get back at his father's government. Still, his spacefaring impulse seems to come from a pure, even childlike, place.
Fortunately, the docking itself provides only minor excitement -- a bounce off the portal, a switch from automatic to manual, before the cosmonauts finally lock in. But immediately afterwards Semyonov treats the crowd of old-timers and reporters to one of the boldest gestures in the history of human space flight: he officially hands Mir's reins to MirCorp. Everyone laughs aloud with Semyonov at the indignities of age and the perpetual rise of the young. Not heard, however, are the inward nervous twitters, for this is a transition not simply from one generation to the next or from one political philosophy to another, but from a world order based on governments to one based on wealth, from an old-school Soviet comrade to an anarchic supercitizen, a man who feels himself alienated from his family, his peers, his country, his planet; a man who, because of a certain facility for making money, has the power to effect relations on a geopolitical scale.
The effects of such a new world order, if in fact it comes to pass, will not be known for quite some time. Meanwhile, in the coming months, MirCorp will send Dennis Tito, its first "citizen-explorer," into orbit. Energia will provide Tito with rocket transportation and cosmonaut training, while NASA, on the sidelines, will continue feeling bruised and hurt, continue its public kvetching, continue exerting pressure on Putin to dump his old bag into the sea. (Goldin recently offered the Russian $100 million in space contracts, contingent on deorbiting Mir.) The Mir love triangle is inherently unstable, as love triangles always are. Anderson and Semyonov jilted Uncle Sam.
Shortly after the docking, Kathuria, as Anderson's proxy, finds himself enveloped in a pack of elder Energia statesmen and, to consummate their union, is shepherded into the control room built for the International Space Station. There, among never-used consoles and shrink-wrapped chairs, everyone eats smoked salmon and caviar and hoists shots of Standard vodka. Everyone watches as MirCorp's cosmonauts float through Mir's hatch, unfurl the blue-and-white MirCorp sign and thank MirCorp very much. Semyonov toasts his new sugar daddies -- the people who trusted us" -- and rebuffs his old flame, NASA: "You closed the door on us, you slime. You closed the door in our face." Anderson's absence feels enigmatic, awkward. I do not speak to him for almost a week. And when I do, he offers only a single word, a simple, affectless adjective, to describe how he feels about his new space liaison, how he feels about sending two cosmonauts to orbit, challenging Russian-America relations and perhaps challenging relations between governments and their wealthiest citizens for quite some time. That word deciphers nothing of his personal and political motives. He says, plainly and abstrusely, that he's "happy."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 5, 2000, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 23 about the venture capitalist Walter Anderson and his attempts to lease the Mir space station for private use misstated his personal wealth. It is about $4 million, according to Anderson, not almost $1 billion, a figure that confused Anderson's personal wealth and the value of Gold & Appel, a fund he manages. Anderson says the fund is actually worth about $400 million. The article also misattributed the ownership of a jet Anderson uses. It is partly owned by Gold & Appel, and not by him. The article referred erroneously to an aspect of his passion for privacy: his company Entree International is indeed named on the marquee of a Washington office building. The article misstated the date of the Russian launching of living quarters for the International Space Station. It was July 12, not July 11. Anderson approached The Times about the errors late in August. This correction was delayed by the need for new reporting and interviews with Anderson.

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
In Italy, a Long Tradition of Homegrown Hip-Hop

BYLINE: By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO; Elisabetta Povoledo is a researcher in the Rome bureau of The New York Times who writes about Italian culture.

DATELINE: MONTEVARCHI, Italy

 BODY:
THEY could have been poster boys for the inevitability of globalization. In shapeless T-shirts, baggy pants and baseball caps turned backward, Gazza, Nehon, Zaion.e and Dr. Snot would have passed unnoticed at any American hip-hop gathering. Except this wasn't New York (or Los Angeles) but a small market town 30 miles south of Florence, better known for its 18th-century churches (one with a reliquary said to contain the sacred milk of the Virgin Mary) and its temples to consumerism (a Prada outlet) than for its breakbeats.
They had come to take part in a three-day conference on hip-hop from the Italian diaspora, organized by Joseph Sciorra of the John D. Calandra Italian American Institute at Queens College. Italian rappers and those of Italian origin from around the world met to discuss and debate the finer points of their art, their concerns and aspirations. 
 Though the hip-hop community of Montevarchi and nearby Terranuova Bracciolini is tiny -- Dr. Snot (Beniamino Brogi), a 17-year-old local M.C., says it numbers about nine people -- the town was in many ways an ideal site for the conference. For Montevarchi is home to Libero Vietti, one of the few remaining poets of ottava rima, a 13th-century form in which stanzas have 8 lines of 11 syllables in a rhyme scheme of abababcc. Ottava rima is the standard form for epic and narrative verse in Italy (Boccaccio, Ludovico, Ariosto and Torquato Tasso) and has also been used in competitions. In its competitive form, in which two poets improvise verses selected by the public, some argue it is a sort of precursor of rap.
"This is the land of the ottava rima, and this is something you should think about," Lorenzo Brusci, an organizer of the conference, told an audience of about 50 on the first day. "It's a form that depends on rhythm and texts where you can go for hours improvising rhymes. Try to see how the technique works."
Ottava rima is a highly polished and structured form that, in its present version, sounds more like a modulated singsong than a rap. But the idea that a tradition with roots in medieval Tuscany relates to a genre rooted in modern New York throws into relief an essential element of Italian rap: as a re-examination of local oral traditions, it has revived the use of dialects in music. Indeed, Italy's vibrant hip-hop scene is less a confirmation of the supremacy of American exports than proof of the popularity of homegrown offerings.
Since their earliest days in the 1970's, hip-hop culture and rap music have built up a global following. Today it is possible to turn on the radio just about anywhere in the world -- TransRap, the "home of global hip-hop," provides information on the music in 167 countries on its Web site -- to hear Hindi rap, Japanese rap or Cherokee rap. There's even a hip-hop band, Nuuk Posse, which raps in Inuit.
The earliest Italian rap, which developed throughout the 1980's, was for the most part a direct emulation of what was happening in the Bronx. "Most of us, when we started, imitated Americans and we all rapped in English," acknowledged Ice One (Sebastiano Ruocco), one of the most respected Italian rappers and the producer of many hip-hop groups. "Then came a sort of Italianese, an imitation of English, that modified the words. But then we became aware of our own language. And we began to understand Italian sounds."
The repudiation of English as rap's lingua franca began about 10 years ago as the mostly underground Italian hip-hop scene developed in distinct and isolated communities. In this context, it was natural for dialects, which had not been used in popular music for years, to be embraced in many areas, especially in the South. Nearly 50 percent of all Italians still speak in dialect, at least within the family, and the musicality of most dialects adapted well to the rhyme and cadence of rap.
"We want to speak to young people, and rap is the most direct way of getting to them," said Polo (Alberto Cretara), the 28-year-old M.C. of La Famiglia, a Neapolitan hip-hop group. "Neapolitan is what I speak every day, and I rap about everyday things. Our songs present our reality; we aren't trying to be American."
At first, Italian rappers mostly addressed contemporary social issues like the Mafia, government corruption (the rise of hip-hop coincided with the fall of the ruling party that had governed Italy for nearly 50 years), immigration, heroin addiction, homelessness and the high unemployment rates in the South. The militancy of the songs varied, finding hard-core spokesmen in the so-called "centri sociali," political aggregations of squatters occupying derelict buildings throughout Italy. Hip-hop groups with battle-cry names like Assalti Frontali (Frontal Attack) and AK 47 dominated that scene, which competed with an even more underground movement that chose to follow a less political, more stylistic, path.
But with few exceptions, the political activism has been short lived. Goffredo Plastino, who teaches ethno-musicology at the University of Bari, argues that the novelty of Italian hip-hop is that it has no ties to Italian musicality and the tradition of the canzone italiana (Italian song), whose mellifluous lyricism easily lends itself to love songs. He contends, however, that as Italian rap broadened its appeal to become increasingly profitable, social protest was progressively abandoned in favor of more conventional subjects, like love. It was an indication that even hip-hop cannot resist the intrusion of Italian melody.
"The reality is that the Italian music industry pushes everyone in one direction until you get the same formula as the Italian song," Mr. Plastino said. "As it becomes more Italian, rap will be finished."
Such a fate is unlikely as long as rappers continue to investigate their deeply rooted musical traditions. "Italian rock, which dominated the 1970's and 80's, was an ugly copy of American rock," said Pierfrancesco Pacoda, a hip-hop producer and the author of two books on Italian rap. "While in hip-hop, Italy rediscovered its own originality."
In the 1993 song "Fight da Faida" ("Fight the Feud"), Frankie Hi Nrg MC (Francesco di Gesu), one of the country's best-selling hip-hop artists, decried the Mafia's stranglehold over southern Italy. "It's the eve of a revolution against the voice of the Godfather," he raps. "But today Don Vito Corleone is much closer. He is seated in Parliament." The song ends with an 18th-century Sicilian filastrocca (nonsense rhyme) sung by Frankie's cousin, Vabbina La Bruna, whose quick-fire staccato delivery of the filastrocca easily fits with Frankie's rap.
"I used to sing it with my friends when we were children," he said. "Just listen to the meter, to the rhythm of the filastrocca; it sounds just like a rap. I learned it from my grandmother. It was the first rap I ever heard; I was 5."
SUD SOUND SYSTEM, a group from the Salentine peninsula in Apulia, plays a reggae-inflected rap hybrid known as "tarantamuffin." It is a music that draws on an old local tradition in which musicians once performed songs to heal those who had been bitten by tranatulas. The rhythm of this healing music, also known as pizzica, passes like an undercurrent through the songs of the Sud Sound System.
Sha-One (Paolo Romano), another of La Famiglia's M.C.'s, says his group has absorbed many elements of Neapolitan culture, in particular the songs of the musicians, known as posteggiatori, who traveled from town to town spreading different words and idioms. In the song "Odyssey" he mentions the siren Parthenope, whose name is linked to the mythological origins of Naples. "I sing you this sonnet that is taken from the portrait of a goddess," he raps. "You have to believe me Parthenope is more beautiful than Venus."
He also points to the animated gestures of the Neapolitan comic Toto (Antonio de Curtis), who died in 1967 but is still celebrated as the archetype of southern Italian comedy. "Just watch an American rapper and how he moves onstage," he said, "and tell me if he doesn't look Neapolitan."
The hip-hop scene in Montevarchi, as well as that of most of Tuscany, is perhaps less lively than that of Naples or the rest of Italy. Still, Tuscany is a natural cradle for rap, as competitions in ottava rim depend on the same skills of improvisation and verbal dexterity that mark a good rapper. Ottava rima competitions have taken place since the 18th century, and until the late 1970's there were few Tuscan town festivities that did not include them. The Italian actor Roberto Benigni mastered the technique as a teenager. Yet today the practice has almost disappeared and is being kept alive by a handful of poets like Mr. Vietti.
In his red T-shirt and blue Nike baseball cap, Mr. Vietti, 74, could pass for a rapper (at least from the back), though he concedes that he knows little about the genre. He is more concerned with the disappearance of the ottava rima competitions, which he says is a result of rural flight and an increased dependence on television. Nonetheless, he says he would be more than willing to teach a youngster the tricks of his trade.
"I can't believe that in the year 2000, there isn't someone from around here with the brains and the gift of nature needed to improvise," he said, shaking his head. "They can rap, but I guess if a young person doesn't hear the ottava rima canto, they'll never learn to improvise it."
Gazza (Daniel Zaganelli), 17, an M.C. from Montevarchi, acknowledges that he has never seen an ottava rima competition. "Sure, we shouldn't ignore our tradition," he said. "It was a good thing that already existed here, but we're too young to know about it and, besides, it's different from what we do."

HEADLINE: NEW ECONOMY;
While the public's concern over online privacy seems to be pervasive, nuances -- and contradictions -- abound.

BYLINE: By Tim Race 

 BODY:
THE public cares deeply about electronic privacy. And so the federal government sued to try to stop the bankrupt e-tailer Toysmart.com from selling customer data the company collected online.
The public cares intensely about electronic privacy. And so civil liberties and privacy rights groups oppose an F.B.I. e-mail surveillance technology called Carnivore. 
 The public cares passionately about electronic privacy. And so people have been flocking to the Web version of CBS's voyeuristic social psychology experiment, "Big Brother" (www.bigbrother2000.com).
Online, it seems, privacy is in the eye of the beholder. That's why the public debate over electronic privacy can get so confusing. Whose privacy? Protected from whom?
If there is any consistency in this debate it may be the assumption that what people want most is freedom of choice:
*Freedom to be left alone;
*Freedom to gawk at others;
*Freedom to use a technique known as "opting in" when it comes to allowing commercial Web sites to collect personal data about oneself;
*Freedom to use a technique known as "kicking out" when it comes to William or Jordan or Karen or any of the other exhibitionists in the "Big Brother" house the public deems displeasing to the Webcam's unblinking eye.
But oh, the contradictions.
It often seems, for example, that the most outspoken electronic privacy rights advocates are among the most technically adept -- presumably because the real techies understand just how powerful the Internet's data-gathering capabilities can be.
So why, then, are some of the most technically adept people willing to take on even potentially broader privacy risks than the perils of receiving e-mail and surfing the Web? Think, for instance, of people adept enough to use Napster or Gnutella or various other software programs that let people swap digital music or other media files over the Internet.
So far, the debate over file sharing has focused on copyright issues. The critics, including the Recording Industry Association of America, which is suing to shut Napster down, say that too many of those music files are swapped with too little regard to copyrights.
But services like Napster also involve latent privacy issues. To use one of these services means -- draw the shade and lock the door -- giving total strangers access to your own computer's hard drive. If it is true that even a few of those strangers have few scruples about copyright law, is there any reason -- besides thieves' honor -- to expect them to limit their foraging to the earmarked music files on someone else's PC?
Of course, Napster employs safeguards and partitions meant to prevent such unauthorized snooping. But the technically adept -- including a computer security expert named Mark Seiden, a hacker known as DT and some Napster users on the Napster.com software forum where I posted a query on this subject -- acknowledged some risk. The Napster users, though, generally dismissed hacker intrusions as a cause for worry.
One Napster user, going by the screen name spyrl, described the Zone Alarm firewall software he had installed to protect his computer from intruders. He also noted that "so far there have been no known cases of people hacking through Napster and I am not going to let the idea of it give me paranoia."
Spyrl, who in a follow-up e-mail exchange identified himself as 15-year-old Clint Johnson of North Myrtle Beach, S.C., added, "I do not have sensitive files on my computer, because if they are that important I would print them out and delete them."
BlinkyWillis -- the forum screen name for James Willis, a retired auto parts salesman in a Portland, Ore., suburb -- wrote that the four people in his household share a computer for their Internet access. This machine is not linked to their individual personal computers. "I do not think we are unusual in our not conducting personal business (or at least leaving no record) on our Internet connection computer," Mr. Willis wrote in a subsequent e-mail message. "We presume that individuals and institutions are accessing the information on our hard drives."
Using a separate computer for Internet access was a common theme on the Napster.com forum. (See? The technologically rich really are different from you and me.)
A Napster.com forum member using the online name Drakonix also reported using firewall software, adding that "the computer which has the physical connection to internet also has no sensitive or irreplaceable files." As for Napster, "I suppose there is still some chance that it could be exploited," Drakonix wrote, "but it is doubtful that Napster user systems would serve useful purpose as targets."
In the view of these techies, then, using Napster presents only theoretical privacy risks. But for most people, the risk of an online merchant's stealing one's identity or the F.B.I.'s subsuming one's digital soul is probably only theoretical, too, right?
So is there really much difference among the theoretical privacy risks? Plenty, according to Mr. Seiden, the computer security expert.
"In the case of choosing to supply any service to the world, like Napster, it's your own choice to do so, and you can calculate the risk and reward," said Mr. Seiden, chief consultant at Securify, a network security consulting firm in Palo Alto, Calif. "In the case of corporate spyware and the government, you are unaware of what they're doing until some reverse-engineering whistle-blower embarrasses the offenders. Meanwhile, they might have been watching you for years."
If "Big Brother" is a social psychology experiment about privacy and group dynamics, so is that big, diverse group house known as the Internet.
"There probably are real differences among people in the extent to which they are willing to entrust private information to others," writes Anthony G. Greenwald, a social psychology professor the University of Washington, who has used the Web to conduct experiments among volunteers.
"Because some are more trusting than others," Mr. Greenwald said via e-mail, "there should be a segmentable market for things that will attract the more trusting (online shopping, music via Napster, opening messages that may contain viruses).
"And there is also a market for things that appeal to the less trusting (alarm systems, unlisted phone numbers, etc.). We have an unattractive name for those who seem to live in excessive fear of attacks on their person or identity -- paranoid -- but I don't know of a name for the opposite."
Let's see. How about the name William? Or Jordan? Or Karen?

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY: The Real Foundation Of the Software World;
Behind-the-Scenes Programmers Are Bricklayers of Internet Economy

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Gazing out at the nearly 7,000 software developers assembled in Orlando two weeks ago, William H. Gates recalled how much things had changed since his company, Microsoft, was founded in 1975. Back then, he said, there were fewer people in the software industry than had gathered that morning in the cavernous convention center. "It was a tiny, tiny business," recalled Mr. Gates, Microsoft's chairman.
Software, to be sure, is a big business today. But in many ways, it once again has the up-for-grabs feel of the early days of the personal computer industry, before Microsoft became the dominant force. And that is why big companies like Microsoft, I.B.M., Oracle and Sun Microsystems are spending so much time, energy and money these days trying to woo outside programmers. 
 "It's nice to be in demand, and in a satisfying profession that has turned out to be fairly lucrative," observed Basim Kadhim, a 29-year-old programmer who telecommutes from Bend, Ore., to Silicon Valley.
The corporate campaigns are a sign that the industry is entering "a disruptive new era of opportunity in software," according to Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a technology research firm.
The opportunity lies in building all the software needed to make the promise of Internet commerce a reality. So far, e-commerce is in its infancy, rarely going beyond browsing the Web and executing some rudimentary transaction, like buying books online or ordering office supplies on an in-house corporate Web site. And the information is still typed by hand on a computer keyboard.
But for software developers like Mr. Kadhim, the goal is to help build a far smarter Internet, where most exchanges of information would be automated. Before long, for example, information from the purchasing department of a carmaker might be shuttled automatically to and from the accounting department of a parts supplier. Most steps in a transaction would be computer-to-computer communication, eliminating mounds of paperwork and hours of human toil.
Or a person's cell phone or Palm-like device might be able to automatically match his calendar with the doctor's schedule, suggesting times for a check-up. Thousands of similar labor-saving uses will add up to the next generation of e-commerce, representing the real payoff from the Internet -- both in terms of personal convenience and economic productivity.
Software will make it happen. And most of the work will be done not by engineers at the big software houses like Microsoft, I.B.M. and Oracle, but by the 80 percent of programmers who labor, often in relative obscurity, at old-line companies, Web site contractors, computer consultants and elsewhere.
Such programmers are in demand because they are the ones who write all the handcrafted software programs that keep the nation's computer-dependent economy running. And many thousands of them now face the task of bringing brick-and-mortar businesses into the future. They are the bricklayers of the Internet economy.
This army of behind-the-scenes programmers will largely determine who the big software winners will be in this, the Internet era of computing.
Today, companies that include Microsoft, I.B.M., Sun, Oracle, BEA, Hewlett-Packard and others are scrambling to establish their software tools and technology as "platforms," or environments, in which large numbers of programmers will want to develop software applications for the Web. The stakes are high. The market for such e-commerce platform software, according to some analysts' projections, could grow to as much as $100 billion over the next decade.
No one expects any single supplier to become as powerful as Microsoft has been in personal computing, because Internet computing is such a diverse milieu, with many of the key technology standards in the public domain. But the PC era proved the importance of attracting developers. Today, many technologists still believe Apple's Macintosh and I.B.M.'s OS/2 were better operating systems than Microsoft's Windows. But Microsoft lured far more developers to write applications for Windows.
"A platform is an ecosystem," noted Charles Fitzgerald, director of business development in the developer division at Microsoft. "And there are a few thousand people at Microsoft whose job it is to help developers."
Microsoft plans to spend $2 billion over the next three years on the tools and training to help software developers build Web applications using Microsoft technology. I.B.M. also puts a $2 billion price tag on its three-year Internet software initiative intended to lure developers to its camp. Other companies are also spending heavily to win over developers.
"Software developers are a hot commodity today, and they increasingly drive platform decisions within companies," explained Valerie Olague, who is leading the I.B.M. program. "We can only be successful if we attract developers."
As a group, the developers seem beyond the reach of conventional salesmanship. They are the kind of people who cultivate deep intellectual interests in particular fields like Japanese animation and science fiction, according to research done for I.B.M. by Renegade, a marketing firm. They share the mindset that drives a person to stay up all night to solve the puzzle of a few buggy lines of programming code.
Certainly, at industry events, developers want to do more than drink and dance. So I.B.M. is sponsoring gatherings in cities including New York, Seattle and San Francisco, which feature talks by renowned Internet programmers and team coding contests with hand-held computers as prizes.
There is no hard sell. The goal is primarily to prompt the developers to go to I.B.M.'s Web site, because increasingly, company Web sites and specialist sites like Slashdot ("News for Nerds") are where developers hang out, exchange tips and download software to try out.
Developers seem most impressed by the simple beauty of code that works. At the Microsoft Developers Conference in Orlando recently, the crowd yawned when Microsoft executives talked of the company's Internet vision. They clapped politely for the slick videos and chuckled at the early morning warm-up routine of the comedian Richard Jeni, who began, "I couldn't be more excited to be here if I knew what you guys did for a living."
But the rousing applause came for a string of programming code, written partly in the hot new Internet standard, XML -- for Extensible Markup Language -- that was projected onto giant blue screens and performed precisely as it was supposed to.
Software programming is problem solving, and developers tend to gravitate to the technology that is the most useful for the task at hand. The young developer from Oregon, Mr. Kadhim, speaks of the appeal of software as a kind of infinitely malleable medium for technical artistry. "You get a rush when you build something and make it work," he said. "It's like cracking a puzzle."
Mr. Kadhim has a Ph.D. in computer science, and he is fluent in programming languages including Basic, Cobol, C, C++, Java and Linux. He calls himself a "Linux lover," referring to a version of the Unix operating system that is distributed free over the Internet and is regarded as a threat to Microsoft's Windows.
Yet in January, Mr. Kadhim joined Fujitsu Software, which makes specialized software tools for Cobol programmers. And he was in Orlando at the Microsoft conference, demonstrating how some of Microsoft's new technology can bring applications written in Cobol, a 40-year-old programming language still widely used in business, onto the Web.
 "I'm doing this because it's a challenging software engineering problem -- how do you bring so much of the old world into the future?" he said. "So far, most of the Web development amounts to toy applications, interesting but not yet hooked to the core of our economy. And Cobol, whether you like it or not, is at the heart of our economy."
In New York, Elaine Power manages a group of two dozen programmers at Organic, a Web site builder and consultant. Ms. Power, 36, got a taste for computers as a teenager in Britain when she wrote a program in BASIC, a simple programming language, that sent a digital ball bouncing around the screen of her brother's personal computer. The fascination was enough to prompt her to major in computer science in college and eventually learn computer languages ranging from Fortran to Java.
Most of the young engineers she works with today program in Java, an Internet programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. They see it as the programming language of the moment, and a skill of the future. "Programmers can be very religious about their platform and their tools," Ms. Power said.
But experienced programmers tend to value flexibility rather than religion because the field moves so quickly. In the 1960's, after all, Cobol was the hot programming language, the skill of the future.
"Being a good programmer is a lot like being a good carpenter," said Tim Howes, chief technology officer of Loudcloud, a start-up founded by Mr. Howes and three other former executives of Netscape, the Internet pioneer. "You should have a breadth of knowledge and know when to use the appropriate tool -- when to use your hammer, your saw and your screw driver."
Today, many companies are using a variety of tools when building Web applications rather than becoming overly dependent on any single technology supplier.
Last year, a group of longtime Silicon Valley software developers founded Liquidprice, a reverse-auction Web service, which allows electronics retailers and auto dealers to bid for the business of individual consumers on the basis of where they live and what products they want. To run the service, Liquidprice, based in Cupertino, Calif., deploys a smorgasbord of software -- Oracle for the database, Microsoft for its Web servers, Java as its main programming language, and I.B.M.'s Websphere as the development environment for its specialized Web applications.
At each tier, says Piyush Gupta, the president and co-founder, the company has insured that it can quickly switch to other suppliers. The trickiest one to abandon would presumably be its Web development software, Websphere. Still, it is a tentative win indeed for I.B.M. in the emerging market for Web development software. Liquidprice engineers have written a thin layer of code intended to isolate the company's in-house applications from the I.B.M. software.
 "The day Websphere doesn't satisfy me, we'll switch," Mr. Gupta said. "For the smart developers, the world of being locked in to any one software vendor is over."

Deutsche Telekom In Deal For Voicestream Wireless
Despite the likelihood of regulatory hurdles, Germany's largest telephone company, Deutsche Telekom, is expected to announce today that it has agreed to acquire VoiceStream Wireless for $50.7 billion.
The agreement represents the first time a company that is controlled by a foreign government has tried to buy a United States phone operator and will be closely watched as a test case for whether the government will allow other such deals in the future. Page A1.
 
Radio Host Seeks to Keep Sponsors
Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the conservative radio host who has been the target of a nationwide protest by gay groups, has begun a counter-offensive intended to retain her advertisers. The show has lost 12 brands, or nearly 10 percent, of its national advertisers. C2. 

Clark Switches Stance on Microsoft
Jim Clark, the founder of Netscape Communications, surprised a group of Internet executives last week when he said that he had bought a million shares of Microsoft stock and opposed the government's plan to break up the company. Mr. Clark, of course, played a role in convincing the Justice Department to bring the antitrust suit in the first place. What Mr. Clark did not tell the executives was where he got the money to buy the Microsoft shares: Earlier this year, he sold the America Online stock that he had received when that company bought Netscape last year. AOL's subsequent deal to buy Time Warner turned him off, he said in an interview. C4.
 
When Privacy and Voyeurism Collide
The public cares about electronic privacy, so the government sued to try to stop Toysmart.com from selling customer data; civil liberties and privacy rights groups oppose an F.B.I. e-mail surveillance technology; and people have been flocking to the Web version of CBS's voyeuristic show, "Big Brother." Online, it seems, privacy is in the eye of the beholder. That's why the debate over electronic privacy can get so confusing. New Economy. C4.
 
Network executives for CBS and Fox, expressing concern about the risks of putting contestants with uncertain backgrounds on prime-time "reality" shows, said they were considering changes in the selection process. C8.
 
Coordinating Customer Service
When buying goods, customers naturally think they are dealing with one company, whether they give their credit card to a store clerk, a catalog representative or a Web site. And they expect to be able to get help from any of those sources, no matter where they made a purchase. Some companies have recently begun synchronizing their catalog, Web and retail operations, which they hope will yield not only better customer service but higher profits.

O. J. Simpson Appearance Canceled
Barbara Walters has canceled an appearance by O. J. Simpson scheduled for Wednesday on "The View," a syndicated daytime discussion program, after being deluged with protests from viewers and members of the program's staff.

Fiscal Irresponsibility

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
There is a disturbing, almost willfully irresponsible quality to the giddy rush by politicians to enact huge federal tax cuts without regard to how much of the projected surpluses are real, and with little or no debate about other, better ways in which some of that money might be used.
It's as if very little was learned during those long years of wandering in the debilitating environs of big budget deficits. Now surpluses are blossoming in the midst of a campaign season and the politicians seem determined to devour them with immediate and mindless tax cuts. 
 Forget about taking steps to shore up the nation's infrastructure, or clean up the environment, or do something real about the sorry state of public education, or poverty, or the millions who lack health insurance.
Forget about any of the complex issues that deserve to be debated and that would require some substantial amount of federal financial support. Big tax cuts are on the table, and even bigger tax cuts are being promised. And once these monster cuts become law there'll be very little left for investment in a sounder American future.
According to Congressional Budget Office projections released last week, the non-Social Security surpluses over the next 10 years will be about $2.2 trillion. But that figure is wildly unrealistic. It would be reduced sharply by any slowdown in the economy, and it assumes non-entitlement spending, including defense spending, will grow no faster than the rate of inflation -- a phenomenon that no sane person in Washington would believe.
Analysts at the respected Center on Budget and Policy Priorities have come up with estimates that fit more comfortably with the real world. They noted that when you set aside that portion of the projected surpluses that come from the Medicare trust fund (which, like Social Security, should remain off limits, according to officials from both parties); and when you look realistically at spending already committed to by the White House and Congress; and when you take into account some of the non-Social Security money that most agree will be needed to help shore up the Social Security retirement system -- when you take all of that into account, the surplus available over the next decade falls to just $700 billion or so.
That's the amount that would be available for tax cuts and new spending. If you wanted to improve the schools, or help cover the uninsured, or offer a prescription drug benefit, or whatever -- you'd have to pay for it out of that $700 billion or so, after you deduct whatever tax cuts come out of that same $700 billion.
Candidates from both parties have been less than responsible on this issue. But the Republicans, especially, have gone way over the top.
To get a sense of how dizzily out of whack things have become, all you have to do is consider that George W. Bush's proposed tax cut is $1.3 trillion. There is no way the non-Social Security surpluses projected over the next decade would be able to cover tax cuts of that magnitude.
Tax cut bills passed or about to be passed in this session of Congress (some face a presidential veto) would reduce government revenues by $730 billion over the next 10 years. Not only are the tax cuts being pushed by the G.O.P. excessive, they are in many cases "backloaded," which is to say written in such a way that the biggest portion of the cuts occur after some years have passed. So the proposed elimination of the estate tax, for example, would result in a loss of $100 billion in revenue over the first 10 years, but more than $500 billion over the second 10 years.
This is insidious. We are manufacturing rather than solving problems for subsequent generations.
Modest, affordable tax cuts are fine. But what's more important as the United States enjoys this best of economic times is to take the opportunity to engage some of the big problems we've put off for years because we didn't have the money to deal with them.
There are Americans who, despite the unprecedented prosperity, still are not being paid an honest dollar for a day's work, who still are without health insurance, who still are not receiving a quality education.
Now would be a good time to start bringing them into the prosperous mainstream.

HEADLINE: The Moral Sense in Estate Tax Repeal

BYLINE: By Alan Wolfe; Alan Wolfe is director of the Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College and is the author of "One Nation, After All."

DATELINE: CHESTNUT HILL, Mass.

 BODY:
Since the supply-side revolution of the Reagan years, the Republican Party has vigorously advocated tax cuts. The idea seemed to make sense both as policy and as politics. Lower taxes, supply-side theorists argued, would stimulate economic growth, thereby avoiding budget deficits. And the appeal to voters would turn the Republicans into the majority party, for few people would be able to resist the notion that government's money is really their own, best left in their pockets.
The policy behind tax-cutting never quite worked as expected; until recently, deficits plagued the American economy. Neither did the politics. To be sure, Walter Mondale lost badly to Ronald Reagan in 1984 after he talked about raising taxes, but then Americans began to tell pollsters that tax-cutting was not a high priority with them. A program of slashing federal spending -- even shutting government down -- wound up harming the Republican Party's hopes for majority status. Steve Forbes made tax cuts the linchpin of campaigns for his party's nomination and got nowhere. New Hampshire, the most tax-resistant state in America, began to consider an income tax. 
 It therefore seemed to be one more example of political folly when Senate and House Republicans decided to take on the estate tax. First passed by Congress in 1916 to help pay for World War I, the federal tax on estates kicks in when a person leaves assets valued at $675,000 (rising to $1 million in 2005). Because only 2 percent of American estates are taxed, Republican calls for repeal reeked of the party's proclivity to reward its wealthy donors, even at the risk of alienating individuals whose more modest estates would never be taxed.
President Clinton responded by insisting that any tax relief should go not to the very rich, but to those who have fallen behind in these dizzying economic times. Democrats have discovered that when it comes to tax policy, class warfare works; Americans are receptive to the notion that Republicans appeal too much to selfish motives to be fully trusted with the common good.
Yet as the estate tax issue played itself out, both parties found themselves surprised. Democrats, realizing that they are on the defensive, are trying to fashion a compromise that would benefit farmers and small businessmen. Republicans, not used to capturing the moral high ground on any issue, sense blood and would like nothing more than a presidential veto.
One possible explanation of this reversal of fortune is that even poor Americans someday hope to be rich enough to have an estate; these days, after all, anyone owning a house in a desirable neighborhood is already within sight of the tax's minimum. But this assumes that Americans are selfish enough to want to hold on to their money even when they do not make much of it. The problem with this explanation is that because the estate tax is paid after you are dead, you cannot hold on to it. You can, of course, spend it before you die. But once you are dead, there are only two options: It can be left to those you designate, usually your children, or it can be left to everyone in the form of general tax revenue.
The philosopher Immanuel Kant taught that the more just solution would be to leave your estate to everyone; we are obligated to others, Kant believed, irrespective of whether we know them personally. It follows that if you are rich enough to have an estate eligible to be taxed, needy people unknown to you are more deserving of your largess than the few children you happen to have had. But while Americans do not mind being taxed, they do not trust government to do what is right. Uncertain that the money they have earned will go to all, they would rather make sure it goes to some. And who better to pick those to whom it will go than the person who made the money in the first place?
This instinct to leave your own money to your own children cannot be called selfish. Sociobiologists, in fact, would call it altruistic, for in their view the willingness of an organism -- usually a gene -- to sacrifice so that its offspring flourishes is the very definition of altruism. Whether or not one agrees with them, repeal of the estate tax taps into very strong family feelings.
Paying for college illustrates the principles involved. It is grossly unfair that rich Americans can send their children to better universities than those that poor Americans can afford. The unfairness is compounded when the best colleges admit so-called legacies -- students whose parents attended these same colleges. Should we therefore encourage parents to forgo all advantages for their own children, giving the money they save instead to a scholarship fund for any needy students? Or should we be happy that people will go to such lengths to ensure that people other than themselves get ahead, even if those others are related to them by blood?
In a way that makes sense to them, even if it does not make sense to philosophers, Americans who support repeal of the estate tax, like Americans who deprive themselves of vacations in order to send their children to first-rate colleges, are expressing a generous urge.
Repeal of the estate tax gives Republicans the opportunity to speak about solidarity. To be sure, the solidarity that repeal encourages, because it focuses on the family rather than society as a whole, is limited in scope. But it is broader than the extreme individualism of the free-market Republican rhetoric Americans find less than ennobling.
Americans prefer strengthening ties among people they know to the alternatives of either looking out for no one or looking out for everyone. Estate tax repeal corresponds to the basic moral instincts of most Americans. That is why, unlike tax-cutting across the board, it is a winning political issue.

HEADLINE: Deutsche Telekom Deal: Did Barriers Fall in Europe, Just to Rise in the U.S.?

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

 BODY:
Through much of the 1990's, the United States led the world in opening the telecommunications industry to competition.
But as Deutsche Telekom attempts to buy a fast-growing American company, the VoiceStream Wireless Corporation, Congressional leaders sound as if they have not been paying much attention to Europe for the last five years. 
 Spurred by Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat, the Senate is now weighing legislation that would block the German company from buying VoiceStream or almost any other American telecommunications company, because Deutsche Telekom's majority owner is the German government.
And last week, responding to a letter from Senator Hollings and 29 other lawmakers, the Federal Communications Commission chairman, William E. Kennard, said an acquisition of an American telephone company by Deutsche Telekom would face heavy regulatory scrutiny.
But blocking a Deutsche Telekom deal could invite retaliation against American communications companies active in Germany and elsewhere in Europe, and might also run afoul of United States commitments to the World Trade Organization.
Under current American policy, foreign companies are allowed to acquire American communications companies if the buyer is based in a country that is a member of the W.T.O. -- as are Germany and all other members of the European Union. Mr. Hollings's proposal would block the F.C.C. from transferring, for at least a year, a radio license to a company in which a government owns a significant stake, even if it is less than 50 percent. Separate legislation supported by Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, would effectively block acquisitions by such companies on a permanent basis.
At first blush, the reasoning of the Hollings camp seems straightforward: the German government still owns about 57 percent of Deutsche Telekom, and Senator Hollings argues that the government could subsidize unfair competition or use its regulatory power to favor Deutsche Telekom in Germany over foreign rivals.
The fears are not entirely misplaced. Germany, along with most other European countries, has a history of impeding competition. As recently as three years ago, Deutsche Telekom was an arrogant, bloated and overpriced company that depended on regulatory protection.
But those days are over. In the last four years, the German government has been selling off shares in Telekom about as fast as the market could absorb them. In three separate offerings, the government has sold nearly $30 billion worth of shares, and officials have said repeatedly that they intend to continue that process until the government's stake is at or near zero.
More important, the German government has drastically deregulated the country's communications market, savaging Deutsche Telekom's core telephone business.
Since 1998, when the European Union ordered all member countries to open the telephone markets to competition, the German company has lost about 30 percent of its long distance market to domestic and foreign carriers and has been forced to slash some of its rates as much as 70 percent to keep from losing even more.
The process has hardly been perfect. Deutsche Telekom has tried to block rivals by charging them high fees to connect to its network and charging customers huge fees for changing telephone companies. But German regulators have slapped down most of those efforts, with the result that rivals have made big inroads into its revenues and profits.
Last year, Deutsche Telekom's revenues for wired telephone service declined as a result of price cuts and customers who changed carriers, although the company largely compensated for the shortfall through booming growth in its mobile telephone business. But in wireless, too, the company faces an extraordinary array of foreign and domestic rivals.
Earlier this year, for example, Vodafone AirTouch of Britain acquired the German company Mannesmann, which is equal to Deutsche Telekom in the wireless business and is a strong second-place competitor in wired telephone service.
France Telecom recently acquired MobilCom, a growing German provider of local, long distance and wireless services. France Telecom is also part of a group that will bid in auctions for new German licenses to offer advanced, or so-called third-generation, wireless services.
The American communications company BellSouth and the Dutch carrier Royal KPN jointly acquired a wireless network, E-Plus, in Germany recently. And British Telecommunications, Britain's dominant telephone company, owns part of a fourth wireless network in Germany.
Meanwhile, American companies like WorldCom are building fiber optic networks across Germany and the rest of Europe. Scores of new companies, many backed by American investors, are building their own fiber optic networks in Europe to offer high-speed Internet services.
Far from being a heavy-handed ally of Deutsche Telekom, German regulators have more often than not supported its rivals, like Mannesmann, on crucial pricing issues.
In Brussels, the antitrust regulators for the European Union's European Commission have added to the pressure. Trying to force more competition in local telephone service, they demanded that Deutsche Telekom sell off its nationwide cable television network.
To be sure, Deutsche Telekom has tried to retain as many of its old privileges as possible. In selling off the cable network, it insisted on breaking up the nationwide system into nine regions, with the clear intention of preventing rivals from creating a nationwide competitor.
Nevertheless, the German company is not only selling majority stakes in the cable systems but selling them to American companies. Callahan Associates International, a Denver-based company founded by a former executive of the regional Bell company U S West, Richard Callahan, is buying two of Deutsche Telekom's biggest cable systems for more than $5 billion.
Mr. Callahan's plan is to upgrade the cable systems to also offer telephone and high-speed Internet service. Certainly he has experience: While at U S West, he helped start the British cable company Telewest, one of the first cable systems in the world to offer both telephone service and cable television over the same network.
Given the raucous competition in German telecommunications, the talk of a Congressional blockade of Deutsche Telekom in the United States has already set off an alarm at the European Union.
The issue of the German government's majority ownership of Deutsche Telekom could turn out to be moot. In its bid to acquire Voice Stream for $50.7 billion in stock and cash, the company's executives say the government's stake would be diluted from 58 percent to 45 percent as a result of issuing new shares to pay for the purchase.
Wilfried Schneider, a spokesman for the European Union in Washington, said that a Congressional effort to block the Deutsche TelekomVoiceStream deal would violate the 1997 World Trade Organization agreement to open telecommunications markets to private and publicly owned companies.
"We think Congress should prevent this proposal from becoming a law," Mr. Schneider said. "It sets a bad example because it looks like some kind of protectionist move."

How Slavery Fueled Business in the North

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES 

 BODY:
The German Parliament hoped to discourage a wave of lawsuits -- and close the door on an ugly past -- when it voted to support a fund through which corporations will compensate people who worked as slave laborers in Germany during World War II. But by agreeing to pay reparations, corporations like DaimlerChrysler, Deutsche Bank, Siemens and Volkswagen are tacitly admitting that German corporate wealth rests at least partly on slave labor extracted from Jews during the commission of crimes against humanity.
This has been a big year for institutional contrition, with the Vatican apologizing for misdeeds of the past -- extending back to the Inquisition -- and Swiss banks seeking atonement for appropriating the accounts of Holocaust victims. But in the United States Congress, a bill that would bring about a similar reckoning with regard to two and a half centuries of slavery may never see the light of day. Legislation sponsored by Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan calling for a study of reparations has failed to reach the House floor, even after being submitted to Congress every year for more than a decade. 
 The failure of Congress to take this bill seriously reflects the sense among Americans as a whole that slavery has no economic bearing on the nation as it exists today. But if a 34-year-old lawyer named Deadria Farmer-Paellmann has her way, a broader debate about reparations and the links between modern corporations and the slave economy may be on the way.
A part-time musician and amateur historian, Ms. Farmer-Paellmann attended law school solely to develop a legal argument for reparations. After scouring corporate archives, she has turned up connections between modern corporations and predecessor companies that seem clearly to have profited from the slave trade, in some cases obliquely but often quite directly.
Inspired by the German case, Ms. Farmer-Paellmann is planning to sue a dozen corporations for "unjustly enriching" themselves and has already begun distributing archival records that provide provocative examples of corporate involvement in the trade. The planned lawsuits are novel. But the news articles about her first few discoveries have already broadened public awareness of the extent to which the United States depended on slaves to build the national as well as the Southern economy.
Charles Ogletree, a Harvard Law School professor, is among those paying attention. He says he is considering both litigation and legislation and is helping to plan a conference scheduled this fall on the reparations issue.
Modern-day Northerners tend to view slavery as confined to the Confederacy, thinking of the Northeast as made up of "free states." Americans are for the most part unaware that slavery covered all of the original colonies and their successor states and began to loosen its grip in the North only in the early 1800's, when personal liberty laws went into effect. New York City was a capital of human bondage, with more slaves than any other city with the possible exception of Charleston, S.C.
New England survives in the history books as the hotbed of abolitionism and the home of the crusading anti-slavery novelist Harriet Beecher Stowe. But Ms. Farmer-Paellmann has turned up documents revealing a different New England, one in which corporate founders and respected businessmen trafficked in slaves, even after aspects of the slave trade were made illegal.
One of the most serious offenders was the Rhode Island businessman John Brown, who founded Providence Bank, an early predecessor of the modern FleetBoston Financial Corporation. The Fleet corporate history portrays Brown as a "respected merchant." But Ms. Farmer-Paellmann has unearthed records showing that Brown owned ships that embarked on several slaving voyages and that he was prosecuted in federal court for participating in the international slave trade after it had become illegal under federal law. Records show that Providence Bank lent substantial sums to Brown, and Ms. Farmer-Paellmann suspects that the bank both financed and profited from the founder's illegal slave trading. For its part, FleetBoston contends that incomplete records make a conclusion impossible.
The most disturbing document to emerge so far reveals that the Aetna Insurance Company of Hartford actually insured slave owners against the loss of their human chattel. That Aetna knew the horrors of slave life is evident in a rider through which the company declined to pay the premium for slaves who were lynched, worked to death or who committed suicide. Aetna says that incomplete records forbid its knowing how many such policies were written. After the policy came to light, the company apologized for having been involved in the slave trade.
Ms. Farmer-Paellmann claims to have found similar documents concerning more than a dozen corporations still doing business in this country and has promised to file several lawsuits charging these companies with unjustly enriching themselves at the expense of slaves. Whether or not the lawsuits succeed is almost beside the point. This exercise will have done its job if it reveals to the public the role of slavery in shaping American life. More than a few modern fortunes rest on the suffering of human beings who once accounted for a large portion of American wealth and lived in chains here for 250 years.

HEADLINE: A New Crisis Over Refugees Adrift in Their Own Lands

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 21

 BODY:
From the Caucasus to Kosovo, Congo, Colombia and East Timor, millions of people have been displaced by civil war or ethnic violence. But almost everywhere, particularly in Africa, they struggle to survive without much, if any, international help because they have not crossed an international border and are not, strictly speaking, refugees.
In recent years, the United Nations has been without a coherent policy for helping those victims of war, known to international agencies as "internally displaced people," or I.D.P.'s. Because there is no agency and almost no money regularly set aside for these people, responses to crises have been haphazard and often opportunistic. Some get help, often because they are mixed into refugee populations. Many never do. 
 The leading United Nations relief official, Carolyn McAskie, said this week that she wanted to look for ways to bring existing United Nations agencies into a common effort to pay more attention to this problem. Although she has yet to appoint a director to coordinate that effort, officials say that the job will go to Dennis McNamara, who has most recently been a deputy to the United Nations administrator of Kosovo.
In choosing this approach, rather than designating a new or lead agency to deal with the problem, Ms. McAskie, the United Nations' emergency relief coordinator, has placed herself in opposition to the United States, and particularly its ambassador here, Richard C. Holbrooke.
Mr. Holbrooke, who since visiting Africa late last year has been on a campaign for action on the issue, said this week that he was "skeptical of the so-called collaborative approach." He said American diplomats and aid experts abroad would be asked to report on how coordination is working.
"Let's see the new system at work," he said in a speech to the United Nations Economic and Social Council. "And ultimately, let's see if it makes any difference on the ground."
In an interview, Ms. McAskie said the concept of putting one agency in charge of the internally displaced had been studied. "We have looked at that option very seriously, and we do honestly believe -- and most of the agencies and quite a few of the governments honestly believe -- that that's not necessarily the best answer, partly because I.D.P.'s are so mixed in with the rest of the population that we have to find ways of addressing the war-affected population as a whole."
"I.D.P.s have specific needs, though," she acknowledged. "There's no doubt about it. And we can do better to address that. We've come out with a policy on protection. We're trying to increase the knowledge and awareness of country teams." She said that one of the major hurdles to increased help to the internally displaced has been a lack of money.
Sadako Ogata, who will retire later this year after serving for nearly a decade as United Nations high commissioner for refugees, underlined in a speech in New York last Tuesday that it is more difficult to raise cash to aid displaced people within their own countries than to help other refugee groups.
"We are failing internally displaced people," she said. "By 'we' I mean to include governments, the United Nations system and the broader humanitarian community. The scale of suffering and the human cost are staggering." She said that in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas she had seen "appalling examples of forced displacement and misery."
"In many of these situations," she said, "displacement is not merely a consequence of conflict, but its very objective. The governments responsible for protecting the rights and well-being of internally displaced people are often the cause of their predicament as they pursue calculated strategies aimed at changing the ethnic map of the country or gaining control over its economic resources."
The help these uprooted people now get, she acknowledged, "is selective, uneven and, in many cases, inadequate."
On Thursday, Mrs. Ogata appealed for $8.4 million for 300,000 people who have been forced to flee homes in three provinces in Angola, where 1.5 million people have been displaced since another peace agreement fell apart in 1998. The United States has pledged $2 million to the fund.
"Will others follow their example?" Mrs. Ogata asked. "I will be blunt," she said. "Making a real difference for internally displaced people will require a very substantial and sustained commitment of resources."

HEADLINE: Group of 8 Pledges to Help Poor Countries

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: NAGO, Japan, July 23

 BODY:
The leaders of eight industrial nations concluded their annual economic summit meeting in this island resort today with a broad commitment to help poor countries reduce their debt burden and increase their access to better education, health care and information technology.
In a communique issued at the end of a three-day meeting in Okinawa, Japan's southernmost island, the leaders of the Group of 8 promised action on a wide variety of issues, most notably to curtail extreme poverty and the spread of infectious diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. 
 Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori of Japan, this year's host, said wealthy nations have an obligation to break the "vicious cycle" of poverty and disease faced by poor countries. In addition to Mr. Mori, the leaders of the United States, Canada, Britain, Italy, France, Germany and Russia took part in the conference.
"We commit ourselves to the agreed international development goals, including the overarching objective of reducing the share of the world's population living in extreme poverty to half its 1990 levels by 2015," the leaders said in a statement.
Seeking to bridge the so-called digital divide, a technological gap that separates the world's haves from the have-nots, the leaders agreed to establish a task force to help developing countries reap the benefits offered by new information technologies.
The conference's final 15-page communique, drafts of which had been circulating for days, contained few new initiatives and provided few details on how the leading industrialized nations would achieve their lofty goals, bringing criticism from some human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations that the summit meeting had lacked substance.
The statement did, however, mention the need for joint attention to a number of issues, including the safety of genetically modified foods, research into the human genome, cross-border criminal organizations, the aging of populations in many developed countries and environmental issues like global warming.
The leaders promised to speed up efforts to achieve debt relief for 20 of the most heavily indebted poor countries. A similar pledge was made a year ago at the group's summit meeting in Cologne, Germany, but so far only nine of those impoverished countries have received some relief.
The leaders at the meeting also pledged to jump-start the multilateral trade talks under the World Trade Organization before the end of the year. Last December, the trade organization's policy meeting in Seattle collapsed when officials failed to reach an agreement on the agenda and street demonstrations against globalization turned violent.
The summit meetings are a chance for world leaders to make an impression, and in Okinawa President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia stole the show.
Before coming to Okinawa, Mr. Putin visited the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, and there was widespread interest at the summit meeting in his trip.
At a press briefing today, Mr. Putin said he believed that Mr. Kim was a man with whom the world could do business and urged more contacts with him to help to defuse tensions in the region.
There were widespread fears that, as in Seattle, there would be disruptive demonstrations around the Okinawa meeting after Okinawan police officers arrested a United States marine accused of sexually molesting a 14-year-old island girl. The episode did lead to huge demonstrations by Okinawans, who have long demanded the removal of the many United States military bases on the island.
But the protests, which were held at military bases and at hotels and conference centers used for the meeting, remained orderly, and the police reported no violence.
In a private meeting with Prime Minister Mori, President Clinton apologized for a series of crimes, including sex attacks, committed here in recent years by United States servicemen.
The Japanese government came under sharp criticism, though, for spending more than $750 million to hold this event.
Nongovernmental organizations said that Japan's record expenditure was nearly 100 times higher than the amounts spent at the meeting in Cologne or an earlier one in Birmingham, England, and that the money could have been used to relieve the debt of the world's poorest nations.
Jubilee 2000, a protest group that seeks to reduce the debt of developing countries, said the amount that Japan spent on the meeting could have been used to erase the debt of Gambia or Equatorial Guinea. "The world's leaders have retreated to this remote island of Okinawa and have turned their backs on the poor," the group said.
The Japanese government said that the $750 million included the cost of staging the three-day meeting in Okinawa and earlier meetings of finance ministers and foreign ministers in Fukuoka and Miyazaki. About $300 million of the $750 million was spent on security, which included 22,000 police officers drafted from across the country to work at the meeting.
It has been nearly a quarter-century since the first summit meeting of the world's major industrialized countries was held -- in Rambouillet, France, in 1975.
The meetings were initially intended as informal gatherings where the leaders of the world's richest countries could resolve problems of common concern, like inflation, economic growth and currency crises. The premise was that they could do more together than separately.
But the conferences have evolved in recent years to include discussions of broader political and social significance, including armed conflicts, technology, hunger, health care and other issues affecting the developing world, and to include Russia, which, despite its ailing economy, is a central figure on the world stage.
In his briefing today, Mr. Putin also said he would continue lobbying Washington to abandon plans to build an antimissile defense shield against possible attack from hostile countries like North Korea.
"Putin conducted himself like a true statesman, unlike his predecessor, Yeltsin, who acted erratic and was probably drunk at previous summits," said George von Furstenberg, a professor in economic and financial policy at Fordham University in New York.
"Putin didn't come here looking sad with his hand out begging for loans," the professor said. "He was confident and mature and had a bag of North Korean goodies to share with the group."

HEADLINE: SHIFTING WORKPLACE/A special report.;
Renewed Corporate Wanderlust Puts a Quiet Brake on Salaries

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Fla.

 BODY:
Not long after W. Lee Nutter took over last year as chairman of Rayonier Inc., a big wood and pulp company with headquarters in Stamford, Conn., he called in a top executive, Jack O'Grady, and asked, "Why are we here?"
The reasons, in fact, had peeled away. Modern technology now allowed the company to distance itself from New York's financial markets and still have complete instant communications. More of Rayonier's timberland and mills were in the Southeast, and Jacksonville beckoned with $2.7 million in public subsidies. And, in a booming economy, managers and executives were increasingly expensive. Moving to an office tower here this summer cut executive labor costs. 
 Twenty-eight people transferred from Stamford, but others declined to relocate and 44 men and women, mostly executives, are being hired locally at salaries that are at least 10 percent lower, on average, than those paid in Stamford. In relocating, Rayonier shrank the headquarters staff to 72 from 85. And the new executives expect less. "Salaries in the Southeast do rise more slowly than in the Northeast," said Mr. O'Grady, who is senior vice president for administration.
Companies have been migrating for decades, of course, moving operations both within the United States and overseas for many reasons, including the search for cheaper labor. But since 1996, corporate migration within the country has soared, roughly doubling to more than 11,000 moves a year, according to Site Selection Magazine of Atlanta, the only organization, public or private, to track the phenomenon. At the same time, the emphasis has shifted from factories, the traditional migrants, to every type of service operation, and across a range of jobs, from Rayonier's six-figure executives to call center operators earning $7 an hour.
The increasing restlessness of American business is beginning to be noticed by economists, government officials and industry groups. "Corporate migration within the United States is definitely accelerating," said Allen J. Scott, a geographer at the University of California at Los Angeles who specializes in economic issues. "The booming economy is prodding companies to relocate or expand in new places."
As labor shortages and competition for workers drive up wages in one city, companies have shifted work or have expanded in another location, where the same tasks can be done at lower pay. This movement helps to answer one of the big questions about the recent economy: How has the United States managed to achieve its lowest unemployment rate since the 1960's and yet not experience as much upward pressure on wages as it has during past booms, even when labor markets were not as tight as they are today?
Various explanations have been offered by economists for the failure of labor shortages to give a bigger kick to wages in the record long expansion that started in 1991: weaker unions, the greater use of temporary workers, a minimum wage that has lost value, a flood of immigrant workers, layoffs and job insecurity, global competition. Often overlooked, however, has been the impact of the stepped-up rate of corporate migration, which adds another critical element to the mix.
But if lower labor costs drive the process, technology greases the way. High-speed telecommunications and fiber optic lines, now available almost everywhere in the country, allow a Rayonier to communicate as easily from Jacksonville as from Stamford, and they also allow a great variety of service companies to link operations in different cities, as if these operations were all in one office. In addition, the talent pool is more evenly spread across the country in the 1990's than in earlier generations, said Lawrence F. Katz, a Harvard economist, meaning "you can find similar labor forces and similar amenities in many more places in America."
While technology facilitates corporate migration, so does the growing use of call centers to deal with the public. Many companies use centers to take orders for merchandise, to service credit cards, to handle securities transactions, to give investment advice, to help owners of computers solve software problems, to collect debts, to sell insurance, to help people navigate the Internet. No one has yet counted all the call center operators, not even the Labor Department, but their importance is beginning to rival that of assembly line workers 50 years ago. And call centers, generally requiring only telephones and desk-top computers, are much more mobile than factories.
Mid-sized cities in the Southeast and Southwest are prime targets of the corporate migration, cities like Charlotte, Memphis, Phoenix and Jacksonville. But companies have also been drawn in growing numbers to the Midwestern states or to Maine or Pennsylvania or Kentucky -- to any place, in fact, that offers lower wages and public subsidies. Maine has fewer than 6,000 people making shoes, less than half the number it had in 1985, but out-of-state retailers, banks, pharmaceutical companies, even a newspaper clipping service, have placed operations in the old shoe towns, re-employing workers.
"Companies are searching for pockets of unemployment," said Steven H. Levesque, commissioner of Maine's Department of Economic and Community Development, "and Maine has these pockets."
 
Spreading the Jobs
Mobility Restrains Wage Momentum
The stepped-up corporate migration has spread jobs and living standards more evenly across the country than in some earlier expansions. Rather than expand several of its operations in New York or New Jersey, for example, Merrill Lynch has gradually added 2,000 employees here in Jacksonville, locating them in four imposing pink stone office buildings on a bucolic site in a suburban office park.
For a migrating company, the money saved in labor costs often goes into earnings, helping to explain the extraordinary profitability of American business in recent years, economists say. And by lowering labor costs, corporate migration serves to keep inflation under control. But it also serves as a counterweight to the social benefit of a low unemployment rate. The ability to move almost any kind of work easily gives employers a more powerful response to the demands of their employees for greater pay.
"Not just the greater mobility, but the threat of it helps to hold down wages," Mr. Katz said.
Even so, average hourly earnings have risen faster than inflation in the boom years since 1996, the first time that has happened for so long a stretch since the 1960's and early 70's. But compare the 1990's with those earlier decades and a more complex story emerges. Wages moved up more persistently in the 60's as the unemployment rate fell. In response, the inflation rate also rose more in the 60's than it did in the 90's. Corporate migration has helped, in effect, to hold down labor costs and prices.
Public attention has focused on manufacturers that shift factories abroad, particularly to Mexico and the Far East. But corporate migration within the United States, which dawdled along at fewer than 5,200 occurrences annually from 1980 through 1994, jumped in the late 1990's to more than 11,400, according to Site Selection's research.
The organization's totals cover not only corporate migrations but also the initial investments of newly started companies. Because only the largest start-ups are counted, however, they represent only 10 percent of each year's total, says Jack Lynes, Site Selection's executive editor. The totals, including the start-ups, reached 12,702 in 1999. Before 1995, the high point was 5,686 in 1989, the last full year of the previous expansion.
Responding to a request for data on corporate migration, the American Management Association polled 63 of its chief executives last month, asking by e-mail whether they intended to relocate their headquarters. Forty-two percent said they had either recently relocated or were actively considering doing so.
"You have to conclude that relocating operations is very much on the agenda of corporate America," said Eric Greenberg, the association's director of surveys.
The continuing migration of millions of families to the Sun Belt and the Mountain States serves as a magnet for many companies. The labor force has grown more rapidly in these regions than in the Northeast or Midwest. In Jacksonville, for example, the labor force has been growing at 3 percent a year since 1990, or three times as fast as the national average.
As a result, skilled executives -- accountants, financial analysts, personnel managers and computer specialists -- are finally as easy for Rayonier to find here as they are in the Northeast, Mr. O'Grady says.
"These are people who have moved for the amenities of life," said Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economist, "and in some long-run sense their wages are going to be relatively low because they want to be there."
Rayonier is the 19th large company to move an operation to Jacksonville this year, or expand one here, and the company is still unpacking. Paintings are propped against a wall in the conference room, waiting to be hung. Potted plants will also decorate the room, Mr. O'Grady promises, and out in the lobby the black plastic counter encircling the receptionist's station will soon be changed for a green marble one, matching the green in the new carpet.
Rayonier's headquarters had been in Stamford for 20 years and in Manhattan for 30 years before that. Its new executives in Jacksonville earn $85,000 and up, some as much as $175,000 a year. For that sort of money, Mr. O'Grady said, the pickings are better and the turnover less.
"You have more people competing for our jobs at this pay range," he said. And the quality is better. In the Northeast, you get a personnel executive, for example, with experience only in workmen's compensation, Mr. O'Grady explained. "Here, for the same pay, they also have experience in medical and dental insurance and 401(k) plans. You get a broader experience base."
There are other advantages. Office space is cheaper, and because headquarters is now "closer to the bulk of our operations," Mr. O'Grady said, fewer executives are needed. The company likes to promote from within, but getting promising employees to transfer to Stamford was harder and more expensive than bringing them here is likely to be. Housing costs are less, the climate milder, and the beaches spectacular. The Jaguar football team also figures as a draw in the Rayonier calculation, Mr. O'Grady said.
"I have a new condo here," said Mr. O'Grady, who transferred to Jacksonville himself in the spring, "and I asked my neighbors, 'Where are you from?' and I would bet 80 percent are from other places."
 
Have Jobs, Will Travel
More Places Seen As Viable Locales
Companies that once put down deep roots are also showing up in Colorado, Idaho, Texas, Nevada, Utah, Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio -- just about everywhere.
But the South is still a favorite. People have been migrating to the South for more than a generation, and now their children, those raised and educated in Jacksonville, for example, are everywhere at Merrill Lynch. William A. Bridy, Merrill's senior director in Jacksonville, often recruits graduates of the University of North Florida, whose campus, with 12,000 students, is only three miles away. Recent graduates are among the 25 "profilers" stationed at Merrill's suburban campus.
Merrill developed profiling at its Somerset, N.J., office, using the profilers to build a database of biographical information on new clients for use as a tool in selling more services. The expansion, seven months ago, was in Jacksonville and Denver.
Here a profiler's starting wage of $26,000 is 10 to 20 percent less than in New Jersey, Mr. Bridy said. "There is not the demand for New Jersey wages," he said, adding that if labor costs do rise, Jacksonville will become less attractive. That is beginning to happen in Denver. "The problem you have there is turnover, which is higher than Jacksonville," Mr. Bridy said.
Sometimes the corporate migration is only a few counties away. Pressed by the Big Three automakers to hold down prices, some parts manufacturers are shifting from the Detroit environs to Traverse City and other locations in upstate Michigan, where wages are lower. Principal Financial Group, which manages pension plans for thousands of companies, found that wages were rising in Des Moines, its headquarters city, for the counselors who field telephone calls from people seeking information about their plans or shifting investments. So work has been moved, through computer links, to offices in Waterloo and Ottumwa, Iowa, where wages for counselors with the same skills are 5 to 10 percent lower than in Des Moines.
Burrelle's Information Services is a constant migrant. The company employs nearly 2,000 people who cull newspaper, magazine, video and Internet citations for corporate customers. As wages rose in Livingston, N.J., its headquarters, and business grew, the company added an office in Salt Lake City, then Presque Isle, Me., and most recently in Houlton, Me. -- all in a successful effort to keep the hourly wage of most of the employees below $10.
"The unemployment rate is a little higher in Houlton than in Presque Isle because it does not have an airport and tends to be bypassed by other companies," said Robert Waggoner, chief executive at Burrelle's. "You have to be adventurous in finding new places."
 
Vying for Better Jobs
Towns Try to Draw The Better Wages
While Maine, with an unemployment rate of 5 percent or more in many towns and cities, vies to attract lower-wage jobs -- or any jobs -- Jacksonville is taking a different tack. The unemployment rate here has fallen to 3.1 percent from 6.6 percent in 1992, and with the pressure reduced to bring in jobs, whatever they pay, the Chamber of Commerce and the Economic Development Commission are trying to attract companies with jobs that pay more than $31,000.
Boeing, the aerospace giant, is one beneficiary. Servicing and overhauling aircraft is a growing part of its business, but rather than expand repair centers in Wichita, Seattle or St. Louis, where mechanics earn $20 an hour and up, Boeing has opened a center in Jacksonville. So have Northrop Grumman and Jet Turbine Services. Skilled mechanics, trained in the Navy and mustering out here, sign on for $18 an hour or less.
"You go where the workers are," said Dee Burcham, manager of Boeing's Jacksonville repair center.
The Navy has a big presence in Jacksonville, but part of its complex, Cecil Field, an air station, was closed and turned over to the city last fall. Now the city is leasing hangar space to Boeing and others for the give-away price of $1.50 a square foot.
"We are pump priming," said Paul Krutko, a director of the Economic Development Commission. "Later the rates will go up."
Mr. Burcham, the Boeing manager, whose 55 employees will rise to 120 by January, acknowledges that Cecil Field's subsidized facilities were an important lure. "All we had to do was organize a work force and we were up and running," he said. But he gave equal billing to "the availability of knowledgeable aviation mechanics and electricians" at $18 an hour or less.
They are people like Michael Zipp, 39, who trained in the Marines as an aviation electrician. He joined Grumman in Bethpage, N.Y., in the early 1980's, long before its merger with Northrop. Earning $17.50 an hour, with a wife and four children, he could not make ends meet on Long Island, he said. So he quit in 1988, moved himself and his family to nearby St. Augustine, where Grumman had an operation, and rejoined the company at $10 an hour.
Even at that lower wage, he says, he could finally afford to pay his bills and, for the first time, purchase a home. Only now, more than a decade later, has his wage risen back to its old level of $17.50 an hour. He is aware that people with his skills earn more elsewhere in the country. The starting wage in Wichita, for example, where Boeing also has operations, is $25 an hour, he says.
Why not move? "I'm settled here," he said.
 
Son of Call Center
Jacksonville Chafes At Label, and Jobs
Jacksonville got its start in economic development as a mecca for call centers, thanks to AT&T, which set up a center here in 1983, after the phone company's breakup, to handle queries from shareholders whose stock was split. Inexpensive land drew more call centers, and Florida's status as a largely nonunion, right to work state.
Public subsidies also helped. They still do, although they are angled now toward companies like Boeing and Rayonier, which is receiving from the city a $1.8 million cash grant for bringing its headquarters here and additional "incentives," as Mr. O'Grady calls them, from the state government.
But for all the efforts of the city fathers to bring higher paying jobs to Jacksonville, the call centers still play a dominant role. America Online, Citibank, Bank of America, MediaOne all have a big presence here. "We have gone from being a call center town to wanting to not be called a call center town," said Faye Kullberg, director of human resources for MediaOne.
Few companies employ more people here than a descendant of the original AT&T call center, now part of a company called Convergys, based in Cincinnati. Convergys has 37 call centers nationwide, with 45,000 employees, including 4,500 here. The operators do not mention Convergys; they take on the identity of the companies that purchase its services. A recent client is AT&T Wireless, whose cell phone customers get a Convergys operator when they call an 800 number for help.
But Convergys has not expanded recently in Jacksonville. The pay for call center operators has risen by about $2 an hour in the last 18 months, to between $10 and $12 an hour. Turnover is also rising, and Jacksonville is losing its luster as a suitable site for low-wage call centers. So Convergys opened its newest center in Brownsville, Tex.
"We pay the same in Brownsville as in Jacksonville," said Frank Kelly, a Convergys executive, "but the unemployment rate there reached 14 percent, and we were able to hire very good people. They consider our job to be a white collar job."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE CONVENTION;
Philadelphia Ends a Neighborhood's Tale

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, July 21

 BODY:
Sparing the approaching Republican National Convention a civic eyesore, bulldozers are moving in on the last of the 957 sinking homes of the Logan triangle, a stricken working-class swath of north Philadelphia that has festered as an urban disaster for more than a decade.
"The city suddenly told me I had to get out," said Suzette Williams, hurriedly packing a moving van after 30 years on North 11th Street. This is the epicenter of a once vital 17-block neighborhood that is now an inner-city prairie dotted with skeletal buildings and a score of lingering residents of Logan's last stand. 
 The 80-year-old neighborhood's collapse into its own unstable landfill is stark evidence that the vaunted Philadelphia renaissance that is attracting the Republican conventioneers is at least a tale of two cities: the glittering downtown of new hotels and trendy restaurants, and frayed old working-class neighborhoods like Logan, five miles to the north. Residents in poor, predominantly black areas complain that the city leadership has been preoccupied with attracting downtown tourists who stay overnight, rather than stemming the working-class flight of some 250,000 people in the last decade from neighborhoods freighted with neglect.
As the city government hurries to raze the Logan hulks, and even mow the summer weeds on the ghostly 47-acre wasteland, what remains, church and civic leaders are emphasizing, is a gaunt but most inviting campaign backdrop for any venturesome presidential contender who might want to stop by during the convention and speak firsthand to the issue of inner-city housing for the working class and striving poor.
"George Bush should come here and put some meat on the bones of his compassionate conservatism," said the Rev. Kermit L. Newkirk, pastor of the Harold O. Davis Baptist Church.
Initially, city officials had promised to raze all 957 buildings and to compensate and relocate the 5,000 residents within three years. That was in 1986, when the crumbling neighborhood first seized the city's attention with an explosion caused by an underground gas leak. The initial prescription of relocation and redevelopment that was supposed to take 3 years to accomplish is now in its 15th year, having spawned a separate quasi-government agency with its own patronage, retirement benefits and petty scandals.
In recent years, people in this Democratic neighborhood have been courting Republican state officials, some of whom have been responsive and credible, Pastor Newkirk said. His frustration is clear after 14 years of struggling with successive Democratic city administrations over the houses' cracking and sinking as their landfill of ash heaps shifted with saturation from an underground creek and ruptured utility pipes. Federal investigators have also found dangerous levels of lead and are testing for other contaminants.
Advocates for assorted causes like the global economy and gay rights will soon be arriving to take to the streets for the four-day Republican convention, opening on July 31. But only Logan is offering a vivid on-site experience and eyewitness guides through a tortured saga of neighborhood blight, political promises and bureaucratic nostrums.
When the opening gavel sounds at the convention center, Logan will have its own welcoming event.
Handbills and public bus advertising downtown will offer conventioneers graphic photos of the devastation, and pose the question, "What is the Republican response?"
If nothing else, the convention preparations have spurred city officials into faster demolition. "We're getting rid of everything over in Logan; I never want to hear that name again!" an involved city official shouted from his car this week at the Rev. Mary Laney of St. Gabriel's Episcopal Church.
The church serves the surrounding Feltonville neighborhood where, Ms. Laney noted, property values have become depressed and housing sales frozen. This is because of warnings that the nearby problem with unstable landfill and underground piping may be spreading to as many as 4,000 additional houses.
"I'm trapped here," said Michael Brown, a homeowner just outside the officially defined area of sinkage, which some city officials concede was arbitrary in the first place.
He watched Ms. Williams pack for her move from North 11th Street. He stood in front of his own house just 30 feet away and told of the same problems of deep foundation cracks, sewage flooding in the basement and tilting, cracked walls and porch.
"My house is paid for but no one will buy it and no one will put up a mortgage for it," Mr. Brown said, sounding desperate as his horizon grew flatter. "You can't give my house away."
Logan's local leaders underline the news from City Hall that Mayor John F. Street, a Democrat, will be attending the neighborhood welcome, nine months after he campaigned in Logan, promising fresh initiative and $37 million in additional help for the disaster. This would roughly double what has been spent so far. Logan activists criticize former Mayor W. Wilson Goode for his handling of the initial crisis and former Mayor Edward G. Rendell for managing Philadelphia's downtown renewal far more successfully than Logan's.
"But the bulldozing amounts to a victory for us," said Ceci Schickel, chief organizer for Philadelphia Interfaith Action, a regional church and civic association. The group has been working with the Industrial Areas Foundation, a nationwide organization that is trying to make a campaign issue of housing, low wages and other problems of the working poor.
"Politicians are in denial about complicated, massive problems like Logan," said Mike Kecan, a foundation organizer. "Their talk of faith-based solutions is tokenism."
The frustrations in Logan were only compounded last summer when some homes were ruled endangered in the city's predominantly white Wissinoming neighborhood because of unstable landfill. Residents affected by this far smaller problem involving about two dozen homes received relocation and compensation help within weeks.
"I've had nothing but trouble for years trying to get my money," Ms. Williams said after completing her packing. "This is still my community," she said as she departed.

HEADLINE: 40 Percent In New York Born Abroad

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
A human tidal wave has added one million immigrants to New York City in the last decade, propelling foreign-born residents to 40 percent of the population, an analysis of United States Census Bureau figures shows.
That level of immigration has not been equaled for nearly a century. As recently as 1990, the figure for foreign-born residents was 28 percent. 
 The new figures come not from the 2000 census, whose results will not be known until next year. Instead, they are derived from the recently released results of a 15,417-household survey taken in 1999 by the Census Bureau. That study is done every three years to see if housing vacancies are below 5 percent, the legal threshold for continuing rent regulation. Because the sample is large and the bureau conducts the survey, the data are considered highly reliable. They jibe with the census, which is undertaken every 10 years.
"It's really a preview of the full census," said Dr. Andrew A. Beveridge, a Queens College sociologist who analyzes census data.
Although the surge has been evident for years, its sheer size is stunning. "Boy, that is some number -- wow, wow!" said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, co-author of "Beyond the Melting Pot," a 1963 treatise on race and ethnicity in the city. "It's an enriching experience for us," Mr. Moynihan said. "It's wonderful -- I mean, we have to think of it that way. If we think of it any other way, it won't be."
Without immigration, for example, New York's overall population would be shrinking. Instead, the stream of people from around the world is offsetting the loss of city residents to death and relocation to the suburbs and other regions. The result has been a modest net gain of about 130,000 since 1990, to an estimated total of 7.4 million last year.
"Absent immigration, we would be seeing a very different New York, with neighborhood abandonment and depopulation," said Dr. Philip Kasinitz, a sociology professor at Hunter College. Dr. William H. Frey, a demographer at the State University of New York at Albany, said, "These groups are revitalizing and re-energizing these neighborhoods."
Similar flows from abroad are bolstering the population of other major cities across the nation, although New York has had the largest influx. A big difference, however, is that other places have ethnically concentrated immigration, such as the Cubans in Miami, while the new New Yorkers are extraordinarily diverse by race and nationality. "This is a region that is going to continue to be very different from any other areas of the country," Dr. Frey said.
City Planning Commission officials declined to be interviewed about the findings. An agency spokeswoman, Jennifer Chait, voiced caution. "These projections are based on data that is incomplete and inadequate for drawing significant conclusions," she said. "Our expectations are that the definitive Census 2000 data will show a substantial increase in New York City foreign-born population but not to as nearly as high as 40 percent."
But Dr. Beveridge said his figures were actually conservative. The Census Bureau sample showed that 44 percent of heads of households were foreign born. Estimating the figure for the entire city, he reduced the percentage to adjust for factors like children of immigrants being born here. The margin of error is 0.8 of a percentage point, he said. He also noted that the planning agency itself had estimated immigration at 100,000 a year, which in 10 years adds up to one million.
Further, official statistics undercount immigrants who decline to respond because of language barriers, wariness of the government or concern about the legality of their immigration, jobs or housing. Immigration data also exclude native Puerto Ricans, who are American citizens, though it can be argued that by language, culture and geography, they have much in common with immigrants.
Dr. Beveridge's findings were backed by two other experts. Dr. John Mollenkopf, director of the Urban Research Center at the City University of New York's Graduate Center, said, "That's consistent with what other sources, like the current population survey, are showing," referring to yet another Census Bureau sampling. His work on that survey indicates that 54 percent of children through the age of 18 are either foreign born or have foreign-born parents. And Dr. Aristide R. Zolberg, director of New School University's International Center for Migration, Ethnicity and Citizenship, said he used a 40 percent estimate for the immigrant population.
Not since 1910 has New York's percentage of foreign-born residents been so high. That era of immigration, through the halls of Ellis Island, transformed the city and sparked debates over the role of newcomers that still echo today. To house the last wave, a staggering 600,000 dwellings were built in the 1920's. Radicalized newcomers enlivened local politics. And sweatshop exploitation of immigrants, spotlighted by the fatal fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist factory in 1911, galvanized the labor movement.
"We never dreamed that New York would again become a major city of immigrants, but then the immigration laws changed in 1965," said Mr. Moynihan's co-author, Dr. Nathan Glazer of Harvard University.
The latest tide continues unabated into the new century.
Experts say the current wave was accelerated by the enticing economic boom and New York's refurbished image as a safer, cleaner city. And there is the age-old tradition of new arrivals following the footsteps of friends and relatives to ethnic enclaves throughout the five boroughs.
Immigration is as old as the city itself. Back in 1643, when New York was called New Amsterdam, the 500 residents spoke 18 languages.
Major ethnic shifts within the current immigration wave are changing the city's makeup. Dr. Beveridge's estimates show that New Yorkers born in the former Soviet Union, who numbered 81,000 in 1990, had nearly tripled to 229,000 by 1999. Other fast-growing groups include Mexicans, who nearly quadrupled to 133,000 in 1999 from 35,000 in 1990, and South Asians from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, who more than doubled to 146,000 in 1999 from 67,000 in 1990.
Continuing to climb as a major Hispanic group, the number of Dominicans rose by more than two-thirds, to 387,000 in 1999 from 230,000 in 1990. (The number of Puerto Ricans born on the island dropped 21 percent to 290,000 in 1999, from 367,000 in 1990. Adding those born on the mainland, Puerto Ricans here totaled 744,000 last year, an 11 percent drop from 834,000 in 1990.)
The statistics confirm the changing face of the city witnessed on the streets every day by native New Yorkers, themselves descended from earlier immigrants. Mexican shops are sprouting in western Queens, Middle Eastern businesses now compete with the Greek establishments of Astoria, and very little of Italy is left in Little Italy, where Chinese-Americans are the absolute majority and Hispanics have been jostling for secnd place.
"Gateway to America," says the welcoming sign at Kennedy International Airport in Queens. So many newcomers have stepped off and made their home in that borough that its 167 nationalities and 116 languages make it the nation's most diverse county. But immigration "certainly poses challenges and pressures," Dr. Glazer said. The Queens borough president, Claire Shulman, said: "I'm continually looking for school seats and sites to build, because we are minus 30,000 seats and growing 10 percent a year. The other thing is there really isn't enough affordable housing, which has led to a lot of illegal conversions."
Some experts call for a strategic plan for dealing with immigration. "We need to get out in front and plan and strive to do better," said Michael H. Schill, a New York University professor.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has often voiced support for immigrants. His press office did not return calls seeking comment from him and from the immigrant affairs office on the latest figures.
Immigration has produced tensions. The visiting baseball pitcher John Rocker made his distaste well known. One man paid for anti-immigration billboards, and City Councilwoman Julia Harrison of Queens objected to Chinese and Korean business signs without English translations.
Most experts say that immigrants are a plus for the city. Although many may be dependent when they arrive, Professor Schill said, "that rapidly changes as they move up the ladder and contribute more in taxes than they consume." He added, "Immigrants tend to be very resourceful, or they wouldn't be here in the first place."
Mrs. Shulman agreed: "They're all wonderful. For the most part they're all working; our unemployment is under 5 percent. I go to a lot of graduations, and they're winning a lot of valedictorians and salutatorians and walking away with lots of good scholarships. The vitality, the energy, the chemistry from people all over the world is what makes New York City unique and makes New York City great." She named another benefit to Queens: "Hey, listen, we have the best restaurants in the city."

HEADLINE: CAMP DAVID TALKS AT A CRUCIAL POINT

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: THURMONT, Md., July 23

 BODY:
With stakes mounting as the Camp David summit meeting nears its third week, President Clinton returned to negotiations tonight, and officials suggested that the talks, now centered on the future of Jerusalem, could break apart in the next day or solidify into a deal.
Adding a new aura of gravity to the talks, the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, traveled to Saudi Arabia to ensure Saudi support for Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, in the crucial debate over Jerusalem. 
 The diplomacy by Mr. Mubarak, who maintains the best relations with Mr. Arafat of any Arab leader, was seen by the Israelis and the Americans as an effort to build a wall of Arab solidarity behind the Palestinian leader.
The Americans made it plain through the State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, that the summit meeting would not go on indefinitely and could reach a make-or-break point as soon as Monday.
"We are not here for an unlimited period of time," Mr. Boucher said. The president will be given an immediate assessment, and this will be "very important" in how the talks move, he said.
Privately, American officials suggested that if progress was not made by Monday, it would be difficult to keep going. If the talks moved toward midweek, they added, this would be a sign that things were going well.
At his summer retreat outside Rome, Pope John Paul II entered the Camp David debate, exhorting the summit leaders in his weekly Sunday address to adopt a long-held Vatican position that a special international status be extended to the holy sites in the Old City of Jerusalem.
As important figures on the outside tried to influence the conference, Mr. Clinton left behind the relative calm of an uncontentious economic summit meeting in Japan, and entered what several accounts suggested was a razor-edge atmosphere among the Israelis and Palestinians at Camp David.
To relieve the tensions, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, got some distraction by visiting the Civil War battlefields at Gettysburg today with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. Mr. Arafat relaxed at Dr. Albright's Virginia farm, where she served him lunch on Saturday.
But these outings were mere interludes in a process that is inexorably building toward a climax. The conference went into its 13th day today, the entire duration of the first Middle East peace conference at Camp David in 1978 under the auspices of President Jimmy Carter.
The Israelis have said Mr. Barak is willing to make concessions on Jerusalem, though it is far from clear that they would be enough for Mr. Arafat. Gadi Baltiansky, Mr. Barak's spokesman, suggested that talks had entered the critical phase.
"It won't take a lot of time," he said. "President Clinton will return to Camp David, and then we will see if there is any point in staying here and going on with the talks, or to pack the luggage and go home."
In Mr. Clinton's absence, the stakes grew in a variety of ways.
In a letter he wrote to Mr. Clinton before the summit meeting was pronounced dead and then swiftly revived on Wednesday night, Mr. Barak stated, according to leaks in the Israeli press, that if the meeting ended with no overall accord, he would walk away even from points he had agreed to.
The Americans have suggested that they may be facing an all-or-nothing outcome and a situation at the very end in which Mr. Clinton will be trying to salvage something from the rubble of a blowup over Jerusalem.
One way of looking at the negotiations as they unfold now, according to this scenario, is comparing them to pushing a rock up a hill. If a full agreement formally bringing an end to the 52-year-old conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians is not achieved, then the progress on some less explosive issues, like the shape of a new Palestinian state and the fate of Palestinian refugees, could be wiped out as the rock rolls back down the slope.
Before Mr. Clinton left for Japan, he and his negotiators, according to Israeli and Palestinian reports, presented some compromise solutions for Jerusalem. They centered on degrees of sovereignty in East Jerusalem for the Palestinians, who claim all of East Jerusalem as the capital of their new Palestinian state.
The principle of the American compromise appears to be virtually full sovereignty for the Palestinians over Palestinian villages in East Jerusalem and what one expert called a "sense of sovereignty" over the Muslim religious sites in the center of the Old City.
The proposals reportedly envision some form of "shared sovereignty" over some of the parts of East Jerusalem adjacent to the eastern part of the Old City.
The reports in Israel say that these are ideas that Mr. Barak has agreed to and that they are concessions that go far beyond what any other Israeli leader has made.
Some of the Israeli accounts of the American proposal -- which is believed to have been amended in Mr. Clinton's absence -- report that a final decision on the status of the Old City, holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians, would be deferred.
The Palestinian reports say those ideas are not sufficient for Mr. Arafat to make a deal. Officials who have been in touch with the Palestinian delegation report that Mr. Arafat is unimpressed by the American proposals. Given the negotiators' agreement not to speak to reporters, it is impossible to know how much those descriptions of a defiant Mr. Arafat are for home consumption or how much they reflect a true picture.
One of the Palestinian negotiators, Abu Mazen, who had left the talks to return home, came back today saying a partial agreement was not in the cards.
A senior Palestinian official, Tayeb Abdel Rahim, was downbeat in a speech tonight at the Egyptian Consulate in Gaza. "The Palestinian delegation has achieved no progress in the important issues of the negotiations, such as Jerusalem, settlements, the return of refuges and borders," he said.
Mr. Mubarak's visit to King Fahd in Saudi Arabia also raised the stakes because the Saudi royal family is the protector of Mecca and Medina, the two holiest Islamic sites, and has a huge interest in the Islamic site in East Jerusalem.
On Saturday, the Egyptian and Jordanian foreign ministers met to discuss the Camp David talks.
Mr. Arafat has often contended that he does not have a mandate from Arabs and Muslims to cede sovereignty to Israel in East Jerusalem and, in particular, over the Muslim and Christian religious sites.
In East Jerusalem, Haram al-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary, known to Jews as Temple Mount, is the third holiest Muslim site, consisting of Al Aksa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock. The complex was in the custody of the Jordanian royal family until the Israelis pushed the Jordanians out of East Jerusalem in 1967.
As Mr. Arafat considered what to do about East Jerusalem, he got pressure from another quarter today. The leader of the militant Hamas movement, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said in Gaza that he would be willing to declare a truce with Israel only if Israel agreed to withdraw completely to the 1967 borders from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem.
The pope's appeal was based on a longstanding view of the Roman Catholic Church that the Israeli conquest of East Jerusalem and its annexation to Israel was an act of occupation. In February, the Vatican signed an accord with the Palestinians calling for freedom of worship in all holy sites of East Jerusalem.
In his address at his summer retreat, Castel Gandolfo, the pope said, "The Holy See continues to maintain that only a special statute internationally guaranteed can effectively preserve the most sacred areas of the Holy City."
Such international safeguards would "ensure freedom of religion and of worship for all the faithful who, in the region and the entire world, look to Jerusalem as a crossroads of peace and of coexistence," the pope said, invoking the city's "holy places and the three monotheistic religions that surround them."
As he left the White House for Camp David, Mr. Clinton held up his hands and mouthed the words "I have my fingers crossed."

HEADLINE: Gun Control Groups Use N.R.A. Tactics For Fall Elections

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
After many years of being outspent and outmuscled by the National Rifle Association, the gun control movement has begun the most ambitious campaign in its history to raise money, recruit foot soldiers and build public support for stronger gun laws in preparation for this fall's national elections.
From established groups like Handgun Control Inc., to fledgling ones like the Million Mom March, more gun control organizations than ever before are doing the kinds of grass-roots organizing that has made the N.R.A. so powerful: opening offices across the nation, training volunteers, devising media campaigns and building political war chests. 
 At the same time, wealthy proponents of gun control seem more willing to contribute to the cause. Several major philanthropists, including George Soros, have given millions of dollars over the last two years to groups that are providing intellectual and strategic support to the organizations and politicians who advocate more regulation of guns.
And in just the last few weeks, a handful of anonymous donors have given more than $2 million to two new groups that will use the money to help candidates who support gun control and attack those who do not.
Though the gun control groups will probably still be outspent by the N.R.A. by at least two to one, their voices in this election are likely to be louder than ever before, through television commercials, mailings and news conferences.
"It's not lonely out there anymore," said Joe Sudbay, political director of Handgun Control, which for years was the only gun control group active in elections. "There is a burgeoning sense that the elections are all-important this year."
Fueling this burst of organizing is a newfound confidence among gun control leaders that public support for regulating firearms is as high as it has ever been. Outrage over mass shootings combined with enthusiasm about the Million Mom March in May have helped change the political climate, they say. And the N.R.A. has lost clout, they contend, as evidenced by the defeat of a referendum last year in Missouri to allow people to carry concealed weapons.
"In the 22 years I've been working on this issue, I have never seen the climate as favorable" for gun control, said Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster who works with Handgun Control.
Mr. Hart cites polls showing that the electorate's support for gun control -- always high -- is now also more intense, meaning more voters are making it a top priority. "Education is 1, the economy No. 2," he said. "But then, ahead of foreign policy and ahead of abortion, right there with moral issues and taxes, is gun control."
Still, even the most optimistic of the gun control leaders acknowledge that they cannot match the resources of the battle-hardened N.R.A., whose leaders have promised to spend $15 million on state and federal elections this year, nearly twice as much as in 1996. The group has already raised $8 million this year and has more than $5 million on hand.
Moreover, with its 3.8 million members, three magazines, vast e-mail contact list and national network of affiliated groups, the N.R.A. is bigger, more experienced and better equipped to mobilize its core supporters than the gun control forces.
"Our membership is larger," said James J. Baker, executive director of the N.R.A. political wing, the Institute for Legislative Action. "And our reach extends well beyond our members."
"This is a very important election," Mr. Baker said, "maybe the most important general election in the 20 years I've been here -- for both sides."
Both camps say the sharp differences between the major presidential candidates this year are helping to energize supporters. Vice President Al Gore has called for an array of new restrictions, including licensing new handgun buyers and banning certain inexpensive handguns. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has generally sided with the N.R.A., signing bills allowing people to carry concealed weapons and preventing municipalities from suing gun makers.
Much as the N.R.A. has tried to demonize Mr. Gore in its fund-raising efforts as a threat to Second Amendment rights, Handgun Control has sought to cast Mr. Bush as a pawn of the N.R.A. who would team up with a Congress controlled by Republicans to rescind every major gun law on the books.
In a recent fund-raising letter, Sarah Brady, chairwoman of Handgun Control, wrote: "My friend, if you and I truly want a safer America, we cannot allow George W. Bush to be elected president of the United States. A political disaster of that magnitude would mean four long years of being on the defensive."
Such appeals seem to be working. Handgun Control has raised more than $1.2 million in the last year, three times what it spent in the 1996 campaign. The group intends to spend at least $4 million this year, focusing on about 20 closely contested Congressional races where gun control is an issue. In most cases, it will be supporting Democrats, said Mr. Sudbay, the political director.
Among the Republicans Handgun Control is likely to work against are Representative James E. Rogan of California and Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri. The group has also run advertisements in several cities criticizing Mr. Bush's record on gun control, and plans to buy more air time in closely contested states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Missouri.
"In swing areas, our mission is to make sure voters, particularly women voters, understand the Bush record," Mr. Sudbay said.
In past campaigns, Handgun Control largely stood alone in the fight against the N.R.A. But this year, it has been joined by at least two new advocates. One is the Million Mom March, the nonprofit group behind the Mother's Day rally in Washington. The group recently created a political arm that has raised $1 million from a single anonymous donor.
The second new group, the Campaign for a Progressive Future, has raised more than $1 million, also from anonymous donors, to spend on campaigns this year, said Steve Cobble, one of its founders.
Both groups organized their fund-raising committees under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, which has allowed them to hide the identities of their donors. But Congress recently enacted rules that will require the groups to disclose the names of future contributors.
The Million Mom March has opened more than 240 chapters in 46 states and expects to be represented in every state by the fall. Those chapters will be able to lobby state legislatures, train volunteers for campaigns and disseminate "voters' guides" evaluating candidates.
Modeling itself after Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the Million Mom March will try to help its allies, and hurt its opponents, by staging emotional rallies featuring victims of gun violence or their survivors. The group plans to endorse a presidential candidate -- almost certainly Mr. Gore -- and will get involved in state and Congressional races.
"Our goal is always to get people who have personal experiences involved in trying to change policy, because they are the most powerful forces," said Andrew McGuire, executive director of the Million Mom March and a former MADD director.
Mr. Cobble, a former adviser to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, said his group would focus on a small number of closely contested Congressional races with stark differences between the candidates on gun issues.
A fourth group, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, is considering creation of a political action committee. But at the very least, the group plans to hire political organizers to help mobilize pro-gun-control voters in 10 to 15 tight Congressional races, said Mark Pertschuk, the group's legislative director.
Mr. Soros, the billionaire financier, has led recent efforts by philanthropists to support nonprofit groups pushing for tighter gun laws. Although many of those groups are not overtly involved in politics, they are providing the intellectual groundwork for the political advocates.
For instance, the Funders' Collaborative for Gun Violence Prevention, a year-old group created with matching $5 million donations from Mr. Soros and the Irene Diamond Fund, has helped finance litigation against gun manufacturers and a study of gun-related injuries by the Harvard School of Public Health.
Rebecca Peters, program director for the Funders' Collaborative, said one of her main goals was to overcome what she considered the mistaken but widespread perception that there were already many tough gun laws on the books.
"Policy makers and the public believe that the law is much stricter than it is," Ms. Peters said. "We are funding information which will allow people and policy makers to understand how sparsely regulated this product and this industry are."

Silicon Valley Views the Economy as a Rain Forest

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:

CYBERSELFISH
A Critical Romp Through the Terribly Libertarian Culture of High Tech
By Paulina Borsook
276 pages. PublicAffairs. $24.
As high tech spreads outward from Silicon Valley to American society at large and people spend more and more time in cyberspace, the journalist Paulina Borsook steps back to look at the digerati and their view of the world.
Her conclusions: that high-tech culture is ravingly antigovernment, antiregulation and "psychologically brittle," that it manifests "a lack of human connection and a discomfort with the core of what many of us consider it means to be human," and that its view of human nature "reduces everything to the contractual, to economic rational decision making" and "ignores the larger social mesh that makes living as primates in groups at least somewhat bearable." In short, that high-tech culture promotes an Ayn Rand-ian view of the world, where the strong in tooth and claw survive, and the meek and unmarketable perish. 
 Ms. Borsook does not write as a Luddite outsider but as longtime observer of the tech world -- she was a contributing writer to Wired magazine in its formative years -- and she has written a smart, funny and irreverent book. "Cyberselfish" is both an engaging bookend to "Escape Velocity" (1996), Mark Dery's provocative study of cyberculture in the 1990's, and a bracing antidote to the Pollyanna-ish cyber-utopianism of Esther Dyson's "Release 2.0" (1997).
The dominant mind-set in high tech today, Ms. Borsook argues, is libertarianism -- in its many manifestations, from laissez-faire free-market economics to a more virulent form of "anarcho-capitalism." It boasts an ugly, selfish code of behavior and functions as a perfect mirror of the dark side of our "winner-take-all casino society." Many techies also evince an aggrieved, adversarial attitude toward the establishment or, in tech-speak, TPTB, "The Powers That Be." There is a tone of adolescent paranoia reminiscent in equal parts of "The X-Files" and "Falling Down" to many technolibertarian exchanges; a sense, in Ms. Borsook's words, of "testosterone-poisoned guys with chips on their shoulders and too much time on their hands."
Ms. Borsook contends that many of the favorite arguments of technolibertarians come from "bionomics" -- that is, they like to use metaphors drawn from biology to explain economic behavior and endorse a decentralized free-market system. Reduced to a bumper slogan, Ms. Borsook writes, bionomics states that "the economy is a rain forest"; in other words, it suggests that "no one can manage or engineer a rain forest, and rain forests are happiest when they are left alone to evolve, which will then benefit all the happy monkeys, pretty butterflies and funny tapirs that live in them."
This social Darwinism not only fails to afford protection to those less equipped to flourish in the jungle -- those "hypersensitive maladaptive no-commercial-potential individuals" -- but in Ms. Borsook's opinion also fails to ensure the triumph of the best. "It's a dirty little secret in high tech that superior marketing and inferior technology will beat out superior technology and inferior marketing every time," she writes, "and that other factors, aside from Darwinian fitness, determine which technologies and which companies thrive or perish."
Ms. Borsook makes it clear that she shares many of the libertarians' most fundamental assumptions -- "What I most want is to be left alone," she writes. "I don't have that will to power that would ever suggest that I know how to tell other people how to live their lives" -- and she criticizes the United States government for what she calls its "mostly awful handling of free speech and privacy as these relate to technology."
But while she comes down hard on federal efforts to curtail digital privacy, calling them a violation of civil liberties and due process, she is equally tough on those technolibertarians who extrapolate their anger at the feds' stand on cryptography (encoding used for security purposes) to the government at large.
"For the most part," she observes, "the government has made Silicon Valley a fine and dandy, safe and regularized place to make scads of money. A gargantuan infrastructure of suppliers and educational institutions, directly and indirectly subsidized by the government, nurtured the defense-electronics industry, which formed the substrate for today's high tech industry."
She is equally impatient with what she sees as high tech's insular selfishness -- its gonzo, go-it-alone individualism animated, she says, by a crippling blindness to human frailty and imperfection. She argues that techies' love of machines and rule-based programming leaves them ill-equipped to deal with emotions and such unquantifiable things as art, that this is why the digerati often prefer to escape the real world for a virtual one and demonstrate little sense of civic responsibility.
There are passages in "Cyberselfish" where Ms. Borsook's fervor gets the better of her fair-mindedness. Her portrait of a former Reagan speechwriter, George Gilder -- a hero to the conservative wing of high tech just as the former Grateful Dead lyricist John Perry Barlow remains the avatar of its neo-hippie wing -- turns into an angry rant; and her assessment of high tech's philanthropic record verges on the churlish, taking the digerati to task for the sort of donations (often computer-based in nature) that they choose to make.
For the most part, however, Ms. Borsook combines common sense with an old-fashioned humanism to make sense of the current high-tech gestalt. She has done a nimble job of tracing the digerati's libertarian roots in the counterculture of the 60's and the Reaganism of the 80's, and she proves equally adept at exploring the social and political fallout of their cultural ascendance.

HEADLINE: Measure of Equality

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"In Iran, More Women Leaving Nest for University" (news article, July 22) exemplifies what is happening with remarkable speed all over the world. The extent of coeducation is, perhaps more than any other, a measure of the emergence of women with full rights. 
 No other extension of women's rights establishes as clearly as does coeducation that women are fully the intellectual, social and economic equals of men. Coeducation implies acceptance of women at a level of equality very rarely achieved in history before our own time.
It is useful to recall that it was only in 1833 that Oberlin College became the first fully coeducational institution of higher education in America, and that many leading American universities became coeducational only in the last 30 years.

Cantatas At Each Hill In a Year Of Bach

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

DATELINE: NORFOLK, Conn., July 22

 BODY:
Much of the music world heads for the hills of New England during the summer, and so, in a Bach year, does Bach.
Actually, he is a regular visitor, in concerts of the New England Bach Festival at Marlboro, Vt., among others. But the activity has stepped up markedly this year, the 250th anniversary of the composer's death, with events like the "Bach 2K" concerts this weekend at the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival. 
 The first concert here, on Friday, offered the "Brandenburg" Concertos, with some performers (the Tokyo String Quartet) more surprising in this repertory than others (like the harpsichordist Kenneth Cooper). But alas, that enticing prospect conflicted with a Marlboro concert offering cantatas, as the Saturday concert here also did.
The New England Bach Festival, in its 32nd year, was founded by Blanche Moyse, herself a venerable institution: a founder of the Marlboro Festival 50 years ago and a longtime Bach adept. On Friday she conducted the Blanche Moyse Chorale and the festival orchestra in three cantatas at the Persons Auditorium of Marlboro College.
Or rather, she conducted when needed. In small-scale movements, involving a singer and continuo with, perhaps, an obbligato player, she sat and beamed on the performance.
Yet as frail as she looked, there was no lack of vitality in the performances. Indeed, in the delightful duet "Nun verschwinden alle Plagen" ("Now all torments vanish") from Cantata No. 32, "Liebster Jesu, Mein Verlangen" ("Dearest Jesus, My Desire"), her quick clip nearly outstripped the abilities of her talented fiddlers.
The rich mix of cantatas ranged from the unfamiliar No. 60, "O Ewigkeit, Du Donnerwort" ("Eternity, Thou Thunderous Word"), with its inventive use of duets, to the famous No. 147, "Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben" ("Heart and Lips and Deed and Conduct"), with the "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" chorale descending twice. (Bach knew a good thing when he found it.) In addition, Steven Paul Spears, a tenor, sang the "Benedictus" from Bach's Mass in B minor, a bonus enhanced by the flute playing of Paula Robison.
Hyunah Yu, a soprano, was the most impressive of the vocal soloists, with clear, secure tone. Randall Scarlata, a fine baritone, lacked the bass notes occasionally needed.
Ms. Moyse's chorus, 22 strong, achieved what good intentions could. The basic sonority is that of so many amateur groups: fuzzy and unfocused, with little core or bite.
The Norfolk concert on Saturday avoided any such problem by having the four vocal soloists sing the choruses. There being only two choral movements, opening and closing Cantata No. 8, "Liebster Gott, Wenn Werd Ich Sterben" ("Dearest God, When Will I Die?"), this practice may well have been merely an economy of chamber scale.
But it also carries the cachet of advanced musicological thinking; Joshua Rifkin and others maintain that Bach probably had only one voice per part in most of his own choral performances. In any case, it worked well enough here: remarkably so in view of the weakness of individual voices (including a veritable caricature of a countertenor), as revealed in solo numbers.
By far the finest vocalist was Richard Lalli, a baritone, who also contributed the solo Cantata No. 82, "Ich Habe Genug" ("I Have Enough"). His approach seemed a bit dry and reserved at times in this warmest of outpourings, and the addition of ornaments in the repeat of the central aria ruffled the inherent serenity of this lullaby, but Mr. Lalli won the listener over in the end, rejoicing with Bach and the text at the prospect of death.
The Norfolk concerts were dedicated to the memory of Ronald Roseman, an oboist and Bach specialist who worked at the festival for more than a quarter of a century before his death in February. Mr. Roseman took a hand in programming this death-haunted concert, Joan Panetti, the festival's director, said from the stage.
Among other things, he quickly proposed "Ich Habe Genug," as well he might have, with its prominent oboe solos in the first and last movements. As it was, Randall Wolfgang played them ably, and Jennifer Grim was a deft, smooth flute soloist in "Liebster Gott."
The extras here were highly variable. David Connell, an organist, and a brass quintet offered three chorales to start, all well and good.
Less to the point, the guitar virtuoso Eliot Fisk opened the second half with a lute prelude and his arrangement of the Chaconne from Bach's D minor Violin Partita. If the steady tread and the cumulative magnificence of that great movement can be achieved on the guitar, they were not apparent here.
Another brass quintet, partly different (and sorely undercut by trombone playing woefully out of tune), performed a movement from "The Art of Fugue" and another chorale. And the sour notes extended to Ms. Panetti's introduction, with recourse to the hoary myths of these as last works and of dictation by the composer from his deathbed.
Surely, the Bach year should be an occasion to dispel myths once and for all and set the record straight. Happily, a tool is readily at hand: Christoph Wolff's magisterial new biography, "Johann Sebastian Bach: The Learned Musician."

Environmentalists Applaud a W.T.O. Ruling on Asbestos

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 24

 BODY:
A recent ruling by the World Trade Organization that upholds France's ban on Canadian asbestos imports has caught the attention of environmentalists and labor rights advocates, who say it indicates the global trade group may be growing more sensitive to their concerns.
The ruling, which affirmed the validity of a French law prohibiting imports of hazardous materials, is also another blow to the global asbestos industry. Other W.T.O. members might now use the ruling as a precedent to justify similar bans. 
 Asbestos, a fibrous mineral, was once widely used as insulation in buildings, but demand for it has shrunk drastically the last few decades because of scientific studies that show it causes cancer and other diseases.
Severe restrictions on the use of asbestos have been in effect for years in the United States, where billions of dollars in health-related claims by workers exposed to asbestos have long clogged the court system. The European Union, following France's lead, is soon expected to outlaw asbestos.
The ruling by a three-person W.T.O. dispute panel is the first time the Geneva-based trade group has upheld a member nation's trade restriction to protect human health. "It's about time that they supported common sense, not narrow-minded, short-term corporate interests," said Remi Parmentier, a spokesman for Greenpeace, the environmental activist organization. The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions has also welcomed the W.T.O. asbestos ruling as a victory for worker safety.
Both groups, which are prominent critics of the W.T.O., share concerns with a broad alliance of activists who disrupted the W.T.O.'s meeting last December in Seattle with demonstrations accusing the trade group of favoring business interests over the environment and workers' rights.
The asbestos ruling is preliminary and still officially confidential, but word of its contents leaked out in June. The final ruling is expected next month or in September, after both sides submit their comments.
W.T.O. officials have declined to comment on the asbestos ruling because it is not final. The Canadian and French missions to the W.T.O. have also declined to comment. But no interim ruling has ever been reversed in the trade group's five-year history, and it is expected to be confirmed.
The asbestos case was filed two years ago by Canada on behalf of its mining and export industry against France, which had banned asbestos and asbestos products as hazardous to humans two years earlier. Canada has long been a leading exporter of asbestos, most of it mined in Quebec.
Canada had sent nearly 30,000 metric tons of asbestos yearly to France before the 1996 ban, said Denis Hamel, a spokesman for the Asbestos Institute, a Montreal-based trade group.
In arguments at the W.T.O., the Canadians said newer, safer forms of asbestos did not release fibers into the air as older products did. They argued that France could have adopted controls less restrictive than a ban.
It is unclear whether the W.T.O. ruling will lead to restrictions on asbestos by other member nations. Some of the initial approval of the ruling by W.T.O. critics has also tempered a bit.
Lucien Royer, health and safety officer for the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, said the asbestos ruling provided little guidance to how the W.T.O. might rule in similar cases where the safety of an export is challenged because the trade group's dispute-resolution process is not public information.
"How the panels select and incorporate information in these rulings is very, very murky," Mr. Royer said.
Others said the ruling might actually be more confusing than helpful in resolving other trade disputes over health and environmental concerns.
Mr. Parmentier said it was "too early to say whether this ruling will affect other cases or the E.U.'s precautionary principle." He was referring to the European Union's effort to establish a principle to justify bans on imports considered harmful to the environment or public health.
The test of that principle has been at the center of the continuing trans-Atlantic trade fight over hormones in American beef.
The trade organization has ruled that the beef is safe and the union's ban is illegal. But the union says that its scientific studies establish that the beef represented enough danger to human health to warrant not complying with the organization's ruling.

Boeing and Airbus Disclose Over $15 Billion in Orders

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: FARNBOROUGH, England, July 24

 BODY:
The Boeing Company and Airbus Industrie announced more than $15 billion in new orders today at the air show in Farnborough, an unexpectedly large sum that reflected the resilience of the commercial aircraft market.
The value of the orders disclosed by the companies, the world's only two builders of large airliners, far exceeded the $9.4 billion total that was announced at the last major international air show, in Paris, a little more than a year ago. 
 Industry experts had predicted that a boom in orders at the end of the 1990's would turn into a slump by this year. Instead, a rebound in Asian economies and the record United States economic expansion are giving the industry confidence that airlines will keep ordering new planes. Leasing companies dominated the buying announced today.
"The market continues to surprise us," said Jim McNerney, president of the GE Aircraft Engines unit of the General Electric Company.
Boeing won orders from the largest aircraft-leasing companies, the International Lease Finance Corporation and General Electric's plane-leasing arm.
International Lease said that it was buying 40 jetliners valued at a total of $6 billion, and the General Electric division is placing orders for some 74 planes worth a total of $5.5 billion.
Airbus, the European consortium, won an order from the leasing company CIT Group Inc. for 50 planes worth $3.6 billion. It also officially disclosed the first commitments for its 550-seat A3XX "superjumbo," bidding to end the 30-year-old monopoly in the jumbo market held by Boeing's 747.
Airbus said Emirates Airlines signed a memorandum of understanding and made an undisclosed deposit for seven of the aircraft for delivery starting in February 2006, with options for five more. Air France also signed a preliminary agreement for 10 of the planes, with options for 4 more.
Both airlines had already expressed interest in the planes. They carry a list price of about $220 million each, though they will not be included in the Airbus order tally until the company's board authorizes proceeding with the project and firm contracts are signed. Airbus hopes to get enough customers to approve production by the end of the year.
Airbus had 239 orders through June 30 and said it was likely to disclose 200 more during the show. That puts it roughly level with Boeing, which had 322 orders through June 30 and will have more than 430 once it signs definitive agreements with the leasing companies.
The air show was also the forum for regional jet makers to announce more than $6 billion in sales today, mostly for planes made by Bombardier Inc. of Montreal. Embraer, the Brazilian plane maker, announced a $500 million order.

HEADLINE: Shopping the Madison Avenue Of Manhasset (Don't Say Mall)

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY 

 BODY:
The two blond women with the tousled Frederic Fekkai haircuts were looking at snapshots over customized Cobbs (hold the ham, hold the cucumber, hold the avocado) at Millie's Place, the salads chased by iced tea, two Equals apiece.
"Does she look good or does she look good?" asked the first woman, a 48-year-old grandmother, who asked to remain nameless. 
 "Adorable," said her 50-year-old, anonymity-seeking friend. "So, how was Aspen?"
"Aspen was January. We're just back from Napa. So, are you loving this picture?"
"Beautiful. And what is she wearing?"
"Dior."
"How old is she now?"
"Six months."
This exchange took place at the Americana shopping center in Manhasset, N.Y., on Long Island's North Shore. Please don't say mall, though. The Americana at Manhasset is to "mall" as upper Madison Avenue is to Market Street in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Comparisons don't obtain.
For starters, there are few places in America where a handsome middle-aged woman dressed for a morning of tennis followed by light lunch and some shopping would not appear conspicuous wearing a crocodile Hermes belt ($1,495) over Ralph Lauren microfiber shorts ($95), a Jil Sander T-shirt ($300), a cotton sweater from Lacoste ($155), tan crocodile driving shoes from Tod's ($1,500) and carrying a beige alligator Kelly bag ($7,000). Even the woman's gold Rolex Oyster Perpetual Datejust ($15,900) was worn with the insouciance most folks might associate with a Timex.
But the Americana is not a most-folks destination. It is, as its developer, Frank Castagna, said, the "premiere shopping destination on Long Island." With its limestone facade, designed by the society architect Peter Marino; its swathes of meadow flowers and grasses, arranged by the modish landscape architects Oehme, van Sweden & Associates; its 225,000 square feet of retail space devoted almost exclusively to luxury brands; the Americana has become an alternate Madison Avenue, a mini Rodeo Drive, the parking lot where America's economic steamroller gets its ticket stamped.
"We're an off-the-radar oasis," said Deirdre Major, a spokeswoman for the Castagna Realty Company, although the Americana hasn't quite slipped the attention of Prada, Escada, Burberry, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan and Max Mara, which all maintain stores there, or of Louis Vuitton, whose Americana outpost averages annual sales "in the millions of dollars," a spokesman said.
The Americana's tenants include not merely such traditional carriage trade retailers as Tiffany & Company and Christofle, but also the members of the luxury pack currently dominating fashion retailing in the United States. Giorgio Armani opened a new franchise there just three weeks ago. Fendi and Hermes are both planning new boutiques for the fall. Hirshleifer's, the venerable retailer specializing in high-end apparel from Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel, is undergoing renovation to triple its selling space. And the accessories designer Kate Spade is also in the process of opening a stand-alone shop. It probably says something about a bull market that her location was formerly occupied by a bank.
The Americana, said John Slavinsky, a senior vice president for Vuitton, "is absolutely the best place to have a freestanding store on Long Island, bar none." It doesn't require a business degree from Wharton to understand the rationale for this, when even babies are wearing Dior.
"It's crazy," said Christina Makowsky, the owner of a Northern Boulevard boutique, Georgina, that is what you might call Americana-adjacent. "You can't believe the money people are throwing around these days. It's liquid millions. Even if you're rich, you're poor."
Of the 250 richest American towns recently cited by Worth magazine, 12 in the top 50 are a short drive from the Americana. The average household income of an Americana customer hovers around $125,000, Ms. Major said. But surely, as one shop owner remarked, that is too modest: "Maybe it's the salary for the maid."
Even as Nassau County wrangles with the state for a financial bailout, the Americana delivers Prada platform shoes and Gucci lug soles and Vuitton pastel logo bags to what Kiki Nolan, the manager for Thomas Pink at the Americana, called, "the richest people on Long Island," the ones that "you see at all the charity parties, the grand parties, the famous rich families of Long Island." Plenty of the Americana's customers seem to bypass fame, however, and head straight to rich.
"Communities have changed," said Steven B. Greenberg, of the Greenberg Group, retail consultants whose clients include Gucci. "Long Island's old guard has sold many of those old homes. The land has been subdivided. Instead of one $10 million home, you have a lot of $3 million homes owned by people in their 30's and 40's."
These people don't want to venture to Manhattan, he went on. "They want to buy luxury, but in a convenient setting." Consequently, rents approach $200 a square foot, a price unsurpassed in any suburban setting in America, Mr. Greenberg said. "That's right up there with the top shopping streets in America, but the volumes warrant it," he said. Retailers can realize a return of $1,000 a square foot, he added, although industry journals peg the figure closer to $850. Still, that is triple the average return at a mainstream mall.
It wasn't always so lucrative. "We had a disjointed center," said Mr. Castagna, whose family construction firm also built the Nassau Coliseum and the cell blocks at Rikers Island. When Mr. Castagna bought the land that would become the Americana from the developer William Levitt in 1956, he optimistically incorporated the new center as the Fifth Avenue of Long Island. As it turned out, he was off by an avenue and several decades. Among the early tenants were a Magic Pan and Baker's Shoes.
"At a certain point," he added, "we did a study and discovered that the land was more valuable with no buildings on it. We started a major move then to go in this direction." The direction was luxury. As it happens, the economy was headed that way, too.
And now, "the silent cash register is always ringing, silently," said a former buyer for Federated Department Stores, which in 1996 opened a $100 million specialty wing of its Bloomingdale's satellite at the Roosevelt Field mall to compete with Americana's luxury brands. "You walk into some of the stores," the buyer added, "and they're empty. But they've already done $50,000 that morning, selling sweaters to women who get bored at home and say, 'Let's order some stuff up.' "
The typical Americana consumer, added Lori Hirshleifer Sills, scion of a retailing business begun at the turn of the century in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, "is very high end. She's a 16 year old who comes to us for Gucci belts and accessories, and she's a woman in her 70's who's buying Chanel." She is a woman, said Josh Patner, a co-designer for Tuleh, a label that will soon have its own miniboutique in Hirshleifer's, "with a gorgeous car, a gorgeous home, who loves to look like a woman, and who is married to a man who loves women to look like women." There is one Hirshleifer's customer, Mr. Patner said, who owns "sapphires that match her Rolls." What retailer, he added, could ask for more?

HEADLINE: Jakarta Lawmakers Press Leader on Ousters

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, July 24

 BODY:
A surly standoff between Parliament and its first democratically elected leader dragged on today as more than 200 members rejected President Abdurrahman Wahid's explanation for why he had ousted two popular cabinet ministers.
The members signed a petition demanding that Mr. Wahid go before the House of Representatives again to explain his actions. Mr. Wahid outraged the lawmakers in an appearance on Thursday, when he refused to give an account of the dismissals, saying the House had no right to interrogate him. 
 The action today raises the heat in what has been a long summer of discontent. The president is scheduled to face a pivotal meeting of the People's Consultative Assembly on Aug. 7, in which he is quite likely to face sharp questions about his often turbulent nine months in office.
As the supreme legislative body, the People's Consultative Assembly could remove the president from office. Five hundred of its 700 members are from the House.
Yet, experts said, the lack of viable alternatives makes it highly unlikely that the assembly would oust Mr. Wahid -- at least for now.
But the deeply poisoned atmosphere has stirred fears that violence could mar the meeting next month. The government plans to deploy 29,000 army troops and police officers in this capital.
The tension has also hobbled the economic recovery. The currency, the rupiah, has tumbled 25 percent since January and now trades at levels reminiscent of the Asian economic crisis. Economic policy is paralyzed, as investors wait for Mr. Wahid to reshuffle his economic ministers after the Assembly session.
"Unless Wahid fixes the economy, he can't fix all these other things, because they flow out of people's sense of well-being or lack of well-being," said Gustav F. Papanek, a professor emeritus of economics at Boston University who is advising the government on economic policy.
On Saturday, Mr. Wahid apologized to the House for his remarks and pleaded with lawmakers to lay the matter to rest. But in a sign that his quirky charm is wearing thin, 252 members rejected the overture and mounted a scalding attack on his leadership. "The president should not issue any more baseless or controversial statements, because it could negatively affect the stock market, cause recklessness or confusion or trigger disputes among the public," the legislators said in their petition, which went to Speaker Akbar Tandjung.
Mr. Tandjung said the House would debate the petition after the Assembly had ended its session in the middle of next month. That all but guarantees that Mr. Wahid will remain under siege for the rest of the summer, though few political experts here say they believe that he is in danger of being ousted.
To some extent, the sparks between the legislature and the president are a symbol of how far Indonesia has come. Under the country's longtime leader, Suharto, the House was a rubber-stamp institution that did the president's bidding. Since Mr. Wahid was elected, the lawmakers and the Indonesian people have begun to demand openness and accountability from their politicians.
Mr. Wahid, a Muslim leader with frail health but a whip-sharp sense of humor, began his term with a wide-open style that suggested a break from the past. But in the last several months, his administration has been sullied by charges of corruption and arbitrary rule.
In April, Mr. Wahid abruptly dismissed two respected ministers, Laksamana Sukardi and Jusuf Kalla. In meetings with political leaders, Mr. Wahid has said the cabinet ministers had been tainted by allegations of graft. But he has not produced evidence to support those assertions.

HEADLINE: The Business of Politics;
Corporations Pour Money Into the Political Conventions

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
For Philip Morris, the imminent political conventions are not so much about nominating presidential candidates and building party loyalty as they are about, well, macaroni. Macaroni in the shape of donkeys. Macaroni in the shape of elephants. Macaroni the company plans to hand out to delegates.
This is macaroni with a purpose: to tell the assembled opinion makers and power brokers that Philip Morris is not just a tobacco company and hasn't been for some time, that it also sells other products -- Kraft macaroni among them. 
 For many, conventions have little to do with politics and a lot to do with business -- polishing civic and corporate images, exploiting marketing opportunities, courting influence and turning what has long been an exercise in democracy into a huge corporate festival. The dazzling corporate sideshows put this year's gatherings -- next Monday through Aug. 3 for the Republicans in Philadelphia; Aug. 14-17 for the Democrats in Los Angeles -- in a class with the Olympics and the Super Bowl.
It is not just major corporations like Philip Morris, which has bigger plans for the Republican gathering but is not ignoring the Democratic one. Cities, too, see a chance to bask in the spotlight. Armed with studies putting the economic benefits of playing host to a political convention at $100 million or more, over a dozen cities -- including New York, Indianapolis and San Antonio -- lined up to be picked, offering millions of dollars in local support. This largess comes on top of the $13 million the federal government gives each party to hold its four-day convention. Yet in this headlong marketing rush, many are concerned. Some contend that the economic benefits are vastly overblown, while the risk to a city's image is underrated. Others call the conventions orgies of cash, providing yet another route for corporations to buy political access. Still others say that as conventions have increasingly lost their political role of nominating candidates and rallying the party faithful, corporations have stepped in to fill the vacuum.
"The conventions have become Super Bowls of the influence of money on politics," said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington nonprofit group. "These are gala events where the most garish examples of excess appear."
The cities selected mounted all-out attacks to land the events along with promises of raising $35 million to $50 million in local funds for support services, mainly transportation, decorations and civic improvements. Tax-deductible contributions come to each city's host committee as cash or goods -- pagers from Motorola, software from Microsoft, discount tickets from US Airways and UAL's United Airlines.
Local governments kick in cash as well. Los Angeles donated $4 million to close a last-minute gap for the Democratic convention. Philadelphia's effort is supported with $17 million from the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania and the city government, along with a $20 million letter of credit.
To critics of campaign financing like Mr. Lewis, host committees have become a gray zone -- a way for parties to benefit from millions of unregulated dollars, raised with minimal disclosure and given out of civic pride as well as a desire to help one candidate. Even so, some cities, like Los Angeles, have struggled to raise enough money.
Critics may rage, but cities that have landed conventions -- both now and in the past -- are thrilled. Even also-ran cities like Indianapolis say they benefited. And corporations on both coasts, local suppliers to national brands, are bubbling with enthusiasm about their plans for the conventions.
"This is a fabulous opportunity," said Patrick McGranaghan, the vice president for marketing at Dale Carnegie Training and Associates, which is training thousands of corporate volunteers for Philadelphia. "We are putting Dale Carnegie in front of every major corporation in the Delaware Valley and showing them what we do. It gives them a taste of Dale Carnegie training, and we hope they will come back and ask for more."
Jeremy's MicroBatch Ice Cream, a three-year-old Philadelphia company that recently produced the first beer-flavored ice cream, plans to donate $10,000 worth of its product to the media center, where 15,000 reporters will work.
"We hope it gets hotter than blazes, so people will want something cool and refreshing," said Michelle Peranteau, a spokeswoman. "There will be hundreds of thousands of people descending on our city. That's hundreds of thousands we could turn into MicroBatch lovers."
On a bigger scale, companies like Philip Morris, Motorola, McDonald's and Microsoft have donated money or products, or both. "We welcome the opportunity to showcase our technology," said Norm Sandler, head of government relations for Motorola, which has supplied conventions since 1952 and will play host at a party to honor the House speaker, Dennis J. Hastert, the Illinois Republican.
Philip Morris gave $250,000 to the Philadelphia host committee, but the Los Angeles committee does not accept tobacco contributions. In Philadelphia, where the company will "sponsor" a downtown street to be temporarily renamed for the company, it will join other corporations in giving parties for politicians and delegates and it is giving away lots of food-related products. Besides the animal-shaped macaroni, it plans to stock hospitality suites and delegate "goody bags" with Altoids mints, Toblerone chocolates, Maxwell House coffee, Miller Beer and Philadelphia cream cheese.
"When you are in a business that has some controversial aspects," said Peggy Roberts, the company's director of communications, "it is important to our shareholders and employees that we try and build relationships in venues that are important to us."
In fact, when civic fund-raisers approach corporations, the pitch is often more about business than politics. After all, if a company wants political access, some say, it would be better off giving directly to the parties. "We try to sell it as a marketing experience and not as a political contribution," said Eli Broad, chief executive of SunAmerica and co-chairman of the L.A. 2000 Host Committee. Mr. Broad gave $1 million to the effort, along with $1 million from SunAmerica's parent company, AIG.
Each city has its own reason for seeking the spotlight. For Philadelphia, it is an opportunity to show off a spiffed-up downtown and a new convention center and to promote itself as a place to visit, do business and live. Los Angeles hopes the convention will erase memories of earthquakes, urban rioting and the O. J. Simpson trial and show the world that the city actually does have a downtown.
"We've had fires, rains and floods, everything but locusts," said Noelia Rodriguez, chief executive of the host committee. "Now we've turned the city around, and we believe it's our moment to shine."
Karen Buchholz, president of Philadelphia 2000, added, "Getting this convention is like a seal of approval for Philadelphia."
But for the cities, it is more than civic pride, there is real money to be had.. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago estimated in a study there would be a direct financial benefit to Chicago of $132 million from the 1996 Democratic convention.
"The hardest thing is to get people to come to your city in the first place," said Geoffry J. D. Hewings, a University of Illinois professor and the study's author. "Hopefully, they will be attracted to it and will come back. And there is a lot of ego associated with these conventions. Lots of people enjoy the nonfinancial benefits of being close to power."
Others say the benefits are overrated and the risks underplayed. Many cities already have a thriving hotel business in August that must be subtracted from any convention revenue. Besides, it is hard to imagine cities like Philadelphia or Los Angeles needing to raise millions to market themselves. And a backlash is possible if baton-wielding police crack down on unruly demonstrators. Cities can have their images tarnished, as Seattle found after the disorder at the World Trade Organization meeting in December.
"Does the convention make people say, 'Gee, I didn't know Los Angeles was there, maybe I'll go visit?' " said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College. "If you have a lame convention and fairly soporific candidates, it seems unlikely you would say, 'Boy, let's go see where Al Gore got nominated.' "
Roger Noll, an economics professor at Stanford University, added, "It seems crazy for anyone to claim that the image of New York or San Francisco or Chicago hinges on getting any of these kinds of events."
Cities that have been convention hosts, or have come close to landing one, disagree. "The event was fabulous for the city," said Susan Golding, mayor of San Diego, which was host to the 1996 Republican convention. "It brings a great deal of public attention and a general feeling that if you can handle a national political convention, well, you can handle just about anything."
Fred Sainz, former Republican convention planner and now head of the San Diego convention center, said cities craved the visibility more than the dollars.
"When reporters get bored with the conventions, as they do, they will write stories about the city," he said. "Larry King going live with the bay and the skyline and sitting there in a short-sleeved shirt in cool August breezes -- that does a lot."
Indianapolis was a finalist for the 2000 Republican convention, and Michael McDaniel, chairman of the state Republican party, said the city had benefited anyway. "We've had bookings in Indianapolis for events just as a result of being a finalist," he said. "They thought they should check us out for conventions. There is no way to put a price tag on that ripple effect."
Still, for all the perceived benefits, raising money is not easy. In the days before the 1996 San Diego convention, the city was about $5 million short, causing a worried Dole campaign to tap its donor list. In Philadelphia, while the host committee boasts of raising more than $40 million, only about $10 million of that is cash from corporations.
And fund-raising problems in Los Angeles have been the stuff of local headlines. Only two months before the convention was to begin, the host committee was still around $11 million short. The city contributed $4 million, and President Clinton came to Los Angeles to raise money, as well as lending his top fund-raiser, Terry McAuliffe, to twist arms. As of early this month, the city was still $4 million short.
As a result, when Ms. Rodriguez, head of the host committee, was interviewed earlier this month, she said Mayor Richard Riordan was in her office. What was he doing there? He was on the phone, she said, asking donors for money.

 BODY:
BP AMOCO introduced a new model of gas station yesterday, and the least important item for sale is the gas.
The prototype of what will be a nationwide line of new stations, called BP Connect, was outfitted with solar panels, and spiffed up with the new green, yellow and white BP sunburst-shaped symbol. Customers will be able to check the forecast for an impending thunderstorm on a small screen at the pump, buy a bottle of wine and some fresh-baked croissants at a neon-free supermarket inside, or log in to the latest news at an e-commerce kiosk. 
 The decidedly upscale new digs are a launching pad for the company's new $7 million rebranding campaign that aims to reposition BP Amoco, an old-economy gas station giant, into a progressive, environmentally friendly retailer that goes, in the company's own words, "beyond petroleum."
The decision to introduce a new brand image and spruce up its service stations comes at a time when, as gas prices increase, competition for customer loyalty is especially fierce. Not only must BP Amoco deal with the consumers' growing sentiment of hostility toward gas companies, it also has to figure out how to best use its four major brands: BP, Amoco, Arco, and Castrol.
The rebranding campaign was seen by brand analysts as a way of increasing operating margins.
"The retail petroleum business is a dull, boring and uninteresting business in which the drivers of preference are location and price, and brands have not played a very significant role in gas stations," said John K. Grace, executive director of Interbrand Corporation, a brand consulting company. "Because branding has been weak, consumers have a difficult time differentiating among top quality players. These petroleum manufacturers are missing the boat in terms of what role brand can play."
While the price at the pump may be on the minds of most drivers this summer, there is a "growing and large percentage of people who don't go to gas stations for gas," said Peter Dixon, senior partner at Lippincott & Margulies, a corporate identity consulting company owned by Marsh & McLennan.
Indeed, BP Amoco is looking to pull drivers into the stations' stores, where they can buy items that are more profitable to sell than gasoline. While filling their tanks, customers can order a cafe latte that will be waiting for them once they've finished pumping their gas. If they really want to rush, BP is working on wireless technology that will enable them to send in their payments ahead of time.
The goal is to have half of the stations' revenue coming from gas sales and the other half coming from the convenience store, Doug Ford, BP Amoco's chief executive for refining and marketing, told reporters yesterday at a Georgia test site for the new station. Currently, 80 percent of revenue comes from gasoline sales and the rest from retail sales.
"To me this is a real estate business," Mr. Ford said. "We're managing a particular site."
BP Amoco, which analysts say has always been particularly sensitive to brand identity, began discussing branding as soon as its $48.2 billion acquisition of Amoco was complete in January 1999. Both brands needed a face lift: Amoco's stations had kept the same design for the last 20 years and BP for the last 12. The company hired Landor & Associates, a division of Young & Rubicam, to research consumer attitudes toward the stations. Landor found that customers liked Amoco products but thought the red, white and blue stations were too dark. At the same time, they found the green and yellow BP colors appealing.
Sir John Browne, BP Amoco's chief executive, decided that if BP Amoco was going to be recognized as a global brand, it needed to have one strong identity, a company official said.
The advertising to promote the new brand image was created by Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group, which was named by BP Amoco as its global agency in November. The ads, which focus on BP's role as a green company, will start running in print and on television today. One commercial asks: "Is it possible to drive a car and still have a clean environment? Can business go further and be a force for good?" BP says it plans to spend $25 million a fiscal quarter on its branding campaign.
The first BP Connect stations will open in Indianapolis, Cleveland, and London this year. The second round of station openings will include Chicago, Atlanta, and Sydney, Australia. The prototype was tested in an old warehouse outside of Atlanta because of its proximity to the suppliers in charge of making the new pump with its LCD screen.
The largest BP Connect sites will be 4,200 square feet. They are airy and open: none of the center-aisle shelves are much taller than waist level.
The stores are divided into five sections: a food service section, a beverage section, an impulse-buying section with snacks, a convenience-store section and an Internet section. The lighting changes with each section. The food service section has a warm, golden glow while the milk-and-eggs portion of the convenience section has a flourescent tinge.
Inside the store, the offerings are localized: customers using the Paris station, for example, will be able to find foie gras.
"It sounds to me like what BP has done is that they woke up one morning and said you know something, we're not in the gasoline business, we're in the retail business," said Clive Chajet of Chajet Consultancy, a brand consulting firm. "BP has recognized that their product is a commodity and they are incapable on the product level to differentiate their brand from competitors.' "
But some critics, like Charles T. Maxwell, senior petroleum analyst at Weeden & Company, are not convinced that customers will benefit from some of the extra add-ons. "Maybe this is one stop shopping but I always like to go to a grocery store to buy my groceries," Mr. Maxwell said. "The grease and parts and shout and clatter and spilled gasoline don't go in my mind with matters of food."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
Broad Reorganization at I.B.M. Hints at Successor to Gerstner

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: ARMONK, N.Y., July 24

 BODY:
In the seven years since he took over, Louis V. Gerstner Jr. has led a striking revival in the fortunes of I.B.M., the world's largest computer company. Yet Mr. Gerstner, the chairman and chief executive, has decided that what the company most needs now is a good shake-up -- to accelerate its growth and achieve its goal of being the leading supplier of technology and services for the Internet economy.
So the International Business Machines Corporation announced a sweeping management overhaul today that includes the elevating of Samuel J. Palmisano, a senior vice president, to become president and chief operating officer. 
 The move clearly seems to make Mr. Palmisano, 48, the heir apparent to Mr. Gerstner, who is 58. Mr. Gerstner, who joined I.B.M. in 1993, when the company was reeling, has an employment contract that calls for him to remain in charge "at least until he turns 60 years of age," or until March 2002.
In a lengthy interview at the company's Westchester County headquarters here, Mr. Gerstner acknowledged that the announcement was certain to focus attention on the question of succession at I.B.M. But he noted that the elevation of Mr. Palmisano was one of several promotions of younger executives as part of the reorganization.
"A new generation of leaders is starting to emerge at I.B.M.," Mr. Gerstner said. "And certainly Sam is part of that, but so are a lot of other people here."
Besides, Mr. Gerstner noted, he has no intention of stepping down anytime soon. "I'm still here," he said. "I'm not going anywhere, and my job hasn't changed. And the board has not chosen my successor as C.E.O."
"There's not a lot you should read into this about me leaving," he added.
Also today, I.B.M. named John M. Thompson, another senior vice president, to become vice chairman. Under the new setup, Mr. Thompson will guide the company's efforts in such promising new areas of growth as wireless communication, network storage systems, life sciences and Internet software.
Yet Mr. Thompson is 57 and, given the I.B.M. tradition of having senior executives retire around 60, he seems to be a less likely successor to Mr. Gerstner than Mr. Palmisano. Mr. Gerstner praised Mr. Thompson as "a rare talent," and gifted manager of technical workers.
The company also promoted five other executives, all in their 40's.
While Mr. Thompson focuses on the future, Mr. Palmisano will be in charge of daily operations in all the company's product and service businesses. In an e-mail memo to I.B.M.'s senior management team today, Mr. Gerstner wrote of Mr. Palmisano, "Sam has consistently demonstrated the aptitude perhaps most critical to leadership success: He sets tough targets and then meets them."
In the interview, Mr. Gerstner said that the reorganization had less to do with executive succession than with retooling the company's management structure to execute its Internet strategy more effectively.
Indeed, the lingering question about the transformation at I.B.M. under Mr. Gerstner's leadership is whether, despite all the progress to date, the company is moving into that future quickly enough to offset the decline in some of its traditional businesses, like mainframe computers.
In its second-quarter financial results, reported last week, I.B.M. surpassed the earnings estimates of Wall Street analysts, but its revenue declined.
For the I.B.M. success story to be complete, it must deliver growing sales. The key to I.B.M.'s future as an investment, said Steven Milunovich, a Merrill Lynch analyst, writing in a bulletin to the firm's clients last week, is "figuring out if I.B.M. is a new-technology or an old-technology stock," and adding, "It's some of both now."
In Mr. Gerstner's view, the table is set for growth at I.B.M., based on its strategy of being a leading supplier to companies trying to make the transition to e-commerce.
In the second quarter, Mr. Gerstner noted that revenue for its e-business consulting grew 78 percent, that its specialized microchips for cellular phones and other wireless communications are sold out, and that it is straining to keep up with demand for the big hub computers, called servers, that shuttle data from and to Web sites.
The company's e-business strategy, set in place over the last few years, is working as planned, Mr. Gerstner said. "The business is exploding underneath us," he said. "And we need to have a very, very focused execution capability within the company."
He called today's announcement the "third turn of the wheel" in terms of corporate strategy since he took over in 1993. The first stage he characterized as survival, and the second involved putting the e-business strategy in place. The third, he said, is the execution stage. Mr. Gerstner, once a partner at the consultant McKinsey & Company, said that one of the most important lessons he learned there was the crucial "linkage between structure and strategy, and that you really don't implement an effective strategy without a structure that reinforces and complements that strategy."
Yet the shake-up, Mr. Gerstner says, was also influenced in part by an instinctive belief of his about corporate management.
"I am a big believer in forcing change on large institutions just for the sake of forcing change," he said. "The longer an organization stays intact, the less successful it is.
"I've been absolutely convinced that you've got to blow things up and start over again every few years, and that puts a whole new face on people's jobs. It gets people focused externally rather than internally."
The management organization, he said, is intended to "sharply delineate" the two major tasks facing I.B.M.: "the execution of today's e-business strategy, which will be led by Sam Palmisano, and that development -- the rapid development -- of the new e-business world that John Thompson will lead."
Shortly after he joined I.B.M., Mr. Gerstner said that the company, given its dire straits, did not need a grand technology vision for its future -- a comment that brought criticism and ridicule from industry analysts. He said he had been widely misquoted, and what he had tried to emphasize then was that I.B.M. most needed to right itself before gazing toward the horizon.
But there seemed to be plenty of talk about vision at the top today. Mr. Gerstner spoke of Mr. Thompson's job as helping to guide I.B.M.'s "billions upon billions of dollars" of investment in next-generation "intelligent infrastructure" for the Internet -- when vast numbers of devices, including cellular phones and Palm-like hand-held computers, would be connected to the Internet
"Today's networked world is primitive compared to what it's going to look like in three to five years," he said.

HEADLINE: Tax Break Program Is Expanded To Help More Depressed Areas

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
New York State has expanded a program that provides tax credits and other incentives for companies to invest in economically troubled areas, adding zones in which the incentives will be offered.
As a result of legislation authorizing the six new districts, which Gov. George E. Pataki recently signed into law, the state will soon send forms to all its municipalities and counties so that those that want such economic development zones may apply to have areas in their jurisdictions chosen. 
 Even as they report that the state's overall economy is on the upswing, state officials say they expect many applications because not every community has shared in the good times. When Mr. Pataki approved the legislation, he said the expansion "means we can do even more to ensure that every community across New York participates in the state's growing economy."
The measure will increase to 58 the number of zones under the program, which began in 1987 to help communities with high unemployment and poverty. The program was later expanded to aid areas hurt by the closing of military bases and other defense cutbacks.
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, which administers the program, said the latest addition of zones was part of an effort to "encourage even more opportunities for job creation" across the state.
Areas that already have such zones include East New York in Brooklyn, South Jamaica in Queens, Port Morris in the Bronx, East Harlem and cities like Buffalo, Albany, Rochester and Plattsburgh. Because of the criteria for the six new zones, three of them are likely to be in rural areas, state officials say.
Under the program, a company receives a basic tax credit of 25 percent of the amount of its investment for locating or expanding a business in a zone, or for investing in building a community facility, like a day care center, in a zone.
The new state budget added millions of dollars in tax credits to the program, the governor's office said, and at least 125,000 people have been employed at more than 2,600 businesses aided by the program. The program's name was recently changed from the Economic Development Zones Program to the Empire Zones Program.

HEADLINE: Back in Business After a Tempest And a Tea Room;
Storm Doomed Eclectic Gallery, But Owner Finds a New Venture

SERIES: AFTER THE FLOOD -- Last in a series.

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

DATELINE: DUNELLEN, N.J., July 20

 BODY:
Bettina DeCaumette wanted the old red jukebox out of the bar, rejecting it in the process of ending one business and starting another. So her bartender and partner grabbed the box from the dusty corner where it had blared out tunes like Bing Crosby's "Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral" for at least three decades, gave it a shove, rolling it into a small pantry in the back.
"When you're the hostess, you don't make your guests create the ambience," Mrs. DeCaumette said, putting on, instead, a CD called "Chicago Blues." 
 Ten months after Tropical Storm Floyd flooded her out, Mrs. DeCaumette is back in business. But she is not operating her Palmyra Tea Room and Art Gallery, the eclectic restaurant and gathering place she ran in nearby Bound Brook for five years, until Floyd filled it with eight feet of water on Sept. 16.
Because she has yet to find a suitable location to reopen the Palmyra in Bound Brook, about 35 miles southwest of Midtown Manhattan, she has become part owner of the Dunellen Hotel. The hotel is a careworn 14-room Victorian building on Washington Street here, just a few miles east of her old business.
A few weeks ago, Mrs. DeCaumette took over the restaurant and the Rathskeller bar in the hotel's basement, a neighborhood fixture since the mid-1930's.
While the Dunellen is not the Palmyra, Mrs. DeCaumette is grateful to be back in business after months of indecision and financial worries.
"I feel very fortunate because lots of people dream of owning their own place and never have the opportunity," she said recently as she presided over her small staff and a sparse lunchtime crowd in the bar. "I believe it's better to go out and do something, anything, rather than do nothing."
Floyd caused more than $1 billion in damage in New Jersey and brought normal life to an abrupt standstill for those who lost homes and businesses. In Bound Brook, on the banks of the Raritan River, which spilled over during the storm, hundreds of small-business owners like Mrs. DeCaumette had to struggle to resume their livelihoods.
A drive through the town shows that most businesses are up and running, but many storefronts are still empty or boarded up. And those who lived through the flood say the effects linger in ways that sometimes cannot be seen or measured. The town, for example, has been divided by a redevelopment plan. Hundreds of angry residents have filled borough council meetings to express their fears that the plan will require their homes to be condemned to make way for new construction.
Town officials, residents and business owners who suffered losses have spent months lobbying the state and the federal governments for financial assistance, which has come slowly. Last month, Congress appropriated $30 million in emergency public works and economic development money to rebuild stricken New Jersey downtowns.
This is in addition to money the state provided for grants to help individual business owners. Patricia Clark, the policy director for Somerset County, said her county received $5.7 million of that money, much of which is going to Bound Brook's business owners. So far, her office has taken grant applications from 287 businesses, and 257, including Mrs. DeCaumette's, have received them, she said. Mrs. DeCaumette was given $11,150 to get back on her feet, and she may qualify for $2,800 more, Ms. Clark said.
Mrs. DeCaumette was turned down for a $100,000 loan from the United States Small Business Administration. Even with her business closed and no cash coming in for the last few months, she still had to pay about $1,000 a month to creditors, including banks and vendors.
She and her husband, Patrick, and daughter, Celia, survived financially by relying on savings and keeping their living expenses down. Mr. DeCaumette, who had helped with the Palmyra before September, took a job with the Bound Brook office of the Salvation Army, which is still helping flood victims to resettle.
Mrs. DeCaumette said the family had gone through its modest savings and had since stopped eating out and traveling, as well as putting off almost all clothing purchases.
The family has also been helped by friends and family. Mrs. DeCaumette's mother, Aud Frislid, who ran an antiques store two doors down from the Palmyra that was also shut by the flood, helps by taking care of Celia. During the last 10 months, she also housed several of the Palmyra's employees, like Jim Brannon, who is now a bartender at the Rathskeller and part owner.
Still, the flood put a strain on them all. Mrs. DeCaumette spent many sleepless nights worrying about how to restart her business and what would happen to her employees. She said she grappled with depression as she wondered how her family would survive financially. "The emotional toll has been very high," she said.
"It's all stressful right now, but we're starting a new business, so it's normal," she added. "We just have to prioritize more carefully."
For a few months, she argued and fought with her old landlord, Phil Neri, who also owned the space Mrs. Frislid was leasing for the antiques business.
In the end, mother and daughter decided to part company with Mr. Neri over disputes about the rent and repairs to the waterlogged storefront space.
Mrs. Auslid, who lives in a Victorian house around the corner from the old tea room space on Hamilton Street, wants to restart her antiques business in her garage.
As for the Palmyra, Mrs. DeCaumette said she still dreamed of reopening it, but had been distracted from her search for a new site by her involvement with the Dunellen.
Mrs. DeCaumette owns 20 percent of the hotel and 80 percent of the restaurant and bar operation. Mr. Brannon, the bartender, will own 10 percent of the restaurant business. The hotel's majority owner is Evan Carzis, the DeCaumettes' landlord in another Bound Brook business, a spice and tea shop called the Woad and Madder. That shop, which was five months old when the floods came, has not reopened either. Mrs. DeCaumette is seeking the right time to resurrect the tea room.
"We've done as much as we could with Palmyra," she said. "Now we need to wait a little bit. We're watching the situation in Bound Brook very closely. Palmyra is still very much alive in our hearts."
To Mrs. Decaumette, the Palmyra was more than a business, and when it closed, she lost more than a way to making a living.
She started the Palmyra as a small operation that grew to be a popular meeting place that was part salon, part art gallery and part performance space. It also had a bookstore and a restaurant that offered a Middle Eastern menu. Mrs. DeCaumette worked as the chef in the Palmyra's early days, and until the fall was still sometimes the hostess, depending on whether anyone in her staff of 15 was absent. She was there almost every day, arriving about 11 a.m. and not going home until 2 or 3 a.m., after closing and preparing for the next day.
So in Dunellen, she's trying to revive an atmosphere as well as a business.
Many of her old staff members are returning. In addition to Mr. Brannon, there is Margo Frak, 16, who had been a waiter at the Palmyra for only a few months before it was flooded. Ms. Frak, a high school student, walked into the Palmyra once with her art teachers and saw the antique furniture and the artworks on the walls. "I said, 'This is cool,' " Ms. Frak recalled. " 'How can I get a job here?' " Four weeks later, she was hired. Then came the flood.
Another of Mrs. DeCaumette's waiters has been working as a reservations assistant at the Ryland Inn in nearby Whitewater, a business owned by friends, but she coming to work at the Dunellen next month. Mrs. DeCaumette's head chef, Kirsten Hansson, had been working at Trader Joe's, a specialty market, but this month began working at the Rathskeller.
The Dunellen Hotel is strikingly different from the Palmyra. It had been run for 52 years by the same owner, Lawrence Kerwin, whose father owned it before him.
The Rathskeller, with its dark stone walls and red checkerboard linoleum floors, had been something of a neighborhood bar for years, and Mr. Kerwin served light fare in addition to his chicken pot pie and carrot cake.
It had a variety of loyal customers, from people who would plant themselves at the bar most of the afternoon to an after-church crowd on Sundays.
Mrs. DeCaumette will give it something of her own twist, with new music and a menu that will continue to provide the usual bar fare, with gradual additions like a smoked trout salad and onion soup. But mostly, she wants it to remain a neighborhood gathering place.
She marvels at finding herself running a bar in the basement of a rundown hotel built in 1869 in a little town called Dunellen.
"I never in a million years thought this is where I was going to be a year after the flood," she said. "That, on a daily basis, is hard to adjust to."
Still, she's finding out that while adversity can turn a life upside down, plenty of things that were issues before the flood remain issues after it.
So when she was not working, she had time to think about her overstressed life and long hours, and she resolved to strike a better balance between work and family.
"We're working hard for me to set boundaries for the well-being of my family, and my sanity too," she said.
But, while she plans to take at least one day off in her new job, she has so far found herself working almost as many hours as she did at the Palmyra.
Still, she strives for balance and keeps in mind the strange twists that life can bring.
"You just have to be more accepting of the things you can't control and to really be open about where life takes you no matter how goal oriented you are," she said. "You can't determine where you're going to be in five years or even six months. That's the big lesson."
 
After the Flood
This is the last in a series of articles examining the rebuilding efforts by the owners of the Palmyra Tea Room and Art Gallery, who were among thousands of residents and business people in Bound Brook, N.J., whose lives were disrupted by Tropical Storm Floyd.
