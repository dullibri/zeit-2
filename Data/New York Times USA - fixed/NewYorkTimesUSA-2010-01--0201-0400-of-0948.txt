HEADLINE: Seeing Old Age as a Never-Ending Adventure

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: OCALA, Fla. 

 BODY:
Ilse Telesmanich, 90, sprained her ankle hiking in South Africa last August. She tried to keep going on the three-week trip, she said, hobbled as she was.
 ''I got very good at hopping on one foot the last time I sprained it,'' she said. 
 But the guides had unfortunately failed to bring along any crutches -- let alone walkers. So Ms. Telesmanich cut the trip short, but she is planning on leaving her home here in central Florida this summer to complete what she started. 
 Tom Lackey, 89, also continued to embrace adventure late into life, in his case as a way past the grief of losing his wife to a heart attack 10 years ago. 
 Mr. Lackey took up wing-walking. Last summer, he strapped his feet to the top of a single-engine biplane, like the daredevils of aviation's early days, and flew across the English Channel at 160 miles per hour -- with nothing between him and the wild blue yonder but goggles and layers of clothing to fight the wind-chill.
 ''My family thinks I'm mad,'' Mr. Lackey said in a telephone interview discussing the flight -- his 20th wing-walk. ''I probably am.''
 Intensely active older men and women who have the means and see the twilight years as just another stage of exploration are pushing further and harder, tossing aside presumed limitations. And the global travel and leisure industry, long focused on youth, is racing to keep up.
 ''This is an emerging market phenomenon based on tens of millions of longer-lived men and women with more youth vitality than ever imagined,'' said Ken Dychtwald, a psychologist and author who has written widely about aging and economics. 
 And the so-called experiential marketplace -- sensation, education, adventure and culture, estimated at $56 billion and growing, according to a new study from George Washington University -- is where much of that new old-money is headed.
 At the Grand Circle Corporation, for example, a Boston-based company that specializes in older travelers, adventure tours have gone from 16 percent of passenger volume in 2001 to 50 percent for advance bookings this year, even as the average traveler's age has risen to 68 from 62.
 At Exploritas, a nonprofit educational travel group previously known as Elderhostel, the proportion of people over 75 choosing adventure-tour options is up 27 percent since 2004. The sharpest growth has been in the over-85 crowd, more than 70 percent.
 At VBT, a bike touring company in Vermont that does rides in countries around the world, the number of bikers over 70 has doubled in the last 10 years.
 ''Unusual is way more popular now,'' said Alan E. Lewis, chairman of Grand Circle, ''and with this audience, that's a major shift.''
 But the era of geriatric derring-do is also bringing new questions.
 Take travel medical insurance. At InsureMyTrip.com, an online company, coverage that costs $15 for a 45-year-old runs four times that much or more for the same trip at age 85, and evacuation coverage for medical emergencies is not available at all through the company's provider after that age. 
 Doctors are also struggling with new issues that uniquely affect many older travelers, like how to pack and protect medications that must be carried into the outback or the tundra without getting too hot, too cold, or lost. 
 ''Everybody's reading the handwriting on the wall,'' said Dr. Jay Lemery, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, which started one of the nation's first fellowships a few years ago in trauma treatment for the active elderly.
 Some pursue challenges close to home, mastering a headstand or the perfect side crane balance on a yoga mat. Others go far afield. 
 At Mount Everest Base Camp, in the Himalayas, for example, doctors at the medical tent now regularly see trekkers suffering from age-related maladies. But Dr. Eric L. Johnson, a physician in Idaho who has worked at Everest, also camped next to a 74-year-old woman who made it to 28,000 feet on the mountain, only about 1,000 feet from the summit, before she turned back.
 Other experts in wilderness medicine say they think technology has diminished the perception of risk that, in past generations, might have kept people on the front porch.
 ''A leg fracture hiking the Inca Trail seems less frightening now, in the age of cellphones and satellite phones,'' Dr. Lemery said. ''So people go on these adventures and think, 'I can get out of there if something goes wrong.' ''
 But some emergency medicine and rescue experts also say that older people might in fact be safer in adventurous, high-exertion activities and environments than their younger counterparts, or at least no less safe. And some use an old-fashioned word to explain why: wisdom.
 ''It's still the same knuckleheads getting in trouble or coming unprepared; young people, mostly,'' said Sgt. Bob Silva of the Eagle County Police Department in the central Colorado Rockies, who regularly gets called for search-and-rescue duty. 
 There is a certain pride of place that comes with age, too. 
 When Charles Smith, 89, a retired engineer from Delray Beach, Fla., was heading for the South Pole a few years ago, for example, a woman got off the plane at base camp and started bragging about being 80. She was quickly put in her place.
 ''One of the fellows in our group tapped her on the shoulder and said, 'I don't want to prick your balloon, but there are three in our group who are older,' '' Mr. Smith said.
 Sometimes, motivation strikes like lightning. After Betty Beauchemin's husband died in 2006, she said, she just about shut down. 
 Then, one day in 2008 after attending a workshop on goal-setting near her home in Cranston, R.I., Ms. Beauchemin, 80, was sitting on a beach and had an inspiration: She wanted to go parasailing for the first time in her life -- which she proceeded to do. That winter, she started skiing again.
 Physiological luck plays a role, too. Ms. Telesmanich, whose sprained ankle has healed well, said she grew up athletic, playing sports with the boys, and never stopped.
 For his part, Mr. Lackey, a retired builder in England, said he was preparing for his 90th birthday next May with an attempt to be the first person, of any age, to wing-walk both directions across the English Channel.
 A friend from Mr. Lackey's church, Sue Pitham, 49, said the first wing-walk seemed morbid to her, coming as it did from grief.
 ''I think the first one was a bit of a death wish, to be honest,'' she said. ''But then he realized he was an adrenaline junkie.''
 Ms. Pitham said a stroke that Mr. Lackey suffered about six years ago slowed him down some, but not much. ''He just needs a little more help getting on top of the plane now,'' she said.

HEADLINE: A Safety Net That Tangles Investors

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

DATELINE: In the wake of a series of Ponzi schemes 

 BODY:
-- the most notable being the Bernard Madoff fraud -- the Securities and Exchange Commission voted last month to tighten the rules and make it much harder for money managers to misappropriate client funds.
 ''Where an independent custodian holds client assets, the risk of client assets being misused is limited,'' said Mary Schapiro, the commission chairwoman. 
 A custodian holds the securities purchased by a money manager, assuring that they exist and that the money realized when they are sold is properly applied. Mr. Madoff's firm served as custodian for its investments, meaning that he was free to not really invest the money that came in from customers. There was a similar arrangement in the Bayou hedge funds run by Samuel Israel. Both Mr. Madoff and Mr. Israel are now in prison.
 ''At a stroke,'' said John C. Coffee, a Columbia law school professor, in testimony to a Senate committee, ''this requirement eliminates the ability of the manager to recycle funds from new to old investors.'' 
 Well, it should. 
 Some of the people who lost money in the Madoff fraud had a custodian agreement with a bank. So far, they are worse off than they would have been if they had not had such an agreement.
 And therein lies a tale raising the question of just what a custodian needs to do. It also shows the perverse effect of a federal law that has kept that group of victims, some of whom lost only a few hundred dollars, and others who lost millions from filing a class-action suit. If some of the victims do not file their own suits, or join in the existing litigation, they could fail to recover any money even if the bank is later held to be liable.
 The bank is Westport National Bank, a unit of Connecticut Community Bank. It had a deal to funnel money into the Madoff fund from small pension funds and from individual retirement accounts, in return for fees based on the value of the holdings.
 The form signed by clients was called a custodian agreement, and it said the bank ''shall maintain adequate records indicating the ownership by the principal of investments with BLMIS and held by the bank as custodian for the principal.'' The client was called the principal, and the initials stood for Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities.
 On its face, argues David S. Golub, a lawyer in Stamford, Conn., representing about 20 of Westport's clients, that contract means Westport promises to take custody of the assets Madoff bought on behalf of the clients, something that did not happen.
 It is diverting, if nothing else, to speculate on what might have happened had Westport demanded to hold the assets as custodian. Since the assets did not exist, Mr. Madoff presumably would have had to refuse to do business with Westport. Might an explanation of that decision have prompted questions leading to a disclosure of the fraud years earlier? We'll never know.
 As it is, the only source of recovery so far for Madoff victims is payments from the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, the government-created brokerage insurance company. That insurance has a limit of $500,000 per account. Had Westport's customers dealt directly with Madoff, each of them would be eligible for that amount, or for their total losses if that figure was lower. But SIPC views Westport as having one account, so $500,000 is the maximum for all Westport's customers combined.
 What is Westport's view of the merits of the case? So far, that is not on the record. ''We feel we acted properly,'' said Richard T. Cummings Jr., the president of Westport's parent company, when I spoke to him briefly this week. But he declined to go into details.
 The lawsuit filed by Mr. Golub has bounced around. He filed it as a class-action suit in state court in Connecticut. The bank got it moved to federal court and argued there that it was really a securities class-action suit, which under federal law could not be heard in state court. A federal judge agreed in part, dismissing part of it and sending the rest back to state court.
 The judge ruled that it could not be heard as a class-action suit at all. Unless that ruling is overturned on appeal, a victory for Westport customers would do nothing for customers who did not sue.
 The arguments so far have centered on whether the case fell under a federal law called the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998. That law was passed to stop class-action lawyers from using state courts to litigate securities suits that would not be allowed in federal court.
 The result, for someone reading filings in the Westport case, is reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland. The bank says that because the alleged conduct is outrageous, the case must be thrown out.
 ''WNB's allegedly fraudulent statements led plaintiffs to believe that their security holdings were safeguarded by a trusted bank,'' the bank's lawyers argued. That meant it was a securities law complaint, and thus should be dismissed.
 The bank added that the clients chose Mr. Madoff, and that in suing the bank they were simply looking for a ''deep pocket'' because they had no hope of recovering money from the real culprit.
 Mr. Golub said in an interview that he did not think there was a strong securities case against the bank, and so did not want to file one. The violation of state contract law is clear, he argued.
 But the judge concluded the case did have securities aspects, and thus could not be heard as a state class action. 
 The account statements Westport's clients received over the years did not say what securities they owned. Instead, the bank issued reports as if there were two funds, BLM1 and BLM2, in which clients had stakes. The customers were told they had shares of one security or the other, and were assessed fees based on the value reported by Mr. Madoff. 
 If this case ever goes to trial, the bank might argue that it simply acted as a bookkeeper for its clients, and had no responsibility for the accuracy of the valuations. If that is true, it will raise questions of just what value customers got from signing a custodian agreement.
 The bank was told regularly by Mr. Madoff what securities were held on behalf of Westport's clients, but the bank did not choose to relay that information to the clients until after the Ponzi scheme was exposed.
 Then the bank sent out a notice telling clients the most recent information it had. The list was evidently produced a little hurriedly; it included shares of ''Exxon Mobile'' and ''Goldman Sacchs.'' There were some holdings of stock index options, but mostly it was a list of blue-chip stocks, with the largest positions in Exxon, General Electric, AT&T and Johnson & Johnson.
 Whether or not Westport is legally liable, it would have been nice if it had, just once, asked to see proof that those shares really existed. That is, after all, one reason that custodians exist.

 CLAYTON BROTHERS QUINTET (Friday through Tuesday) John Clayton, a bassist, and Jeff Clayton, a saxophonist, have been sharing bandstands for more than 30 years, and their rapport, captured on a recent album called ''Brother to Brother'' (ArtistShare), feels like a stout and uncomplicated thing. In this band they enlist the canny young pianist Gerald Clayton (John's son), as well as the trumpeter Terell Stafford and the drummer Obed Calvaire.

 FORWARD FLIGHT (Wednesday and Thursday) Subtitled ''A Gathering of Brass in Contemporary Music,'' this four-day affair is a subseries of the Festival of New Trumpet Music. Its kickoff gala, beginning at 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday, is a tribute to Wilmer Wise, a Philadelphia trumpeter whose groundbreaking career has reflected an equal footing in jazz and classical music. (Mr. Wise is on the bill alongside Dave Douglas, the festival's founder.) Thursday's offerings will include the New York Trumpet Ensemble, playing music by Charles Wuorinen (at 7:30 p.m.); Mr. Wise, tackling chamber works by Ornette Coleman (9 p.m.); and a series of miniature world premieres, performed by trumpeters like Tim Byrnes and Stephanie Richards (6:30 p.m.).

 DAVID GILMORE AND NUMEROLOGY (Tuesday through Thursday) David Gilmore favors the clean guitar tone of George Benson, but his playing tends more toward rhythmic aggression and sharp corners. He appears here with Numerology, a constellation of fierce talent that includes Claudia Acuna on vocals, Miguel Zenon on alto saxophone, Christian McBride on bass, Mino Cinelu on percussion and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan , (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $25. (Chinen)20100107
 FRED HERSCH TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) For much of the last decade, the pianist Fred Hersch led a graceful and purposeful trio with Drew Gress on bass and Nasheet Waits on drums. Here he re-enlists Mr. Gress but joins forces with the drummer Paul Motian, with whom he has played just once before (in Charlie Haden's Liberation Music Orchestra, for a single week in the 1980s). Mr. Motian is a stubborn poet of shading and pulse, and for someone as conscientious as Mr. Hersch, he should be a terrifically provocative foil. (Through Jan. 17.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village , (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)20100107
 CONRAD HERWIG'S LATIN SIDE ALL-STAR BAND (Monday) Mr. Herwig, a trombonist and arranger, has carved out a niche: ''The Latin Side of Herbie Hancock'' (Half Note), due out this year, is his latest attempt to subject jazz's modernist masters to an Afro-Caribbean revision.

At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village , (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $25 at tables, $15 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)20100107
 JON IRABAGON (Saturday and Monday) Mr. Irabagon, an energetic and proficient young alto saxophonist, leads two distinct groups in the coming days, each a reflection of his personality. His quintet -- with the trumpeter Brandon Lee, the pianist Adam Birnbaum, the bassist Peter Brendler and the drummer Donald Edwards -- plays concise, well-reasoned post-bop, as heard on ''The Observer'' (Concord), his most recent album. That group appears on Saturday; on Monday Mr. Irabagon, Mr. Brendler and the drummer Kevin Shea make up the Rollins Trio, invoking the precedent of Sonny Rollins and basing a full set's outcome on the marathon explication of a single tune. Saturday at 10 p.m., Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 675-6056, fatcatmusic.org. Monday at 9 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, near Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn , (718) 218-6934, zebuloncafeconcert.com; no cover. (Chinen)20100107

Rounding out the group are a few future prospects: the multireedist James Spaulding, the bassist David Williams and the drummer Al Foster. (Through Jan. 17.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway , (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)20100107
 INGRID LAUBROCK QUARTET (Wednesday) Ingrid Laubrock, a German-born tenor and soprano saxophonist who is based in Britain, works here with Mary Halvorson, a shrewdly slippery guitarist; John Hebert, a stalwart bassist; and Tom Rainey, a stark, suggestive drummer. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village , (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a $7 minimum. (Chinen)20100107
 JO LAWRY TRIO (Monday) ''I Want to Be Happy'' (Fleurieu) is the prepossessing debut from Ms. Lawry, an Australian jazz singer with a springlike tone, a nimble technique and a grasp of shading and pacing. Here, in intimate quarters, she leads a supportive trio with Matt Clohesy on bass and Steve Cardenas on guitar. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Bar Next Door, 129 Macdougal Street, West Village , (212) 529-5945, lalanternacaffe.com; cover, $12, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)20100107
 TONY MALABY (Monday and Tuesday) Mr. Malaby, a saxophonist of broad imagination and fearless disposition, leads two groups next week, each worthy. On Monday he reunites the band from ''Paloma Recio'' (New World), one of the better slept-on jazz releases of 2009: the guitarist Ben Monder, the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the drummer Nasheet Waits. On Tuesday he enlists a favorite frontline partner, the trumpeter Ralph Alessi, as well as the bassist Drew Gress and the drummer Billy Drummond. Monday at 8 and 9 p.m., the Local 269, 269 East Houston Street, at Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 254-5420, rucma.org; $10 per set, or $20 for the night; $7 per set for students, or $15 for the night. Tuesday at 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village , (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)20100107
 RUSSELL MALONE QUARTET (Friday and Saturday) On his most recent album, ''Live at Jazz Standard, Volume Two'' (MaxJazz), Russell Malone reasserts his stature as a prime guitarist in the jazz mainstream. He's likely to manage a similar feat with this quartet, which includes Rick Germanson on piano, Tassili Bond on bass and Ulysses Owens on drums. At 8, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street , (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $30. (Chinen)20100107
 BRAD MEHLDAU (Thursday) Mr. Mehldau has established himself as one of the standout jazz voices of his generation, partly through a run of intensely lyrical solo piano recitals. This one is a benefit for the jazz education organization JazzReach. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea , (866) 468-7619, highlineballroom.com; $35; $75 for the VIP package. (Chinen)20100107

 JANE MONHEIT (Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) On ''The Lovers, the Dreamers and Me'' (Concord), Ms. Monheit sings achingly about love lost and gained, expanding her repertory (to songs by Fiona Apple, Paul Simon and Corinne Bailey Rae) but rarely budging from her fallback stance of simmering melodrama. Still, the pristine clarity of her voice is a remarkable asset, and when she remembers to lighten up, she can be wickedly effective. (Through Jan. 16.) Sunday at 7 p.m.; Tuesday through Thursday at 8:30 and 11 p.m.; Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton , (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 for side seating, $40 for center seating.

 MOSTLY OTHER PEOPLE DO THE KILLING (Friday) Rampaging through the jazz tradition is the sport of choice for this four-piece free-bop band, led by the bassist Moppa Elliott and featuring the trumpeter Peter Evans, the alto saxophonist Jon Irabagon and the drummer Kevin Shea. ''Forty Fort'' (Hot Cup), the group's fourth album, is a characteristic thrill ride, prankish in its affect but gravely serious in its execution. At 9 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, near Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn , (718) 218-6934, zebuloncafeconcert.com; no cover. (Chinen)20100107
 STEVE NELSON QUARTET (Sunday and Monday) On his most recent album -- ''Sound-Effect'' (HighNote), a typically engaging effort from 2007 -- the vibraphonist Steve Nelson works with an ace rhythm section that includes his favorite pianistic foil, Mulgrew Miller. Here he enlists not only Mr. Miller but also the great bassist Ron Carter and the veteran drummer Louis Hayes. At 11:30 p.m. and 1:30 a.m., FB Lounge, 172 East 106th Street, East Harlem , (212) 348-3929, fondaboricua.com; cover, $20. (Chinen)20100107
 JEFF NEWELL'S NEW-TRAD OCTET (Thursday) This aptly named band led by the saxophonist Jeff Newell appears as part of the Bargemusic concert series, with a respectfully revisionist set of early jazz, gospel and parade music.

 NYC WINTER JAZZFEST (Friday and Saturday) For New York City jazz fans the Winter Jazzfest has become a perennial postholiday splurge and a righteous kick-start to the new year. Held this year in five separate clubs, all within a tight radius in Greenwich Village, it puts forth a profusion of available talent with an unspoken emphasis on cosmopolitan chic. For highlights, see the feature elsewhere in this section; for a full schedule and ticket information: winterjazzfest.com.

The results are sure to be buoyant; they may also be dazzling.

 DAFNIS PRIETO SI O SI QUARTET (Friday) On his most recent release, ''Live at Jazz Standard'' (Dafnison), the irrepressible Cuban drummer Dafnis Prieto leads a working band -- with Peter Apfelbaum on saxophones, Manuel Valera on piano and Charles Flores on bass -- in a smartly rollicking sort of interplay. Much the same cohort surfaces here, with the supremely qualified Johannes Weidenmuller replacing Mr. Flores. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village , (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $15; $10 for members. (Chinen)20100107

This one-nighter will feature strong contributions -- from the likes of the alto saxophonist Steve Wilson, the tenor saxophonist Donny McCaslin and the guitarist Ben Monder -- but its true strength lies in a virtually unsurpassed ensemble cohesion. At 7 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton , (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)20100107

 MCCOY TYNER TRIO WITH GARY BARTZ, FRANCISCO MELA'S CUBAN SAFARI, JONATHAN BATISTE BAND (Friday) The rumble and sweep of McCoy Tyner's pianism has quieted a bit over the years, but he's still a commanding voice, and he has some proven chemistry with Mr. Bartz, an ever-searching alto saxophonist. A pair of opening sets will feature Mr. Mela, a dynamic and mischievous Cuban drummer, with a promisingly named group; and the percussive New Orleans pianist Jonathan Batiste, with a band of his own. At 8 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea , (866) 468-7619, highlineballroom.com; $25. (Chinen)20100107

HEADLINE: Despite Work for U.S. Forces, Iraqi Is Denied a Green Card

BYLINE: By KATIE FRETLAND

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Nada Alkhaddar spends her days at the Muslim Women Resource Center helping refugees and immigrants deal with government and commercial bureaucracies that can make life in the United States seem about as easy as computing the Alternative Minimum Tax. 
 ''We help anyone, Muslims or Christians, from here or anywhere in the city,'' Ms. Alkhaddar said as she guided an Eastern European man through a long questionnaire from a local bank. She adjusted her hijab and smiled as she worked in an office overlooking Devon and Western Avenues, an Indo-Pakistani neighborhood just north and west of downtown.
 Despite her skills at navigating the obstacles immigrants face, Ms. Alkhaddar cannot seem to help the person closest to her and her three children -- her husband, Ahmed Alrais -- who is trying to get a green card. 
 Mr. Alrais came to the United States in the spring of 2008 after his life had been threatened for working as an interpreter for the United States Army in Iraq. Unable to find a job during the recession and without a green card, he returned in February to the country he had fled to work again for the Army through a private contractor. 
 Federal officials at United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Department of Homeland Security, will not give Mr. Alrais credit for the time he has spent on a United States military base overseas so he can fulfill an American residency requirement to get the green card. His application was denied in November.
 Mr. Alrais, 51, struggles to understand a system that would have given him a green card if he had stayed in the United States for the full year without a job, instead of working with American forces in Iraq. 
 ''That's confusing; that's very confusing,'' Mr. Alrais said Wednesday via Skype from northern Iraq. ''We get hit by mortars, like, I don't know, once or twice a month, and when we go out, we don't know when we are going to be attacked, and sacrificing being here away from our families.''
 Despite the turmoil and political controversy over how easily some immigrants enter the United States illegally, Mr. Alrais's experience shows how formidable the challenges can be for many refugees and immigrants -- even those with families in the United States and seemingly solid credentials. 
 ''He serves the country with his life in such a dangerous place,'' said Ms. Alkhaddar, 50, who keeps a purple folder full of government papers relating to her husband's case at her apartment on Chicago's North Side. 
 The folder contains documents like their marriage license, as well as letters of recommendation from Mr. Alrais's military supervisors in Iraq. 
 ''He has been very supportive of our presence, helped our soldiers and has been a loyal friend to us,'' said Maj. James B. Phillips of the Army in one letter, which also described Mr. Alrais as ''trustworthy and dependable.'' Major Phillips worked with Mr. Alrais in 2003.
 In an e-mail message this week from Iraq, Major Philips said Mr. Alrais was an outstanding interpreter whom he highly respected.
 ''The troops and I also liked him because when we first met he had a Mustang that he would drive to work every now and then,'' the major said. ''It was always nice to see a classic American car while deployed.''
 Fred Tsao, policy director at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, said Mr. Alrais's ordeal to secure a green card was ''crazy.''
 ''To go back and face the dangers while serving this country and then be denied a green card seems really unfair,'' Mr. Tsao said. ''It's an awful deterrence to making a contribution to the country that took you in. Something is terribly wrong here.''
 Ms. Alkhaddar and Mr. Alrais fled their home in Baghdad in 2006 after his work for the United States Army in 2003 and 2004 made him a target for Iraqis angered by the invasion. 
 ''A lot of people were assassinated just because they had a contract working with the U.S. forces,'' Mr. Alrais said. 
 A grocer refused to sell food to his youngest son, Mohamed. ''He said, 'We will never sell anything for you because of your father,' '' Ms. Alkhaddar said. ''He came home crying. They start kidnapping people. For our safety we moved.''
 The family went to Egypt for two years, where they lived in a compound called Beverly Hills outside Cairo. They came to the United States as refugees in May 2008, as the recession was hitting the American job market. 
 Even though Mr. Alrais had the proper documentation for a refugee and was a chef trained in France, he could not find a good job in Chicago to support his family. He left the United States in February to work in Iraq as an interpreter with Global Linguist Solutions, a contractor based in Virginia that provides translators to the American military.
 Mr. Alrais's wife and children stayed behind, planning to apply for citizenship for the family after they had met the residency requirement of one year. May was their one-year anniversary, and Ms. Alkhaddar and the children were given green cards. But Mr. Alrais's application was denied. 
 In a letter to Mr. Alrais in November, Donald P. Ferguson, the Chicago field office director of Citizenship and Immigration Services, said Mr. Alrais had not met the residency requirement because he had not been in the United States for a full year after he arrived. Because of his work with the military in Iraq, he was away from Feb. 19 until Sept. 11, 2009. 
 Mr. Ferguson wrote that being on an American territory on a military base in Iraq did not count toward residency. ''The service is unable to consider your time working in Iraq to fulfill the physical presence requirement for adjustment of status purposes,'' he wrote. 
 Mr. Ferguson cited another problem with the application: Mr. Alrais had given his power of attorney to his wife so she could apply for the green card for him while he was overseas. Ms. Alkhaddar submitted an Internal Revenue Service form showing she held his power of attorney, but the Department of Homeland Security does not accept that form as sufficient proof of power of attorney, Mr. Ferguson said.
 Mr. Ferguson did not return phone calls requesting comment. Marilu Cabrera, an agency spokeswoman, said the agency would not comment on any specific cases.
 Thomas Ragland, an immigration lawyer in Washington who previously worked for the Department of Justice and the Board of Immigration Appeals, said the immigration system could be impossible for the average person to handle.
 ''Even some average lawyers out there are not very good at navigating it,'' Mr. Ragland said, ''even though they charge for it.''
 Mr. Ragland said Mr. Alrais, who plans to come to Chicago later this month to plead his case, deserved an advocate to help him get a green card, considering how members of Congress and the military had spoken about the importance of taking care of Iraqis who aid the armed forces.
 Ms. Alkhaddar keeps in touch with her husband over her computer at home, telling him how the children are doing. 
 Their oldest son, Amro, 27, is a mechanic on Chicago's South Side. Their daughter, Shahad, 21, is an interior design student at Harrington College downtown. Their youngest son, Mohamed, is a sophomore at Mather High School, where he plays football. 
 Mohamed, 17, dreams of being a Chicago policeman. ''For America,'' he said.

HEADLINE: For Those Who Want to Play the Field

BYLINE: By JORDAN MacKAY. 
Jordan Mackay is the author of ''Passion for Pinot: A Journey Through America's Pinot Noir Country'' (Ten Speed Press, 2009).

 BODY:
Included on my list of New Year's resolutions was an old favorite: a commitment to drink less -- particularly on weeknights, particularly wine. 
 It's a challenge. At my house a bottle of wine has a will. The instant its cork is removed, it wants to be finished, and a singular 750-milliliter bottle often seems to either be just too much or just slightly too little for my wife and me.
How to make this resolution easier to keep? We considered self-restraint, but were dissuaded by the high degree of difficulty. 
 And then I thought of half-bottles, an underappreciated format. If we started out with a 375-milliliter bottle, we could easily gratify the bottle's desire to be finished, but not have to stumble into bed without doing the dishes. 
 The problem with half-bottles is that few wineries bottle them, and few shops carry many. And in those that do, the selection is usually woeful. 
 The search for externally imposed wine discipline led me ultimately to Half Wit Wines, a San Francisco-based company that deals solely in half-bottles. One of its partners, Wendy Van Dyck, a former principal ballerina with the San Francisco Ballet, understands the call for moderation. 
 ''I only weigh 100 pounds, and one glass of wine, that's about all I can do,'' she said. 
 For Ms. Van Dyck, half has become the norm. ''When I even see a full bottle of wine nowadays, it's almost overwhelming,'' she said. ''It's like, whoa, that's a lot of wine!'' 
 Founded four years ago, Half Wit Wines is really as homespun as its throwback Web site (halfwitwines.com) would suggest. Ms. Van Dyck and her partner, Gordon Uhlmann, have no employees. There's no mini storefront -- all orders are taken online and shipped promptly the next day. 
 Yet despite the modest outfit, they've established what has to be one of -- if not the -- greatest half-bottle portfolio in the world, a tally their Web site numbers at an exact 1,373 selections. 
 The selection is astounding, with a red wine inventory that includes bottles not just from California and Europe, but also places like Idaho, Israel and Lebanon.
 The quality of the selections is impressive across the board: great Chablis and Champagne sit next to fine Burgundies, Barolos and Napa cabernets.
 Prices can go as high as $122 (2005 Chateau Pichon-Longueville) and as low as $1 (for the Malamatina retsina from Greece, on special). 
 Curious how a wine from Idaho tastes? The half-bottle presents a bite-size opportunity with a manageable financial commitment, which turns out to be another benefit of the format. 
 Ms. Van Dyck also notes another advantage, flexibility. 
 ''There are so many couples where one person loves white and the other likes red,'' she said. ''This way you don't have to negotiate who's going to get their favorite color that night.'' 
 Or say my wife and I are having two courses at home, first a salad and then some meat. We could start with a half-bottle of white, perhaps a Spy Valley sauvignon blanc from New Zealand ($14) and then move on to a Coltibuono Chianti Classico 2005 ($14) with the main course. 
 It was this element that originally inspired Ms. Van Dyck and Mr. Uhlmann, who were dining at the French Laundry when they noticed ''how many people were buying half-bottles and pairing them with different courses,'' she said. ''We thought: 'This is a great idea. Why not do that at home?' '' 
 The concept does work wonderfully well in restaurants, though most don't bother to stock many half-bottles. An exception is Spruce in San Francisco, which (along with Gary Danko) has one of the largest selections in town, numbering close to 90 bottles.
 Spruce's wine director, Andrew Green, is a fan. 
 ''I've never reached the point where I feel I have enough of them,'' he said, noting that on a recent trip to Burgundy, ''at almost every winery I visited I asked them to bottle more wines in half-bottle.'' 
 The only drawback with half-bottles is that they don't simply cost half the price of a full bottle. The winery's bottling costs -- including glass, labels, corks -- are not significantly less, so the retail price of a half-bottle is on average about 60 percent of a full. 
 Nevertheless, both Half Wit and Spruce had successful 2009s. The Half Wit team said that their business is up 15 percent since 2008, despite (or perhaps because of) the recession. Mr. Green says that half-bottles at Spruce ''do incredibly well at all price points. People have been ordering more half-bottles, and spending more on each -- sacrificing quantity to maintain quality.'' 
 Half Wit sweetens the deal by offering free shipping for orders over $75. So far, the regime seems to be working out. 
 Though sometimes we want just a little more than a half and a little less than a whole bottle. 
 So I'm looking into a bottle format that's more common in Europe: 500 milliliters. Now that might be just right.

HEADLINE: Slight Increase in U.S. First-Time Jobless Filings

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The number of people claiming unemployment benefits for the first time barely rose last week, after two weeks of sharp drops, further evidence that layoffs are easing.
 The Labor Department said Thursday that initial claims for jobless benefits rose by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 434,000 last week. That was lower than the 447,000 that analysts expected. 
 The four-week average of claims, which smoothes fluctuations, fell for a 18th week to 450,250. That figure is nearing the roughly 425,000 that many economists say would be a sign the economy will start creating jobs.
 Economists are closely watching initial claims, which are considered a gauge of the pace of layoffs and an indication of companies' willingness to hire new workers. As the economy slowly recovers from the worst recession since the 1930s, more hiring is critical to boosting workers' incomes and providing the fuel for increasing consumer spending and further economic growth.
 The number of continuing claims dropped 179,000 to 4.8 million, the department said. But that figure doesn't include an additional 5.4 million people receiving unemployment under federal emergency programs, as of the week ending Dec. 19, the latest data available.
 A total of 10.5 million people were receiving unemployment benefits that week, an increase of about 300,000 from the previous week. That increase is partly a result of a decision by Congress in November to extend benefits for a fourth time since the recession began. Jobless workers can now receive up to 73 weeks of benefits, paid for by the federal government, on top of the 26 weeks customarily provided by the states.
 The large number of people continuing to receive benefits indicates that even as layoffs are declining, hiring has not picked up. That leaves people out of work for longer and longer periods of time.
 The Labor Department will issue a more comprehensive snapshot of the job market on Friday, when it releases the monthly jobs report for December. Economists forecast the unemployment rate will rise to 10.1 percent from 10 percent and employers will have shed 8,000 jobs.
 Still, the sharp drop in first-time unemployment claims in recent months as well as other signs of improvement have caused some economists to predict a small job gain in December. If so, that would be the first net increase in jobs in two years.
 Initial claims have dropped by 100,000, or 19 percent, since late October.
 Among the states, Pennsylvania reported the largest increase in claims, with 9,653, which it attributed to layoffs in the construction, food and transportation industries. Kentucky, Indiana, Kansas and Ohio had the next largest increases. State data lags the initial claims data by one week.
 California reported the largest drop in claims, with 23,160, which it attributed to a holiday-shortened work week and fewer layoffs in the construction and service industries. Texas, Georgia, Florida and North Carolina had the next largest decreases.

HEADLINE: A Foreclosure Crisis Rooted, the Family Says, in Predatory Lending

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco.

 BODY:
Giuseppa Bagnarol, 82, was in her final hours in August, dying at home surrounded by the large family she presided over as matriarch.
 They gathered to say goodbye at the bucolic Redwood City retreat Mrs. Bagnarol had created -- a compound of three homes cascading down a steep hillside where she raised chickens. Some of her children and grandchildren live on the grounds.
But that night an unwanted visitor arrived: a process server delivered papers that ordered Mrs. Bagnarol and her family to get out. The bank had foreclosed on their property, and they were all being evicted. 
 Emotions exploded. Not now, the family cursed. A sheriff's deputy was called to keep the peace. Mrs. Bagnarol died a day later.
 But the unfortunate timing of the official visit was not the only source of the anger. More troubling were the financial deals that led to the visit -- and the decision by lenders to sign Mrs. Bagnarol up for one exotic mortgage after another.
 ''It's definitely elder abuse,'' said Carolina Bagnarol, her daughter. ''There's predatory lending here.''
 Ms. Bagnarol has filed a lawsuit against a lengthy list of lenders she said took advantage of her mother. The loans plunged her mother deeper into debt with each mortgage payment, to the point of financial ruin. The lawsuit contends that Mrs. Bagnarol was pursued and persuaded -- twice over -- to take out ultimately disastrous loans on the family's property.
 In recent years, 70 percent of the elderly have been solicited to take out new mortgages, according to a survey by AARP. 
 ''Older people seem to be targeted in part because they own their houses and have owned them for a long time and have equity in their houses,'' said Jean Constantine-Davis, senior lawyer for the AARP Foundation.
 Mrs. Bagnarol was in her late 70s and suffered from the onset of dementia when she signed the loans, family members said. 
 ''This is one of the most egregious cases I've ever seen,'' said Michael Rooney, the San Francisco lawyer representing the family in the lawsuit. ''The terms were so horrible -- negative amortization and adjustable rate -- no one would believe this loan was good for her.''
 The types of loans Mrs. Bagnarol received were popular at the time. Sold under names like Option/ARM and ''Pick-a-Payment,'' borrowers could make minimum payments that did not cover the entire amount due. The balance was then added back into the loan, increasing the overall debt.
 Eventually that debt would come due, creating huge monthly payments that many homeowners could not afford. Critics blame these loans for helping to cause the housing market crash. Lawmakers agree -- as of Jan. 1, it is illegal to write this type of loan in California.
 Mrs. Bagnarol first bought the property in 1994 for $535,000, her family said, and for most of the intervening 15 years had a conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. As the property's value skyrocketed in the boom years, she refinanced to take out money for a family business and to build a new main structure.
 This eventually led to a $1,365,000 negative amortization loan in 2005. Its low interest rate soon expired, and she refinanced with another $1.5 million loan on Dec. 29, 2006; under its terms, her monthly payments eventually spiked to $14,541.32 from $5,176.81. When Mrs. Bagnarol fell behind, the debt spiraled to $1,640,000 by December 2008. 
 Family members say that when they tried to pay on behalf of their mother, the bank was uncooperative. Events snowballed into foreclosure, followed by eviction notices. Eight people live at the compound, including Ms. Bagnarol and her three children.
 The situation has torn the family apart. It was Mrs. Bagnarol's son-in-law, Michael Polizzi of Residential Pacific Mortgage in Alamo, who promoted the loans. He bristled at the notion that he had taken advantage of her.
 ''If Miss Bagnarol is alleging any improper conduct by RPM or by me, those allegations are false,'' Mr. Polizzi said, reading a prepared statement after conferring with his lawyer.
 Efforts to save the family homestead have been further complicated by changes in bank ownership. The loan started with World Savings, an institution acquired by Wachovia, which itself was bought by Wells Fargo, a bank that had a policy against negative amortization loans, but now finds itself dealing with the debris.
 Wells Fargo is paying attention to the Bagnarol case. On Tuesday afternoon it offered a reprieve. Teri Schrettenbrunner, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, said the bank had halted the eviction process ''while we work with her mother's estate to bring the mortgage payments current.''
 Carolina Bagnarol, a former business manager for the rock group Journey who is no stranger to vicissitude, is skeptical. But she is grateful that her mother never knew that her homestead was in jeopardy. 
 Carolina's brother, Franco, agreed. ''It would have killed her sooner,'' he said, ''and she would have died unhappy.''

HEADLINE: Britain's Central Bank Leaves Key Rate and Stimulus Unchanged

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
The Bank of England left its benchmark interest rate and economic support programs unchanged Thursday, opting to wait for stronger recovery signals before following other major central banks in starting to dismantle stimulus measures.
 Data released for the euro area, meanwhile, showed that the moderate rebound in the region was progressing.
 The British central bank's monetary policy committee voted to leave its benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent, where it has been since March, and to keep its program for asset purchases, enacted as an unorthodox means of stimulating demand, at $:200 billion ($318.5 billion). 
 The bank had expanded the asset-purchasing plan in November for a third time since it was introduced in March but left it unchanged in December. So far, it has bought $:193 billion -- mostly government bonds -- under the program.
 The bank said that it expected the purchases ''to take another month to complete,'' and that ''the scale of the program would be kept under review.''
 Analysts had expected the central bank to remain cautious and wait at least a month, maybe more, before making any policy shift. When it meets again next month, the policy committee will have new estimates on inflation and gross domestic product. Those numbers are expected to show the British economy returned to growth in the last quarter of 2009, after six consecutive quarterly contractions.
 ''While the U.K. probably exited recession in the fourth quarter and will probably record strong growth in early 2010, there are ongoing risks to the recovery,'' said James Knightley, an economist at ING. ''We suspect that Bank of England policy will remain unchanged for several more months.''
 Mr. Knightley said that a rising tax burden could dent already fragile household confidence. In addition, a general election in spring presents policy uncertainties.
 Britain has trailed other leading economies in coming out of recession. France, Germany and the United States all started growing again during the third quarter last year. Central banks for those countries are looking to scale back emergency stimulus measures.
 The European Central Bank is curbing its extraordinary fund auctions, while the Federal Reserve is expected to begin draining liquidity from the American financial system this year. The central bank of Switzerland said in December that it would stop buying corporate bonds.
 The European Commission said Thursday that economic sentiment in the 16 countries using the euro improved in December, with consumer and industrial confidence rising modestly.
 The commission's economic sentiment indicator rose to 91.3 in December, from 88.8 in November. This was above a consensus forecast of 90. Economists said the numbers were consistent with a continuing but moderate recovery.
 Consumer-related data from the euro area, however, was softer. A report showed that retail sales in the euro area fell 1.2 percent in November after a 0.2 percent rise in October.
 The recent economic data from Britain has also been mixed.
 British home prices rose 1 percent in December, ending the year 1.1 percent higher than at the end of 2008, according to the mortgage lender Halifax. 
 The Society of Motor Manufacturers said new-car sales in Britain rose 39 percent last month from a year earlier as government incentives bolstered demand. But consumer confidence fell in December, the Nationwide mortgage lender said.
 Despite extensive government intervention in the United States housing market, some policy makers at the Federal Reserve are worried that even more may need to be done, according to minutes of a Fed meeting.
 At the same time, unease is growing that a tentative comeback in the American housing market could fall apart as a tax credit for home buyers expires this spring and the Fed's program to hold down mortgage rates ends.

HEADLINE: Shorting China

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
James S. Chanos built one of the largest fortunes on Wall Street by foreseeing the collapse of Enron and other highflying companies whose stories were too good to be true.
 Now Mr. Chanos, a wealthy hedge fund investor, is working to bust the myth of the biggest conglomerate of all: China Inc.
 As most of the world bets on China to help lift the global economy out of recession, Mr. Chanos is warning that China's hyperstimulated economy is headed for a crash, rather than the sustained boom that most economists predict. Its surging real estate sector, buoyed by a flood of speculative capital, looks like ''Dubai times 1,000 -- or worse,'' he frets. He even suspects that Beijing is cooking its books, faking, among other things, its eye-popping growth rates of more than 8 percent.
 ''Bubbles are best identified by credit excesses, not valuation excesses,'' he said in a recent appearance on CNBC. ''And there's no bigger credit excess than in China.'' He is planning a speech later this month at the University of Oxford to drive home his point. 
 As America's pre-eminent short-seller -- he bets big money that companies' strategies will fail -- Mr. Chanos's narrative runs counter to the prevailing wisdom on China. Most economists and governments expect Chinese growth momentum to continue this year, buoyed by what remains of a $586 billion government stimulus program that began last year, meant to lift exports and consumption among Chinese consumers.
 Still, betting against China will not be easy. Because foreigners are restricted from investing in stocks listed inside China, Mr. Chanos has said he is searching for other ways to make his bets, including focusing on construction- and infrastructure-related companies that sell cement, coal, steel and iron ore.
 Mr. Chanos, 51, whose hedge fund, Kynikos Associates, based in New York, has $6 billion under management, is hardly the only skeptic on China. But he is certainly the most prominent and vocal.
 For all his record of prescience -- in addition to predicting Enron's demise, he also spotted the looming problems of Tyco International, the Boston Market restaurant chain and, more recently, home builders and some of the world's biggest banks -- his detractors say that he knows little or nothing about China or its economy and that his bearish calls should be ignored.
 ''I find it interesting that people who couldn't spell China 10 years ago are now experts on China,'' said Jim Rogers, who co-founded the Quantum Fund with George Soros and now lives in Singapore. ''China is not in a bubble.'' 
 Colleagues acknowledge that Mr. Chanos began studying China's economy in earnest only last summer and sent out e-mail messages seeking expert opinion.
 But he is tagging along with the bears, who see mounting evidence that China's stimulus package and aggressive bank lending are creating artificial demand, raising the risk of a wave of nonperforming loans.
 ''In China, he seems to see the excesses, to the third and fourth power, that he's been tilting against all these decades,'' said Jim Grant, a longtime friend and the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, who is also bearish on China. ''He homes in on the excesses of the markets and profits from them. That's been his stock and trade.'' 
 Mr. Chanos declined to be interviewed, citing his continuing research on China. But he has already been spreading the view that the China miracle is blinding investors to the risk that the country is producing far too much.
 ''The Chinese,'' he warned in an interview in November with Politico.com, ''are in danger of producing huge quantities of goods and products that they will be unable to sell.'' 
 In December, he appeared on CNBC to discuss how he had already begun taking short positions, hoping to profit from a China collapse.
 In recent months, a growing number of analysts, and some Chinese officials, have also warned that asset bubbles might emerge in China.
 The nation's huge stimulus program and record bank lending, estimated to have doubled last year from 2008, pumped billions of dollars into the economy, reigniting growth.
 But many analysts now say that money, along with huge foreign inflows of ''speculative capital,'' has been funneled into the stock and real estate markets.
 A result, they say, has been soaring prices and a resumption of the building boom that was under way in early 2008 -- one that Mr. Chanos and others have called wasteful and overdone. 
 ''It's going to be a bust,'' said Gordon G. Chang, whose book, ''The Coming Collapse of China'' (Random House), warned in 2001 of such a crash.
 Friends and colleagues say Mr. Chanos is comfortable betting against the crowd -- even if that crowd includes the likes of Warren E. Buffett and Wilbur L. Ross Jr., two other towering figures of the investment world.
 A contrarian by nature, Mr. Chanos researches companies, pores over public filings to sift out clues to fraud and deceptive accounting, and then decides whether a stock is overvalued and ready for a fall. He has a staff of 26 in the firm's offices in New York and London, searching for other China-related information.
 ''His record is impressive,'' said Byron R. Wien, vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Services. ''He's no fly-by-night charlatan. And I'm bullish on China.''
 Mr. Chanos grew up in Milwaukee, one of three sons born to the owners of a chain of dry cleaners. At Yale, he was a pre-med student before switching to economics because of what he described as a passionate interest in the way markets operate.
 His guiding philosophy was discovered in a book called ''The Contrarian Investor,'' according to an account of his life in ''The Smartest Guys in the Room,'' a book that chronicled Enron's rise and downfall.
 After college, he went to Wall Street, where he worked at a series of brokerage houses before starting his own firm in 1985, out of what he later said was frustration with the way Wall Street brokers promoted stocks. 
 At Kynikos Associates, he created a firm focused on betting on falling stock prices. His theories are summed up in testimony he gave to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce in 2002, after the Enron debacle. His firm, he said, looks for companies that appear to have overstated earnings, like Enron; were victims of a flawed business plan, like many Internet firms; or have been engaged in ''outright fraud.'' 
 That short-sellers are held in low regard by some on Wall Street, as well as Main Street, has long troubled him.
 Short-sellers were blamed for intensifying market sell-offs in the fall 2008, before the practice was temporarily banned. Regulators are now trying to decide whether to restrict the practice.
 Mr. Chanos often responds to critics of short-selling by pointing to the critical role they played in identifying problems at Enron, Boston Market and other ''financial disasters'' over the years.
 ''They are often the ones wearing the white hats when it comes to looking for and identifying the bad guys,'' he has said.

HEADLINE: Sorting Out Legislation

BYLINE: By MICHELLE QUINN

 BODY:
The California State Legislature convened this week to begin dealing with a projected $19.9 billion budget deficit over the next 18 months, a situation Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger described as ''our Katrina.'' Beyond the budget, state legislators have other issues to contend with, including these three legislative proposals, all of which arise from local concerns or incidents. 
 MICHELLE QUINN
AB 1601 D.U.I. Assemblyman Jerry Hill, Democrat of San Mateo, said he was moved to change state law after reading about a San Mateo County man who was still driving with a valid license after his eighth drunken driving conviction. Mr. Hill's legislation would authorize judges handling drunken driving cases to consider a person's entire record beyond the current 10-year limit. 
 It would also allow judges to permanently suspend a person's license after three or more drunken driving convictions. Currently, judges can permanently take away the license of a person found to be under the influence only if someone has been hurt or killed. 
 From 1983 to 2006, 310,971 people in California were convicted of D.U.I. or alcohol-related reckless driving convictions at least three times, according to the state's office of traffic safety.
 AB 984 WITNESSES News coverage of the October gang rape of a student at Richmond High School prompted Assemblyman Pedro Nava, Democrat of Santa Barbara, a former prosecutor, to introduce a bill that would make those who observe a rape or murder of a person of any age liable for not reporting it.
 The Richmond attack went on for more than two hours with multiple bystanders, the police have said. If the victim had been 13, rather than 16, those who witnessed the crime could be prosecuted for failing to report it. Six people have been arrested in relation to the attack. 
 Under Mr. Nava's bill, observers who fail to report could face misdemeanor charges and punishment of up to six months in jail and a $1,500 fine. 
 ''The fact that this girl's episode could have been brought to a close almost immediately is too much to bear,'' he said. ''It isn't as if I am asking people to intervene to put themselves in harm's way.'' 
 Senator Leland Yee, Democrat of San Francisco, is planning to introduce a related bill that would make an observer legally obligated to report a felony level sexual assault against a victim 18 or younger, a spokesman said. 
 AB 390 LEGAL MARIJUANA When Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, Democrat of San Francisco, introduced AB390 last February, he said he wanted to provide the state some economic relief, to the tune of $1.5 billion, and start a conversation about the effectiveness of drug enforcement. 
 The bill would allow adults 21 and older to legally possess, grow and sell marijuana. The state would charge a $50 per ounce fee and a 9 percent tax on retail sales. 
 The bill has no strong support in the legislature, and since it was introduced a ballot initiative that mirrors it may go to voters in November. Mr. Ammiano said that if his bill does not proceed quickly in the next month, he will hold it to await the results of the vote.

HEADLINE: To Slow Growth, China Raises an Interest Rate

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
The central bank of China on Thursday raised a key interest rate slightly for the first time in nearly five months, in what economists interpreted as the beginning of a broader move to tighten monetary policy and forestall inflation.
 After breaking stride a year ago during the global economic slowdown, the Chinese economy resumed galloping growth over the summer. Government investments, real estate construction and consumer spending are all rising briskly as a result of a surge in lending by state-controlled banks.
 Even exports have begun to recover despite continued economic weakness in the European Union and the United States, China's two biggest overseas markets. 
 Raising interest rates may help discourage speculative investments by Chinese companies and individuals in real estate projects and other areas of economic activity. China's difficulty is that higher rates may also prompt overseas investors seeking higher returns to redouble their efforts to push money into China, despite the country's stringent capital controls.
 The People's Bank of China announced Thursday that the yield from its weekly sale of three-month central bank bills had inched up to 1.3684 percent. The yield had remained at 1.328 percent since Aug. 13.
 An increase of less than 0.05 of a percentage point might sound small, but economists said it was a harbinger of more rate increases to come. 
 They cited expectations that consumer and producer prices would rise in the months ahead, particularly compared with low price levels a year ago, when demand temporarily slumped in China as well as the rest of the world.
 ''It is a turning point,'' said Ben Simpfendorfer, an economist in the Hong Kong offices of Royal Bank of Scotland. ''There is a convergence of events that will lead to higher rates.''
 The increase in the interest rate turned mainland China's stock markets into Asia's worst performers Thursday. The CSI 300 index of shares on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets slumped 1.98 percent.
 Air freight capacity out of mainland China and Hong Kong was almost fully booked in December, according to shippers, making it likely that China would post strong export numbers when it released a flood of monthly and annual economic data next week. 
 Senior corporate executives were unsure if this strength would continue this year, or whether the surge in December represented a flurry of restocking by retailers that went into the Christmas holiday season with meager inventories.
 Victor Fung, the nonexecutive chairman of Li & Fung, a Hong Kong-based trading and supply chain management company that is one of the world's largest, said that overseas demand might not be strong enough to sustain the strength in China's December shipments through 2010. But his staff is somewhat more optimistic than he is, he added, as are some investment bank economists.
 The slight increase in interest rates could prove even more significant if it is the start of an effort by Chinese regulators to limit bank lending. Chinese banks have lent heavily at home, and have stepped up lending in other countries as well, taking market share from Western banks hobbled by the global financial crisis.
 The rate increase is not the first since the bottom of the economic downturn. After cutting interest rates by 2.4 percentage points in the last quarter of 2008, the People's Bank nudged up interest rates by 0.363 of a percent from late June to early August last year in a series of growing weekly increases.
 But the central bank had stood firm ever since, watching for more evidence of the economy's health. 
 Central banks around the world have a history of taking small steps when they begin raising interest rates after a long period of keeping them low in response to an economic downturn. Because China does not have a well-developed bond trading market, the yields on the weekly sales of central bank bills are widely watched as a barometer of the central bank's intentions.
 The central bank sells its bills mainly to banks, which pay in renminbi that the central bank then effectively takes out of circulation, slowing growth in the country's money supply. 
 Weekly sales of central bank bills are part of a process that economists describe as ''sterilization'' of China's extensive intervention in currency markets. As dollars and other foreign currencies pour into China from its trade surplus and foreign investment, the central bank prints vast sums of renminbi and issues them to buy those dollars and other currencies.
 To prevent all those extra renminbi from feeding inflation, the central bank then claws back the renminbi from the market through a series of measures that include the sale of central bank bills. China also requires commercial banks to keep large reserves on deposit at the central bank, partly to keep the banks from lending too recklessly but also so that the central bank can use that money to finance further purchases of dollars and other foreign exchange.
 The goal of sterilization is to keep inflation under control in China while keeping the renminbi weak. That helps make China's exports competitive overseas and preserves jobs in China, while contributing to unemployment in countries producing rival goods.
 The dollars and other currencies go into China's foreign exchange reserves, which stood at $2.27 trillion at the end of September; monthly figures through the end of December are scheduled for release next week. China has the biggest foreign exchange reserves of any country, by far.
 Because the central bank has essentially borrowed at home to finance that accumulation of reserves, there is considerable worry in China about losses on those reserves if the value of the dollar weakens further.
 The central bank is already buying more than $300 billion a year of foreign currencies, mainly dollars, to keep the renminbi weak and preserve the competitiveness of Chinese exports in foreign markets.

HEADLINE: Fed Advice To A.I.G. Scrutinized

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH; Chris V. Nicholson contributed reporting.

 BODY:
New revelations that the government stopped the American International Group from revealing information about its bailout had securities lawyers and policy makers buzzing on Thursday about whether the information had to be disclosed under federal securities law, and if so, what to do about the lack of compliance. 
 Joel Seligman, a historian of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said the disclosure rules were supposed to apply to all public companies, with only a few narrow exceptions for things like trade secrets and national security. There was no exception for ''too big to fail'' companies on federal life support, he said. Companies are supposed to disclose all information that could be material, though that term is not clearly defined.
 ''When an organization is troubled, it actually makes disclosures of this kind more important,'' Mr. Seligman said. 
 Others disagreed, saying that bank and insurance regulators normally keep their discussions with struggling financial institutions private, to keep from inciting runs. There has always been tension, one securities lawyer said, between banking regulators, who want to resolve problems behind closed doors, and the federal securities laws, which compel disclosure. 
 The latest concerns that the government was suppressing important information about A.I.G. arose on Thursday after Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican of California, obtained e-mail messages between the insurer and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in which a Fed lawyer told A.I.G. ''there should be no discussion'' of certain details of the bailout in a regulatory filing. 
 The e-mail messages dealt with one of the most controversial aspects of A.I.G.'s bailout: that the Fed was paying the insurer's trading partners 100 cents on the dollar for their soured investments. A.I.G. cited this fact, but the lawyer crossed the reference out. 
 The Fed also struck a paragraph about other investments that could not be unwound.
 The New York Fed said on Thursday that it was offering advice, not orders, and that the second reference was irrelevant and did not apply to the transaction that A.I.G. was describing in its regulatory filing.
 Securities requirements aside, Mr. Issa said this secretiveness flew in the face of good public policy and said he wanted to bring the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, to Capitol Hill ''to get every side of the story and understand what the motive and intent was of these actions.'' 
 Mr. Geithner was president of the New York Fed at the time of the e-mail exchange. The contents of the messages were first reported by Bloomberg News.
 As part of its bailout, the government took a 79.9 percent stake in A.I.G., and Mr. Issa said he thought taxpayers had the right to know the details of the company's finances.
 Meg Reilly, a spokeswoman for the Treasury, said that Mr. Geithner ''played no role in these decisions and indeed, by Nov. 24, he was recused from working on issues involving specific companies, including A.I.G.''
 The messages showed that in December 2008, A.I.G. was preparing a filing to explain how it had eliminated a portfolio of derivatives, known as credit-default swaps, through an entity created with the Fed called Maiden Lane III. 
 The swaps served as insurance on debt securities held by financial institutions around the world. Maiden Lane III bought up the debts, making the financial institutions whole and allowing A.I.G. to tear up the swaps. 
 One troublesome set of swaps, worth about $10 billion, could not be torn up, because they did not insure debts that could be bought by Maiden Lane III -- they insured amorphous bundles of derivatives. A.I.G. has never found a way to cancel them, and they are still in force. 
 The existence of these particular swaps has been controversial, because they suggest that A.I.G. and its trading partners were dealing not just in newfangled insurance, but in highly speculative bets on the real estate markets. 
 The Fed's lawyer, Ethan T. James, of Davis Polk & Wardwell, deleted all references to the $10 billion in swaps that could not be torn up. He wrote in the margin: ''There should be no discussion or suggestion that A.I.G. and the N.Y. Fed are working to structure anything else at this point.''
 After receiving his instructions, A.I.G. deleted the reference to the $10 billion derivatives problem from its filing.
 An official of the New York Fed said its reasons for telling A.I.G. not to mention the $10 billion of special swaps were innocuous. The New York Fed issued a statement by its general counsel, Thomas C. Baxter, saying it was ''appropriate'' to have given A.I.G. guidance on what to say in the S.E.C. filing, because the New York Fed had helped create Maiden Lane III. 
 ''Our focus was on ensuring accuracy and protecting the taxpayers' interests, during a time of severe economic distress,'' Mr. Baxter said. ''All information was in fact disclosed that was required to be disclosed by the company, showing that the counterparties received par value. There was no effort to mislead the public.''
 Mr. Baxter, the general counsel, also said that while the New York Fed had offered its opinions about the filing, ''the final decision rested with A.I.G. and its external securities counsel.'' 
 Mark Herr, a spokesman for A.I.G., said that the company would not comment on the matter. 
 Mr. Issa, the senior Republican on the House oversight committee, said he was writing to the committee chairman, Edolphus Towns of Maryland, about including the questions of disclosure in the committee's inquiry into the bailout. 
 Thursday's controversy follows other disputes over whether the Federal Reserve was suppressing information about A.I.G. that the public had a right to know. Early in the bailout, the company and the Fed refused to name the financial institutions that were counterparties to the company's derivatives. 
 The Federal Reserve's vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, told angry senators in a hearing that the Fed thought A.I.G. would lose customers if such information were made public, and any such loss would only hurt the taxpayers. 
 But the senators warned that unless the names were revealed, no more bailout money would be forthcoming, and not long after that, the names were made public. 
 The inspector general for the bailout, Neil Barofsky, said in an audit of A.I.G. that the arguments against transparency simply did not withstand scrutiny. ''Notwithstanding the Federal Reserve's warnings, the sky did not fall,'' he wrote in November.
 More recently, attempts by the New York Fed and A.I.G. executives to soften pay restrictions included references to the company's condition that some thought should have been disclosed to shareholders.
 The officials argued that the executives would resign if they were paid in company stock, citing projections showing that the stock might be worthless -- something the taxpayers, as shareholders, might like to know -- according to people with knowledge of the analysis. 
 Those discussions were disclosed on Sunday in an article in The New York Times Magazine.
 A.I.G. did not comment. Others said that its regulatory filings stated that the company expected to be viable for more than 12 months only if the government continued its support, and that well captured the level of investor risk. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 9, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the government's instructions to the American International Group not to disclose information about its bailout misidentified the state represented by Edolphus Towns, chairman of a House oversight committee that has been conducting an inquiry into A.I.G.'s bailout. It is New York, not Maryland.

HEADLINE: An Underdog From Sri Lanka Battles the Global Giants of Tea

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

DATELINE: COLOMBO, Sri Lanka 

 BODY:
Merrill J. Fernando's eyes lit up one recent morning when his son Dilhan handed him a box of Twinings Pure White Tea. He quickly ripped open a tea bag and spilled its contents onto a piece of paper.
 Then he asked for some green tea, which Dilhan delivered on another piece of paper. Mr. Fernando beamed as he put the samples side by side. They looked similar but were starkly different from the silvery white tea produced by his company, Dilmah, which is sold in supermarkets for nearly four times the price of Twinings.
 ''All the brands without exception sell as white tea either 99 percent black tea or green tea with one piece of white tea,'' Mr. Fernando, 79, said ruefully. ''This is what we are up against. This is what the consumer is up against. But this is part of normal trade, and I have begun to accept it.''
 Twinings said it used a Chinese white tea variety known as Bai Mudan in its tea bags and the more exclusive silver needle variety, which is similar to Dilmah's white tea, in its loose leaf tea. 
 Mr. Fernando has relished his role as the underdog battling the giants of the global tea business. In the last two decades, he has built Dilmah into one of the world's largest independent tea companies and one of the best-known Sri Lankan brands by selling tea that is critically acclaimed and more expensive than the competition. 
 His company's story symbolizes the path that other Sri Lankan businesses and industries have had to follow to compete with the likes of China and India, which have lower costs of production and the advantage of size. To attract business, Sri Lankan companies have become specialists and producers of affordable yet exclusive products. In apparel, for instance, producers here have established themselves as a go-to source for lingerie and sportswear so they do not have to compete on cheaper clothes directly with low-cost mass producers like Bangladesh and China.
 ''To compete with the Chinese juggernaut in particular, the Sri Lankan strategy has been to go into niches like lingerie for Victoria's Secret,'' said Razeen Sally, an expert on the Sri Lankan economy who is co-director of the European Center for International Political Economy in Brussels.
 In tea, Sri Lanka was the world's largest exporter as recently as 2004, but it lost significant market share as governments and companies in Kenya and China made a big push to produce low-cost tea, and as green tea became more popular. Today, Sri Lanka exports about $1.3 billion in tea. 
 Mr. Fernando spent much of his career selling tea to big companies like Lipton and Tetley. But in the 1970s, he noticed that buyers in the United States, Europe and Australia had started to buy less Sri Lankan tea, blending it with cheaper teas from other countries. Those companies' profits jumped, but growers, producers and traders in Sri Lanka were devastated.
 ''Unless I got into branding and marketing,'' he said, ''I would have been out of the business in two or three years.'' 
 Dilmah, named after his sons Dilhan and Malik, who now help run the company, positioned itself as a seller of pure Sri Lankan, or Ceylon, tea that was not blended with other teas.
 But most foreign supermarket operators and customers had never heard of Dilmah and it was hard to persuade them to take a chance on the upstart, said Jaliya Wickramasuriya, Sri Lanka's ambassador to the United States and a former Dilmah executive. ''It was very difficult to even get an appointment with the big chains,'' he said.
 Mr. Fernando's break came in the mid-1980s when an Australian supermarket chain, Coles, gave him an order for tea that carried the store's brand. Dilmah has since expanded across much of the globe, including recently the United States. The research firm Datamonitor estimates it is the sixth-largest tea brand in the world now. In the six months ended in September, Ceylon Tea Services, Dilmah's parent company, earned $5.2 million on $19.7 million in revenue. That was up from profits of $1.3 million, on $18.6 million in revenue the year before, when the company's earnings were hurt by a fall in the value of the Australian dollar.
 Dilmah has also expanded into tourism, by turning four old tea plantation bungalows in central Sri Lanka into five-star guest houses known as Ceylon Tea Trails. The company plans to add two more bungalows and build 10 timeshare villas nearby.
 The company has opened ''tea bars'' where it offers tastings and classes about how to make, drink and appreciate tea, much as wineries do. These efforts are aimed at showing consumers that its tea is worth the extra cost. Dilmah's white tea, for instance, cost $11 for a box of 10 bags while a box of Twinings costs about $3. (White tea costs more than black or green tea because it is made from a smaller part of the plant and has more antioxidants.) 
 The Sri Lankan tea industry has been slow to change in some important ways. Many of its tea bushes, for instance, have low yields because they are decades past their prime and need to be replanted, which is expensive, said Hasitha de Alwis, director of promotion for the Sri Lanka Tea Board.
 The country has also shunned automation to preserve the quality of its tea. While most producers in Kenya and India make black tea using a speedy manufacturing process known as cut, turn and curl, Sri Lanka favors a traditional approach that takes longer to produce more varieties.
 Most tea here is also hand-plucked by small teams of Tamil women who are descendants of Indians who were brought to the island 150 years ago by the British. After years of struggle for higher wages and better working conditions, Sri Lankan estate workers are now better paid than laborers in India and elsewhere, though many often still live in small, rundown houses. 
 A recent labor agreement increased wages by about 40 percent; most workers earn $3.50 to $5 a day. That increase and an estimated 15 percent drop in production because of inadequate rainfall have helped drive up prices at Colombo's tea auctions by 100 percent in the last 12 months.
 Plantation companies that manage estates and a foundation funded by Mr. Fernando say they have spent millions to improve the quality of education, housing and health for plantation workers.
 Still, industry and labor officials expect a severe labor shortage in the coming years because many children of plantation workers are not interested in working in tea fields even at the increased wages.
 On a recent December afternoon, K. Tilgowthey and about 15 other women were plucking tea leaves from a hillside in central Sri Lanka as the rain came down. They worked quickly and quietly, the only sounds coming from the snapping of tea leaves and the rustle of the plastic bags that covered their heads and torsos. Many of the women wore no shoes; some wore flip-flops.
 Mrs. Tilgowthey, 31, said she started working on the Holyrood Estate, which is partly owned by Dilmah, 10 years ago when she married a man who worked and lived here. The couple have two daughters and a son. Asked whether she would like them to work with her on the plantation, she was quick to say no.
 ''It's hard work,'' she said. ''So, I hope my children get educated.''

HEADLINE: In Downturn, An Upside: Generosity

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail:susan.dominus@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Recession got you down? Look on the bright side -- it's not a crisis, it's a crisatunity!
 That suspiciously upbeat word mash-up has become a term of art for political organizers, who usually use it in the context of e-mail messaging techniques. When such organizers try to raise awareness about a big problem -- say, global poverty -- they are talking about a crisis, which can evoke ennui and helplessness.
 But if they can outline specific action to address a slice of the problem -- sign this petition today that will embarrass this foreign government into resolving this human rights abuse! -- then they've got themselves a crisatunity (pronounced CRY-sa-too-nitty). A crisis, but an opportunity! 
 Many social service agencies in New York stepped into December with every reason to think they would face another garden-variety crisis of the Great Recession -- scant resources with which to brighten the holidays for children. ''We had no idea where things were going to come from,'' said Terry Troia, executive director of Project Hospitality, an interfaith organization that serves the hungry and homeless on Staten Island. 
 But crisatunity struck -- even without a campaign of alarming and action-inspiring e-mail messages. As Christmas approached, new toys flooded into Project Hospitality from unusual places, including a correctional facility whose staff that sponsored a drive. ''It was a banner year,'' said Ms. Troia, ''and the majority of gifts that poured out were from people we'd never met before.'' 
 The same phenomenon bowled over Carolyn McLaughlin, executive director of BronxWorks, a community and social-service center that used to be called the Citizens Advice Bureau. Ms. McLaughlin estimated that she had 25 new donors providing gifts to 1,000 South Bronx children. Some of those did not exactly fit the typical local-business or corporate sponsor profile -- there was a woman who had once lived at the agency's shelter, and a motorcycle club called the Legion of Doom. The gifts were also more lavish than usual -- ''things like electric guitars and Easy-Bake ovens and brand new bicycles,'' Ms. McLaughlin said.
 Reports of similar bounty came in from Goddard Riverside Community Center, on the Upper West Side, Hudson Guild, a settlement house based in Chelsea, and the Supportive Children's Advocacy Network, which serves East Harlem.
 ADD it to the list of upsides of the downturn: A raised awareness of hardship can spur people to help. Abortion-rights groups, which see contributions rise when their opponents are in power, have long known about crisatunity, even if they didn't call it that. This holiday season, some New York groups found they had to do less to get more, even from people who had less to give. 
 ''It's rough out there,'' said Noel Andujar of Legions of Doom, who organized about 30 members to give toys to BronxWorks' Positive Living, a service for families with a member who is H.I.V. positive. ''A lot of the guys in the group are laid off, but they managed to pull through and give a toy.''
 Ben Brandzel, who spearheaded many of MoveOn.org's e-mail campaigns, first started using the term ''crisatunity'' in 2007, while describing the anatomy of effective organizing e-mail to other campaigns. ''The heart of the concept is that in the same moment, you take in the scope of the problem and your ability to change it for the better,'' he said. 
 He could imagine that if some of the energy channeled toward opposing President Bush's policies could be strategically refocused, in this economy, toward service and charitable giving. And if he is right, what better way than through campaigns that emphasize both the depths of a specific local crisis, and the immediate effectiveness of giving (or volunteering) year-round, not just at Christmas?
 But Mr. Brandzel did not coin the term, which reeks of millennial corporatespeak; for that, we have to thank the great lexicographer (and spoofer of millennial corporatespeak), Homer Simpson. In an old episode of the show, Lisa points out to her father that the Chinese use the same word for both crisis and opportunity. Homer replies, ''Yes! Crisatunity!''
 For better or for worse, 2010 will surely have plenty of it.

HEADLINE: Still Mourning a Husband While Caring for a Mother

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER

 BODY:
Maria Petrik spreads brittle sheets of paper across a delicate Romanian lace tablecloth. Each page is covered with handwritten translations of words that she and her husband, Gyorgy, taught themselves after arriving in Queens two decades ago. 
 The translations are rendered as equations, alphabetized by their native Hungarian. 
 Egyedul = alone. 
 Egyutt = together.
 They had been together nearly every day since March 27, 1968, when a mutual friend introduced them in a Romanian cafe. 
 She has been alone since Oct. 8, 2009, when he died of a heart attack.
 ''I don't know why God let him slip from me,'' says Mrs. Petrik, 64, her head tipping forward as she sobs. ''He was my life. He was everything to me.''
 They grew up in a Romanian town that was once part of Hungary. They left in 1991 to escape the oppression that seemed to have eased little since the fall of communism in 1989. They arrived in Queens with the few things that had not been stolen from their luggage at the airport in Romania, $100 in United States currency that Mr. Petrik had bought on the black market, and a small tan dog. 
 ''I have no children, so I bring my dog,'' she said. ''I even bought ticket.''
 They rented a studio apartment in Jackson Heights. Mr. Petrik, who had worked as a plumber in Romania, took a night-shift job at the Hunts Point market in the Bronx. Mrs. Petrik, who had worked for 29 years in Romania cutting hair, stayed home.
 ''My husband tell me: 'You work hard all your life. It's enough,' '' she said.
 In 1996, Mrs. Petrik's father died in Romania. The next year, her mother came to live with them. They moved into a two-bedroom apartment in the same building. 
 Soon after, Mr. Petrik suffered a heart attack and was unable to work again. Mrs. Petrik took a job as a home health aide. Over the next decade, she cared for her weakened husband and her mother, who developed Alzheimer's disease. She came home each day to cook lunch for them, and then returned to work. 
 They struggled, but made ends meet on her income and the $1,400 in workers' compensation and $238 in Social Security benefits that Mr. Petrik received each month. 
 The Petriks had both become United States citizens but still hoped to retire to Romania. That dream ended in 2006 when a burglar stole the cash they had saved for a move. 
 Early one morning in November 2008, Mrs. Petrik found her husband lying in bed staring blankly into space, with his newspapers scattered across the floor. 
 ''I see something wrong,'' she recalled. ''He look at me, and I see the eyes look different.''
 Mr. Petrik had suffered a stroke. Another soon followed. Partly paralyzed and having trouble speaking, he was moved into a nearby rehabilitation center. Mrs. Petrik stopped working to care for him and her mother, who slid further into dementia. Every day, she walked to the rehabilitation center to bathe and dress her husband and bring food to him. 
 One night in October, Mrs. Petrik kissed her husband goodnight and went home. He died in his sleep of a heart attack. He was 68.
 Emotional loss was compounded by fear. Suddenly, her only income was $371 a month from Social Security, far short of her monthly rent of $799. She had no idea where to turn and felt ashamed. 
 ''I have no money for funeral, nothing,'' she said. ''I do not want to go on the street. I have here my mom.''
 In November, a social worker at Elmhurst Hospital Center, where Mrs. Petrik's mother receives treatment, learned of their money problems and notified Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the seven beneficiary agencies of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
 Mrs. Petrik was granted the amount of her December rent. Her caseworker, Sha-Nae Anderson, also arranged for Mrs. Petrik to receive $129 a month in food stamps and a monthly stipend of $352 from the Society for the Relief of Women and Children until her full Social Security payments begin in April, when she will turn 65. 
 Ms. Petrik has business cards pitching her three decades of ''European experience'' as a haircutter, but she has not been able to find work. She spends her days caring for her mother, who is 84, and cooking. A specialty is Hungarian stuffed cabbage.
 In her living room, rosary beads and a figurine of Jesus rest on a box holding her husband's ashes, next to a burning candle and a vase of flowers. Mrs. Petrik holds a photo of Gyorgy blowing out a candle on a birthday cake she baked for him last year.
 She kisses the photo, weeping. ''I miss him so much.''
 Previously recorded $4,609,456 Recorded Thursday 234,376 Total $4,843,832 Last year to date $6,053,178

HEADLINE: China Tries A New Tack To Go Solar

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
As it moves rapidly to become the world's leader in nuclear power, wind energy and photovoltaic solar panels, China is taking tentative steps to master another alternative energy industry: using mirrors to capture sunlight, produce steam and generate electricity.
 So-called concentrating solar power uses hundreds of thousands of mirrors to turn water into steam. The steam turns a conventional turbine similar to those in coal-fired power plants. The technology, which is potentially cheaper than most types of renewable power, has captivated many engineers and financiers in the last two years, with an abrupt surge in new patents and plans for large power operations in Europe and the United States. 
 This year may be China's turn. China is starting to build its own concentrating solar power plants, a technology more associated with California deserts than China's countryside. And Chinese manufacturers are starting to think about exports, part of China's effort to become the world's main provider of alternative energy power equipment.
 Yet concentrating solar power still faces formidable obstacles here, including government officials who are skeptical that the technology will be useful on a large scale in China.
 Much of the country is cloudy or smoggy. Water is scarce. The sunniest places left for solar power are deserts deep in the interior, far from the energy-hungry coastal provinces that consume most of China's electricity. Provinces deep in the interior have few skilled workers or engineers to maintain the automated gear that keeps mirrors focused on towers that transfer the heat from sunbeams into fluids.
 Concentrating solar power ''is not very suitable for China,'' wrote Li Junfeng, a senior government energy policy maker, in a detailed e-mail reply to questions this week.
 Yet the private sector in China is racing to embrace the technology anyway.
 A California solar technology company and a Chinese power equipment manufacturer plan to sign a deal on Saturday for the construction of up to 2,000 megawatts of power plants using concentrating solar power over the next decade, executives from both companies said this week. That is equivalent to the output of a couple of nuclear power plants. They will start with a 92-megawatt plant in Yulin, a town in a semi-desert area of Shaanxi Province in central China.
 The Chinese equipment manufacturer, Penglai Electric, hopes to work with other Chinese manufacturers to drive production costs down precipitously, clearing the way for exports, although these would require further approval from the California licensor of the technology, eSolar.
 Eric Wang, the senior vice president for international business development at Penglai Electric, said that manufacturing mirrors, turbines, towers and other equipment in China instead of the United States could cut costs by at least half. That could make concentrating solar power more competitive with other forms of power generation around the world.
 China's Ministry of Science, the Beijing municipal government and the Chinese Academy of Sciences are already building Asia's first concentrating solar power plant on the outskirts of Beijing, although it is only a pilot operation to generate 1.5 megawatts.
 Preparations are also under way for the construction of a 50-megawatt concentrating solar power plant in Gansu Province in northwestern China, said Min Deqing, a renewable energy consultant in Lanzhou, the provincial capital of Gansu. 
 But while nuclear power, wind energy and photovoltaic solar panels have strong backing from China's political leaders and enormous financing by government-owned banks, concentrating solar power still faces deep-rooted skepticism in senior ranks of the government.
 Unlike in the United States, the roots of that skepticism do not lie in concerns about disrupting the habitat of rare species in sunny, desert areas -- a worry that may block some attempts to build concentrating solar power plants in the Mojave Desert.
 Mr. Li wrote that concentrating solar power works best when cheap water, cheap land and lots of sun are available in the same place -- a rare combination in China. Mr. Li also expressed concern that concentrating solar power would prove more expensive per kilowatt-hour generated than photovoltaic solar power, a technology in which China is already the world's low-cost supplier.
 Mr. Li has a lot of influence on these issues. He is a deputy director general for energy research at the National Development and Reform Commission, the top economic planning agency in China. And he is the secretary general of the government-backed Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association, which helps oversee these industries' operations in China.
 But Mr. Li did say that he saw a limited role for concentrating solar power, particularly in places where it could be combined with other power plants, or where it could be combined with a way to store power overnight. Penglai and eSolar hope to do both.
 Water consumption, mainly to condense the steam after it has been used to generate electricity, is another potential weakness of the technology. Water tends to be scarce in deserts, of course. Penglai and eSolar are leaning toward air cooling instead of water cooling, at the price of cutting the efficiency of their plant.
 Mr. Gross said the eSolar technology could also be used to create extra heat during the day, with the heat being stored and used to generate power at night -- a form of the electricity storage sought by Mr. Li.
 Despite the government's skepticism, renewable energy investors remain enthusiastic about the potential for concentrating solar power projects in China. K. K. Chan, the chief executive of Nature Elements Capital, a renewable energy investment fund in Beijing, said that he had been looking at such deals in recent months after concluding that the valuations for photovoltaic solar projects were unreasonably high, possibly because that technology had such strong government backing.
 Mr. Min in Lanzhou said that while there was little data yet on the cost of concentrating solar power, the price tag was likely to fall in China. ''Eventually, when 100 percent domestically produced mirrors are used,'' he said, ''the cost will be lower than solar panel power plants.''

HEADLINE: The Damage Of Card Rewards

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
For several years, I've wondered whether my aggressive pursuit of credit card rewards made me a selfish consumer.
 After all, the 1 to 3 percent or more of every transaction that merchants pay to accept the cards is a significant cost, and the small local retailers that make neighborhoods vibrant often pay a higher percentage. 
 Stores then build those fees into higher prices, so people who aren't earning any rewards can end up subsidizing those who do. Many of these people have no credit cards because they're financially troubled. 
 So the risk is that we perpetuate a sort of reverse Robin Hood problem, as Prof. Steven Semeraro of Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego puts it. It's possible that the poor pay subsidies to finance the rewards of the affluent. 
 Andrew Martin's article in The Times earlier this week noted how quickly the fees that merchants pay to accept certain debit cards had risen, too. That suggests a related question: Wouldn't we all be better off if those of us who use plastic to earn free travel or cash back laid down our cards en masse? 
 So this week, I tried to figure out what would happen if we did just pay cash, or if there's a better course of action for people who spend in a self-interested fashion but still have a conscience.
 Quantifying the damage the cards cause merchants and the poor turns out to be quite difficult. Each card in your wallet can bear a wide range of costs, and retailers may pay different amounts to accept the same card. You can get a rough sense of your cards' costs by punching in the first six numbers at truecostofcredit.com. 
 Here's one finding: Rewards-earning credit cards with the Visa and MasterCard logo often cost merchants more than plain-vanilla ones, which hints at the card companies' laserlike focus on subsidizing rewards for the affluent customers who are still spending, even if they are paying their bills off each month and thus paying no interest.
 But cards undoubtedly also benefit retailers. People can use credit to spend more than they have in the bank at the moment, and some may spend more on a card than they would if they had to lay out a pile of money. Merchants who handle less cash, meanwhile, bear fewer costs for counting it, calling the armored car, and theft by employees or armed bandits. 
 As for the cost to consumers of all the card use, the National Retail Federation figures that the so-called interchange fees that their members pay to accept Visa and MasterCard alone cost an average of $427 an American household in 2008. Add in other fees the stores pay, plus costs for American Express and Discover, and that number could approach $600. 
 Bringing that cost down to zero means that everyone would have to quit cards cold turkey. That's a tall order, given that the campaign wouldn't work unless all Americans were in on it, especially those who earn well over that $600 each year in rewards. 
 Besides, cards offer other benefits besides rewards, like ease of budgeting and record keeping, allowing you to avoid checks by paying monthly bills with a card, the ability to dispute charges and the time savings in not having to refill your wallet at an A.T.M. as often (and cost savings in not paying A.T.M. fees).
 But let's pretend that a boycott is feasible. Then what? Some merchants would keep the money they no longer had to pay to the banks instead of lowering prices. Banks, having lost that income, might try to make it up by charging consumers higher fees. 
 There is no way for consumers to win. No way, that is, unless merchants started giving us all discounts for using cash instead of cards. Then, we could decide whether the card rewards were worth more to us than the discount that any given retailer was offering. Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover all say that this is perfectly fine (not to mention the retailers' right by federal law); they allow cash discounts but prohibit surcharges for card use.
 But most merchants find this problematic for a variety of reasons. What difference is there, really, between a discount and a surcharge except semantics? And what retailer needs the risk of inadvertently breaking one of the rules and having to pay a fine or losing the ability to accept cards altogether?
 Other retailers find it offensive on its face that they should have to offer a discount to people who use United States legal tender. How, they ask, did we come to a point where anyone would even be bold enough to suggest something so outrageous? Besides, it makes little sense to hand over money to people who are already paying cash without knowing how many card users will join them, if any. 
 Then, there are the rules in some states that require retailers to display both the cash and credit price on every single item. That might work for a gas station but be expensive for a big-box retailer. 
 John Rydman, co-owner of the Spec's chain of wine and liquor stores in Texas, offers a 5 percent discount to customers who use cash or punch in their PINs when using their debit cards. He decided to mark every item in the store with two prices, even though the state didn't require it. ''We do it for the ease of the customer, because they can't do the math generally,'' he said. 
 You'd think his largess would satisfy every customer, but it does not. ''Some people don't get it and don't like it,'' he said. ''They're mad that nobody else does this to them.''
 Indeed, this is the problem that gas stations can face, according to Jeff Lenard, a spokesman for NACS, an industry group that represents convenience stores and gas stations. If they introduce a cash discount, many card-using customers will drive on by, assuming that the station owner has in reality simply raised prices for people swiping plastic. If the station owner then capitulates and establishes a single price again, cash customers who were getting a deal before now think prices have gone up again, and they, too, find another place to fuel up. 
 Life might be simpler and more efficient if retailers could levy a surcharge that covers their costs to accept cards and let consumers figure out whether to pay it. But the card companies don't allow that, and Congress hasn't yet forced their hand, though this is now how things work in Australia (where some retailers charge excessive fees, alas). 
 So what's an American consumer to do in the meantime? For help answering that, I turned to Dave Hanson. Mr. Hanson, a Spokane, Wash., resident, is one of the savviest card users I know. He also happens to have studied philosophy in graduate school at the University of Chicago and taught applied ethics at Gonzaga University. 
 He's not cutting up his cards just yet. ''The marginal effect of my individual use of plastic simply won't impact the larger outcome,'' he said. ''The assumption that we ought to act in a way that we wish all of us would act ignores the fact that there is no mechanism by which we can ensure that we will all act that way. And we won't.''
 But shouldn't some us take a stand anyway, if only to prove a point? ''You wouldn't get very far if you suggested that to people,'' he said. ''The sad fact of contemporary American economic culture is atomistic individualism. Anything else is decried as communism.''
 Mr. Hanson suggested some other ideas. He uses cash for certain small purchases and at retailers where he has reason to believe that his card use will cause undue economic harm. He also supports politicians who aim to change banking practices that hurt merchants and the poor.
 Indeed, if you're worried about the social impact of your card use, you could donate some of your card rewards each year to nonprofit groups that help the economically disadvantaged.
 Or, you could give up on cards and try to earn your rewards back by investing in Visa stock. Making money off the card system in that way might not be ethically consistent. But at least you'd still have a stake in what appears to be an inexorable march down the road toward a cashless society.

HEADLINE: U.P.S. Plans to Cut 1,800 Jobs

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
United Parcel Service said on Friday that it would cut 1,800 management and administrative jobs as it repositioned itself for a gradual recovery. 
 About 1,100 employees will be offered buyouts, which are meant to streamline the company's small-package segment in the United States. Other cuts will come through attrition and layoffs. The small-package segment represents roughly 60 percent of the company's annual revenue. It handles shipments of up to 150 pounds by ground and air.
 United Parcel, based in Atlanta, has 408,000 employees worldwide. About 340,000 of those workers are in the United States.
 The company also raised its profit forecast for the fourth quarter, which ended in December, citing improving operations and cost cuts.
 United Parcel will reduce its American regions to three from five and its districts to 20 from 46 in April. There are no plans to close any operating facilities. The company said the consolidation of offices would not affect the sales and operations team, including drivers. It expects to incur a one-time charge in 2010 because of the reorganization.
 The company now expects earnings of 73 to 75 cents a share for the October-to-December quarter. It had previously predicted earnings of 58 to 65 cents a share. The company is to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 2.
 ''The stronger earnings stem from better-than-expected results in both domestic and international operations and savings through cost management,'' the chief financial officer, Kurt Kuehn, said in a statement. ''However, we still anticipate a gradual economic recovery with improvement more evident as 2010 progresses.''
 Shares of United Parcel rose $2.76, to $60.17.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Fell Once Again in November

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Americans borrowed less for a 10th consecutive month in November with total credit and borrowing on credit cards falling by the largest amount on records going back nearly seven decades. 
 The declines raised new questions about whether consumers would cut back further on spending, making it harder for the economy to mount a sustained rebound.
 The Federal Reserve said on Friday that total borrowing dropped by $17.5 billion in November, a much bigger decline than the $5 billion decrease expected by economists.
 Americans are borrowing less for several reasons. They remain fearful about their job prospects and they are trying to replenish depleted investments. The government reported Friday that employers cut an additional 85,000 jobs in December, bringing total job losses to more than eight million since the recession began in December 2007.
 Even consumers who would like to increase their borrowing are finding it hard to get credit. Many banks have tightened lending standards. While economists have worried for years about the low rate of savings, the concern now is that consumers could derail the recovery if they start saving too much. Consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of total economic activity.
 November's $17.5 billion drop in total credit was the biggest amount in dollars terms since records began in 1943. That represents an 8.5 percent fall from the October borrowing level. That was the biggest percentage drop since credit declined 9 percent in May 1980.
 The category that includes credit cards fell by $13.7 billion, a record decline in dollar terms. The drop was 18.5 percent from November, the biggest decline in percentage terms since a 29.6 percent plunge in December 1974.
 The Fed's credit report excludes home loans and home equity mortgages, covering only borrowing that is not secured by real estate.
 The 10-month drop in overall credit was a record in terms of consecutive declines, surpassing the old mark of seven drops in a row in 1943 and 1991.
 Borrowing in the category that includes credit cards has fallen for 14 months, also a record.
 With the string of declines, overall consumer borrowing by the Fed measure has fallen to $2.46 trillion.

HEADLINE: Swiss Court Says Regulator Broke the Law in UBS Case

BYLINE: By CHRIS V. NICHOLSON

 BODY:
A Swiss court ruled on Friday that the country's financial regulator broke the law last year when it ordered the investment firm UBS to hand over data on nearly 300 clients suspected of evading taxes to United States authorities. 
 The Federal Administrative Court in Bern said that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, known as Finma, had gone beyond its mandate. 
 The regulator argued that its actions last February were justified by laws allowing it to take unspecified preventive measures if banks were threatened with insolvency. But in a 60-page ruling, the judges said the government and the Parliament were the only institutions with the authority to implement state-of-emergency laws.
 The agency said it had not yet decided if it would appeal the ruling to the Swiss Supreme Court. While it is too late to halt the transmission of data on certain clients, it could influence the course of future cases, as Switzerland remains embroiled in disputes about tax evasion, namely with France.
 In August, UBS reached another agreement with the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service to transfer the names and account details of 4,450 wealthy Americans; 500 cases were processed by November.
 The Swiss supervisory authority ordered UBS last February to surrender information regarding nearly 300 clients to the United States, which was threatening the bank with criminal prosecution. 
 UBS, based in Zurich, also agreed to pay a fine of $780 million to settle the case. At the time, it was feared that UBS would not survive as a business if it were indicted in the United States, and that its failure could have undermined Switzerland's economy.
 In its statement on Friday, Finma said that liquidity issues did not factor into the court's decision.
 UBS has acknowledged that from 2000 to 2007, some of its employees ''participated in a scheme to defraud the United States'' and its tax authorities by creating and concealing offshore accounts.
 UBS declined to comment on the ruling. The Swiss government spokesman, Andre Simonazzi, said the ministers would discuss the issue next week.

HEADLINE: As Dividends Have Fallen, So May They Rise

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
FOR the first time in at least half a century, American companies announced more dividend cuts than increases in 2009.
 In a normal year, companies announce 10 to 20 times more favorable than unfavorable dividend changes, but the last two years have been anything but normal. The financial crisis forced many financial companies to cut or suspend payments, and the credit crisis and recession led many other companies to cut back wherever they could. 
 But by the end of the year, there were indications that the recession was over and the number of negative dividend decisions began to decline, according to statistics compiled by Standard & Poor's.
 ''The fourth quarter was in no way a good period for dividends, but compared to recent history it marks a significant improvement, and when added to the stabilization in increases, supports our belief that the worst is over for dividends,'' said Howard Silverblatt, the senior index analyst at S.& P.
 ''Standard & Poor's believes that the dividend recovery will be slow, and that it will take until 2012 to 2013 to return to where we were in 2007 and 2008,'' he added.
 Over all, Mr. Silverblatt said, dividend cuts in 2009 cost investors $58 billion.
 The figures shown in the accompanying graphics compare the number of companies announcing either a resumption of dividend payments or an increase in the payout to the number announcing either a reduction or elimination of the dividend.
 S.& P. also counts declarations of extra dividends, but does not keep track of whether such dividends are higher or lower than the company paid the previous year. Those figures are excluded from the calculations.
 In 2009, just 778 companies announced either increases or resumptions of payouts, the smallest number since S.& P. began keeping track of the figures in 1955. The previous low was 786 in 1958, another recession year and the only previous year when the number of negative moves came close to the number of positive ones.
 Similarly, the number of negative moves in 2009, at 804, was the highest ever, surpassing the 738 figure of 1958.
 On a quarterly basis, the first three months of 2009 were the worst of this cycle, with 64 percent of dividend announcements being negative. But that figure fell a little short of the record of 67 percent, set in the second quarter of 1958.
 The stock market hit bottom in March 2009, at a time when there was talk of a new Great Depression. In that one month, a record 144 companies announced reductions in or eliminations of dividends. Before the current cycle, that total had topped 100 in only one other month, May 1958. But the number surpassed 100 in five of the six months from November 2008 through April 2009.
 The sheer rapidity of the plunge could provide an indication that the dividend recovery will be faster than many expect. It is possible that some companies made cuts fearing much worse conditions than actually arrived, and will therefore be able to raise payouts even without much improvement in business.

GRAPHIC: CHART: For the first time in half a century, American companies announced more negative dividend actions (reductions or eliminations) than positive ones (increases and resumptions) in 2009. In the peak quarter for bad news, the first quarter of last year, almost two-thirds of the changes were negative. But by the end of the year, positive actions were beginning to predominate.

HEADLINE: Panel Will Question Big Bank Leaders

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and ERIC DASH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Eight months after Congress established a commission to investigate the causes of the financial crisis, the panel is at last getting its work under way, despite concerns that its report, due on Dec. 15, will arrive too late to influence the debate over regulatory reform.
 The commission, comprising six Democrats and four Republicans, has summoned four heads of big banks to testify on Wednesday at the panel's first substantive hearing: Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, John J. Mack of Morgan Stanley and Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of America. 
 ''There is a deep hunger out there, on behalf of the American people, to understand what happened,'' the commission's chairman, Phil Angelides, said in an interview on Friday. ''It arises out of anger, confusion and anxiety about their own future. This will be, in a real sense, the only public forum for examination of this crisis.'' 
 The unequal partisan composition of the panel, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, has raised hackles among Republicans. But Mr. Angelides, a Democrat and a former California state treasurer who unsuccessfully tried to unseat Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006, said he had collaborated on every major decision with his vice chairman, Bill Thomas, a fellow Californian and former congressman who was once the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. 
 The commission has hired more than 30 staff members, including Matt Cooper, a veteran magazine journalist who is serving as a senior adviser. The executive director is J. Thomas Greene, who was a chief assistant attorney general in California.
 Mr. Thomas at one point called Mr. Angelides a ''wacko Democratic liberal'' during the interview, but also said the chairman had consulted him on all staff appointments and had convinced him and other Republicans that ''we have a really fair shot'' at an impartial report. 
 Democrats have likened the new commission to the Pecora Commission, which was established in 1932 to examine the causes of the 1929 stock market crash and which led to major reforms like the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated investment banks and commercial banks. 
 But the House adopted a package last month to overhaul financial regulations, and final legislation could be enacted before the commission delivers its report. 
 Nonetheless, Mr. Angelides and Mr. Thomas said they hoped their findings would affect future legislation and serve as a definitive narrative of the crisis's origins. They cited as a model the 9/11 Commission report, which was praised for its clarity and became a surprise best seller. Along with pursuing a commercial publisher, they said the commission intended to place many documents online. 
 The commission is likely to tackle a series of topics, including subprime mortgages and institutions considered too big to fail. ''It's important that it be logical, rational and clearly nonpolitical,'' Mr. Angelides said. 
 Wall Street executives have taken an interest in the hearings since they were announced late last month. Bank employees worked through the holidays preparing testimony and drawing up potential questions that will be asked of their chiefs. The hearings will occur in the middle of the 2009 bonus season, and executives are bracing for questions about the paychecks that many firms will dispense. The commission's attention is expected to turn to Citigroup next month. 
 Scott E. Talbott, a lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable, said the causes of the crisis were already well known, and played down the panel's impact. ''The economy is not going to get worse because of findings of the commission, and the industry is not going to suffer any more than it has.'' 
 Mr. Angelides said the commission would not hesitate to use its power of subpoena. ''If we need the information and can't get it voluntarily, we'll get it by subpoena,'' he said. ''End of story.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 12, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the first substantive hearing of a commission established by Congress to investigate the causes of the financial crisis referred incorrectly to a similar investigation in 1932 that sought to learn the causes of the Wall Street crash of 1929. That inquiry was a series of hearings conducted by the Senate Banking Committee; it was not established as a commission. (The investigation has become known as the Pecora hearings, after Ferdinand Pecora, the chief staff investigator.) The error has appeared in other articles written since Congress last year began considering creating a commission to investigate the recent crisis, including articles on March 12, May 6 and July 16 last year and an Op-Ed Page column on Oct. 18.

HEADLINE: Japan Airlines May File for Bankruptcy to Help Government Rescue Effort

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Japan Airlines, the once-proud flagship carrier now crippled by $16 billion in debt, may soon file for bankruptcy protection as part of a state-led turnaround in one of the nation's largest corporate failures.
 Government officials said a final decision had not been made on the fate of the airline, Asia's largest. But they suggested that the carrier, which the state has already bailed out four times, would most likely undergo some form of court-led restructuring similar to a Chapter 11 filing in the United States -- a bold step for the new government of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama.
 ''This problem was long postponed by the Liberal Democratic Party,'' the transport minister, Seiji Maehara, told reporters on Friday, referring to the departing administration. ''With a change in government, we will find the ultimate solution,'' he said. 
 In a statement, Japan Airlines denied that a final decision had been made on its restructuring plans and said that it had no announcement to make.
 Shares in the airline slumped 13 percent on Friday, extending losses this week to almost 30 percent and lowering the airline's market value to below $2 billion, from more than $6 billion a year ago. A formal decision by the government on a filing is expected next week, with a possible bankruptcy filing as early as Jan. 19, Japanese news agencies said.
 Prime Minister Hatoyama, whose party swept to power in September on promises of extensive changes to Japan's postwar order, said the government was committed to keeping the planes flying smoothly during the restructuring.
 ''We have made efforts to make sure JAL's operations are not disrupted,'' he said. ''We will continue that effort.'' 
 Despite Japan Airlines' woes, two United States carriers -- Delta Air Lines and American Airlines -- are vying for a stake in the company. For decades prized and protected as a national icon, the airline is still a powerful regional player despite its most recent struggles, which give the American airlines a rare opportunity to invest in it.
 Both airlines hope to tap routes to Asia, the world's fastest-growing aviation market. Executives at Delta and American have said they hope to bolster Tokyo as their hub in Asia, and they are seeking a stronger foothold in Japan before the expansion of Haneda airport in Tokyo. A recent agreement between the United States and Japan is spurring cooperation between airlines of the two countries.
 ''Whichever form the restructuring takes, JAL needs a strong international partner by its side,'' the president of Delta Air Lines, Edward H. Bastian, told reporters on Thursday in Tokyo, where he was set to meet executives and government officials. ''Our objective here is to invest in the restructured company,'' he said.
 Delta has offered Japan Airlines $500 million in equity, as well as a major increase in passengers and revenue from its SkyTeam alliance. American, which has a tie-up with the airline through its Oneworld alliance, has offered $1.1 billion to stay put. 
 Mr. Bastian seemed to push for change at Japan Airlines. ''Change is hard but is absolutely necessary to make changes if JAL is going to survive. Tough decisions need to be taken,'' he said. Any investment would fetch only a minority stake because Japanese law prohibits foreign ownership of its airlines. 
 It is a spectacular fall for Japan Airlines, which rose out of the ashes of World War II and became a symbol of Japan's rise as a global economic power. Initially owned by the government, it opened its first domestic routes in 1951. It expanded overseas just two years later with a flight linking Tokyo to San Francisco by way of Honolulu.
 The airline continued to grow rapidly with the Japanese economy, and in Japan's bubble economy of the 1980s supported the heyday of Japanese package tour groups overseas. The red-crested crane on its aircraft became a national motif, and Japanese girls dreamed of becoming flight attendants on Japan Airlines. 
 But ambitious investments in overseas hotels and resorts, coupled with soaring personnel and pension costs, weighed on the company's finances. The airline was privatized in 1987.
 More recently, the airline has suffered from a drop-off in traffic amid the global economic crisis and the swine flu epidemic. The airline, which lost about $1.5 billion in the six months ended in September, has said it will cut thousands of jobs and cancel unprofitable routes.
 But with its balance sheet deteriorating rapidly, the airline applied in October for aid from a state-backed turnaround fund. The fund has said it is prepared to back Japan Airlines with more public money if the airline files for bankruptcy under Japan's Corporate Rehabilitation Law and its creditor banks waive $3.77 billion in loans. 
 The airline's top lenders -- Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho and Sumitomo Mitsui -- have balked at the plan, instead suggesting a restructuring outside of court. Some government officials also expressed fears that a bankruptcy would cause panic among passengers and ground planes.
 Experts say a bankruptcy would best serve the airline's long-term interest, especially as it looks for backing from a partner like Delta or American.
 ''For the future of JAL, it will be important to maintain integrity of process,'' the Center for Asia Pacific Aviation, a market intelligence company based in Sydney, said in a recent report. ''If major foreign airlines are to invest heavily in the carrier, due process and reasonable certainty of outcome will be essential.''

HEADLINE: Unions Rally to Oppose a Proposed Tax on Health Insurance

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

 BODY:
When millions of blue-collar workers were leaning toward John McCain during the 2008 campaign, labor unions moved many of them into Barack Obama's column by repeatedly hammering one theme: Mr. McCain wanted to tax their health benefits.
 But now labor leaders are fuming that President Obama has endorsed a tax on high-priced, employer-sponsored health insurance policies as a way to help cover the cost of health care reform. And as Senate and House leaders seek to negotiate a final health care bill, unions are pushing mightily to have that tax dropped from the legislation. Or at the very least, they want the price threshold raised so that the tax would affect fewer workers. 
 Labor leaders say the tax would hit not only wealthy executives with expensive health benefits, but also many rank-and-file union members who have often settled for lower wage increases in exchange for more generous health benefits. 
 The tax would affect individual insurance policies with annual premiums above $8,500 and family policies above $23,000, which by one union survey would affect one in four union members. 
 The House bill does not contain such an excise tax, and many House Democrats oppose adding it to the combined House-Senate legislation. But the tax is a critical revenue component in the Senate's bill. If the bill does too little to cover its costs, it might be defeated. Many economists support the tax, saying it will help hold down costs. 
 With labor groups warning that the tax will infuriate a key part of the Democratic base -- union members -- President Obama has agreed to meet with several top labor leaders on Monday to address their concerns and try to defuse their anger. The group includes the presidents of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Teamsters and the steelworkers' and service employees' unions.
 But whether the tax is negotiable remains unclear. Not only has Mr. Obama specifically endorsed the idea, but the White House and Senate leaders see the tax as pivotal in paying for the health care overhaul and addressing runaway health care costs. 
 Many Democrats and union officials fear that if both sides dig in on the issue, it could create a rift between the White House and labor -- with some union leaders hinting they might lobby aggressively against the entire health care bill if it contains such a tax.
 Union leaders have repeatedly warned the White House about the strong rank-and-file dismay, which could hurt the Democrats in Congressional elections this fall, especially in battleground states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. 
 Ron Gay, an AT&T repairman in Youngstown, Ohio, who spent much of the summer of 2008 urging co-workers to vote for Mr. Obama, said, ''If this passes in its current form, a lot of working people are going to feel let down and betrayed by our legislators and president.'' 
 The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 19 percent of workers -- or about 30 million employees -- would be affected by the tax in 2016. Economists say most of them would be nonunion, although it is organized labor that has the lobbying clout to take a stand.
 In recent days, labor's strategy has become clear. Unions are urging their members to flood their representatives with e-mail messages and phone calls in the hope that the House will stand fast and reject the tax. The A.F.L.-C.I.O., a federation of nine million union members, has declared next Wednesday ''National Call-In Day'' asking workers to call their lawmakers to urge them not to tax health benefits. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters is urging members to tell their representatives that ''such a tax is simply a massive middle-class tax hike that this nation's working families should not be forced to endure.''
 Many Democrats fear that enacting the tax will hurt their re-election chances.
 ''This would really have a negative impact on the Democratic base,'' said Representative Joe Courtney, Democrat of Connecticut, who has enlisted 190 House Democrats to sign a letter opposing the tax. ''As far as the message goes, it's a real toughie to defend.''
 While union leaders would prefer killing the tax, some say privately that they could live with it if the threshold is lifted to $27,000, say, or $30,000. They argue that many insurance policies above $23,000 are typical of the coverage in high-cost areas like New York or Boston, or policies that cover small businesses or employers with older workers.
 According to a union survey, one in four members would be hit by a $23,000 threshold, but only one in 14 if the threshold were raised to $27,000. 
 White House officials, however, voice concern that raising the threshold that much would lose $50 billion of the $149 billion in revenue that the tax is expected to generate over 10 years.
 Those officials and Senate leaders argue, moreover, that unions are wrong to fight the tax, saying that it will hold down health costs and that money employers save on health premiums will ultimately go to higher wages. 
 Some experts say the tax's main effect would be to deter insurers from continually raising premiums. ''This is a tax on insurance companies, not on workers,'' said Erin Shields, an aide to Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a chief sponsor of the excise tax. 
 ''Health care costs are rising much faster than inflation,'' Ms. Shields said. ''Imposing this tax will help hold down costs because it will give employers an incentive to find a plan that falls beneath the threshold and will give insurers an incentive to offer the best possible plan below the threshold.''
 Ms. Shields defended Mr. Obama, saying the excise tax he backs is far different from Senator McCain's proposal. Mr. McCain called for eliminating tax breaks for employer-sponsored health benefits, replaced with a tax credit to help consumers obtain health insurance, Ms. Shields said. 
 She added that the measure Mr. Obama supports would tax only that part of a family policy above the $23,000 threshold -- which would be taxed at a 40 percent rate.
 But union officials say the tax will cause employers to push higher co-payments and deductibles onto their employees. They argue that a fairer way to generate revenue would be to embrace the House bill, which imposes an income tax surcharge on couples earning more than $1 million.
 Neither the House nor the Senate would seem to have much wiggle room on the issue.
 Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, has said he would oppose any bill containing the House's surtax. His vote was crucial in enabling Senate Democrats to reach the 60 votes needed to pass the health bill over a potential Republican filibuster. 
 The House bill, meanwhile, passed by only a five-vote margin, and at least three Democrats who voted for it -- Mr. Courtney, Phil Hare of Illinois and Carol Shea-Porter of New Hampshire -- have said they would oppose a final bill if it contained an excise tax like the Senate version. 
 Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, predicted the excise tax would raise workers' wages from 2010 to 2019. ''There are many academic studies showing that when health costs rise, wages fall,'' he said. ''In the mid- and late 1990s, when we got health costs under control, wages rose nicely.'' But he added that other factors could have also lifted wages during that period.
 Leo W. Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers, scoffed at arguments that by restraining health costs, the tax would lead to higher wages.
 ''The people who are promoting this tax say companies will make up for this with higher wages,'' Mr. Gerard said. ''These people who say that have never been at the bargaining table. It doesn't work that way.''
 Robert Gleason, chairman of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, said Mr. Obama had made an about-face that would badly hurt the president and other Democrats. ''You remember when the first President Bush said, 'Read my lips, no new taxes,' and he raised taxes and he went down to defeat,'' he added. ''This is the same thing.''
 Michael P. James, a 57-year-old steelworker with the Timken Company in Canton, Ohio, campaigned for Mr. Obama and is seething about the tax.
 ''I don't think we should be penalized by this bill,'' Mr. James said. ''The president would be going back on his word. If he goes ahead and passes a bill with the excise tax, I won't be able to support him again.''

HEADLINE: From Battlefield to Ivy League, on the G.I. Bill

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Cameron Baker, an undergraduate at Columbia University, made a point of wearing a ''Coalition Forces'' T-shirt at the start of the fall semester. He was not bragging or making a collegiate attempt at ironic humor.
 Mr. Baker, 26, really was among the coalition forces, having done back-to-back deployments to Iraq with the Air Force and three more years there with a private contractor. He wore the shirt to quietly broadcast his involvement in Iraq, alerting professors and classmates to tread lightly should the conversation turn to war.
 It was a different coping mechanism that backfired on him.
 Mr. Baker gravitates toward the front of classes to compensate for hearing loss from repeated exposure to mortar fire. Recently, in his course ''Issues in Comparative Politics,'' a professor played a short news clip about the electoral process in Iraq. For a split second, a roadside bomb went off in the video, and Mr. Baker, caught off guard and right up close, started shaking. 
 ''I wasn't in the classroom anymore,'' he said later that day. ''I wasn't transported all the way back to Baghdad, but I could feel just the rush of emotions that accompanies something like that -- the immediate adrenaline rush, the anxiety that comes with it, the hypervigilance, when I start trying to become very aware of my surroundings, to ensure that nothing is going to go off behind me.''
 More than 300,000 veterans and their dependents are enrolled in American institutions of higher education, their numbers swelling as a result of a new, more generous version of the G.I. Bill that Congress passed in 2008. The veterans and their federal benefits are being embraced by community colleges and huge campuses like the University of Texas, as well as by online schools like the University of Phoenix.
 They are bringing to the esoteric world of academia the ballast of the most real of real-world experiences, along with all the marks of the military existence, from crew cuts to frayed nerves to a platoon approach to social life.
 Perhaps nowhere is this new wave more striking than at Columbia, which more than any other Ivy League institution has thrown out a welcome mat for returning servicemen and women. There are 210 veterans across the university, integrating a campus whose image-defining moment in the past half-century was of violent protests against the Vietnam War.
 The campus still tilts heavily to the left, with many students displaying the arty, jaded aura befitting their Manhattan surroundings. But now, students largely welcome the vets, who are both admired and considered something of a curiosity.
 The veterans in the undergraduate program attend classes side by side with fresh-faced 18-year-olds, but do not often socialize with them, preferring to gather instead at their own watering hole. In contrast to their classmates, many -- though certainly not all -- lack stellar high school records, which is what propelled some of them to the military in the first place.
 Some also come with post-traumatic stress disorder. The college offers counseling for the disorder, but it is impossible to defend against every trigger.
 Each time Mr. Baker goes near a refrigerated soda case, for example, the squealing door reminds him of the whistle of a Katyusha rocket.
 'Oh, That Columbia'
 The youngest of four children, Mr. Baker moved as a child from Utah to Texas to Connecticut and back to Texas, nearly flunking out of high school, not once but twice. 
 ''I didn't care,'' he said. ''I was more interested in hanging out with my friends than studying.''
 After graduating from high school, Mr. Baker was given a month to move out of the house. His parents suggested the military, which his brother and a brother-in-law had already joined. He signed with the Air Force, spending a year in Alaska before heading to Iraq with his civil engineering squadron.
 During five years there, he frequently came under fire but was never seriously wounded. The most obvious sign of his war duty is a phrase tattooed in Arabic across his enormous trapezius muscles that spells out ''Redemption Through Retribution'' -- a provocative declaration that he says has layers of meaning, one being his desire for revenge after the loss of a friend during his first tour.
 After returning from Iraq, Mr. Baker decided to buckle down. His goal was not high-minded: It was to eventually make enough money to take care of himself and his parents, who now live in Georgia. He enrolled at the Lubbock, Tex., campus of South Plains College, a two-year school, earning a 3.9 grade-point average.
 Columbia's School of General Studies, which offers an undergraduate education for nontraditional students, took notice after spotting his name on a list for Phi Theta Kappa, the honor society for two-year colleges. Thus began a courtship that the school has repeated again and again, contacting young veterans directly and even dispatching admissions officers to Marine bases.
 ''They actually sent me a couple of e-mails, and I thought it was spam,'' Mr. Baker said. ''I got a package in the mail the next day, and I decided to check out this school. I didn't have any prospects. I was thinking of going to Texas Tech to become a petroleum engineer. I Googled it and thought, 'Oh, that Columbia.' '' 
 The influx of veterans at Columbia continues a tradition begun in 1947, when the university created the School of General Studies to accommodate the large numbers of World War II veterans on the G.I. Bill.
 Over the years, with the ebb and flow of wars, the School of General Studies embraced a wider range of students who had taken time off from academia -- ballet dancers, professional athletes, even veterans from other countries.
 ''I call them tutus and Uzis because they're all dancers or kids from the Israeli Army,'' said the school's dean, Peter J. Awn.
 But with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continuing, the military presence at Columbia is again on the rise. The school now counts 88 veterans with G.I. benefits among the 1,330 students. The rest of the veterans at Columbia are spread across more than a dozen graduate and professional schools.
 The admissions process for the School of General Studies, which some skeptics view as an easier path to a Columbia degree, is somewhat different from that in Columbia College, the university's largest undergraduate school. But officials insist it is no less rigorous. 
 Admissions officers look at high school records, test scores and essays. They conduct interviews in person and on the phone. They consider college-level work and real-life experience.
 While some of the veterans may indeed have nodded off in high school, the military effectively woke them up.
 ''We've seen again and again that the sheer determination those students demonstrated in the military translates well to their academic success here,'' said Curtis M. Rodgers, dean of enrollment management at the School of General Studies. ''There's a particular elite nature that we see in our Marines. We see it, too, with folks who have gone into the special forces in all the branches.''
 A Band of Students
 While General Studies students take the same courses as other Columbia undergraduates, there are invisible walls between them. For one thing, the average age in General Studies is 29. (One Barnard student calls Mr. Baker ''Grandpa.'') Instead of dormitories, General Studies students are offered apartment-style housing reserved for graduate students, helped by the G.I. Bill's $2,700-a-month housing allowance for New York City.
 But even among their contemporaries in General Studies, the veterans are often a group unto themselves.
 The moment he stepped on campus, Mr. Baker joined a ready-made community of other veterans. Most afternoons found him lifting weights with Tom Cox, 24, a former Marine from West Hartford, Conn., who also started at Columbia in the fall. Before and after, Mr. Baker pored over calculus and philosophy books in the General Studies lounge, where century-old portraits of academicians peer at a long center table where the veterans sometimes gather.
 ''Everyone here knows I'm messed up in the head,'' Mr. Baker said as one veteran after another entered the study lounge, dispensing soulful handshakes. ''I can talk about it and they're not going to ask me stupid, uninformed questions, and they're not going to bring it up the next day. And that's very important.''
 Mr. Cox, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said it was difficult to relate to students from Columbia College. ''The ones who are 18 and 19, it's tough,'' he said. ''They haven't seen anything.''
 But he has found students to be genuinely supportive. ''Everyone always says, 'Thank you for your service,' even if they don't agree with the war,'' he added.
 Forty years ago, the climate was much different, with war protests reaching such a pitch that students took over buildings for days on end and violent clashes with the police led to more than 500 arrests and scores of injuries. 
 Today, veterans are finding that, at least when they are around, the other students tend to tiptoe awkwardly around the war and their experience.
 ''It's a reserved curiosity,'' said Adam Kurland, 30, a graduate student in the School of Business who is from Shrewsbury, N.J., and served in the Army in South Korea and Iraq. ''People are initially hesitant to ask questions because they're afraid it's inappropriate or they don't want to say the wrong thing.''
 Mr. Baker said he was keenly aware of the ''huge reputation this school has of being antiwar and antimilitary,'' which made him apprehensive about coming. Still, he appreciates that nonveterans ''moderate their talk'' around veterans.
 It probably helps that his feelings about the war are complex. ''When it first started, I was all idealistic about it,'' Mr. Baker said of the war in Iraq. ''I thought we were going to go over there and do some good, and by the end of the first deployment, it was very clear that we were absolutely wasting our time there.''
 A Generous Bill
 The Post-9/11 G. I. Bill, which took effect in August, is proving to be a bonanza for universities. For veterans who served at least three years since Sept. 11, 2001, or were disabled, the program pays the entire tuition at public two- and four-year institutions, in addition to a housing allowance and money for books. The old bill had less generous tuition reimbursements and no housing allowance. The government has paid more than $1 billion in benefits under the new bill alone. 
 The top three recipients of students under the new G.I. Bill offer many of their courses online: the University of Phoenix, the most by far with 2,054 students; the University of Maryland University College; and American InterContinental University. 
 At a more traditional school, the University of Texas, where the number of veterans rose to 606 this fall from 419 a year earlier largely because of the new G.I. Bill, officials have moved to streamline information about benefits and services by creating a single Web page. LaToya Hill, assistant dean of students, has pressed the university to hire a full-time veteran services coordinator, although given the economic climate, that is unlikely to happen this year, she said.
 ''What we have discovered is that when they get discharged, a lot of the veterans are looking for information'' Dr. Hill said. ''Which institution they choose depends upon the ease of that process.''
 Administrators at Columbia are also preparing for a surge. Twenty to 25 more veterans are expected to arrive at the School of General Studies in the spring, and Dean Awn predicted that the overall number would grow ''by 60 or 75 a year.''
 A provision in the new bill known as the Yellow Ribbon program has made it more affordable for eligible veterans -- those who served at least three years since Sept. 11, 2001 -- to attend expensive private colleges that pay some of the tuition. Columbia has set aside $1.2 million for Yellow Ribbon students for the current academic year, while the government is expected to pay $5 million on behalf of veterans attending under the new G.I. Bill, not including the housing allowances.
 But as the veteran population at Columbia expands, so, too, will its needs. 
 ''One veteran who just graduated had lost his leg below the knee and had a prosthesis,'' Dean Awn said. ''I can't imagine we're not going to get paraplegics or people with vision loss.''
 For now, most of the students' problems relate to adjustment, anxiety and stress. Dr. Richard J. Eichler, executive director of Counseling and Psychological Services, which is part of Health Services at Columbia, said that post-traumatic stress disorder usually involves a ''symptom cluster'' including flashbacks, hypervigilance, avoidance and numbing.
 One of the goals of treatment, Dr. Eichler said, was to help veterans downshift. 
 ''It makes sense to be on guard when you're in a combat situation,'' he said. ''But it's not so useful in civilian life.''
 Mr. Baker was blindsided by the explosion shown in his political science course in part because the class had not touched on the war all semester. But throughout the fall, he found himself reacting to the cacophony and crowds around the Morningside Heights campus.
 Mr. Baker is rattled, variously, by the subway, teeming sidewalks, random noises, even the constant chitchat that is a hallmark of college life. 
 ''In closed spaces, if there are seven people or more talking all at the same time, everything feels like it's pushing in on me, and that triggers aggression,'' he said. ''I just remove myself from the situation.''
 Mr. Baker has developed techniques to make him feel more secure. In a crowded bar or nightclub, for instance, he stands with his back to the wall so that he faces the action. He also sought help from Counseling Services, and during a few sessions, he learned ways to relax by doing breathing exercises.
 ''The shrink said that anxiety triggers fight or flight,'' he said. ''There's a weird yoga thing where you flex a muscle group and focus on it and breathe.''
 Oddly, some veterans find solace in their new surroundings. 
 ''The idea of moving to New York City was a little threatening,'' said Joseph Raser, a General Studies junior who was in Iraq and Afghanistan with the Army and transferred to Columbia from Northeastern University in Boston. ''But it's kind of comforting that there is so much going on, that it's fast-paced, almost like a deployment.''
 V.F.W. of Columbia
 Mr. Baker and a number of other veterans hang out a few times a week at Haakon's Hall, a new restaurant across the street from campus that has become a de facto V.F.W. hall. The owner, James Lenzi, hosted a dozen veterans stuck on campus on Thanksgiving, giving them a free lunch. He did the same on Christmas. 
 The paternal relationship evolved as the restaurant was about to open in May and the veterans were looking for a place to hold an event.
 ''I know the miseries of war,'' Mr. Lenzi said. ''My father and 12 uncles fought in World War II and Korea. I'm working-class, and they are the only ones who talked to me.''
 While the veterans get free pitchers of beer and V.I.P. treatment, Mr. Lenzi reaps the benefit of their varied skills: fixing the wireless network, hoisting barrels of beer, updating the Web site, even doing plumbing work. 
 ''It's like 'Cheers,' '' Mr. Baker said.
 Mr. Lenzi, in his own way, looks out for the veterans, too.
 ''What time is your class tomorrow?'' he asked Kevin Stendal, a former Marine, on a cold night last month. 
 ''14:40,'' was the reply.
 After mentally converting the military time to 2:40 p.m., Mr. Lenzi assented to another pitcher of beer for their table.
 ''I just don't want them to be hung over,'' he said. ''They've got finals.''

HEADLINE: With B.C.S. Done, Spring Must Be Near

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
The trickiest thing about college football's supposed championship is how impossible it is to live up to its built-in expectations. After more than a month of blather and speculation, of head coach worship and quarterback coronations, of baying at multiple full moons, it makes the Super Bowl look like an instantly conceived pickup game by comparison. So when you hang with all that and still care on Jan. 7 and are handed a complete deflation five Texas snaps into the game, it really makes you want a refund. For something. Your microwave popcorn. Anything. 
 Sure, Alabama fans are fine with all of this and they can ''Roll Tide'' themselves for months, with plenty of warm feelings about Mark Ingram bulling through the Heisman jinx and Coach Nick Saban's trademark punishing defense, writes Pat Forde on ESPN.com. But even in victory Saban killed a bit of the giddiness with a sour-puss reaction to the Gatorade bath. Everyone else felt as if they'd been doused with sticky stuff much earlier, when Texas quarterback Colt McCoy was knocked from the game in the first quarter, sapping all the drama from the game quickly, wrote Kevin Sherrington of The Dallas Morning News. Mike Lopresti of USA Today dubbed it less than a fair fight after that and Mike Freeman of CBSSports.com writes that means we don't know how good Alabama really is. The Los Angeles Times's Bill Plaschke is sold on the Tide, but the turn of events certainly sapped something from the whole experience, writes Dennis Dodd on CBSSports.com.
 McCoy's untimely injury, writes Andy Staples on SI.com, was the last piece of indignity in McCoy's snakebit career and Yahoo.com's Dan Wetzel says it was no picnic for either Texas quarterback. And Longhorns Coach Mack Brown will be reliving his ill-fated play call at the end of the first half for a long time, writes Joe Posnanski of SI.com.
 Oh, and wake us when the Southeastern Conference doesn't win one of these things, writes Jeff Passan on Yahoo.com.
 In what seems a fitting ending to a season marked by coaches behaving badly, Fanhouse.com reports that South Florida is canning Coach Jim Leavitt after reports that he struck a player. He can join the former Kansas Coach Mike Mangino and Texas Tech's Mike Leach in an instant support group.
 The N.F.L. now swoops in to dominate the news this weekend with its first round of playoffs, in which the Philadelphia Daily News columnist Rich Hoffman believes he's seeing the last of Donovan McNabb in an Eagles uniform and the world will find out how Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers will handle the most blistering rays of the always hot spotlight on him, writes Chris Harry of Fanhouse.com. WSJ.com's Reed Albergotti shines a new light on the Jets' indestructible tailback Thomas Jones and The Dallas Morning New's Gerry Fraley says the Cowboys' playoff plight can no longer be blamed on the curse of Doug Flutie.
 If you prefer your N.F.L. news on the more bizarre side, wander on over to the Raiders (surprise!) and roll your eyes at the tiff between them and the former quarterback Rich Gannon, who is using his radio show to annoy the pants off them. You won't look at stadium snow-shovelers the same way after finding out several dozen of them on their way to help clear Gillette Stadium were caught in an immigration sting. 
 When you want N.F.L. coaches to make you laugh -- unintentionally, of course -- watch this video/musical mashup of some famous tirades. Once and for all, Herm Edwards is immortalized.
 The fallout from the Gilbert Arenas suspension continues to ripple through the N.B.A., turning some attention to gambling among players and shining a harsh light on the league's willingness to set the stage for people like Arenas, writes Adrian Wojnarowski on Yahoo.com. David Steele writes on Fanhouse.com that Arenas is not the evil soul people are making him out to be and Gregg Doyel writes on CBSSports.com that the calls for escalating punishment are going a bit over the top. But Jason Whitlock of Foxsports.com writes that this kind of thing will keep happening until the league takes time to educate its players better.
 Bad news attached to the name Barry Bonds continues to roll, with his son Nikolai being arrested after being accused of throwing a doorknob at his mother, Sun Bonds.
 We sense there were more than a few metaphorical doorknobs thrown at televisions on Thursday night. Fortunately, we can't get arrested for that.

HEADLINE: Federal Judge Rejects Suit By Baltimore Against Bank

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL

 BODY:
A federal judge this week tossed out a lawsuit by Baltimore against Wells Fargo, ruling that the city could not prove that the bank's lending practices had resulted in broad damage to poor neighborhoods. 
 Baltimore officials have accused the bank of tipping hundreds of black homeowners into foreclosure by singling them out for high-interest subprime mortgages.
 But the city's claims are ''even more implausible,'' Judge J. Frederick Motz of Federal District Court wrote, ''when considered against the background of other factors leading to the deterioration of the inner city, such as extensive unemployment, lack of educational opportunity and choice, irresponsible parenting, disrespect for the law, widespread drug use and violence.'' 
 Officials with Wells Fargo, one of the nation's largest banks, have declined to give interviews on the lawsuit. But Cara Heiden, co-president of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, said in a statement after the ruling, ''From the beginning, we have consistently maintained that Baltimore's economic problems could not be attributed to the small numbers of foreclosures Wells Fargo has done in Baltimore.''
 Judge Motz left the legal door ajar for Baltimore, saying city officials could file a more limited complaint detailing specific damages caused in specific neighborhoods. Lawyers for Baltimore said they would do so. 
 ''We are not saying that Wells is responsible for a catastrophe in Baltimore and all the deterioration of the neighborhoods,'' said John P. Relman, a lawyer representing the city. ''We are simply saying that they are engaged in illegal conduct.''
 Mr. Relman promised that the city would detail the costs it incurred, including boarding up foreclosed and abandoned properties, responding to fires and dispatching police officers to evict squatters. And he said the city would point to the damage to the home values for surrounding homeowners, about which there is extensive academic literature.
 The Baltimore lawsuit included affidavits from former Wells Fargo loan officers who said the bank had systematically singled out black applicants for high-interest subprime mortgages.
 The judge's decision was a blow to a growing number of efforts by cities and states to hold banks accountable for some of the loose lending practices of the past decade.
 In Memphis, city officials last week filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo, saying the bank's lending practices had wreaked havoc in predominantly black neighborhoods. In Illinois, the state attorney general filed a lawsuit accusing Wells Fargo of marketing high-cost mortgage loans to black and Latino customers while selling lower-cost loans to white borrowers with similar incomes.

HEADLINE: In Europe and U.S., Data Shows Murky Job Outlook

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
The euro area has joined the United States in reaching a 10 percent unemployment rate as the American economy lost more jobs than expected in December, according to statistics released Friday. 
 The latest data tempered hopes in Europe and the United States for a rapid recovery that did not depend on large doses of government support.
 Before the American report was released, many analysts were predicting that the number of jobs there might increase for the first time since the recession began in December 2007. But the estimated net loss of 85,000 jobs, while a vast improvement over the situation for much of last year, pointed to continued reluctance on the part of employers to hire new workers.
 At a news conference, President Obama acknowledged the American data as a setback, while outlining plans to deliver $2.3 billion in tax credits to spur manufacturing jobs in clean energy. 
 ''We have to continue to explore every avenue to accelerate the return to hiring,'' the president told reporters.
 In Europe, which typically lags behind the United States, job losses continued to mount as the unemployment rate inched up to 10 percent in November, from 9.9 percent, hitting the highest level since 1998, a year before the euro was created.
 ''It's a recovery, but it's a weak, U-shaped recovery,'' both in Europe and America, said Arnab Das, global head of market research and strategy at Roubini Global Economics in London. ''We've lost a lot of jobs and it will take some time for creation to kick in. There is still enormous slack in the market.''
 Of the two regions, job seekers in America might be in a slightly better position to benefit from an upswing, analysts said. 
 During past recoveries, labor markets in the euro area have taken longer to improve than the United States because the American job market is more flexible, making it susceptible to sharper swings. 
 The unemployment rate in the United States, which is based on a separate survey from the job numbers, was unchanged at 10 percent, but only because huge numbers of unemployed people remained pessimistic about their prospects and had given up, at least for now, on their search for work.
 But in a twist that highlighted the erratic nature of economic renewal, the data pointed to a minuscule increase of 4,000 jobs in November -- rather than a loss of 11,000 the government originally estimated. If that holds up through future revisions, it would be the first monthly gain in two years. Another 16,000 job losses were added to October's tally.
 The American report ''shows that there is going to be some difficulty in making the transition to move from the end of firing to actual hiring,'' said Julia Coronado, senior United States economist at BNP Paribas. ''Eventually we will see some job growth, but there are a lot of weak patches still in the economy.''
 Christina D. Romer, chairman of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, called the report a ''setback'' but echoed the view of a number of private economists that the United States economy was likely to move to overall job creation sometime early this year.
 In Brussels, the European Union's statistics agency, Eurostat, said Friday that the number of unemployed in November rose by 102,000 in the 16-member euro area, a significant increase but well below the peak of 475,000 jobs lost at the start of the year. The 10 percent jobless rate contrasts with an 8 percent rate a year earlier.
 ''We think that the labor market correction has a long way to go'' in the euro area, said Nick Kounis, chief European economist at Fortis Bank in Amsterdam. ''Employment has still not fully adjusted to the fall in output during the recession, reflecting institutional rigidities in the euro zone labor market.'' 
 Highlighting the difficult business climate, Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer and the maker of Budweiser and Stella Artois beers, said Friday that it would cut some 10 percent of its work force in Western Europe, including hundreds of jobs in Germany and Belgium. InBev declined to give a figure for the total number of jobs to be cut.
 The unemployment rate for the broader 27-member European Union was 9.5 percent in November, Eurostat said, from 9.4 percent in October and 7.5 percent in November 2008. 
 Mr. Das of Roubini Global Economics pointed to significant differences between European nations.
 Jobs in countries like Germany appear to be safer, as that economy is benefiting from increased demand for its manufactured exports, like high-end automobiles, machine tools and capital goods, particularly from emerging markets. 
 The Eurostat data showed that seasonally adjusted unemployment in Germany was 7.6 percent, unchanged from October.
 Years of wage restraint have also helped make German companies competitive on a cost basis, protecting orders and jobs. Data released Friday by the Federal Statistics Office showed that German exports rose again in November, increasing by 1.6 percent on October. 
 The European unemployment rate would almost certainly be higher if governments like France and Germany had not established programs that offer support to companies putting workers on shorter hours to help cushion the effects of recession. 
 France's publicly financed partial-unemployment program allowed companies experiencing exceptional difficulties -- like PSA Peugeot Citroen, the automaker -- to lay off staff members temporarily and to draw on state funds to pay them during those periods. 
 Germany also has measures to reduce working time, many of which are specifically framed as employment-saving measures. The federal Kurzarbeit system, which translates as ''short work,'' offers a state-supported backup for enterprises resorting to short-time working outside the provisions of collective agreements.
 In France, the rate stood at 10 percent, up from 9.9 percent in October. For Italy, the rate was 8.3 percent, up from 8.2 percent a month earlier. 
 The lowest European rates were in the Netherlands, at just 3.9 percent, and Austria, at 5.5 percent, Eurostat said.
 In other European countries, the strains of the swift collapse in house prices and consumer confidence have created greater imbalances and are taking a greater toll on workers. 
 In Spain, for example, unemployment in November hit 19.4 percent, the second-worst figure in Europe behind tiny Latvia, at 22.3 percent. In Spain, unemployment among people under 25 years old has now touched a shocking 43.8 percent.
 Andrew Watt, a senior researcher at the European Trade Union Institute for Research in Brussels, said labor market flexibility would be less of a factor in defining near-term changes in unemployment in European and America than whether factories and other producers could reach sustained growth of output that goes beyond simply restocking depleted inventories. 
 ''Flexibility is a long-term issue,'' he said. ''The level of growth is what will drive the unemployment data.''

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate in Euro Zone Is in Double Digits

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in the euro zone hit double digits in November for the first time in more than a decade, tempering hopes for a rapid recovery in the job market. 
 Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, said on Friday that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the 16 countries that use the euro rose to 10 percent in November, from 9.9 percent in October and 8 percent in November 2008. 
 For the euro area, the rate was the highest rate since 1998, a year before the euro was introduced.
 The number of unemployed in November rose by 102,000, still a significant pace of increase although down from the monthly peak of 475,000 seen at the start of last year. 
 The unemployment rate for the broader 27-member European Union was 9.5 percent in November, from 9.4 percent in October and 7.5 percent in November 2008. 
 In France, the rate stood at 10 percent, up from 9.9 percent in October. In Germany, it was 7.6 percent, unchanged from October. For Italy, the rate was 8.3 percent, up from 8.2 percent. 
 The highest rates in the month were recorded in Latvia, at 22.3 percent, and Spain, with 19.4 percent. Unemployment among workers under 25 in Spain has touched 43.8 percent.
 The lowest rates were in the Netherlands, at 3.9 percent, and Austria, at 5.5 percent.
 While there have been signs of accelerating economic activity in Europe -- France and Germany officially emerged from recession during the third quarter and Britain is expected to have done the same in the fourth quarter -- economists say that the unemployment rate could well keep rising through this year, as employment does not tend to pick up until later in the cycle.
 ''We think that the labor market correction has a long way to go,'' said Nick Kounis, chief European economist at Fortis Bank in Amsterdam. ''Employment has still not fully adjusted to the fall in output during the recession, reflecting institutional rigidities in the euro-zone labor market.''
 During past recoveries, labor markets in the euro area have taken longer to improve than that of the United States, he said.
 Data on the United States labor market for December, released Friday, showed that the country lost 85,000 jobs while the unemployment rate held steady at 10 percent.
 Eurostat also confirmed Friday that the euro-zone economy grew by 0.4 percent in the third quarter from the previous period, driven by a strong performance in Germany. Growth in the wider European Union picked up by 0.3 percent.
 Economists say that the rate of unemployment would be even higher in Europe if governments like France and Germany had not backed programs that offer support to companies that keep workers but put them on shorter hours. 
 Separately, the Swiss federal department of economic affairs said Friday that unemployment there climbed to 4.4 percent in December, the highest level since 1997. It was 4.2 percent in November.

HEADLINE: A Newly Frugal Generation Revives Discount Dining in Florida

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH 

 BODY:
 -- The early bird special at Cafe Prima Pasta began last year after the restaurant's owner, Gerardo Cea, lost all his savings in real estate and began seeing his regular customers at the supermarket. 
 ''They weren't coming anymore,'' Mr. Cea said. ''They couldn't afford it.'' 
 He expected his offer of a 50 percent discount before 6 p.m. to attract the usual crowd of frugal retirees. But word kept spreading, and on most nights now, at least half the tables are filled with young families, singles or hip couples -- women in short skirts and men who prefer ''dude'' to ''sir.'' 
 Across Florida in fact, the early-bird special is experiencing a revival. With that label and some newer versions, several restaurants have introduced early dining discounts since the recession started, and younger people are arriving in larger numbers at classic establishments that have been serving up free dessert for decades. 
 Part of it is purely business -- promotions work when people have less money to spend -- but restaurant owners, researchers and patrons say it also reflects a changing mood. It is a sign, they say, of shifting priorities, as Americans respond to tighter budgets with a demand for value and a willingness to alter their habits to enjoy a little fun. 
 Many restaurant owners, on Florida's east and west coasts, now report seeing behavioral changes that remind them of the generation that survived the Depression. In addition to coming in early for specials, they said, more customers have been using coupons, sitting down only after studying the menu and wasting less food. 
 ''The value of money has changed in America,'' said James Accursio, whose family has owned the Capri, an Italian restaurant in Florida City, since it opened in 1958. ''We're not high rollers anymore.'' 
 His restaurant is one of many experiencing a moment reminiscent of the movie ''Cocoon.'' As Mr. Accursio scanned his main dining room on a recent Saturday just before the early bird expired at 6:30, he saw more young faces where only old ones used to be. To his left sat the Dawkins family, ages 47, 33, 23, 8 and 3; by the door, a man with a full head of dark hair checked his iPhone across from his date; and near the back were the Slaters, a family of 11 that crossed demographic lines. 
 Their ages ranged from 80 -- for Marty Slater, the matriarch, who said she had been coming to the Capri since she moved to Florida in the '50s -- down to 19. Economically, it was a middle-class group. On one side of the table sat an architect, a social worker and a manager in manufacturing. And nearly all said they had been hurt by the recession.
 As a result, they said, old-fashioned restaurants like the Capri -- think iceberg lettuce, not arugula -- had become especially appealing because they offered consistent value, and it was not just the early bird's filet mignon for $12.95. It was also the respectful treatment -- the waiters in ties, the greetings of ''Mr.'' and ''Mrs.,'' the effort to remember the orders of regulars, and letting everyone stay as long as they wanted. 
 ''When you go out now, you have to have a plan,'' said Gary Green, 34, who married into the family after leaving Jamaica. At the Capri, he said, ''there's less risk.'' 
 Katherine Slater, the restaurant's only diner with a nose stud and dyed red hair, said she had only recently begun to understand what her elders saw in such places. ''When I was young, 18, I was like, why would I want to go out to dinner there with my parents and my grandparents?'' she said. ''Now I'm 21. I appreciate it.''
 Nearly everyone in the state feels a little poorer these days -- with unemployment at its highest rate since 1975 and real estate values continuing to drop. That insecurity has reshaped the local mindset, say many Floridians under 55, and taken the shame out of scrimping. 
 For instance, Cassandra Eriser, 35, an aesthetician with cover girl looks who works giving facials at a South Beach spa, is not what most people imagine when they think early bird. But there she was at Cafe Prima Pasta on a recent Sunday at 5:30 p.m., finishing up a meal of tilapia with her boyfriend, a musician with a shaved head. 
 With wine and tip, the couple spent less than $25 each. 
 ''It's a great way to try a new restaurant without forking over a lot of money,'' Ms. Eriser said.
 A few nights later at Cafe Prima Pasta, the urge to splurge brought out a party of 13. Mostly employees of a nonprofit in their 20s and 30s, they laughed as they explained that they were eating early for a simple reason: ''Because we're broke.'' 
 At the early bird for Tropical Acres Steakhouse in Fort Lauderdale, which opened in 1949, Edward and Denisa Wainwright said they were celebrating their anniversary there because it was affordable and still felt fancy. 
 ''This reminds us of the New England style,'' said Mr. Wainwright, 55. Even before the dessert cart arrived, he said he was full. A Harvard graduate, he said he taught at Kaplan Test Prep, making half what he used to make at a database company. 
 ''We've had to get used to it,'' Mrs. Wainwright, 52, said. ''We don't go out as much because of the money.''
 In some circles, of course, the early bird still carries a whiff of mothballs, thus the rebranding. When Benihana tried it last summer in South Florida, they called it ''twilight dining.'' At Cafe Baci in Sarasota, which has also seen more young people lately, they use ''early dining.'' 
 Hudson Riehle, a senior vice president for research at the National Restaurant Association, said other restaurants around the country had tried ''afternoon dining'' or just ditched the label entirely, using ''prix fixe'' instead.
 ''The term 'early bird' may be a little dated from a lexicon standpoint, like 'doggy bag,' '' Mr. Riehle said. ''But the concept has been and will continue to be an extremely effective marketing tool for certain restaurants in certain markets.'' 
 At Cafe Prima Pasta, at least, the early bird has already become an institution, and almost too much of a success. Mr. Cea, 43, an immigrant from Argentina who learned the restaurant business in New York, said he recently realized that there were too many people arriving early with a taste for high-end meat and fish, like imported branzino. It was his turn to tighten the belt; a few weeks ago, he introduced a more limited menu. 
 ''It's beautiful, the American dream, it's great,'' Mr. Cea said. ''But if you don't put your feet on the ground, what it's given you will be taken away.''

HEADLINE: By Landing Fleet, Small Port Sets Off a Storm of Envy

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: NEWPORT, Ore. 

 BODY:
Fishing and timber are not what they once were, and the recession has slowed the rush for second homes. So it seemed the fate of this small port was clear: more struggle.
 Then Newport, with fewer than 10,000 people, pulled off a stunning economic upset. Last summer, it outbid and outmaneuvered three ports in Washington to become the home, beginning in 2011, of the Pacific Fleet of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
 As many as 175 well-paying federal jobs are on the way. Huge research vessels will dock across from rusty old salmon boats beneath the New Deal-era bridge that spans Yaquina Bay. 
 ''We're going to be the Woods Hole of the West,'' said Michael Wilkinson, who runs a bed and breakfast on a floating riverboat in the bay, referring to the oceanographic institution on Cape Cod.
 Yet while Newport celebrates, Washington, where the oceanic administration has maintained its Pacific Fleet on Lake Union in Seattle for nearly half a century, is not happy. 
 The state's Congressional delegation has fired off letters raising questions about the move. Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, has threatened to hold hearings and asked about things like the stormy weather off the Oregon coast and how the agency will function in Newport while other branches remain in Seattle.
 And Bellingham, Wash., which was also competing for the contract, has claimed that the move violates government construction policies by requiring building in a floodplain. Last month, the Government Accountability Office, the auditing arm of Congress, agreed; the oceanic administration has not said how it will address that finding, even as the government has signed a 20-year lease in Newport and preliminary work is under way.
 Here in Newport, officials cast the flooding issue as a technicality, and suggest a little gleefully that people in Washington may have taken them too lightly.
 ''They probably thought, 'Newport's so small, they'll never even get the paperwork together,' '' said Terry Thompson, a Lincoln County commissioner. ''They didn't realize they were running into a buzz saw.''
 Yet among those immersed in the regional rivalry between Oregon and Washington, the events have prompted conspiracy theories involving prominent political players: Could the move to Newport be connected to the fact that the new administrator of the oceanic agency is Dr. Jane Lubchenco, a former professor at Oregon State University, which has a major marine research center in Newport? 
 Surely not, others insist, noting that the oceanic administration is under the Commerce Department, whose secretary, Gary Locke, is a former governor of Washington. 
 Another theory is that the move to Newport is a consolation prize to Oregon for an Obama administration proposal to protect endangered salmon on the Columbia River, which runs, in part, between Washington and Oregon. Washington has been more supportive of the plan than Oregon. But Justin Kenney, the oceanic administration spokesman, said the Newport decision was made in the Bush administration, and without participation by Dr. Lubchenco, Mr. Locke or elected officials.
 ''It is important to note that the request for proposal and criteria were developed during the previous administration,'' Mr. Kenney said in an e-mail message.
 Three Washington ports were final candidates for the administration's fleet, but Newport was the only Oregon port in the running at the end. That made it easier for the state's political leaders, including Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski, a Democrat, to get involved. 
 Oregon eventually agreed to spend $19.5 million to help Newport build the $38 million facility, a move that meant Newport could promise the agency a substantially lower lease than Washington was offering. 
 ''The State of Washington didn't provide any subsidy to any applicants,'' said Rob Fix, the chief financial officer for the Port of Bellingham. ''No one expected the State of Oregon to do that. The money came out of the sky.''
 Also working in its favor, Newport already has a small NOAA office as well as the Hatfield Marine Science Center of Oregon State University. Its port is deep and just minutes from the ocean, while ships docked in Puget Sound in Washington State take several hours to reach the sea.
 Then again, Washington bidders have noted that Newport does not have a major shipyard for repairs, and they have questioned whether Newport can build the necessary piers and other structures for the agency by 2011.
 Don Mann, the general manager of the Port of Newport, said the port had heard nothing to suggest that the move was at risk. This month workers are to begin removing old structures and leveling ground for the new facility.
 ''As far as we're concerned,'' Mr. Mann said, ''it's a done deal unless the sky falls. We don't anticipate that it will.''
 Mr. Wilkinson, of the Newport Belle Bed and Breakfast, which is docked about 1,200 feet from where the oceanic administration will be stationed, said he was pleased to be getting a new neighbor and not worried about the flooding issues in the Government Accountability Office report.
 ''A rising tide,'' he said, ''lifts all boats.''

HEADLINE: Invitation To Disaster

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
We didn't pay attention to the housing bubble. We closed our eyes to warnings that the levees in New Orleans were inadequate. We gave short shrift to reports that bin Laden was determined to attack the U.S. And now we're all but ignoring the fiscal train wreck that is coming from states with budget crises big enough to boggle the mind.
 The states are in the worst fiscal shape since the Depression. The Great Recession has caused state tax revenues to fall off a cliff. Some states -- New York and California come quickly to mind -- are facing prolonged budget nightmares. Across the country, critical state services are being chopped like firewood. More cuts are coming. Taxes and fees are being raised. Yet the budgets in dozens and dozens of states remain drastically out of balance. 
 This is an arrow aimed straight at the heart of a robust national recovery. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has pointed out that if you add up the state budget gaps that have recently been plugged (in most cases, temporarily and haphazardly) and those that remain to be dealt with, you'll likely reach a staggering $350 billion for the 2010 and 2011 fiscal years.
 This is not a disaster waiting to happen. It's under way.
 Without substantial new federal help, state cuts that are now merely drastic will become draconian, and hundreds of thousands of additional jobs will be lost. The suffering is already widespread. Some states have laid off or furloughed employees. Tens of thousands of teachers have been let go as cuts have been made to public schools and critically important preschool programs. California has bludgeoned its public higher education system, one of the finest in the world.
 Michigan has cut some of the benefits it provided to middle-class families struggling with the costs of health care for severely disabled children -- benefits that helped pay for such things as incontinence supplies and transportation to special care centers. The Grand Rapids Press quoted a state official who acknowledged that the cuts were ''tough'' and were hurting families. But he added, ''The state simply doesn't have the money.''
 The collapse of state tax revenues caused by the recession is the sharpest on record. Steep budget cuts have not been enough to offset the unprecedented plunge in tax collections that resulted from unemployment and other aspects of the downturn. The shortfalls swept the nation. As the Rockefeller Institute of Government reported, ''Total tax revenue declined in all 44 states for which comparable early data are available.''
 State governments are not without fault. Very few have been paragons of fiscal responsibility over the years. California is a well-known basket case. New York has a Legislature that is a laughingstock. But for the federal government to resist offering substantial additional help in the face of this growing crisis would be foolhardy. You can't have a healthy national economy while dozens of states are hooked up to life support.
 The Center on Budget offered some insight into how the trouble in the states adds up to trouble for us all:
 ''Expenditure cuts are problematic policies during an economic downturn because they reduce overall demand and can make the downturn deeper. When states cut spending, they lay off employees, cancel contracts with vendors, eliminate or lower payments to businesses and nonprofit organizations that provide direct services, and cut benefit payments to individuals.
 ''In all of these circumstances, the companies and organizations that would have received government payments have less money to spend on salaries and supplies, and individuals who would have received salaries or benefits have less money for consumption. This directly removes demand from the economy.''
 The Obama administration has provided significant help to states through its stimulus program, and it has made a difference. It prevented the crisis from being much worse. But much of that assistance will run out by the end of the year and states are fashioning budgets right now that will absolutely hammer the quality of life for some of their most vulnerable residents.
 New York's lieutenant governor, Richard Ravitch, has been trying to bring a measure of sanity to the state's budget process. But as he told me this week, without additional federal help, many states will have no choice but to impose extreme budget cuts, or raise taxes, or -- most likely -- do both.
 We need more responsible and less wasteful fiscal behavior from all levels of government. But the country is still faced with a national economic emergency, with tens of millions out of work or underemployed. We can hardly afford any additional economic shocks. Turning our backs on the desperate trouble the states are in right now is nothing less than an utterly willful invitation to disaster.

HEADLINE: 3 Weeks Old, Winter Breaks Budgets and Rules the Road

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY; Reporting was contributed by Robbie Brown from Atlanta, Christina Capecchi from Minneapolis and Emma Graves Fitzsimmons from Chicago.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
There's the gold standard of snow and ice removal on major roads in the Midwest -- asphalt, plowed smooth and salted for easy driving. 
 And then there's the reality this year across the region, and in the Northeast, too, where drivers might be lucky to see bare pavement, and some roads are considered good enough if they have a single defined rut for the tires on one side of a vehicle. A ''one-wheel path,'' in industry parlance.
 With states and localities facing budget cuts in a time of economic crisis, the early onset of severe storms bringing heavy, wet snow is wreaking havoc on already strained resources and raising concerns about public safety. 
 ''Each snowflake looks like a dollar sign floating down,'' said Barbara Whitmore, the town clerk in Genesee, Wis., 30 miles west of Milwaukee. ''We are basically now trying to just do hills, curves and intersections rather than entire roads for salting. Everything is plowed but might not get down to bare concrete. People like to see the salt so it gets down to bare concrete, but the cost is too high.''
 Many other counties, cities and states across the regions are also feeling the pinch of expensive storm cleanup -- rationing of salt, not plowing side roads, canceling public works projects for fear of running out of money to clear the roads. 
 In Kansas, state workers are no longer plowing for a perfectly clear path on weekends or after business hours, except on Interstate highways. ''Our budgets have been cut, and people will notice it on the highways this year,'' said Steve Swartz, a spokesman for the state's Transportation Department. ''In years past, we'd continue to pay our operators until we got down to bare pavement everywhere, at all times.''
 Minneapolis cut more than $1 million from its $8.4 million snow removal budget by eliminating 54 full-time positions. (Those employees are still on reserve and receiving benefits, and, as such, are required to help clear snow when needed.)
 In Iowa, Des Moines's $3 million snow removal budget is supposed to last the winter, but with the snowstorm that hit Thursday, the city has already used the entire budget. ''We will have exhausted it by the end of this event,'' Bill Stowe, the director of public works, said Friday. ''Yesterday, we had six additional inches and 30-mile-per-hour winds. We're done.'' 
 In Waltham, Mass., a suburb of Boston, Mayor Jeannette A. McCarthy said the town had nearly depleted its $400,000 snow removal budget after a storm last weekend. It will now have to ask the City Council for more money, she said. 
 In Kansas City, Mo., the $2.5 million allocated for the entire winter's snow removal budget, including overtime pay for workers and the chemicals used to combat the snow, has been spent.
 ''Our snow budget is gone,'' said Dennis Gagnon, a spokesman for the city's Public Works Department. ''We've used as much in the last three weeks that we expect to use in a full year. It has been a struggle.''
 The department will have to dip into a contingency fund, which is smaller than usual because of the recession. ''Times were already tight,'' Mr. Gagnon said. ''Finding this money under the mattress is not going to be easy.''
 Beyond transportation departments, the ranks of first responders had already been reduced in some areas because of budget cuts and mandatory leave. In some states, troopers and highway patrol officers are having a hard time keeping up with accidents on unusually slick roads.
 The number of Iowa troopers is down to 379 this year from 455 about 10 years ago, said Courtney Greene, chief of the Iowa Public Safety Department's public information bureau.
 ''We don't have enough officers to handle all the accidents,'' said Doug Cutts, a trooper with the Iowa State Patrol. ''We had multicar pileups, up to 10 vehicles involved in crashes. We just went from one crash to the next crash to the next crash.'' 
 At least 13 weather-related deaths were reported this week by local authorities nationwide, with some clustered in the Southeast, where snowfall was unexpectedly heavy on Thursday. Deaths were reported in Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee and Ohio. Several of them were the result of accidents on the roads. 
 ''It's very difficult driving,'' said Mayor R. T. Rybak of Minneapolis. ''We are hoping for a melt, or least a little bit of a break in this incredibly harsh weather.''
 Despite budget constraints, many communities have not changed their immediate routines. But they are bracing for consequences later in the year.
 In some places, that could mean fewer road maintenance projects and repairs or less painting and mowing maintenance. 
 ''We will move money to respond because we view this as an emergency response,'' said Mr. Stowe, in Des Moines. ''We wouldn't ask firefighters to use less water or police officers to use less ammunition in response to an emergency.''
 In Kansas, Mr. Swartz said: ''We recognize that snow and ice removal is a top priority for safety, and to keep people and goods moving. We tried to make cuts that protect those functions. It will mean that that we probably can't do other things not snow-related. It will be absorbed in our operations budget some other way.''
 In the meantime, people are slogging through.
 Marveleen Peterson, 80, a retired nurse, says she is reluctant take her Cadillac on the roads in Minneapolis, but she still has to buy groceries and run errands.
 ''I have not driven very far since Christmas,'' Ms. Peterson said. ''I am trying to be independent, and so far I've done fairly well in trying to take care of my errands. But if this continues like this all winter, then I may feel a little sorry for myself.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the effects of early winter storms on already strained state and local budgets misstated, in some copies, the current number of state troopers in Iowa, where officials say they do not have enough patrol officers to handle all accidents. It is 379, not 37 (down from 455 about 10 years ago).

HEADLINE: Jobs and Politics

 BODY:
If there's a silver lining in the December jobs report, it is this: Nothing concentrates the minds of politicians like rising unemployment in an election year. Unless Congress and the White House push a robust job-creation agenda -- starting now -- worsening joblessness is a distinct possibility, even if the economy in general recovers in the coming months. That means the unemployment rate could still be high or even climbing when the midterm elections near. That may be the best hope for concerted federal action to put Americans back to work. 
 At 10 percent, the unemployment rate was unchanged from November to December. But the only reason it held steady is that 661,000 jobless Americans were not counted as unemployed last month because they had not looked for a job in the four weeks preceding the December survey. If they had been included, the jobless rate would have been closer to 10.4 percent. Over all, an estimated 3.6 million out-of-work people have been uncounted since the recession began in December 2007. They include people who had not recently looked for work and those who would have entered the work force in normal times, like recent high school and college graduates, but remained on the sidelines as jobs disappeared. 
 Here's the rub: As soon as the economy shows more signs of life, those missing workers are likely to start looking for work. That would add to the ranks of the officially unemployed, causing the jobless rate to rise, perhaps dramatically -- unless jobs are being created to absorb the labor glut. 
 The private sector alone is unlikely to create enough new jobs, even as the economy recovers. Employers are more likely to add hours to the truncated workweeks of existing employees than to hire new workers. They may also prefer to make temporary workers permanent rather than add new staff. 
 And even if hiring were unexpectedly strong, it could not repair the severely damaged job market anytime soon. The economy lost another 85,000 jobs in December, bringing the official total job loss over the past two years to 7.2 million jobs. But with the population growing -- and with revisions to earlier data expected to show larger losses than previously reported -- the economy is probably coming up short by 10 million to 11 million jobs. The job growth that would be needed to recoup losses of that magnitude in the next three years -- some 400,000 jobs a month -- is simply not in the cards.
 Responding to the jobs report on Friday, Mr. Obama reminded Americans that $2.3 billion in tax credits -- passed by Congress last year as part of the fiscal stimulus -- would soon begin to spur the creation of some 17,000 green technology jobs. He also called on Congress to approve another $5 billion in spending for more clean energy manufacturing. And he urged lawmakers to move on legislation for several job ideas he put forth last month, including a plan for public-works employment and bolstered small business lending. That's a start, but now he has to get Congress to act. 
 The jobs he saves may be those of members of Congress from his own party.

HEADLINE: New Rules Allow Anyone to Convert to a Roth I.R.A., but Should You?

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
Don't be surprised if your broker calls in the next few months and asks if you have thought about converting your traditional individual retirement account to a Roth I.R.A.
 That's because as of Jan. 1, anyone can convert their regular I.R.A. into a Roth regardless of income. Before the rules changed, only people with modified adjusted gross incomes of $100,000 or less could convert their accounts.
 So should you consider it? 
 Anyone who expects to land in a higher tax bracket in retirement should think about converting. With a Roth I.R.A., you pay taxes on your contributions now so you can withdraw money tax-free later. Regular I.R.A.'s, on the other hand, allow you to take a tax deduction on eligible contributions, but you pay taxes when you take out the money. 
 But the Roth's benefits extend beyond its possible tax advantages. Unlike traditional I.R.A.'s, you are not required to take required minimum distributions once you turn 70 1/2, which makes the Roth an effective way to leave money to heirs -- or to save for emergency expenses later in life. And because withdrawals are not counted as income, what you take out won't affect whether your Social Security benefits are taxed. (Some people with high retirement income must pay taxes on a percentage of their benefits.) So some longtime teachers and doctors with substantial pensions may benefit from converting even a portion of their I.R.A.'s. 
 There is one exception. If you live in Wisconsin, you will face stiff penalties if you convert your I.R.A.'s. More on that later.
 But as with most money-related matters, deciding to convert is not simple. It requires a fair bit of guesswork, namely, trying to foretell your tax bracket in retirement. Many retirees expect to pay less. But with soaring federal deficits and the rising costs of programs like Social Security and Medicare, most everyone agrees that taxes will increase -- though by how much and for how long is anyone's guess. 
 ''It's not just a function of your own income expectations, it's also a function of government policy,'' said Rande Spiegelman, vice president of financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. ''There are a lot of intricacies and nuances not only with the tax law itself, but with your unique situation.''
 And that's why many financial planners recommend hedging your bets or keeping your retirement money in accounts that are taxed in different ways -- much as you diversify your investments. That way, if the government changes the rules of the Roth itself (or changes the tax code in any number of ways), at least you have your bases covered. ''The more uncertainty I may feel about the future, the more likely I might be to go halfway with a strategy and not jump in with both feet,'' said Christine Fahlund, senior financial planner for T. Rowe Price.
 There are a few caveats. Experts generally do not recommend acting unless you have the money to pay the tax bill for the conversion without dipping into your I.R.A. (If you're under 59 1/2, you'll also face a 10 percent penalty for tapping your I.R.A.)
 You may also be wondering if this is yet another ploy by the investment industry to make more money. The Roth I.R.A.'s do, after all, present an opportunity for the industry to collect and manage more of your assets and charge commissions if you are moving from one investment company to another. But if your I.R.A. is already at a company, like, say, Fidelity or Vanguard and you keep it there, the conversion should not cost you anything. 
 Though your decision to convert should be based on your circumstances, there are a number of factors that can influence your decision, including these:
 Consider If ...
 YOU MAY NOT NEED THE MONEY For people who are unsure whether they will need all of their retirement money, it could pay to convert a portion of their I.R.A. for large or unanticipated expenses later in life. After all, Roths do not require account owners to withdraw any money, ever. ''Leaving the Roth I.R.A. untapped for as long as possible -- as a hedge against longevity or to cover medical or long-term care expenses -- can be an appealing strategy for investors, including the huge middle class,'' Ms. Fahlund said. ''If they never have to tap into the Roth I.R.A., it becomes an attractive legacy.''
 YOU HAVE A TAXABLE ESTATE ...Roths are useful tools for people with taxable estates. By paying the tax on the conversion, you are also effectively reducing the amount of taxes you will owe on your estate. Financial planners also recommend that people in the top tax brackets choose to pay the taxes in 2010 to avoid the higher income tax rates scheduled for 2011. Otherwise, the Internal Revenue Service will automatically charge you half the tax in 2011 and half in 2012, when rates are higher.
 ... OR NONDEDUCTIBLE I.R.A.'S If you earned too much money to contribute to a traditional I.R.A., you may have made contributions with after-tax money. In that situation, the contributions can eventually be withdrawn tax-free and only investment earnings are taxed. Likewise, you would be taxed only on those earnings in a conversion. ''It's a slam-dunk if your I.R.A.'s contain nothing but nondeductible contributions with minimal investment earnings,'' said Helen Huntley, a financial adviser in St. Petersburg, Fla.
 Nondeductible I.R.A.'s also provide a backdoor entry into the Roth I.R.A. for people who make too much money to contribute directly. Higher earners can make nondeductible contributions to traditional I.R.A.'s and convert them to a Roth I.R.A. each year -- and pay little or nothing in taxes because the tax is only on earnings. (In 2010, married taxpayers who earn up to $167,000 can each make the full $5,000 contribution to a Roth, or $6,000 for people over the age of 50. Couples who earn up to $177,000 can make partial contributions. Single taxpayers who earn less than $105,000 can make a full contribution, though it phases out above $120,000.)
 YOU ARE YOUNG OR ENGAGED Younger people have an advantage because they have more time for tax-free growth -- and to earn back the taxes paid upfront. Another strong candidate for conversion is someone engaged or soon to be engaged whose tax bracket is lower than the combined household's bracket will be, said Jennifer Lazarus, a financial planner in Durham, N.C. ''This person will benefit from locking in lower tax rates, and the converted balance will grow tax-free over the course of their marriage,'' she said. ''The younger the couple, the greater the tax-free benefit.''
 That does not mean that older people should rule out converting. If, for instance, you are required to take sizable minimum distributions from your regular I.R.A., which then push you into a higher tax bracket, it may pay to convert part of your I.R.A., even over a series of years, said Mr. Spiegelman of Schwab. This is especially useful for anyone with sizable pensions.
 Think Twice If ...
 There are several specific situations where you should not convert. If you expect you will need every penny of your retirement money and you think you will land in a much lower tax bracket than you are in now, it does not pay.
 That is also true if you plan to leave your I.R.A. to charity. It will inherit the account and its contents free of tax, said Therese Govern, an accountant and financial planner in Seattle.
 Wisconsin residents, meanwhile, should not convert -- or at least not yet. The state has not yet adopted the federal tax rules, which means that people with taxable income over $100,000 who convert face stiff penalties. The State Legislature is expected to act by April to eliminate the penalties. 
 Also keep in mind that if you are under 59 1/2, converted Roths must be open at least five years before you can make penalty-free withdrawals. So if you need the money before then and still want to convert, keep enough in your traditional I.R.A. to tide you over. Once you are over 59 1/2, there are no withdrawal penalties.
 Given the complexity of the tax code, you should work with a tax adviser. 
 Of course, you should also feel comfortable with your decision. ''The process of determining whether or not to convert is not just about economics,'' said Terry Donahe, a financial planner in Lake Oswego, Ore. ''How does the individual feel about paying taxes now? Given the fragile state of our economy in general and the financial markets in particular, many individuals are reluctant to part with cash.''

GRAPHIC: CHART: Benefits of Converting to a Roth: A new law beginning this year will allow investors to convert money held in a traditional I.R.A. into a Roth I.R.A., regardless of how much they earn. A conversion may be a good idea for some investors because withdrawals from a Roth I.R.A. are not taxed, and no minimum distributions are required. ASSUMPTIONS: A 45-year-old converts a $25,000 traditional I.R.A. to a Roth and pays the required taxes ($7,188) from a taxable side account. The I.R.A. earns 8% annually before age 65 and 6% thereafter. The federal tax rate is 25% and state tax is 5%. For gains in the side account, the federal tax rate is 15% and state 5%. (Source: T.

HEADLINE: Heavy Rains End Drought For Texas

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.; Rachel Marcus contributed reporting.

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
The worst drought to strike Texas in the last 50 years has broken, ending a year-and-a-half dry spell in which farmers and ranchers suffered devastating losses, climatologists and agronomists said this week.
 Heavy rains since September have replenished reservoirs, filled stock tanks and quenched huge expanses of parched earth across Central and South Texas, where state officials estimate that farmers and ranchers suffered losses of around $4 billion. 
 John Nielsen-Gammon, the state climatologist, said that while some pockets along the Gulf Coast and in the Panhandle remained drier than usual, most of the state had recovered. 
 ''The back of the drought is broken,'' Mr. Nielsen-Gammon said. ''It's still lingering in a few areas, but there aren't any places right now feeling acute drought.''
 The rains came too late for many ranchers in South Texas, who were forced to send to market most of their cattle, including breeding stock. Cotton farmers suffered, too. In Kleberg County, the entire cotton crop failed for the first time since 1904. The yields in two other nearby counties were barely 5 percent of normal.
 ''Nothing grew, zero,'' said Jon Whatley, who grows cotton and sorghum in Odem. Mr. Whatley said the drought seemed worse than an infamous dry spell in the 1950s that his father had lived through. 
 ''In the 1950s, they were always able to get the crop up and growing -- the yields weren't good -- whereas in '09, we couldn't get it growing at all,'' he said.
 State officials say the period from September 2008 to September 2009 was the driest on record in the state.
 Mr. Nielson-Gammon said the drought owed much to the two winters in which surface water temperatures along the equator in the Pacific Ocean were above normal, a phenomenon known as El Nino. In addition, the tropical storms that raked the Texas coast in 2008 dropped almost no rain inland.
 But this winter the Pacific cooled off, producing the pattern known as La Nina, which generally brings wet weather to Texas, he said. The central region around Austin and San Antonio received 8 to 12 inches more rain than normal from August to October. Farther south, around Corpus Christi, a wave of storms in November and December dropped up to 10 inches more rain than usual, he said.
 Austin Brown II, a third-generation rancher in Beeville, said he was so elated to see the rainfall this autumn that he sent out a Christmas card with a picture of his family standing in front of a full farm pond that had been desiccated the summer before.
 But Mr. Brown said he and other ranchers were still in dire straits. He was forced to cull 75 percent of his cattle and, with beef prices remaining low because of the national recession, he was unsure when or if he would be able to rebuild. 
 ''It was very devastating, and one that we may not ever get over because beef prices are terribly low right now,'' he said. ''I'm not anxious to rebuild. By the summer we should know if we are really out of the drought.''
 Matt Huie, another Beeville farmer and rancher, planted 1,000 acres of cotton last spring, but the seeds failed to sprout. Now, Mr. Huie said, the ground is moist enough to engender hope of a good crop this year. 
 ''It's rained more in the last 90 days than it did in all of 2008 combined,'' he said. ''After two lousy years in a row -- one really, really bad -- this year had better be a home run, or there are going to be a lot of people out of business here in the ag industry.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the end of the worst drought in Texas in 50 years reversed the descriptions of La Nina and El Nino as well as their effect on the drought there. La Nina is the phenomenon that occurs when surface water temperatures along the equator in the Pacific Ocean are below normal, and it was what helped create the drought the past two winters. El Nino is a weather pattern that occurs because of the warming of the Pacific waters, and it was responsible for bringing rain to Texas this winter.

HEADLINE: U.S. Has Limited Resources to Face Threats in Yemen

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As the Obama administration confronts the latest terrorism threat in Yemen, its diplomatic and development efforts are being constrained by a shortage of resources, a lack of in-house expertise and a fraught history with a Yemeni leader deeply ambivalent about American help.
 Administration officials said they focused on Yemen as a hothouse for Islamic terrorism from the day President Obama took office. The United States has tripled its foreign assistance to the country from 2008 levels and plans to spend up to $63 million on Yemen this year.
 But by all accounts, that is a modest amount for a country that is suddenly a central threat on the foreign policy landscape; it is roughly the same amount the United States sends to Serbia. It illustrates how much the United States is stretched on the foreign policy front, and how hard it is to extend its resources beyond the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 Beyond providing military and intelligence help -- showcased in recent airstrikes on training sites for Al Qaeda -- the administration has yet to develop a coherent plan for dealing with Yemen's pervasive poverty and corruption, according to former diplomats and outside experts. Those ills, they say, are at the root of Yemen's lure for terrorists. 
 ''I don't think we have a strategy for Yemen; I think we have some responses,'' said Edmund J. Hull, the American ambassador there from 2001 to 2004. ''It's difficult to do because the problems in Yemen are so huge that you almost get stopped before you start.''
 In an overburdened State Department, there are only a handful of Yemen experts, compared with 30 people from nine government agencies who are assigned just to the administration's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard C. Holbrooke.
 Washington's limited insight into Yemen was on display Thursday, when the White House's chief counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, expressed surprise that Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was sophisticated enough to carry out a plot against an American jetliner. In fact, Mr. Brennan, a onetime C.I.A. station chief in neighboring Saudi Arabia, is widely regarded as one of the administration's most knowledgeable officials about the country.
 ''It's not that Yemen is the most mysterious and unknowable country in the world,'' said Micah Zenko, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''One needs to ask why more wasn't done sooner.''
 The State Department said it had decided to step up its engagement with Yemen even before the botched Dec. 25 attack on the jetliner. In September, the United States signed an agreement with the Yemeni government for a three-year $120 million ''stabilization program,'' devised to create jobs and improve health and other public services on an accelerated timetable.
 ''We wanted to put together a package of quick-impact projects that would give people a sense that their lives are improving,'' said Janet A. Sanderson, a deputy assistant secretary of state who oversees Yemen.
 After the Navy destroyer Cole was bombed in Yemen in 2000, the United States embarked on a similar effort. In addition to focusing on counterterrorism operations, the State Department helped finance projects like a health clinic on the rugged highway between the capital, Sana, and Marib, a town in a remote region where Qaeda forces are known to cluster.
 Improving health care is one way to make Yemenis less receptive to Al Qaeda and other extremists, Mr. Hull said. The United States had previously tended to focus its economic aid on politically influential places like Sana and Aden, the port city where the Cole was attacked. From 2002 to 2004, officials said, Qaeda elements in Yemen were on the defensive.
 But Washington's relations with Yemen soured after several Qaeda suspects escaped from a prison in Sana in 2006. After the release of a high-profile Qaeda operative in 2007, the United States suspended aid that Yemen was supposed to get through the Millennium Challenge program.
 ''You had this reversal and downward trend in relations,'' Mr. Hull said. ''Both we and they took our eyes off the ball.''
 By 2008, nonmilitary aid to Yemen had dwindled to less than $20 million. Afghanistan is expected to receive $2.7 billion a year in nonmilitary aid, Pakistan $1.5 billion and Iraq $500 million.
 The administration doubled Yemen's economic aid last year, but as Barbara K. Bodine, another former ambassador, pointed out, the amount ''works out to $1.60 per Yemeni.''
 ''That won't even buy you a cup of coffee in Yemen,'' she added, ''and they invented coffee.''
 Ms. Bodine, who was posted to Yemen at the time of the Cole bombing, said that even with the increased commitment, American aid was still overly skewed toward military support, much of it covert. Over time, she said, that could undermine Yemen's struggling democracy.
 ''If they see David Petraeus more than Kathleen Sebelius, then we have a problem,'' Ms. Bodine said, referring to the military commander and the secretary of health and human services, respectively.
 State Department officials acknowledge that the United States has limited resources for Yemen, though given the intense scrutiny focused on the country, those numbers could rise. But they question whether more aid money would be used effectively, given the pervasive corruption there. As it is, the United States steers most of its dollars through outside organizations like CARE.
 Officials also say the United States has to be realistic about what can be done in Yemen, given a long list of problems, including a water shortage, dwindling oil reserves and secessionist movements in the south, a major insurgency in the north and a growing young population with no jobs.
 In a speech this week on development strategy, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton came close to labeling Yemen a lost cause. ''In countries that are incubators of extremism, like Yemen,'' she said, ''the odds are long. But the cost of doing nothing is potentially far greater.''
 The biggest hurdle to aid may be Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. While American officials said he appeared determined to root out Qaeda elements, his resolve has wavered over time, depending on his calculation of whether radical Islamists are a threat or benefit to him. Mr. Saleh is also worried about being too closely identified with the United States.
 Saudi Arabia already pours an estimated $1 billion a year into Yemen, and the United Arab Emirates, Britain and Germany have longstanding ties.
 ''He hasn't always been eager for American support,'' a senior administration official said of Mr. Saleh. ''That's all the more reason to wrap this in broader international support. That makes it easier politically for him.''

HEADLINE: Plan to Close California's Budget Deficit

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger took his first shot at closing California's impending $20 billion budget gap on Friday, proposing large-scale pay cuts for state workers, the elimination of several social service programs and a plan to press the federal government for more money. 
 The suggested cuts -- which were met with resistance from lawmakers, with whom he must negotiate a final budget -- come on the heels of tens of billions of dollars in cuts and tax increases over the last budget cycle. 
 ''I know many of these cuts are painful,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said at a news conference in Sacramento. ''Believe me, these are the hardest decisions a governor has to make. Yet there is simply no conceivable way to avoid more cuts and more pain.''
 Much of the state's money must be spent on mandates required by Washington and state ballot initiatives, and the economy continues to be sluggish. As a result, the governor, short on solutions, took aim at entire programs and wholesale spending areas, rather than seizing on across-the-board trims, the usual method of cutting. 
 For instance, Mr. Schwarzenegger chose not to cut financing for public universities, but has proposed eliminating the state's $1 billion welfare program for families with children, ending a $126 million health insurance program for children, reducing the state's Medicaid eligibility to the minimum to save over $500 million, and ending the state's network of subsidized home health care providers for the poor.
 The state might avert the worst of such a scenario, the governor suggested, if the federal government comes up with $6.9 billion that he claims it is owed, either through fixing accounting errors and shortchanging, or through the rejiggering of federal formulas to benefit the state. 
 ''We are not looking for a bailout,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said. ''Just federal fairness.''
 Leaders in states that generate large amounts for the federal coffers, like California and New York, often complain bitterly about what they get back, generally to little avail. 
 Mr. Schwarzenegger also proposed ending the furloughs for state workers, which were begun last year by the administration and were overturned in part in court battles waged by some unions. In their place, the governor said that he would like to see 5 percent pay reductions across the board, and that he wanted state employees to contribute an additional 5 percent toward their retirement costs. 
 Driver alert: speeders who are caught by red-light cameras using new software would face fines of $225 to $325; most of that money would pay for trial courts.
 The plan did not call for tax increases on residents, but did call for a 4.8 percent surcharge on residential and commercial property insurance to pay for fire protection. And a proposal to pay for state parks, which narrowly avoid sweeping closings this year, would reintroduce a plan for oil drilling off Santa Barbara.
 Lawmakers reacted skeptically to some of the ideas.
 ''Essentially threatening the federal government -- I don't think that is the appropriate way to go about things,'' Karen Bass, the Assembly speaker, said in an interview. ''We certainly concur with the depth of the problem. What we would rather do instead is tell an agency to figure out how to achieve the savings.'' 
 The governor on Friday declared a fiscal emergency and called the Legislature into a special session to deal with the roughly $6.6 billion in shortfalls in the current fiscal year.

HEADLINE: 85,000 More Jobs Cut in December, Fogging Outlook

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN; Javier C. Hernandez contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The nation lost 85,000 jobs from the economy in December, the Labor Department reported Friday, as hopes for a vigorous recovery ran headlong into the prospect that paychecks could remain painfully scarce into next year. 
 ''We're still losing jobs,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. ''It's nothing like we had in the free fall of last winter, but we're not about to turn around. We're still looking at a really weak economy.''
 The disappointing snapshot of the job market intensified pressure on the Obama administration to show results for the $787 billion spending bill it championed last year to stimulate the economy.
 At a news conference, Mr. Obama acknowledged the December data as a setback, while outlining plans to deliver $2.3 billion in tax credits to spur manufacturing jobs in clean energy. 
 ''We have to continue to explore every avenue to accelerate the return to hiring,'' the president told reporters.
 Most economists assume the unemployment rate -- which held steady at 10 percent in December -- will worsen in coming months. The nation would then confront the highest jobless rate in a generation on the eve of November elections that will determine the balance of power in Congress. 
 Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com, forecasts that the unemployment rate will reach 10.8 percent by October. The so-called underemployment rate -- which counts people who have given up looking for work and those who are working part time for lack of full-time positions -- now sits at 17.3 percent.
 Mr. Zandi argues that the economy requires an additional $125 billion jolt of stimulus spending on construction projects and aid to state and local governments -- a proposal that confronts enormous political challenges. 
 Republicans assert the first dose of stimulus spending has been squandered on dubious projects. The Obama administration, increasingly concerned by the size of federal deficits, is loath to spend more.
 Mr. Zandi argues that a failure to spend now to spur growth could leave the United States in a bigger hole. 
 ''If we don't do it and we slide back into recession,'' he said, ''that's going to exacerbate the deficit even more.'' 
 The December jobs report included one encouraging milestone: Data for November was revised to show the economy gained 4,000 jobs that month, compared with initial reports showing a net loss of 11,000 jobs. That was the first monthly improvement since the recession began two years ago.
 But the December data failed to repeat the trend, disappointing economists, who had generally expected a decline of 10,000 jobs. The report showed continued slowing in the pace of job losses, but it also underscored that companies were reluctant to hire.
 For a fifth consecutive month, temporary help services expanded, adding 47,000 positions in December. That buttressed the notion that companies required more labor, even as they held off hiring full-time workers.
 ''We're going in the right direction,'' said Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, a research and trading firm. ''If we just have a little bit of patience, we'll start to see monthly increases of 200,000 to 300,000 jobs within six months.''
 But millions of people still grappling with the bite of the worst downturn since the Great Depression have exhausted their patience -- along with their savings and confidence.
 In Charlotte, N.C., Kumar G. Navile, 33, says he has applied for 500 jobs in the year since he lost his position as an engineer. 
 ''You get up every day and say today will be different, but it is mentally challenging,'' Mr. Navile said. ''I performed well in school. I got a job the day I graduated. It's been a struggle.''
 For those out of work, the market is bleaker than ever. The average duration of unemployment reached 29 weeks in December, the longest since the government began tracking such data in 1948. 
 ''There is almost no hiring going on outside the temporary help sector,'' said Andrew Stettner, deputy director of the National Employment Law Project. 
 Despite the parsing of data and contrasting economic forecasts, no complexity cloaked the basic facts of the report: job openings remain scarce. 
 ''Most people, they're not looking at the data,'' Mr. Baker said. ''They're just asking, 'Can I get a job?' And that's not getting any easier.''
 The government's monthly jobs report, while always important, now stands as the crucial indicator of economic health.
 For years, households spent in excess of incomes by borrowing against the value of homes, leaning on credit cards and tapping stock portfolios. But home prices have plummeted, stock holdings have diminished and nervous banks have sliced credit even for healthy borrowers, leaving the paycheck as the primary source of household finance.
 Economists are divided over the nation's economic prospects. Some argue that recent expansion on the factory floor presages broader economic improvement that will soon deliver job growth.
 Not yet. Manufacturing lost 27,000 jobs in December. Construction jobs declined by 53,000. Government shed 21,000 jobs. Despite a surprisingly strong holiday shopping season, retailing lost 10,000 jobs.
 Health care remained a bright spot, expanding by 22,000 jobs.
 Skeptics argue that the factory expansion merely reflects a rebuilding of inventories after businesses slashed stocks during the panic. Expansion has been aided by stimulus spending and tax credits for homebuyers.
 Once these factors fade in coming months, skeptics argue, the economy will confront stubborn challenges -- cash-tight households curtailing spending, banks reluctant to lend and businesses unwilling to hire.
 Those with the gloomiest outlooks envision a ''double dip'' recession, in which the economy resumes contracting. Others fear years of stagnation, like Japan's Lost Decade in the 1990s.
 One point of agreement among economists is that the nation cannot recover without millions of new jobs. The economy needs about 100,000 new jobs a month just to keep pace with people entering the work force. When workers gain wages, they spend them at other businesses, creating jobs for other workers -- a virtuous cycle, in the parlance of economists.
 Recent months have produced tentative signs that such a cycle might be unfolding, even as economists debate its sustainability. The December jobs report added to the ambiguity.
 On the one hand, job losses undermined hopes for a quick turnaround. Yet the losses were a far cry from the roughly 700,000 monthly job losses seen a year ago.
 ''Standing still feels good when you've been used to falling backwards,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group. ''But we want to move forward.''

HEADLINE: Obama Takes A New Route To Opposing Parts of Laws

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration is lowering the volume in a long-running argument between Congress and the executive branch over when, if ever, a president has the power to bypass federal statutes he has signed into law.
 Legal scholars said the administration's new approach, which avoids repeating claims of executive power that the White House has previously voiced, could avoid setting off fights with lawmakers. But the approach will make it harder to keep track of which statutes the White House believes it can disregard, or to compare the number of laws challenged by President Obama with former President George W. Bush's record.
 In Mr. Obama's first months in office last year, he followed recent precedent and frequently issued statements, when signing bills into law, that the executive branch could disregard provisions that he considered unconstitutional restraints on executive power.
 But Mr. Obama has not issued a signing statement since last summer, when one claim set off a bipartisan uproar in Congress. And the administration has decided that Mr. Obama will sometimes sign bills containing provisions it deems problematic without issuing a signing statement that challenges those sections. 
 Still, the administration will consider itself free to disregard new laws it considers unconstitutional, especially in cases where it has previously voiced objections elsewhere, officials said.
 The White House disclosed its shift when asked why it had not put out a signing statement last month, when Mr. Obama signed a $447 billion spending bill for 2010. It contained several provisions that restricted executive power in ways that the administration had previously asserted were unconstitutional -- including in signing statements attached to similar bills and in policy statements it issued about the spending bill as lawmakers drew it up.
 ''The administration's views about certain provisions in the omnibus spending bill had previously been publicly communicated,'' said Ben LaBolt, a White House spokesman, ''so it wasn't necessary to duplicate them in a signing statement.''
 Since the 19th century, presidents have occasionally used signing statements to declare that parts of a bill were unconstitutional and need not be enforced or obeyed as written. But the tactic was rare until the second term of President Ronald Reagan, whose legal team developed a strategy of issuing the statements more frequently to increase presidential power. 
 Reagan's successors continued that approach. And the practice escalated again under Mr. Bush, who used it to advance expansive theories of executive power. He challenged about 1,200 sections of bills -- more than all predecessors combined -- including a ban on torture and oversight provisions of the USA Patriot Act. 
 Mr. Bush's assertive use of the tactic set off a national debate over its propriety. The American Bar Association declared that signing statements ''undermine the rule of law and our constitutional system of separation of powers,'' and argued that the Constitution gave presidents only two choices: veto a bill, or sign it and obey all of it.
 But other scholars said the tactic was appropriate if a president cited only mainstream legal theories. Mr. Obama, whose advisers sided with the latter camp, has characterized Mr. Bush's use of signing statements as an abuse and pledged greater restraint.
 Mr. Obama nevertheless challenged dozens of provisions early last year. The last time was in June, when his claim that he could disobey a new law requiring officials to push the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to adopt certain policies angered Congress. The White House sought to reassure lawmakers that it intended to take those negotiating positions anyway and was merely noting its view that Congress cannot control foreign negotiations. Many lawmakers rejected that theory, and the House quickly voted 429 to 2 to bar officials from disobeying the restrictions. 
 Although the recent spending bill received no signing statement, it contained a similar provision about World Trade Organization negotiations, as well as several other types the administration had previously challenged. The White House issued several ''statements of administration policy'' warning that those provisions raised constitutional concerns while the legislation was pending, but Congress did not change them.
 Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who led last summer's backlash, said the White House risked losing Congressional support for international economic organizations. Mr. Frank also said it was ''outrageous'' to contend that if Congress disagreed with the administration's opinion that a provision would be unconstitutional, the president could sign the bill and disobey it. 
 ''They have a legitimate right to tell us their constitutional concerns -- that's different from having a signing statement,'' Mr. Frank said. ''Anyone who makes the argument that 'once we have told you we have constitutional concerns and then you pass it anyway, that justifies us in ignoring it' -- that is a constitutional violation. Those play very different roles and you can't bootstrap one into the other.'' 
 But Peter M. Shane, an Ohio State University law professor, praised the approach as a step toward a return to the ''normalcy'' of how presidents used signing statements through Reagan's first term. Mr. Shane has previously criticized the administration over its frequent early use of the device. 
 Still, Jack L. Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor who led the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel in 2003-04, argued that an approach of issuing fewer signing statements would ''not be terribly consequential'' in practice because the executive branch could still override a provision that its legal team later pronounces unconstitutional.
 Last year the Obama administration disregarded a statute that forbid State Department officials to attend United Nations meetings led by nations deemed state sponsors of terrorism. Congress has included that restriction in several recent bills.
 When Mr. Bush signed one such bill, he issued a signing statement instructing officials to view the law as merely advisory, and they attended at least one such meeting on his watch. By contrast, when Mr. Obama signed another bill with an identical provision, he did not specifically single it out for challenge. But his administration later obtained an Office of Legal Counsel opinion pronouncing it unconstitutional, and officials continued to attend such meetings.
 Unlike signing statements, opinions from the Office of Legal Counsel are often secret. Mr. Goldsmith said the administration's approach of issuing fewer signing statements would mean ''somewhat less accountability.''
 ''I think it's a bad development if they are not going to highlight for the nation in all these new statutes where they think there are problems,'' he said. 
 The White House, however, said it had given clear public notice about its views.
 ''Each piece of legislation,'' Mr. LaBolt said, ''is considered on an individual basis to determine whether a signing statement is necessary, and communications regarding the administration's views on legislation such as Statements of Administration Policy will continue to be publicly available for Congress and all Americans to evaluate.''

HEADLINE: Turning Focus to Jobs, if Outside Events Allow It

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama keeps trying to turn attention to ''jobs, jobs, jobs,'' as his chief of staff has put it. But he is finding that it can be hard to focus on any one issue when so many demand attention, often unexpectedly. And as the lackluster employment report on Friday suggested, showing concern is not the same as showing results.
 The president and his party have now entered a midterm election year in which they expect to lose seats in Congress after big gains in the last two cycles. Just how many they lose will probably hinge more on pocketbook politics than on any other issue: whether voters believe the still-sluggish economy, as evidenced by the jobless rate, is reviving, and whether Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats deserve credit or blame. 
 The employment situation is only the most visible of the economic policy challenges that Mr. Obama faces. 
 His push to overhaul financial regulation is bogged down on Capitol Hill. The housing market is still weak and his programs to help homeowners have had little impact. The Federal Reserve is under pressure from inflation hawks to begin tightening policy, while deficit hawks are demanding that government spending be restrained -- even as some economists say more stimulus is needed to avert prolonged economic sluggishness or even another recession.
 But the measures by which voters are most likely to judge his success are the unemployment rate and the pace of job creation. So after an inaugural year in which Mr. Obama was absorbed in the overhaul of the health care insurance system and by a prolonged internal debate over a military buildup in Afghanistan, the White House has been trying to orchestrate a shift to showcase Mr. Obama as concerned and focused on doing everything within his power to create jobs. 
 But the employment report for December, which showed further job losses instead of the hoped-for gains, suggested that time might be running out for Democrats to show significant progress before voters start making up their minds -- say, by summer. 
 Meanwhile, the world keeps intruding as Mr. Obama tries to execute his promised pivot. 
 No sooner was the president home on Monday from his Hawaiian holiday break than he was closeted for days at the White House with his national security team, on responses to the foiled Christmas Day airliner attack.
 With House and Senate Democrats now in the home stretch of their negotiations for a compromise on health care legislation, he will have to be more directly involved than ever before in those gritty legislative details.
 Anita Dunn, until recently Mr. Obama's communications director, said that when the health care bill was completed, ''that will give the administration more space to really communicate to the American people about those things that have been done and that the president continues to push forward on to make the economy work for middle-class families.''
 Mr. Obama, in his Friday afternoon statement on the job numbers, called them a reminder ''that we have to continue to work every single day to get our economy moving again. For most Americans, and for me, that means jobs.''
 Mr. Obama was speaking at a White House event to call attention to his program for encouraging the creation of jobs linked to clean energy sources. He did not call for any new initiatives, though the White House has been refining a proposed package of tax incentives and other measures that Mr. Obama is likely to highlight in his State of the Union address in a few weeks. 
 The responses by Republicans to the jobs report on Friday reflected their belief that Mr. Obama was vulnerable to the charge that he and the Democrats are flailing. 
 ''It's time,'' said Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, that Mr. Obama ''finally do what he should have been doing over the past year -- put his full and undivided attention on fixing our economy.''
 At the same time, he and other Republican leaders suggest that Democrats are doing too much in the way of government intervention in the economy. Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, said in a statement that ''unless Washington gets out of the way'' Americans will not be able to get out of ''this mess.'' 
 The fact is that juggling issues is just part of being president. Unlike a candidate for the job, a president is more buffeted by events and less able to stay ''on message.''
 The challenge for Mr. Obama, then, is to find ways to telegraph his concerns about the economy while also looking like he has done something about it.
 His chief contribution -- the $787 billion stimulus package -- became law nearly a year ago; recent extensions and pending proposals building on the package will bring it to about $1 trillion in tax cuts and spending. While economists generally agree it has helped avert even greater job losses, Republicans seize on the continued high unemployment rate to argue that the plan has been a costly failure. 
 Many economists expect job growth to resume by February or March. The unemployment rate, however, is expected to remain as high as 10.5 percent through Election Day in November, as discouraged people who have left the job market decide to resume their search. 
 Assuming the economists are right, Democrats have to hope that voters focus on monthly gains in new jobs as a sign of progress. Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, said polling evidence suggested that was what many voters would do. 
 But David Winston, a political consultant who advises Congressional Republican leaders, said the unemployment rate was the most important indicator for voters assessing Mr. Obama's performance. 
 ''If this number doesn't significantly improve, that's going to be a negative for him and for his party,'' Mr. Winston said. 
 And, he added, voters are liable to ask, ''Why all the focus on health care when you should have been dealing with unemployment?''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Grief and Grieving

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
The attack on the Republican establishment by the tea party folks grabs the gaze like a really bad horror flick -- some version of ''Hee Haw'' meets ''28 Days Later.'' It's fascinating. But it also raises a serious question: Are these the desperate thrashings of a dying movement or the labor pains of a new one? 
 My money is on the former. Anyone who says that this is the dawn of a new age of conservatism is engaging in wishful thinking on a delusional scale.
 There is no doubt that the number of people who say that they are conservative has inched up. According to a report from Gallup on Thursday, conservatives finished 2009 as the No. 1 ideological group. But ideological identification is no predictor of electoral outcomes. According to polls by The New York Times, conservative identification was slightly higher on the verge of Bill Clinton's first-term election and Barack Obama's election than it was on the verge of George W. Bush's first-term election.
 It is likely that Republicans will pick up Congressional seats in November partly because of the enthusiasm of this conservative fringe, democratic apathy and historical trends. But make no mistake: This is not 1994.
 This is a limited, emotional reaction. It's a response to the trauma that is the Great Recession, the uncertainty and creeping suspicion about the risks being taken in Washington, a visceral reaction to Obama and an overwhelming sense of powerlessness and loss.
 Simply put, it's about fear-fueled anger. But anger is not an idea. It's not a plan. And it's not a vision for the future. It is, however, the second stage of grief, right after denial and before bargaining. 
 The right is on the wrong side of history. The demographics of the country are rapidly changing, young people are becoming increasingly liberal on social issues, and rigid, dogmatic religious stricture is loosening its grip on the throat of our culture.
 The right has seen the enemy, and he is the future. 
 According to a Gallup report issued this week, Republicans were more than twice as likely as Democrats and a third more likely as independents to have a pessimistic outlook for the country over the next 20 years. That might be the fourth stage of grief: depression. 
 So what's their battle plan to fight back from the precipice of irrelevance? Moderation? A stab at modernity? A slate of innovative ideas? No, their plan is to purge the party's moderates and march farther down the road to oblivion.
 Erick Erickson, the incendiary editor of the popular conservative blog RedState, appeared on ''The Colbert Report'' on Monday and said that ''no one really knows what a Republican is anymore.'' 
 Split hairs about labels if you must, but the Republican brand already has begun a slow slide into obscurity. And turning further right only hastens its demise. Quiet as it's kept, many in the party know this. That, alas, is called acceptance.

Five months after Afghanistan's tainted presidential election, it still does not have a fully functioning government in place. President Hamid Karzai nominated 24 members to his new cabinet, and last week Parliament rejected 17 of them. 
 That could further delay the reforms that are urgently needed to reverse years of government mismanagement and corruption. Still, Parliament has shown a healthy independence and many of its judgments appear sound. It also gives Mr. Karzai another chance to assemble a stronger team. He should do so, quickly.
 Several important cabinet posts were approved, including the ministers of defense, interior, finance, agriculture and education. These appointees are largely technocrats and are seen by American and other Western officials as competent and relatively untainted by corruption -- an especially important qualification for officials who will control large sums of outside aid. 
 Washington lobbied hard for the incumbents Abdul Rahim Wardak, the defense minister, and Hanif Atmar, the interior minister. They are both considered to be strong leaders and allies for the necessary but difficult effort to build up and strengthen the army and to clean up the highly corrupt police. 
 Lawmakers also wisely rejected the reappointment of Ismail Khan as energy minister and three nominees associated with Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum. Mr. Khan and General Dostum backed Mr. Karzai in the campaign. Both are also notorious warlords accused of human rights abuses. If Mr. Karzai felt a debt to them, he should consider it repaid, distance himself from such unsavory cronies and reach out to other candidates.
 President Karzai showed better sense when he chose political allies of Abdullah Abdullah -- his main challenger in the August election -- to serve as ministers of higher education, rural rehabilitation and refugees. We don't know why Parliament rejected them; they may not have been the best choices. Mr. Karzai should work hard to find other competent members of Mr. Abdullah's group to serve in the government. 
 He should also work hard to find a place for Ashraf Ghani, a former finance minister and World Bank official who is well regarded internationally. He has sensible ideas about developing a national strategy for improving governance and for adopting transparent criteria for choosing credible people for government jobs. He could bring both credibility and competence to a government short on both.
 After the cabinet vote, lawmakers were about go on their winter break. President Karzai was right to insist that they remain in Kabul until they confirm a new cabinet. He now must put forward a better list of nominees and work cooperatively with a Parliament he usually ignores to win their approval. Washington should encourage them to come to terms as quickly as possible. Afghanistan has too many problems for more delay. 
 On Jan. 28, Mr. Karzai, along with Britain and the United Nations, is scheduled to host an international conference in London to address Afghanistan's problems. Mr. Karzai has promised to unveil an anticorruption campaign and a plan for the government to eventually assume control of Afghan security. We are also looking for NATO, the United Nations and the European Union to say how they are going to do their jobs in Afghanistan better. 
 If there is any chance of succeeding, Afghanistan must have a credible and honest government that can deliver the services and security that its people desperately need.

HEADLINE: With Detroit In a Downturn, Entrepreneurs Opt to Look Up

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
With $6,000 and some Hollywood-style spunk, four friends opened this city's only independent foreign movie house three months ago in an abandoned school auditorium on an unlighted stretch of the Cass Corridor near downtown. 
 After the unlikely hoopla of an opening night, red-carpet-style event in an area known for drugs and prostitution, exactly four customers showed up to see a film. 
 Since then, the Burton Theater has had a few profitable nights. But, the owners say, this adventure in entrepreneurship was never completely about making money. It was also about creating a more livable community. 
 ''Nobody could comprehend why we'd start a theater,'' said an investor, Nathan Faustyn, 25. ''But when you live in Detroit, you ask, 'What can I do for the city?' We needed this. And we had nothing to lose. When you're at the bottom of the economic ladder, you have nowhere to look but up.'' 
 Despite the recession -- and in some cases because of it -- small businesses are budding around Detroit in one of the more surprising twists of the downturn. Some new businesses like the Burton are scratching by. Others have already grown beyond the initial scope of their business plans, juggling hundreds of customers and expanding into new sites. 
 Across from the Burton, for instance, Jennifer Willemsen just celebrated the first anniversary of her shop, Curl Up and Dye, a retro-themed hair salon serving 1,500 clients. Not far away, Torya Blanchard, a former French teacher, recently opened the second location of Good Girls Go to Paris, a creperie. Next door, Greg Lenhoff, also a former teacher, opened a bookstore in August called Leopold's. 
 And just down the street from Leopold's, on Woodward Avenue, Victor Both runs Breezecab, a company he started with a severance package after a layoff from Wayne State University. He uses rickshaws to ferry workers and conventioneers around downtown. ''This filled a transportation void,'' said Mr. Both, 34, who picked up the pedicab idea while touring Las Vegas before his layoff. ''I haven't made much money, but the experience has been priceless. I had no idea Detroit had so much love.''
 It is not an uncommon instinct to start an enterprise in bad times and seize on weakened competition, lower overhead costs and perhaps more free time. Nor is it limited to Detroit. But the trend is particularly striking here, in a city that was suffering long before the rest of the nation fell into recession and where hard times, business closings and abandonment became routine generations ago.
 Experts say the zeal for entrepreneurship these days in Detroit and elsewhere has precedent: according to research by Dane Stangler, a senior analyst at the Kauffman Foundation, a center for economic research in Kansas City, Mo., half the companies on the Fortune 500 list this year were founded in recession or bear markets. Further, Mr. Stangler said in an interview, company survival rates going back to 1977 show a negligible difference between companies founded in expansions and recessions.
 For some of the new businesses, preparation was minimal. 
 ''All I really needed was a garage, a cellphone and a Web site,'' said Mr. Both, who started Breezecab with two leased rickshaws. 
 Ms. Blanchard's creperie was more complicated. The restaurant is in the first-floor retail space of what had been an unattractive apartment complex. When the site came under new management recently, the landlord offered to gut the retail space, spending about $70,000 on improvements, Ms. Blanchard said. She put in the rest: $15,000 in equipment, a coat of red paint, an oversize blackboard for the menu, and her own collection of vintage French movie posters. 
 Now, Ms. Blanchard pays what she calls a ''ridiculously low'' rent of $1,600 a month for a 1,000-square-foot space that accommodates 45 diners at Parisian-style cafe tables near the Detroit Institute of Arts.
 ''This was a place to watch your back just four years ago,'' said Ms. Blanchard, who founded the business with a cashed-out 401(k). 
 ''I just wanted to do something that I loved,'' she said. ''And everything worked its way out.''
 Michigan, which has the highest unemployment rate of any state, has been aggressive in offering support for start-up companies, particularly in Detroit. The Michigan Small Business and Technology Development Center, which offers support and counseling, counts 20 small businesses, and 400 new jobs, created last year in the three-county area around Detroit, and the center expects that tally to grow as it completes its accounting in the coming weeks. That was down from 41 new businesses in 2008, but on par with the 23 such start-ups in 2007 and 24 in 2006. 
 At Wayne State University's business incubator, TechTown, housed in a former auto plant, 150 companies jostle for space -- up from one when the building opened five years ago. 
 ''I find it inspiring,'' Peter Bregman, the chief executive of Bregman Partners, a New York management consulting firm, said of what is happening in Detroit. ''There's something about that feeling -- 'Maybe America abandoned us, but we're not going to abandon us.' ''
 Analysts say the entrepreneurs have tapped into buyers' penchants for spending locally in a bad economy, along with a longstanding void in the service industry.
 Some business owners are also capitalizing on a newly energized nostalgia for the vibrant Detroit that used to be, and the more general trend toward urban living. 
 ''This is a passion project for most people,'' said Claire Nelson, owner of the Bureau of Urban Living, an accessories boutique, and one of the organizers of a loose network of local entrepreneurs that functions like a support group. 
 ''We've got all this empty space in Detroit,'' said Ms. Nelson, 33. ''If landlords are willing to work with us, we pour our hearts and souls into the place.''
 Once the Burton Theater carved out its space in the schoolhouse that closed in 2002 -- a 1920s-era building that had receded into the shadows like so many empty spaces in Detroit -- the city, which had let the block go dark, turned the streetlights back on. The relighting was a victory felt far beyond the Burton.
 ''Our business ideas are about taking ownership of where you are and what you have,'' said Ms. Willemsen, 29, of Curl Up and Dye. ''We want to do right by our neighbors.''
 And some customers are going out of their way to support the new city businesses. 
 ''I live in the suburbs where I used to get my hair cut until Jen opened a store,'' said Dessa Cosma, a client at Curl Up and Dye. ''I'd rather spend my money here. It's a conscious decision for someone who cares about the city.''

 COMMUNITY COMMITMENT: Nathan Faustyn, left, helped start a foreign movie house, complete with a pool table in the men's room. Part of the goal was to make the area more livable. ''When you live in Detroit,'' he said, ''you ask, 'What can I do for the city?''' Nearby, a retro-themed hair salon that opened just a year ago counts 1,500 clients.

HEADLINE: Neighbors Challenge Energy Aims In Bolivia

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO and ANDRES SCHIPANI

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia 

 BODY:
President Evo Morales's leftist government, which has asserted greater control over some of South America's most coveted natural gas reserves, is facing a challenge as neighboring countries move to achieve energy security by cutting their dependence on Bolivian gas supplies. 
 New gas projects in Brazil and Argentina have come on line at a time when Mr. Morales is winning plaudits for a strong economy. It grew 3.7 percent last year, enabling him to consolidate control over energy resources, including natural gas, South America's second-largest such reserve after Venezuela's, and huge lithium deposits. 
 But even as Mr. Morales has emerged as one of the region's strongest leaders, bolstered by a landslide re-election victory in December, concern is surfacing here over Bolivia's long-term financial underpinnings as its neighbors start importing gas from distant sources like Qatar, and not so distant ones, like Trinidad and Tobago. 
 The reorganization of South America's energy relationships is being closely followed by countries trying to limit their reliance on energy-rich nations that are in political flux or that use their resources as a political lever, as Russia's state energy company has bullied former Soviet republics and Europe. 
 ''The new projects in South America offer a striking example of how countries can cut their umbilical dependence on pipelines,'' said Carlos Alberto Lopez, an energy secretary in a previous administration here. ''We are awakening to the reality that our energy nationalism is shooting us in the foot.'' 
 The new gas-import ventures in Brazil and Argentina, as well as two in Chile, once a potential market for Bolivian gas, all use ship-borne imports, in which the fuel is cooled into liquefied natural gas for transport from exporting countries and reheated on delivery. This increasingly common transport method has provided substantial competition with pipelines in some markets. 
 Bolivia itself once had plans to export liquefied gas by sending it first to a Chilean port, from where it would be shipped north to Mexico or the United States. But the plan caused so much outrage -- driven in part by historical tensions with Chile and by resentment of the political elite here who had championed the project -- that it was a major factor in an uprising by Bolivia's indigenous population in 2003. 
 Mr. Morales, 50, helped lead those protests and announced the nationalization of the energy industry after he became president in 2006. He sent soldiers to occupy gas installations, raised royalties on foreign energy companies and bolstered nationalistic institutions like the navy, which patrols rivers and lakes, and pines for sea access in this landlocked country. 
 While these policies intensified fears in neighboring countries over Bolivia's ability and willingness to export its gas at certain prices, they hold wide appeal among Bolivia's voters, reflected in the election victory here last month of Mr. Morales, the country's first indigenous president.
 ''We've been ransacked for so long,'' said Domitila Mora, 46, a fruit seller in El Alto, the city of slums located above the capital, La Paz. ''The nationalization gave us back our dignity, and now things are better. Brother Evo Morales is taking care of our natural resources for us.'' 
 The symbolism of his energy policies permeates El Alto's bleak cityscape in the form of state advertising. 
 One billboard paid for by YPFB, the national energy company, extols social spending made possible by higher royalties. ''There is no development without nationalization,'' it says, showing Mr. Morales holding a schoolgirl in his arms. 
 Relatively sound economic stewardship, particularly compared with Venezuela, Bolivia's top ally, makes a sudden crisis over losing gas-export markets unlikely. Bolivia's growth last year contrasted with Venezuela's 2.9 percent economic contraction, as Venezuela struggled with high inflation and a dearth of private investment. 
 Brazil, the region's rising power, is also not eager to see Bolivia, a major producer of cocaine and still one of South America's poorest nations, lose its hard-won economic stability. 
 While trying to avoid confrontation with Mr. Morales, Brazil has reassured Bolivia that it will keep importing its gas, even as Petrobras, Brazil's national energy company, has cooled to large new investments here. And private Brazilian companies like HRT have made breaking dependence on Bolivian gas a central mission. 
 Meanwhile, cracks are already emerging in Bolivia's energy industry as the focus of international energy companies in South America shifts decidedly to Brazil, which is developing its own new discoveries of offshore oil and gas, and away from Bolivia and Venezuela. 
 Prices for Bolivia's gas fell sharply in 2009, with income from gas exports declining 39 percent to $2.1 billion, according to the Bolivian Hydrocarbons Chamber, an industry group. 
 As foreign companies slow investments here, drilling for new fields is almost at a standstill, Bolivian energy consultants said. 
 YPFB, the national energy company, also faces a scandal involving a kickback scheme and the recent killing here of an energy executive who was carrying $450,000 in cash, events that Mr. Morales attributed to infiltration of the company by the Central Intelligence Agency. 
 But the liquefied gas projects in neighboring countries, including two in Brazil and one in Argentina, loom as a bigger challenge. 
 Two more liquid projects in Chile, which does not import Bolivian gas, would alter the region's energy dynamic further. Gas from those projects could also be shipped by pipeline to Argentina, a top Bolivian market. 
 For now, the possibility of Bolivian energy exports to Chile seems increasingly remote as Chile remains resistant to aspirations by Bolivia, reiterated here last month by Adm. Jose Luis Cabas, the commander of Bolivia's armed forces, to regain coastline from what is now Chilean territory. 
 ''Evo's nationalization was an astute move politically in the short term,'' said Roger Tissot, a specialist in South American energy politics at Gas Energy, a Brazilian consulting firm, citing the increase in social spending made possible here by higher revenues. ''But in the long term Bolivia is boxing itself in.''
 Miguel Yague, a senior energy official in Mr. Morales's government, said that Bolivia remained optimistic about maintaining exports to its neighbors and possibly establishing pipeline routes to Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. ''Looking at Brazil,'' he said, ''it is a market of almost limitless potential.'' 
 Still, Brazil is now drawing up plans of its own to tap its newly discovered gas reserves and build its own separate liquefied natural gas terminal to possibly export the fuel during months of low demand. 
 And Peru, Bolivia's northwestern neighbor, is preparing to export liquefied gas, potentially shipping to markets that could have been Bolivia's.
 At the same time, Bolivia is focused on smaller projects like expanding a pipeline to Argentina. Fanfare followed a recent announcement by Repsol, the Spanish energy giant, that it would increase investments in Bolivia. But skepticism persists as to whether the move was similar to those by foreign companies in Venezuela, where they seek to keep a seat at the negotiating table in a country with large energy reserves but rarely follow through on talk of large projects. 
 ''A decade ago Bolivia was preparing to be the energy nerve center of South America,'' said Gonzalo Chavez, an economist at this city's Catholic University. ''Now a loop of energy-security projects is going up around us.''

HEADLINE: Recession Is Pushing Up Law School Applications and Interest in Graduate Studies

BYLINE: By REBECCA R. RUIZ

 BODY:
It took longer than some experts expected, but the recession and the resulting shortage of good jobs have spurred a jump in applications to law schools and a growing interest in graduate programs.
 The number of people taking the Law School Admissions Test, for example, rose 20 percent in October, compared with October 2008, reaching an all-time high of 60,746. And the number of Americans who took the Graduate Record Examination in 2009 rose 13 percent, to a record 670,000, compared with the year before, according to the Educational Testing Service, which administers the test. The increase is a sharp reversal from 2008, when the number fell 2 percent even though the recession was already under way.
 ''There's a bit of lag time between when people start to worry about the economy and when they get their applications going,'' said Wendy Margolis, director of communications for the Law School Admission Council, which administers the L.S.A.T. 
 Jeffrey S. Brand, dean of the University of San Francisco School of Law, echoed that view.
 ''I think the crash was so severe that people were kind of catatonic,'' Mr. Brand said. ''They weren't sure what to do. They're coming out of that mode now.''
 David G. Payne, the Educational Testing Service's vice president and chief operating officer for college and graduate programs, said the rise in interest in graduate programs was tied to the troubled economy and increased school recruiting. 
 ''When job creation slows, there's an increase in the number of people who pursue a graduate degree,'' Mr. Payne said.
 Officials at many law schools reported substantial increases in applications over last year. Washington University in St. Louis has had a 19 percent year-to-date increase in applications to its college of law. At the University of San Francisco School of Law, applications are up 35 percent over last year, and at the University of Iowa's College of Law, applications are up 39 percent.
 Some increases are more explicable than others. Applications to the Maurer School of Law at Indiana University have risen 54 percent this year, which may be related to its rise in the U.S. News & World Report rankings to 23 in 2009, from 36 the year before.
 But at Cornell University's Law School, whose ranking has remained relatively stable, applications are up 44 percent, and no one is quite sure of the reason for such a large increase. 
 Richard Geiger, dean of admissions, said: ''I'm a little thrown off by the fact that our increase is much bigger than expected. There's nothing big we're doing to explain that kind of increase.''
 Prebble Q. Ramswell, 37, is among those choosing to return to school after being unable to find work.
 A mother with two bachelor's degrees, one in political science and the other in psychology and sociology, Ms. Ramswell has nearly 10 years of work experience, including six years as an intelligence analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency.
 Ms. Ramswell lost her job with the C.I.A. when her contract ended last spring. She and her husband, who had also worked for the C.I.A., were both unemployed. 
 ''We were having such a difficult time finding work,'' she said. After months of searching, her husband found work in Florida, and the couple and their 4-year-old daughter moved there from Northern Virginia.
 ''I still had no luck finding anything, so I said to myself, 'What is it in my life that I have wanted to do, that could make something good of a situation that has turned horribly wrong?' '' 
 Ms. Ramswell is now applying for a master's degree in liberal arts, looking to leverage her background in social science and, ultimately, to become a psychotherapist.
 ''I've realized that it will make me more marketable and open more doors,'' she said.
 Stephanie E. Neal, 24, also said she was hoping to increase her appeal to employers by returning to school. She graduated from college with a bachelor's degree in psychology and sociology in 2008 and has since completed a paralegal certificate and a victim's assistance certificate. But she has been unemployed since May and is now preparing to take the G.R.E. She lives with her parents in Southern California and said ''desperation'' has pushed her back toward academia.
 ''With every job going to someone who has more experience and who is willing to take a pay cut to have a job, I'm left with what amounts to slim pickings,'' she said. ''With no income, I've turned to the idea of higher education.'' 
 Collins Byrd, dean of admissions at the University of Iowa's College of Law, said he had seen many applicants like Ms. Neal.
 ''I think people spent the past year in a bit of shell shock,'' Mr. Byrd said. ''I don't think people applied at as high a rate because they just didn't know what to do. They sat there and did nothing.
 ''Now they're seeing what they can do, seeing if they can take out loans or mortgages on housing. I think people are coming to grips with reality.''

HEADLINE: Secrets Revealed in Turkey Revive Armenian Identity

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY; Sebnem Arsu contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ISTANBUL 

 BODY:
Fethiye Cetin recalled the day her identity shattered. 
 She was a young law student when her beloved maternal grandmother, Seher, took her aside and told her a secret she had hidden for 60 years: that Seher was born a Christian Armenian with the name Heranus and had been saved from a death march by a Turkish officer, who snatched her from her mother's arms in 1915 and raised her as Turkish and Muslim.
 Ms. Cetin's grandmother, whose parents later turned out to have escaped to New York, was just one of many Armenian children who were kidnapped and adopted by Turkish families during the Armenian genocide, the mass killing of more than a million Armenians by the Ottoman Turks between 1915 and 1918. These survivors were sometimes called ''the leftovers of the sword.''
 ''I was in a state of shock for a long time -- I suddenly saw the world through different eyes,'' said Ms. Cetin, now 60. ''I had grown up thinking of myself as a Turkish Muslim, not an Armenian. There had been nothing in the history books about the massacre of a people that had been erased from Turkey's collective memory. Like my grandmother, many had buried their identity -- and the horrors they had seen -- deep inside of them.'' 
 Now, however, Ms. Cetin, a prominent advocate for the estimated 50,000-member Armenian-Turkish community here and one of the country's leading human rights lawyers, believes a seminal moment has arrived in which Turkey and Armenia can finally confront the ghosts of history and possibly even overcome one of the world's most enduring and bitter rivalries. 
 She already has confronted her divided self, which led her from Istanbul to a 10th Street grocery store in New York, where her Armenian relatives had rebuilt their broken lives after fleeing Turkey. (Many of the Armenians who survive in Turkey today do so because their ancestors lived in western provinces during the killings, which took place mostly in the east.)
 The latest tentative step toward healing generations of acrimony between the countries took place in October on a soccer field in the northwestern Turkish city of Bursa, when President Serzh Sargsyan became the first Armenian head of state to travel to Turkey to attend a soccer game between the national teams. In this latest round of soccer diplomacy, Mr. Sargsyan was joined at the match by President Abdullah Gul of Turkey, who had traveled to a soccer match in Armenia the year before.
 ''We do not write history here,'' Mr. Gul told his Armenian counterpart in Bursa. ''We are making history.''
 The Bursa encounter came just days after Turkey and Armenia signed a historic series of protocols to establish diplomatic relations and to reopen the Turkish-Armenian border, which has been closed since 1993. The agreement, strongly backed by the United States, the European Union and Russia, has come under vociferous opposition from nationalists in both Turkey and Armenia.
 Armenia's sizable diaspora -- estimated at more than seven million -- in the United States, France and elsewhere is alarmed that the new warmth may be misused as an excuse to forgive and forget in Turkey, where even uttering the words Armenian genocide can be grounds for prosecution. 
 Also threatening the deal is Armenia's lingering fight with Azerbaijan, its neighbor and a close ally of Turkey, over a breakaway Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan.
 The agreement, which has yet to be ratified in the Turkish or Armenian Parliaments, could have broad consequences, helping to end landlocked Armenia's economic isolation, while lifting Turkey's chances for admission into the European Union, where the genocide issue remains a crucial obstacle. 
 But Ms. Cetin argued that the most enduring consequence could be helping to overcome mutual recriminations. She said Armenians had been battling a powerful and collective denial in Turkish society about the killings. 
 ''Most people in Turkish society have no idea what happened in 1915, and the Armenians they meet are introduced as monsters or villains or enemies in their history books,'' she said. ''Turkey has to confront the past, but before this confrontation can happen, people must know who they are confronting. So we need the borders to come down in order to have dialogue.''
 Ms. Cetin, who was raised by her maternal grandmother, said the borders in her own Muslim Turkish heart came down irrevocably when her grandmother revealed her Armenian past. 
 Heranus, she said, was only a child in 1915 when Turkish soldiers arrived in her ethnically Armenian Turkish village of Maden, rounding up the men and sequestering women and girls in a church courtyard with high walls. When they climbed on each others' shoulders, Heranus told her, they saw men's throats being cut and bodies being thrown in the Tigris River, which ran red for days. 
 During the forced march toward exile that followed, Heranus said, she saw her own grandmother drown two of her grandchildren before she herself jumped into the water and disappeared. 
 Heranus's mother, Isguhi, survived the march, which ended in Aleppo, Syria, and went to join her husband, Hovannes, who had left the village for New York in 1913, opening a grocery store. They started a new family. 
 ''My grandmother was trembling as she told me her story,'' Ms. Cetin said. ''She would always say, 'May those days vanish, never to return.' '' 
 Ms. Cetin, a rebellious left-wing student activist at the time of her grandmother's revelation, recalled how confronting Armenian identity, then as now, had been taboo. ''The same people who spoke the loudest about injustices and screamed that the world could be a better place would only whisper when it came to the Armenian issue,'' she said. ''It really hurt me.''
 Ms. Cetin, who was imprisoned for three years in the 1980s for opposing the military regime in Turkey at the time, said her newfound Armenian identity inspired her to become a human rights lawyer. When Hrant Dink, editor of the Turkish-Armenian newspaper Agos, was prosecuted in 2006 for insulting Turkishness by referring to the genocide, she became his lawyer. On Jan. 19, 2007, Mr. Dink was killed outside his office by a young ultranationalist. 
 Ms. Cetin published a memoir about her grandmother in 2004. She said she purposely omitted the word ''genocide'' from her book because using the word erected a roadblock to reconciliation. 
 ''I wanted to concentrate on the human dimension,'' she said. ''I wanted to question the silence of people like my grandmother who kept their stories hidden for years, while going through the pain.''
 When her grandmother died in 2000 at age 95, Ms. Cetin honored her last wish, publishing a death notice in Agos, in the hope of tracking down her long-lost Armenian family, including her grandmother's sister Margaret, whom she had never seen.
 At her emotional reunion with her Armenian family in New York, several months later, Margaret, or ''Auntie Marge,'' told Ms. Cetin that when her father had died in 1965, she had found a piece of paper carefully folded in his wallet that he had been keeping for years. It was a letter Heranus had written to him shortly after he had left for the United States. 
 ''We all keep hoping and praying that you are well,'' the note said.

HEADLINE: Start-Ups Find Space And Support

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Former auto workers are among the vanguard of those jumping into the small-business trend in Detroit, and one place they are getting help is the sprawling business incubator of Wayne State University. 
 During his 18 years working at a Ford assembly plant northwest of downtown, Aaron Ellison, 41, had some ideas about how to improve safety around traffic lights, but he never got around to acting on them until the plant closed and he took a buyout.
 Now he is the owner of the two-year-old Ellison Corporation, which designs and markets a patented traffic signaling system from office space at the Wayne State facility, a former auto plant that is the largest of the local business incubators seeking to retool the city's work force.
 ''The desire and determination were there,'' Mr. Ellison said. ''But I needed help in making a transition from auto worker to inventor to business owner.''
 At five years old and covering a city block, the incubator, known as TechTown, describes itself as an ''entrepreneurial school'' that provides space for emerging businesses to grow. It houses 150 start-ups in areas like education, the creative arts and environmental sciences. 
 Beyond space, it has given support, in the form of classes or access to low-cost office equipment, to other companies. Linda Angell, 56, who took an early retirement from General Motors, keeps a mailbox there for her year-old business, Touchstone Evaluations Inc., which provides design and testing support for medical and consumer products.
 While TechTown is by no means singularly devoted to former auto workers, it has retained a focus on Detroit's economic past. 
 ''This is a city that is used to making things,'' said Randal Charlton, TechTown's executive director. ''And whether it's engineering or sculpture or furniture or whatever, the way to use our assets, which are lots of empty factory space, is to identify new products we can manufacture and add value to.''

HEADLINE: If He's So Smart, What Will He Do Now?

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 IN retrospect, maybe the whole Peter Orszag groupie phenomenon was getting a little out of hand early last year with the (ahem) birth of Orszagasm.com, the fan blog devoted to the allegedly hunky White House Director of the Office of Management and Budget -- a k a the guy who is ''putting the OMG back in the OMB.''
 Or maybe it was last March when the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, declared to The New York Times that Mr. Orszag has ''made nerdy sexy.'' 
 Or when the brainiac proved his boss correct by becoming a bona-fide babe magnet, a fixture at decorated dinners and the object of breathless fascination in Washington gossip columns (''Orszag really, really likes Diet Coke!'' gushed Politico). 
 He became the epitome of Obama-Era Nerd Cool. The President himself joked lovingly about his favorite ''propeller head'' at the White House Correspondents Dinner last May. His dates were noted (The Washington Post publisher Katharine Weymouth, among others). Some West Wing wags worried that Mr. Orszag's profile might be getting a tad inflated and that he was getting a little big for his BlackBerry holsters (yes, that's plural). 
 Now things have become complicated for the 41-year-old Mr. Orszag -- and not in the way that pension reform, sustainable growth rates and risk-based capital standards are complicated; rather, in the way that it's complicated when a divorced father of two with a very important job gets very publicly engaged to a 31-year-old financial correspondent for ABC News, Bianna Golodryga, just weeks after his ex-girlfriend gave birth to his daughter.
 Got all that? Good. So did a lot of people around town: the fact that Mr. Orszag's ex -- Claire Milonas, a 39-year-old venture capitalist -- was pregnant with his daughter was well known among Beltway swells. ''The worst-kept secret in the history of Washington,'' declared Mr. Orszag's brother Jon, an economic consultant in Los Angeles. 
 But this ''worst-kept secret'' gestated into ''news'' on Wednesday, when The New York Post blared: ''White House Budget Director Ditched Pregnant Girlfriend for ABC News Gal.'' 
 Suddenly the ''Orszag love-child story'' became a full-term tabloid distraction in a White House otherwise preoccupied by matters like terrorist plots, health care costs and unemployment reports. Mr. Orszag alerted ''the senior people in the West Wing'' of the situation, said Kenneth S. Baer, spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget. As a general rule, executive branch spokesmen are not accustomed to worrying about ''Inside Edition'' -- at least since the Clinton years. 
 ''Trying to explain the sustainable growth rate in Medicare is challenging,'' Mr. Baer said. ''But this is different.'' He just wants this story to go away -- something both sides seem to agree on.
 ''I think the whole thing is silly,'' Ms. Milonas said in a brief telephone interview Friday. ''I hope this whole thing blows over quickly.'' Ms. Milonas, a Harvard- and Yale-educated daughter of a prominent Greek businessman, added that she wishes Mr. Orszag well in his upcoming nuptials (it is unclear whether she has done this directly). 
 But, of course, this is not a story that will easily go away. Friday brought another wave: another New York Post story about the ''lover-boy budget director.'' He made the cover of the tabloid Washington Examiner. The Washington Post's Reliable Source column was comparing Mr. Orszag to Tom Brady -- not so much as a football player, but as simply ''a player.''
 Big questions kept coursing through the corridors of power, particularly this one: Did the Casanova with a calculator really ''ditch'' his pregnant girlfriend for a younger television news babe? 
 Depends what your definition of ''ditch'' is -- and, of course, whom you ask. People in Mr. Orszag's camp say he and Ms. Milonas had broken up well before he started seeing Ms. Golodryga last spring; people close to Ms. Milonas say they are not so sure of the timing (Ms. Milonas would not speak on this matter, and Mr. Orszag declined to comment altogether). 
 Likewise, some in the Milonas camp suggest that Mr. Orszag had promised to marry her, but then met Ms. Golodryga; the Orszag people say that Ms. Milonas wanted to get married, but Peter did not, at least to Claire.
 ''We were in a committed relationship until the spring of 2009,'' Mr. Orszag and Ms. Milonas said in a joint statement Wednesday (spurred by the Post article). ''In November, Claire gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. Although we are no longer together, we are both thrilled she is happy and healthy, and we would hope that everyone would respect their privacy.''
 Friends of Ms. Milonas say that Mr. Orszag wasn't exactly asking for privacy in December when Ms. Golodryga was showing off her engagement rock on ''Good Morning America.'' The two met at the White House Correspondents Dinner, the same event at which the president joked that the TLC network would be starting a new reality show called ''Jon & Kate Plus Peter Orszag.'' 
 People close to Ms. Milonas say they were surprised when Mr. Orszag announced he was getting married just a few months after he met Ms. Golodryga. People in the budget director's bivouac blame Ms. Milonas's side for leaking the news to The Post, which the White House said is driven by a conservative agenda. ''It's no secret what the partisan beliefs of The New York Post are,'' Mr. Baer said, ''or what the journalistic standards of a tabloid like that are.'' 
 It is not clear what role, if any, Mr. Orszag will have in the future of his new daughter, Tatiana Zoe Milonas. He was not present for her Nov. 17 birth and has spent barely any time with her. Mr. Orszag lives in northwest Washington and shares custody of his two children from his first marriage, to Cameron Hamill. Both Ms. Milonas and Ms. Golodryga live in New York. 
 As with any story of this nature in Washington, the Very Serious People who traffic in it are obliged to emphasize that such silliness is beneath them. Mr. Baer said that nearly every press inquiry he has received was prefaced with the requisite faux-sheepishness. 
 ''Everyone feels the need to say, 'I'm really sorry I have to ask you about this' and 'I'm only carrying out orders from my boss,' '' Mr. Baer said. (For the record: this reporter was only acting on orders from his boss.) And, of course, the Very Serious Media are not writing the Orszag Love-Child Story, they are merely writing about the media frenzy surrounding it.
 Perhaps the most fascinating aspect is not so much the timeworn themes of love, life and heartbreak. ''Human relations are a mess,'' said Marina Ein, a crisis public relations expert in Washington whose messes have included the travails of former Congressman Gary Condit. ''We're in the same situation as when Adam was trying to dodge the apple that was thrown at him.''
 Even so, Adam didn't have to deal with deficit forecasts, consumer price indexes or, for that matter, cable headlines like ''Budget Baby Mama Drama'' (thanks for that, MSNBC). And there's a natural intrigue that goes along with an unlikely celebrity who becomes an even more unlikely piece of tabloid fodder. ''There is something that a lot of people in Washington find shocking about this story, which is why we keep talking about it,'' Ms. Ein said. ''This is a person who seems so controlled in his professional life.'' Indeed, someone who carries neat to-do lists in his breast pocket and a copy on his desk of Epictetus, the Greek philosopher who preached self-discipline. ''And yet he's so messy in his private life. This is an a-ha moment.''
 This goes to another obvious -- and recurring -- question: whether someone whose personal life has become so complicated is really fit to tackle one of the most demanding, important and stressful jobs in the universe. ''Frankly I don't see how Orszag can balance three families and the national budget,'' wrote Joel Achenbach of The Washington Post.
 Oh, budget, schmudget. This is about one question above all others, and that is this: Is Peter-mania dead? Is he still a celebrity nerd? 
 ''He is, of course, still a celebrity nerd,'' said Ana Marie Cox, a national correspondent for Air America and unabashed Orsz-a-phile. ''He is still a celebrity and he's still a nerd. What part of that isn't true?''

HEADLINE: The New Age Cavemen and the City

BYLINE: By JOSEPH GOLDSTEIN

 BODY:
LIKE many New York bachelors, John Durant tries to keep his apartment presentable -- just in case he should ever bring home a future Mrs. Durant. He shares the fifth-floor walk-up with three of his buddies, but the place is tidy and he never forgets to water the plants. 
 The one thing that Mr. Durant worries might spook a female guest is his most recent purchase: a three-foot-tall refrigerated meat locker that sits in a corner of his living room. That is where he keeps his organ meat and deer ribs. 
 Mr. Durant, 26, who works in online advertising, is part of a small New York subculture whose members seek good health through a selective return to the habits of their Paleolithic ancestors. 
 Or as he and some of his friends describe themselves, they are cavemen.
 The caveman lifestyle, in Mr. Durant's interpretation, involves eating large quantities of meat and then fasting between meals to approximate the lean times that his distant ancestors faced between hunts. Vegetables and fruit are fine, but he avoids foods like bread that were unavailable before the invention of agriculture. Mr. Durant believes the human body evolved for a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, and his goal is to wean himself off what he sees as many millenniums of bad habits. 
 These urban cavemen also choose exercise routines focused on sprinting and jumping, to replicate how a prehistoric person might have fled from a mastodon. 
 In a city crowded with vegetarian restaurants and yoga studios, the cavemen defy other people's ideas of healthy living. There is an indisputable macho component to the lifestyle. 
 ''I didn't want to do some faddish diet that my sister would do,'' Mr. Durant said. 
 The caveman lifestyle in New York was once a solitary pursuit. But Mr. Durant, who looks like a cheerful Jim Morrison, with shoulder-length curly hair, has emerged over the last year as a chieftain of sorts among 10 or so other cavemen. He has cooked communal dinners in his apartment on East 90th Street and taught others to make jerky from his meat locker. 
 The tribe is not indigenous to New York. Several followers of the lifestyle took up the practice after researching health concerns online and discovering descriptions of so-called paleolithic diets and exercise programs followed by people around the country and in Europe. The group's lone woman, Melissa McEwen, 23, was searching for a treatment for stomach troubles. She started reading the blog of a 72-year-old retired economics professor who lives in Utah, Arthur De Vany. 
 Mr. De Vany's blog promotes what he calls Evolutionary Fitness. Like his disciples in New York, he believes that ancient humans could perform physical feats that would awe the gym rats of today. 
 His followers believe that he too is capable of fearsome feats. When Mr. Durant told a gathering of New York cavemen that he had seen Mr. De Vany at a seminar in Las Vegas, Matthew Sanocki, 34, asked if Mr. De Vany looked as muscular in the flesh as in pictures on his blog. 
 ''He looks great,'' Mr. Durant said. ''You feel like he could, at a moment's notice, charge at you and trample you.''
 Already, the New York cavemen are getting attention from the patriarchs of the paleo movement. One such figure, Erwan Le Corre, a Frenchman whom the magazine Men's Health said ''may rank as one of the most all-around physically fit men on the planet,'' stopped by Mr. Durant's while visiting the city in December. The men sealed their friendship with what both described as a bare-chested -- and in Mr. Le Corre's case, barefoot -- run across the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges on a frigid night. 
 Mr. Le Corre, 38, who once made soap for a living, promotes what he calls ''mouvement naturel'' at exercise retreats in West Virginia and elsewhere. His workouts include scooting around the underbrush on all fours, leaping between boulders, playing catch with stones, and other activities at which he believes early man excelled. These are the ''primal, essential skills that I believe everyone should have,'' he said in an interview. 
 Loren Cordain, a professor at Colorado State University and the author of ''The Paleo Diet,'' links the movement to a 1985 New England Journal of Medicine article, which proclaimed that the ''diet of our remote ancestors may be a reference standard for modern human nutrition.''
 Another source of paleo converts is CrossFit, a fitness program known for grueling workouts combining weightlifting and gymnastics. CrossFit trainers, who teach at more than 1,200 gyms and other affiliates across the country, generally encourage clients to follow either a caveman diet or the Zone diet, which requires tracking calories. ''Some of the gyms have hardcore paleo folks, and if you're a member of that gym then you're paleo, while other gyms are hardcore Zone,'' said Anthony Budding, who manages the content on CrossFit.com.
 Experts in early humans dispute some of the tenets of latter-day paleos, including the belief that fasting is beneficial and that the body is unequipped to handle an agriculture-based diet. 
 Still, there is a ''sharp contrast'' between the strength and fitness of our distant ancestors and us, said Clark Larsen, a physical anthropologist at Ohio State University. ''The male or female of 12,000 to 15,000 years ago will be considerably stronger and in better shape,'' he said. Unfortunately, life was short: If you made it to age 30 or so, you had done well. 
 New York might seem a challenging environment for the aspiring caveman. Entire professions, oblivious to the rising and setting of the sun, toil in the glare of computer monitors. More to the point, the city has gone so far as to outlaw both hunting and gathering, at least when committed in a city park. Uprooting a plant, snatching a bird egg or trapping a squirrel in a park are misdemeanors punishable by up to 90 days of jail. 
 ''I like New York, but it's hard to sit in a Midtown office all day,'' said Ms. McEwen, a slim brunette, who prefers the term ''hunter-gatherer'' to describe her lifestyle. 
 But the surprising consensus of the paleos is that the city is a paradise. 
 ''New York is the only city in America where you can walk,'' said Nassim Taleb, an investor who gained a measure of celebrity for his theories, described in ''The Black Swan,'' that extreme events can roil financial markets. ''People treat walking like exercise,'' he said, ''but walking is how humans become humans.''
 Mr. Taleb, who rejects the label ''caveman'' in favor of ''paleo,'' avoids offices (including his own) as much as he can. He prefers to think on the go. Dressed in a tweed coat and Italian loafers, this paleo man is a flaneur, sometimes walking miles a day, ranging from SoHo to 86th Street.
 Instead of eating three square meals a day, many of New York's cavemen fast intermittently, up to 36 hours at a stretch. Fasting is a topic of banter at the Union Square West apartment where Matthew Sanocki and his brother, Andrew, live and run design-related e-commerce Web sites.
 ''Are you going for a 24?'' Matthew might ask Andrew, describing a fast by its duration in hours. 
 Andrew Sanocki, 38, a former Navy officer, explained that he preferred working out on an empty stomach near the end of a fast, and then following up with a large meal. This is a common caveman schedule, intended to reflect the exertion that ancient humans put into finding food. It is as if, Mr. Sanocki explained, ''we've gone out and killed something, and now we have to eat it.''
 Another caveman trick involves donating blood frequently. The idea is that various hardships might have occasionally left ancient humans a pint short. Asked when he last gave blood, Andrew Sanocki said it had been three months. He and his brother looked at each other. ''We're due,'' Andrew said.
 Most of the cavemen at Mr. Durant's gatherings are lean and well-muscled, and have glowing skin. A few wear trim beards. Some claim that they no longer get sick. Several identify themselves as libertarians. 
 They regularly grumble about vegans, whom they regard as a misguided, rival tribe. But much of the conversation is spent parsing the law of the jungle. The most severe interpretations generally come from Vladimir Averbukh, a jaunty red-headed Web manager for the city who was born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Upon visiting Mr. Durant's apartment for the first time, in August, Mr. Averbukh scowled at a tomato plant on his host's roof deck.
 ''Cavemen don't eat nightshades,'' Mr. Averbukh, 29, said. He explained that tomatoes are part of the nightshade family, arguing that they are native to the New World and could not have been part of humanity's earliest diet. Mr. Durant shrugged. (Mr. Durant said later that there was nothing uncavemannish about eating tomatoes.) 
 Mr. Averbukh is a pre-Promethean sort of caveman. Much of his nourishment comes from grass-fed ground beef, which he eats raw. In a bow to the times, he sometimes uses a fork.
 The other cavemen in New York find Mr. Averbukh's preference for raw beef a little strange. 
 ''I draw the line at sushi,'' Andrew Sanocki said. ''Paleo man had fire, didn't he?''
 Beyond Mr. Durant's tribe, it is likely that other New Yorkers are practicing a milder, diet-focused version of the lifestyle. An Upper East Side physician, Grant Macaulay, said he has recommended the diet to hundreds of his patients, and sends them to Barnes & Noble to buy a copy of Mr. Cordain's ''Paleo Diet.''
 But these computer-savvy cavemen are not interested in living off the grid, like others who share their ambivalence toward the indoor life. And their eating and exercise habits aside, the cavemen say they have no nostalgia for the prehistoric world. 
 Mr. Averbukh, who drives around town in a red Smart Car, said the thought of ''throwing yourself in the forest with a stick and seeing how long you survive'' held no appeal. 
 The cavemen are happy in the modern world, they say, but simply want to regain the fortitude that they attribute to their ancient ancestors.
 ''The problem is that as soon as we get out of our temperature-controlled environments, we're weak,'' Mr. Durant said. ''Where's that wildness that allowed humans to flourish throughout history?'' 
 With this view of humanity's past, what does Mr. Durant see in his future? One idea is a restaurant called B.C. or Wild. Just in case he develops the right business model, Mr. Durant has bought the domain name hunter-gatherer.com.

HEADLINE: Street Corners Vs. Cul de Sacs

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
REAL estate agents often chant the mantra ''location, location, location,'' which essentially means ''find a home in a well-kept neighborhood with good schools and a low crime rate.'' 
 Some may cite a fourth factor, ''walkability,'' a concept supported by self-styled ''new urbanists'' who advocate denser cities designed for the pedestrian and mass transit as much as for the car. In their ideal neighborhood, you could walk to a bookstore and then to an ice cream shop, and your children could walk to school, probably unescorted. (It sounds like so many movie depictions of America in the 1950s.)
 They argue that walkability lowers crime -- that good people on the streets drive away the bad guys -- and that it generally improves life and sharply raises home values. Whether it helps homes retain their value when the market slumps, however, seems a harder question to answer. 
 A study published in August by C.E.O.'s for Cities, a group of urban redevelopment advocates, found that in many ways, the street corner beats the cul de sac. It looked at the sales of 90,000 homes in 15 markets to estimate how much value was associated with something called the Walk Score. Using a 100-point scale, this score rates the number of destinations, including libraries, parks and coffee shops, within walking distance of a home.
 The scores for America's 40 largest cities can be found at Walkscore.com by typing in an address. For instance, the White House scores a near-perfect 97: a ''walker's paradise,'' the Web site says. Another famous home, the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles, rates a 25. (You can get lost in Walkscore.com for hours; the ''Brady Bunch'' house, the exemplar of 1970s suburban life, scores an above-average 75.) 
 The study found that houses with above-average Walk Scores commanded a premium. It was as much as $30,000 in cities like Charlotte, N.C., Chicago, Sacramento and San Francisco, wrote Joe Cortright, the study's author and an economist at Impresa, a consulting firm in Portland, Ore.
 The correlation failed to hold in 2 of the 15 cities studied -- Bakersfield, Calif., and Las Vegas, where housing prices decreased in walkable neighborhoods.
 So far, there is no definitive study concluding that the more walkable neighborhoods hold their value better when the real estate market declines. But Mr. Cortright wrote in a study done a year earlier for the same group that the spike in gasoline prices in 2005 popped the housing bubble. He found that distant suburbs had the largest declines in home values, while prices in ''close in'' neighborhoods, typically those that were the most walkable, held up or, in a few cases, increased.
 He cited an example in the Chicago area where a suburban home worth the same as a close-in home in 2006 had declined in price, relative to the city home, by $66,000 in 12 months.
 More definitive answers may be found in the mountain of data accumulated by new online companies involved in real estate. Academics who once had to choose between stale government data or aggregated sales information from the National Association of Realtors can now sift through detailed neighborhood information almost as soon as a ''Sold'' sign goes up on the lawn. 
 The Impresa study used data from Zip, an online real estate listing service. Zillow.com, a Web site that tracks home values, is amassing considerable data useful for consumers and researchers alike. For example, it tracks home values by ZIP codes and in some cities -- like Seattle, where Zillow is based -- by well-defined neighborhoods.
 Google, whose search query data has been used to track trends and even flu epidemics, is also starting to accumulate real estate sales data. Academics haven't yet published definitive studies using these new sources of information. But Stan Humphries, Zillow's chief economist, recently used the firm's data to show that, in most cities, low-end homes fell in value far more than those on the high end. He also found that high-end homes had fallen prey to foreclosure.
 MR. HUMPHRIES is also looking for other trends to tease out of the data, taking a stab, for example, at examining how home prices are related to proximity. He can personally relate to this. He lives in Sammamish, an eastern suburb of Seattle with a Walk Score of 29, where average home values are down 21 percent from their peak in 2007. Prices fell 14 percent in the centrally located Green Lake neighborhood of Seattle, with a score of about 89 -- a decline comparable to that of other more urban neighborhoods of the city.
 Using Zillow data, he looked at concentric circles of major metropolitan areas and, with some exceptions, it held true that property values closer to the city center held up. One anomaly is Detroit, where neighborhoods near the city center have been devastated by population loss, which in turn has bred fires, vandalism and crime. 
 Yet the lesson of buying close-in, he said, is becoming pretty clear: ''If you are a rational actor trying to maximize your dollar, you may have to pay more.''

HEADLINE: Prisoners Of Parole

BYLINE: By JEFFREY ROSEN. 
Jeffrey Rosen, a law professor at George Washington University, is a frequent contributor to the magazine. He is at work on a book about Louis Brandeis.

 BODY:
IN 2004, STEVEN ALM, a state trial judge in Hawaii, was frustrated with the cases on his docket. Nearly half of the people appearing before him were convicted offenders with drug problems who had been sentenced to probation rather than prison and then repeatedly violated the terms of that probation by missing appointments or testing positive for drugs. Whether out of neglect or leniency, probation officers would tend to overlook a probationer's first 5 or 10 violations, giving the offender the impression that he could ignore the rules. But eventually, the officers would get fed up and recommend that Alm revoke probation and send the offender to jail to serve out his sentence. That struck Alm as too harsh, but the alternative -- winking at probation violations -- struck him as too soft. ''I thought, This is crazy, this is a crazy way to change people's behavior,'' he told me recently. 
 So Alm decided to try something different. He reasoned that if the offenders knew that a probation violation would lead immediately to some certain punishment, they might shape up. ''I thought, What did I do when my son was young?'' he recalled. ''If he misbehaved, I talked to him and warned him, and if he disregarded the warning, I gave him some kind of consequence right away.'' Working with U.S. marshals and local police, Alm arranged for a new procedure: if offenders tested positive for drugs or missed an appointment, they would be arrested within hours and most would have a hearing within 72 hours. Those who were found to have violated probation would be quickly sentenced to a short jail term proportionate to the severity of the violation -- typically a few days.
 Alm mentioned his plan to the public defender, who suggested that it was only fair to warn probationers that the rules were going to be strictly enforced for the first time. Alm agreed, and on Oct. 1, 2004, he held a hearing for 18 sex offenders, followed by another one for 16 drug offenders. Brandishing a laminated ''Wanted'' poster, he told them: ''I can guarantee that everyone in this courtroom wants you to succeed on probation, but you have not been cutting it. From now on, you're going to follow all the rules of probation, and if you don't, you're going to be arrested on the spot and spend some time in jail right away.'' He called the program HOPE, for Hawaii's Opportunity Probation With Enforcement, and prepared himself for a flood of violation hearings.
 But they never materialized. There were only three hearings in the first week, two in the second week and none in the third. The HOPE program was so successful that it inspired scholars to evaluate its methods. Within a six-month period, the rate of positive drug tests fell by 93 percent for HOPE probationers, compared with a fall of 14 percent for probationers in a comparison group. 
 Alm had stumbled onto an effective strategy for keeping people out of prison, one that puts a fresh twist on some venerable ideas about deterrence. Classical deterrence theory has long held that the threat of a mild punishment imposed reliably and immediately has a much greater deterrent effect than the threat of a severe punishment that is delayed and uncertain. Recent work in behavioral economics has helped to explain this phenomenon: people are more sensitive to the immediate than the slightly deferred future and focus more on how likely an outcome is than how bad it is. In the course of implementing HOPE, Alm discovered another reason why the strategy works: people are most likely to obey the law when they're subject to punishments they perceive as legitimate, fair and consistent, rather than arbitrary and capricious. ''When the system isn't consistent and predictable, when people are punished randomly, they think, My probation officer doesn't like me, or, Someone's prejudiced against me,'' Alm told me, ''rather than seeing that everyone who breaks a rule is treated equally, in precisely the same way.''
 Judge Alm's story is an example of a new approach to keeping people out of prison that is being championed by some of the most innovative scholars studying deterrence today. At its core, the approach focuses on establishing the legitimacy of the criminal-justice system in the eyes of those who have run afoul of it or are likely to. Promising less crime and less punishment, this approach includes elements that should appeal to liberals (it doesn't rely on draconian prison sentences) and to conservatives (it stresses individual choice and moral accountability). But at a time when the size of the U.S. prison population is increasingly seen as unsustainable for both budgetary and moral reasons -- the United States represents 5 percent of the world's population and nearly 25 percent of the world's prison population -- the fact that this approach seems to work may be its biggest draw. 
 The HOPE program, if widely adopted as a model for probation and parole reform, could make a surprisingly large contribution to reducing the prison population. In many states, the majority of prison admissions come not from arrests for new crimes, as you might think, but from probation and parole violations. Nationwide, roughly two-thirds of parolees fail to complete parole successfully. Todd Clear, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, estimates that by eliminating imprisonment across the nation for technical parole violations, reducing the length of parole supervision and ratcheting back prison sentences to their 1988 levels, the United States could reduce its prison population by 50 percent.
 Some in government are beginning to take notice. In November, invoking the HOPE program as a model, the Democratic congressman Adam Schiff of California and his Republican colleague Ted Poe of Texas introduced legislation in the House that would create federal grants for states to experiment with courts that deliver swift, predictable and moderate punishment for those who violate probation. 
 There also appears to be a national audience for a broader conversation about new ways to shrink the prison population. Last year, a three-judge panel in California ordered the overcrowded state prison system -- the largest in the country, with more than 170,000 prisoners at its peak -- to reduce the inmate population by tens of thousands of prisoners within two years in order to comply with constitutional standards for medical and mental health care. Facing a tightening budget crisis in September, California legislators added to the pressure by demanding a reduction in the prison budget of $1.2 billion. In the U.S. Senate, Jim Webb of Virginia is leading a crusade for prison reform, insisting that fewer jail terms for nonviolent offenders can make America safer and more humane, while also saving money. And in the Obama administration, Attorney General Eric Holder is questioning the value of relentlessly expanding prisons. In July, he declared that ''high rates of incarceration have tremendous social costs'' and ''diminishing marginal returns.''
 The most effective way to shrink the prison population, of course, is not just to reform probation and parole but also to deter groups of potential lawbreakers from committing crimes in the first place. If, in addition to bringing down the numbers of probation and parole revocations, police officers and judges could also address the core problems of drug arrests and street violence, the United States might even be said to have solved its notorious prison problem. Is such an ambitious goal possible? While it might sound too good to be true, the HOPE-style thinking about deterrence offers a promising road map for addressing all these challenges.
 ALTHOUGH HE ACTED on his own, Judge Alm did not design the HOPE program without inspiration. In the mid-1990s, when he was a U.S. attorney in Hawaii, Alm heard a presentation by David M. Kennedy, who is considered the patron saint of the new thinking about deterrence. Kennedy, who now teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, spoke about Operation Ceasefire, a program he was designing to reduce youth violence in Boston. Along with his colleagues Anne M. Piehl and Anthony Braga, Kennedy worked with the head of the Youth Violence Strike Force, a division of the Boston Police Department. The police officer explained that while conventional deterrence hadn't worked, he had begun to persuade gangs to behave by issuing a credible threat: namely, that when a gang attracted attention with notorious acts of violence, the entire gang -- all of whose members likely had outstanding warrants or probation, parole or traffic violations -- would be rounded up.
 Kennedy recalls this today as a breakthrough moment in his thinking. Ever since the days of Cesare Beccaria, the 18th-century philosopher and death-penalty opponent, classical deterrence theorists had focused on credibly threatening individuals; Kennedy's first innovation was to focus on increasing the legitimacy of law enforcement in the eyes of groups. ''The legitimacy element has risen in my mind from being an important element of the strategy to the most important element,'' Kennedy told me. Convinced that the best way to increase legitimacy was to enlist what he calls the ''community's moral voice,'' Kennedy set out to deter the most dangerous young gang members by persuading their friends and neighbors to pressure them into obeying the law.
 In May 1996, Kennedy, Piehl and Braga helped to design the first of what came to be known as ''call-in'' sessions, intended to put gangs on notice that they would face swift and certain punishments. Working with Kennedy, probation and parole officers ordered gang members to attend face-to-face meetings with the police. The gang members were given three warnings. First, they were told that if anyone in their group killed someone, the entire group would suffer consequences. Second, the gang members were told that if they want to escape from street life, they could get help and job training from social service agencies and churches. And finally, they heard from members of their community that violence was wrong and it had to stop. The results of the forums were striking and immediate. Within two years, youth violence in Boston fell by two-thirds and city homicide rates by about half. 
 Why was Operation Ceasefire so effective? One reason was that the warning hearings gave the gang members a sense of what to expect. Increasingly draconian sentences don't always reduce crime, and sometimes increase it. (After increasing in the 1980s, crime fell by 25 percent in the 1990s, but states that put more people in jail had a smaller decline than states that imprisoned fewer.) In part, this is because many people actually don't know the punishments they face.
 In addition to offering knowledge, Operation Ceasefire provided certainty. The small numbers of gang members singled out meant they could trust that the police would be able to follow through on their threats. ''If you can get people to behave by threatening them credibly, you'll need less actual punishment than if you let them run wild and punish only occasionally,'' says Mark A. R. Kleiman, author of the new book ''When Brute Force Fails: How to Have Less Crime and Less Punishment.'' Kleiman, whom Alm consulted soon after initiating the HOPE program, became interested in swift, certain and moderate punishment when he was a colleague of Kennedy's years before. Lastly, Operation Ceasefire gave gang members an incentive to obey the law by promising that they would get positive reinforcement from their families and neighbors for changing their behavior.
 In all of this, Kennedy's insights were supported by a variety of recent research suggesting that people are more likely to obey the law when they view law enforcement as fair and legitimate. Tom Tyler, a psychology professor at New York University, has found that compliance with court orders is highest for offenders who perceive that they have experienced a fair process. And in a recent book, ''American Homicide,'' the Ohio State University historian Randolph Roth argues that throughout American history, the homicide rate has decreased when people trust that the government is stable and unbiased and believe in the legitimacy of the officials who run it. Similarly, the legal scholar Paul Butler argues in his new book, ''Let's Get Free: A Hip-Hop Theory of Justice,'' that widespread incarceration in the 1980s and '90s undermined the legitimacy of law enforcement in the eyes of the affected communities by converting a prison term into something heroic rather than stigmatic. 
 After Operation Ceasefire, Kennedy turned his attention from gangs to open-air drug markets. He set out to change how the criminal-justice system was viewed from the perspective of the offenders and their communities -- and how the offenders and their communities were viewed by the police. As Kennedy told me, ''I saw law enforcement believing plausible but untrue things about the communities they police'' -- namely, that the communities were corrupt and didn't care about the violence that was destroying them -- ''and the communities believing untrue things about the police'' -- namely, that the cops were part of a racist conspiracy to lock up black offenders while overlooking white ones. 
 To correct what he calls a ''corrosive and tragic mistake,'' Kennedy came up with the idea of a kind of truth-and-reconciliation commission in which offenders would talk to the police accompanied by the people they trusted the most: their mothers. In 2003, working with James Fealy, the police chief in High Point, N.C., Kennedy arranged some preliminary meetings. Although Fealy had been shocked to learn that the community thought he and his officers were almost as bad as the drug dealers, Fealy, in turn, surprised community members by declaring that no one in law enforcement thought the drug war could be won. 
 These meetings prepared the groundwork for the strategy that followed. After identifying 16 active drug dealers, Fealy arrested four and then prepared warrants for the other 12 that could be signed whenever the police chose. He then called in the other dealers, nine of whom arrived accompanied by their mothers and other ''influentials'' like grandmothers, and delivered the following message to them as a group: ''You could be in jail tonight. We don't want to do that, we want to help you succeed, but you are out of the drug business.'' The mothers and grandmothers, seemingly impressed by the decision not to arrest, cheered on the police. In subsequent meetings, the ''influentials'' shouted down naysayers, including a conspiracymonger who accused the C.I.A. of having created the crack epidemic to oppress black people. The drug market in the area dried up. 
 IN ADDITION TO influencing Judge Alm's probation reform, Kennedy's efforts to rethink deterrence have also inspired one of the most powerful recent models for national parole reform, which comes from Tracey Meares, a law professor at Yale. (Unlike probation, which involves a sentence instead of prison, parole involves supervision after part of the prison sentence has been served.) In 2002, Meares, who was then a law professor at the University of Chicago, was asked by the U.S. attorney in Chicago, Patrick Fitzgerald, to analyze how best to address crime in the city. She concluded that they should begin on the West Side, in West Garfield Park and the surrounding area, where rates of murder and gun violence were more than four times the city average. Fitzgerald suggested that they might implement a version of Project Exile, a controversial program in Virginia that sought to deter gun violence by threatening federal prosecutions -- and a five-year mandatory minimum sentence -- for repeat offenders convicted of illegal gun possession. But Project Exile had experienced only mixed success: federal prosecutors could prosecute only a small proportion of the gun cases submitted by the Richmond police. The threat of a severe sentence was, in effect, something of a bluff. 
 Meares told Fitzgerald that threats of zero tolerance wouldn't work because they simply weren't credible. Instead, Meares argued that law-enforcement officials should concentrate on specific groups of wrongdoers in ways they could accept as both reasonable and fair. Using Operation Ceasefire in Boston as a model, Meares identified everyone who had committed violent or gun-related crimes and had been released from prison and recently assigned to parole. She gathered them in random groups of no more than 20 for call-in sessions in what Meares calls ''places of civic importance'' -- park buildings, local schools and libraries -- where they sat at the same table as the police in order to create an egalitarian, nonconfrontational atmosphere. They then heard a version of Kennedy's three-part presentation. The results of the program were drastic: there was a 37 percent drop in the average monthly homicide rate -- the largest drop of any neighborhood in the city. Violent crime in Chicago today is at a 30 year low. ''All these strategies are a way of signaling to groups of people that government agents view them with dignity, neutrality and trust, which is the best way of convincing them that the government has the right to hold them accountable for their behavior,'' Meares told me. 
 From Kennedy and Kleiman to Alm and Meares, the judges and scholars developing new deterrence strategies are changing the way we think about parole, probation, gang violence and drug markets. But the strategies also present a rare opportunity to persuade the nation's policymakers that the most urgent case for prison reform is not only economic but also moral and practical. Yes, it's an outrage that the United States locks up citizens for so long with such uncertain effect; but it's also self-defeating, because long sentences give rise to a crisis of legitimacy that can lead to more crime, not less.
 A crisis of legitimacy may sound like a huge, perhaps intractable problem, but the tantalizing promise of the new deterrence thinking is that the crisis can actually be solved, practical step by practical step. The relative simplicity of the solutions, it turns out, is at the core of their radical potential.

HEADLINE: In Bonds, A Balance Of Risk And Yields

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
MANY Americans have grown up with the mantra that their investment portfolio should hold an increasingly large percentage of bonds as they age. The theory is simple: bonds provide both security and income as people retire and need money to cover their living expenses.
 That approach suggests, for example, that a 60-year-old investor should have an asset allocation that might include as much as 60 percent bonds -- and so on up the age ladder. 
 Such a strategy is still valid in the long term, but could be problematic in today's uncertain economic climate. The specter of troubled municipal governments unable to meet their obligations, and the threat of rising interest rates, have made bond investing particularly tricky. 
 An investor in search of security today has to accept such a low yield that a number of financial advisers are worried that bonds won't generate enough income for retirees. Some are advising that portfolios contain a smaller portion of bonds than they did a year or so ago.
 For many people, ''this has to be one of the most frustrating interest rate environments, because the yields are so low that you have to be careful not to just reach out and take on more risk just to get a better yield,'' said Edward Yardeni, an investment strategist.
 ''Clearly, he added, ''that can be a quick way to lose money.''
 Seth J. Masters, who oversees asset allocation for AllianceBernstein, said that some of today's views on the importance of bonds for personal investing stem from the 1950s, when life expectancies were shorter. 
 The fact that people are living longer is ''a wonderful thing,'' he said, ''but it is a real challenge because you are looking at 24 to 30 years of retirement.''
 ''If you have the bulk of your savings in bonds with today's interest rates,'' he added, ''you have a smoother path to a dismal result.''
 Laszlo Birinyi Jr., president of Birinyi Associates, a stock market research firm, finds it more appropriate to be in stocks than bonds because the yields are limited. ''This is the first time I have been so opposed to bonds because the levels of returns are so microscopic,'' he said. 
 The problem, though, is that by holding stocks rather than bonds, investors may be raising the level of risk in their portfolio. But even those who like bonds are being more cautious. 
 ''Stop looking for income and look for cash flow,'' said Harold Evensky, a partner at Evensky & Katz Wealth Management in Coral Gables, Fla. He says he thinks that people who need money to live on each year should consider the total return of the portfolio, including capital gains, and not focus solely on dividends and interest.
 ''People need cash flow that will grow with inflation,'' he said. ''Bond interest rates do not, and dividends may or may not.''
 As for the bond component of the portfolio, ''we are getting more defensive and keeping shorter-duration funds,'' he said. ''We are also more concerned about quality: we used to say we wanted A-rated bonds. Now we generally want double-A-rated bonds or better.'' 
 For taxable accounts, Mr. Evensky likes Vanguard Short Term Tax Exempt and T. Rowe Price Summit Municipal Intermediate, among others. For tax-free accounts, he uses the BlackRock Low Duration fund and the Pimco Total Return fund. 
 Mr. Yardeni believes in a mix of high-quality bonds and dividend-yielding stocks. And while he thinks that municipals are relatively safe, he strongly favors revenue bonds, like those issued for roads or bridges that charge tolls, so that there is a dedicated stream of income to make interest payments.
 General obligation bonds are tied to the creditworthiness of a municipal government and have typically been viewed as safe. But he worries about the fiscal soundness of some municipalities in this recession. 
 Alexander Anderson Jr., a money manager at Envision Capital Management, which buys individual bonds for its clients, looks for bonds with final maturities of six years or less and ratings in the municipal universe of A+ or better and triple B or better for corporate bonds.
 ''You have to be cautious about locking up money in longer-term bonds,'' he said. ''Rising interest rates will diminish the value of those bonds.''
 Some financial advisers are willing to take a bit more risk with municipal bonds. 
 JASON T. THOMAS, chief investment officer at Aspiriant, a wealth management firm in Los Angeles, says he likes the Nuveen High Yield Municipal Bond fund, which holds municipal bonds with an average rating of triple B. 
 In Mr. Thomas's view, people are too worried about state and local government finances.
 ''When they get scared, they run and buy short-term, high-quality bonds'' when they could be getting higher returns. He says he believes that Nuveen has the best municipal bond credit analysis team, and that the ability to evaluate risk is key. 
 Ann Rutledge, a principal at R & R Consulting in New York, cautions people to talk to their advisers about the bond issues they are buying and, if possible, to do their own research. She said ratings ''may be stale and not reflect updated credit information.'' 
 For example, she said, be sure to try to understand how a bond issuer makes money.
 ''If a lot of that information is in the footnotes, that is a bad sign,'' Ms. Rutledge said. 
 Much more information is now available on debt issues than in the past, she pointed out. Last summer, EMMA: Electronic Municipal Mark Access began providing free, up-to-date financial filings on almost all of the 1.2 million debt issues outstanding, as well as details on trades in specific bonds going back five years. 
 Whereas Mr. Evensky and Mr. Thomas like some corporate bond funds, Ms. Rutledge advises sticking with specific municipal bonds. She says that to build a diversified fixed-income portfolio, investors need detailed information about the financial health of individual companies, which is often hard to find. It is particularly difficult now, when the overall economy is weak. 
 ''There are probably some great opportunities in corporate debt funds,'' she said, ''but if you don't know the company, don't do it.''

HEADLINE: Oops, There Go The Tail Winds

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IN hindsight, it makes perfect sense that equities started to surge last March. 
 Stocks often move in anticipation of shifts in the economy -- they've generally rallied four to six months before recessions have ended. By the third quarter of last year, the economy was expanding again. It picked up steam toward the end of the year, validating the market's earlier optimism. 
 But move to the present. If the market is a predictor of economic trends, investors are now handicapping the performance of the economy and corporate profits in the spring and summer of this year. On that count, the market seems to be predicting bumps ahead. 
 For example, even though the Standard & Poor's 500 index of blue-chip stocks soared 62 percent from early March to mid-October, the rally has slowed. Since Oct. 15, the S.& P. 500 has risen by a more modest 4 percent.
 Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston, says he still expects equities to advance at the beginning of the year. But ''somewhere between January and June, the rally will probably peter out,'' he said.
 He added that ''it may be the opposite of 2009, which started off falling sharply -- much like the market did in 2008 -- only to bottom out and rally for the remainder of the year.'' Only this time, the market may reverse course by going lower later in the year.
 Why are some strategists predicting a potential pullback? For starters, the good economic news that spurred 2009's rally is expected to moderate as the year progresses.
 That's not to say the economy -- or for that matter, Wall Street -- will turn outright bearish. But the bullish case is not expected to be so clear.
 Consider gross domestic product. Last year, investors focused on directional change. In the second half of 2009, the economy is believed to have grown at an annual rate of roughly 3 percent, after contracting at an annual rate of more than 6 percent in the first quarter.
 But the euphoria is starting to die down. A recent survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia indicates that forecasters expect the rate of economic growth to slow somewhat this year -- to 2.3 percent in the first quarter and 2.4 percent in the second. 
 Moreover, in dollar terms, the economy is still smaller than it was at the end of 2007.
 The outlook is similar on the corporate profit front. 
 Last year, investors focused on forecasts that S.& P. 500 earnings would grow nearly 200 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009, versus the same period in 2008. But that stunning growth rate is expected to come down to earth in 2010.
 S.& P. 500 profits are projected to rise around 38 percent for the first quarter, 23 percent for the second quarter, and 22 percent for the third, according to John Butters, director for United States earnings at Thomson Reuters. 
 To be sure, earnings growth above 20 percent is still well above the norm. But in dollar terms, corporate earnings are expected to be lower in the third quarter than they were in the same period in 2006.
 Another concern is that some of the tail winds that propelled stocks in 2009 -- including government stimulus spending around the world -- are expected to reverse course later this year.
 ''The market could start to run into some of those head winds around the second quarter,'' said Timothy W. Hayes, chief investment strategist at Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla.
 Mr. Hayes says that if stock prices continue to climb at the start of the year, rising optimism and equity valuations may leave the market more vulnerable to bad news, like the threat of rising interest rates.
 Already, long-term market interest rates have begun to climb, with the yield on 10-year Treasury notes up to 3.79 percent, from 3.20 percent at the start of December.
 And central banks around the world are expected to start raising short-term rates as their economies recover and inflation fears surface. 
 For its part, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it expects that rates can stay low for ''an extended period.'' Right now, the markets seem to be betting that a rate increase may occur as early as August.
 But Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at the Charles Schwab brokerage firm, says, ''I wouldn't be surprised if it happens a little sooner than that.''
 IF that's the case, many market strategists think that the market could suffer a setback. Mr. Kleintop at LPL Financial is betting that the S.& P. 500 could surge to around 1,250 early this year, which would represent a gain of about 9 percent from current levels. But he thinks that the market could give back about half those gains in a correction toward the end of the year.
 Be careful what you wish for, Mr. Kleintop said. Last year, investors were praying for better-than-expected economic news. But now that a recovery may be at hand, they are beginning to fear the consequences: less fiscal stimulus from governments around the world, coupled with rising rates.

HEADLINE: Seeking Greener Pastures

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: generationb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
PERRI CESARELLI gets up at 5:30 a.m., takes the dog out, eats breakfast, showers, dresses, then, at 7:05 walks the 12 minutes to the train station in Little Neck, N.Y., leaving herself a five-minute buffer before catching the 7:22 into Manhattan.
 She's 46, and for a dozen years has worked for a hedge fund, where she's now the office manager. It's a job that pays a solid middle-class wage ($66,500 a year) and that she enjoys (''something new every day''). If she's lucky she's on the 6:24 home, and walks in the door by 7:15.
She expects her husband, Joseph, to have dinner ready -- he's unemployed and spends his days at home. But too often he hasn't prepared anything, and though she's not proud of this, she gets angry, or almost as bad, it breaks her heart. 
 Her husband feels terrible about it, too. He's 56, has been looking for work for over two years and says some days he just can't bear it. ''Some days I'm so depressed I don't want to do anything,'' he said. ''The hard part about this -- I've always considered myself a survivor, always been able to find work I liked.''
 His bachelor's degree is in biology, and he spent six years as a research assistant at Columbia University and the American Museum of Natural History. He loves theater, and in the '80s and '90s worked on Broadway in the wardrobe union. He taught himself computer skills and became a programmer/analyst for Prudential Securities, making $56,000 a year by 2001.
 But after 9/11, Prudential downsized, moving its back offices from lower Manhattan to New Jersey. In 2002, Mr. Cesarelli was let go. He had several jobs after that, but none that he much liked and none that paid close to his old salary. And since the recession, he's had none at all. ''I was a person who could pick himself up and do anything, but I'm not so sure I'm good at that anymore,'' he said. ''Sometimes I get so anxious and depressed.''
 It has strained the marriage. ''Two years without him working, it's a shock,'' said Ms. Cesarelli. ''Both my parents worked and both Joseph's parents. I never thought I'd be a sole breadwinner. Not what I thought life would be. Certainly not what Joseph wanted. Not what he was working towards.''
 ''Not what I wanted,'' Mr. Cesarelli said.
 It's been called a mancession, but the misery is spread pretty evenly. Mr. Cesarelli is mired in a bad demographic. In December, 11 percent of men were out of work versus 8.8 percent of women, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In Mr. Cesarelli's field, computers, 100,000 jobs have been lost in the last two years. And once a middle-aged person loses a job, it takes longer to be rehired. In December, jobless workers over 45 were unemployed an average of 33.4 weeks, versus 26.8 weeks for younger workers.
 ''Baby boomers grew up believing if we worked hard and applied ourselves, it would work out,'' Mr. Cesarelli said. ''Well, it didn't. Everything collapsed around me.''
 Mr. Cesarelli met his wife in 1993 at the Esquire court reporting company, where they occupied nearby cubicles. She had just ended a bad marriage; he was in the process of splitting up with his longtime live-in girlfriend.
 Ms.: ''After a divorce, I wasn't sure how serious I wanted to be.''
 Mr.: ''We never went out on dates. We'd take long walks.''
 Ms.: ''Midtown to the Battery.''
 Mr.: ''Talk and talk. They say successful relationships are based on communication. Ever meet somebody that you just liked -- just so many things about her?''
 She asked him out.
 Ms.: ''He was shy. It was a couple of months before he kissed me. What I liked about Joseph -- he was a nice guy, he was polite, good looking, older. Most guys I met my age were insufferable.'' They enjoyed movies, theater, books, concerts. He belonged to a medieval re-enactment group and took lessons to learn to ride horses, care for them and joust at the fairs.
 In 1997, they celebrated their wedding at a re-enactment fair. In 1999, they bought a small three-bedroom house in Queens for $225,000, taking out a 5.8-percent 30-year mortgage. ''We never did that adjustable rate thing,'' Ms. Cesarelli said. ''We're very careful people.''
 After Prudential, Mr. Cesarelli's only full-time job was selling men's clothing for Lord & Taylor for three years. When a training program there did not lead to a management position, he said he decided to leave. ''I came home and talked to Perri. I said: 'I can't do this anymore. I'm not getting anywhere.' She said, 'Then quit.' Probably a mistake. I didn't have anything else.''
 He's spent the Great Recession failing at all forms of job-hunting -- agencies, job boards, temp services, job fairs, networking.
 ''I'll say to him, 'You could try the agencies again,' '' Ms. Cesarelli said. ''He says, 'I've tried four times.' You feel you could always do more, but the way things are now, who knows.''
 ''This joblessness feels like a virus,'' she said. ''Walking on streets and subways, you hear people talking about what happened to them, sad stories. Believe me, I know we're lucky to have our house, food on the table, a car. If you heard someone was out of work two years -- you would've gasped. Now it doesn't shock us. People are so tired and overwhelmed and beaten down.''
 The things they loved while courting have been cut out. ''I can't remember the last time we went to the theater,'' she said.
 ''Or out to dinner,'' he said.
 Talking, once effortless, is now painful.
 ''It's hard for him to talk about it,'' she said.
 ''It's hard for you, too,'' he said.
 She worries he's depressed, and he counters that for 50 years he never suffered depression, that he doesn't need medication or therapy, he needs a job. ''Plus we can't afford therapy,'' Mr. Cesarelli said.
 ''It is one thing my insurance is not great about,'' Ms. Cesarelli said.
 About two years ago, to fight the despair, Mr. Cesarelli increased his time volunteering from weekends to seven days, 20 hours a week, caring for the medieval society's three horses, stabled nearby at the Sands Point Preserve on the North Shore of Long Island. ''Gives me a reason to wake up,'' he said. One recent morning, he arrived at the barn at 9:30 and went straight to work, feeding the horses their oats, changing their water, spreading hay across the pasture, then taking Eli, Monte and Gunther out to graze. The temperature was just 23 degrees, but it was sunny and still; within an hour, sweat was trickling down his face. ''Feels good to work,'' he said.
 At a time in his life when he doesn't have much to say to people, he's grateful for the horses' company. ''I consider this a sign of my mental health,'' he said, heading back to muck the stalls. ''If I were depressed, I couldn't function. The horses' health wouldn't matter to me.''
 Mr. Cesarelli tries not to become too eager about it, but he recently heard of an opening for a barn manager and interviewed for the position. ''Ever had an experience that seems like everything you've done for 20 years has led to this moment?'' he said. ''My knowledge of horses, computers, my biology studies. Of course, after all I've been through, I have to consider what it will do to me if I don't get it.''
 He hopes to hear soon.
 After finishing the stalls, he drove home, showered, changed into clean clothes. When his wife walked in from work that night, she was happy to see he'd fixed them a nice dinner ofchicken, roast potatoes and corn.

HEADLINE: Optimism About the New Year

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
SO is it over? The three-year period of unrelenting home price declines: has it stopped? And is it possible that sales prices will go the other way in 2010?
 Excited by brisk business in some locales even during the traditionally slow holidays, a few real estate brokers began blurting out such hopes. 
 ''I think the change in direction is starting to happen,'' said Ken Baris, the president of Jordan Baris Realty, after selling a West Orange colonial, a Livingston split-level and a Newark condominium -- all for full price, or nearly -- during the week between Christmas and New Year's Day. He quickly added a caveat: ''Maybe values will drop again before they go up.'' But then came an addendum to that: ''I feel confident they will rise.'' 
 Statistically speaking, there are grounds for modest optimism that prices will trend upward in the near future, said the market analyst Jeffrey Otteau, whose Otteau Valuation Group continuously tracks sales data in 21 counties for real estate companies.
 Mr. Otteau cited one recent report indicating that New Jersey was one of a half dozen ''breakout'' states in which prices had already begun to creep up in the second half of 2009. That report came from the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which indexes purchase prices of homes with mortgages guaranteed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.
 Looking at data from the entire period of the slide -- the start of 2006 through the third quarter of 2009 -- Mr. Otteau concluded that the state's residential market ''didn't get hammered all that bad'' compared with the nation at large, and was likely to recover faster. 
 Similarly, the parts of the state that suffered the least decline in prices are the ones most likely to bounce back the fastest, Mr. Otteau said.
 The median home price declined 12.4 percent statewide over the three years, to $289,275 from $330,331, by the Otteau Group calculations. Two northwestern New Jersey counties, Sussex and Hunterdon, got hit much harder than the average, both experiencing declines of more than 20 percent, which various analysts have ascribed to sparser development, smaller population and greater distance from job centers.
 Back when home prices were at their highest, buyers had started to ''push west'' to those counties, trading longer commutes for affordability, said James Bednar, who writes a blog on state real estate at njrereport.com. With the general decline in prices during the past few years, ''demand to move to those western counties has dropped,'' said Mr. Bednar, whose online self-description is ''Grim.''
 In Hudson County, by contrast, median purchase prices fell just 2.6 percent, peak to trough. The pace of sales pace slowed sharply over the three-year period, even as thousands of new, high-end condominiums came on the market. But Hudson's proximity to Manhattan jobs bolstered values, as it has for the 30 years, since waterfront area redevelopment began west of the river.
 In Essex, Somerset, Mercer, Camden, Atlantic and Salem counties, prices declined 5 to 10 percent.
 In Bergen, Union, Monmouth and Gloucester counties, the decline was 10 to 15 percent.
 Besides Sussex and Hunterdon, the hardest-hit counties -- with declines between 15 and 20 percent -- were Passaic, Morris and Warren, in the northern part of the state; Ocean and Burlington in central Jersey; and Cape May at the southern tip.
 ''Every county has its own story,'' said Mr. Otteau, noting that Cape May is heavy with resort properties and second homes, which do not sell well during a recession, and that intense redevelopment efforts in the more urbanized areas of Essex and Camden counties probably helped minimize price declines there
 Several brokers said they did not even think of real estate markets in terms of county lines. Perri K. Feldman, an agent with Keller Williams Realty, sees her primary turf as being towns running along the Midtown Direct Train line from Morristown to South Orange (Morris to Essex County).
 Prices rose in that area late in 2009, Mrs. Feldman said; she originally saw a rush to meet the Nov. 30 deadline to ensure eligibility for a federal income tax credit. That federal stimulus program has since been extended; now buyers have until April 30 to enter into a contract for a new primary residence and June 30 to close on the home.
 Cumberland County actually saw its median sales price rise during the market slump years, but Mr. Otteau called that an anomaly, ''based on its comparatively small population and the county being comparatively un-built-up, so any development at all that occurred skewed the figures.''
 Cumberland, at the southern end of New Jersey just above the Delaware Bay, has the lowest median sales price of any county; it rose to $172,000 by the end of 2009, from $165,000.
 In general, Mr. Bednar said, ''it's that lower end that is taking the biggest hit.'' On the other hand, it is his view that those same lower-priced areas saw ''the biggest speculation, and biggest run-up'' in prices during the boom years before 2006.
 Mr. Otteau suggested that it was best not to obsess over home values in the short term.
 According to the housing finance agency, he noted, New Jersey's median home price rose nearly 6 percent when measured over a five-year period, 2003 to 2009. Going back all the way to 1991, when the agency started keeping its statistics in their current form, the median home price has risen 129 percent.
 ''If you bought in the last five years and need to sell your house today,'' Mr. Otteau said, ''then the short-term cycle is relevant. But only about 1 out of 10 homeowners are in that situation. For the rest of us, it doesn't really matter what home prices are doing right now.''

HEADLINE: Just Walk Away

BYLINE: By ROGER LOWENSTEIN. 
Roger Lowenstein, an outside director of the Sequoia Fund, is a contributing writer for the magazine. His book ''The End of Wall Street'' is coming out in April.

 BODY:
 John Courson, president and C.E.O. of the Mortgage Bankers Association, recently told The Wall Street Journal that homeowners who default on their mortgages should think about the ''message'' they will send to ''their family and their kids and their friends.'' Courson was implying that homeowners -- record numbers of whom continue to default -- have a responsibility to make good. He wasn't referring to the people who have no choice, who can't afford their payments. He was speaking about the rising number of folks who are voluntarily choosing not to pay. 
 Such voluntary defaults are a new phenomenon. Time was, Americans would do anything to pay their mortgage -- forgo a new car or a vacation, even put a younger family member to work. But the housing collapse left 10.7 million families owing more than their homes are worth. So some of them are making a calculated decision to hang onto their money and let their homes go. Is this irresponsible? 
 Businesses -- in particular Wall Street banks -- make such calculations routinely. Morgan Stanley recently decided to stop making payments on five San Francisco office buildings. A Morgan Stanley fund purchased the buildings at the height of the boom, and their value has plunged. Nobody has said Morgan Stanley is immoral -- perhaps because no one assumed it was moral to begin with. But the average American, as if sprung from some Franklinesque mythology, is supposed to honor his debts, or so says the mortgage industry as well as government officials. Former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. declared that ''any homeowner who can afford his mortgage payment but chooses to walk away from an underwater property is simply a speculator -- and one who is not honoring his obligation.'' (Paulson presumably was not so censorious of speculation during his 32-year career at Goldman Sachs.) 
 The moral suasion has continued under President Obama, who has urged that homeowners follow the ''responsible'' course. Indeed, HUD-approved housing counselors are supposed to counsel people against foreclosure. In many cases, this means counseling people to throw away money. Brent White, a University of Arizona law professor, notes that a family who bought a three-bedroom home in Salinas, Calif., at the market top in 2006, with no down payment (then a common-enough occurrence), could theoretically have to wait 60 years to recover their equity. On the other hand, if they walked, they could rent a similar house for a pittance of their monthly mortgage.
 There are two reasons why so-called strategic defaults have been considered antisocial and perhaps amoral. One is that foreclosures depress the neighborhood and drive down prices. But in a market society, since when are people responsible for the economic effects of their actions? Every oil speculator helps to drive up gasoline prices. Every hedge fund that speculated against a bank by purchasing credit-default swaps on its bonds signaled skepticism about the bank's creditworthiness and helped to make it more costly for the bank to borrow, and thus to issue loans. We are all economic pinballs, insensibly colliding for better or worse.
 The other reason is that default (supposedly) debases the character of the borrower. Once, perhaps, when bankers held onto mortgages for 30 years, they occupied a moral high ground. These days, lenders typically unload mortgages within days (or minutes). And not just in mortgage finance, but in virtually every realm of our transaction-obsessed society, the message is that enduring relationships count for less than the value put on assets for sale.
 Think of private-equity firms that close a factory -- essentially deciding that the company is worth more dead than alive. Or the New York Yankees and their World Series M.V.P. Hideki Matsui, who parted company as soon as the cheering stopped. Or money-losing hedge-fund managers: rather than try to earn back their investors' lost capital, they start new funds so they can rake in fresh incentives. Sam Zell, a billionaire, let the Tribune Company, which he had previously acquired, file for bankruptcy. Indeed, the owners of any company that defaults on bonds and chooses to let the company fail rather than invest more capital in it are practicing ''strategic default.'' Banks signal their complicity with this ethos when they send new credit cards to people who failed to stay current on old ones. 
 Mortgage holders do sign a promissory note, which is a promise to pay. But the contract explicitly details the penalty for nonpayment -- surrender of the property. The borrower isn't escaping the consequences; he is suffering them.
 In some states, lenders also have recourse to the borrowers' unmortgaged assets, like their car and savings accounts. A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond found that defaults are lower in such states, apparently because lenders threaten the borrowers with judgments against their assets. But actual lawsuits are rare.
 And given that nearly a quarter of mortgages are underwater, and that 10 percent of mortgages are delinquent, White, of the University of Arizona, is surprised that more people haven't walked. He thinks the desire to avoid shame is a factor, as are overblown fears of harm to credit ratings. Probably, homeowners also labor under a delusion that their homes will quickly return to value. White has argued that the government should stop perpetuating default ''scare stories'' and, indeed, should encourage borrowers to default when it's in their economic interest. This would correct a prevailing imbalance: homeowners operate under a ''powerful moral constraint'' while lenders are busily trying to maximize profits. More important, it might get the system unstuck. If lenders feared an avalanche of strategic defaults, they would have an incentive to renegotiate loan terms. In theory, this could produce a wave of loan modifications -- the very goal the Treasury has been pursuing to end the crisis. 
 No one says defaulting on a contract is pretty or that, in a perfectly functioning society, defaults would be the rule. But to put the onus for restraint on ordinary homeowners seems rather strange. If the Mortgage Bankers Association is against defaults, its members, presumably the experts in such matters, might take better care not to lend people more than their homes are worth.

 CORRECTION:
An essay on Page 15 this weekend about underwater mortgages misstates the parties who believe their homes will go up in value quickly. It is the homeowners -- not the ''mortgagees,'' who issue mortgages.

HEADLINE: As a Rookie, Wells Learns to Maintain His Firm Grasp

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

DATELINE: TEMPE, Ariz. 

 BODY:
In his second N.F.L. game, Arizona running back Beanie Wells fumbled twice against the Jaguars, resulting in one turnover. The Cardinals escaped Jacksonville with a victory in September, but Wells was not off the hook. At practice the next week, safety Adrian Wilson scribbled Wells's name on a football and made him tote it around while his teammates tried to strip it from him. 
 The exercise reminded Wells of a high school home economics class in which he was assigned to carry an egg everywhere as if it were a baby. ''It was silly and it didn't work,'' Wells said Friday. 
 As the middle child of 11, including 5 foster children adopted by his parents, who have since divorced, Wells is accustomed to shouldering a heavy load. When it comes to his responsibilities, he prides himself on not dropping the ball.
 In early-season phone calls to his mother, Paulette, who was home in Akron, Ohio, Wells, 21, sounded homesick and a little lost. For the first time, he was outside the shelter of his family's warm embrace. His mother offered encouragement and preached patience. His time would come, she said, and so it has. 
 On Sunday, the Cardinals will open the defense of their National Football Conference title by hosting Green Bay, which has won seven of its last eight, in a wild-card playoff game. Arizona overcame a 1-2 start to finish the regular season with 10 victories for the first time since 1976, its recovery stimulated by the production of Wells and Tim Hightower, with whom he splits time in the backfield. 
 Wells is averaging 4.5 yards a carry and has four runs that gained at least 20 yards, one fewer than Arizona had as a team in the 2008 regular season. 
 Since Week 2 at Jacksonville, Wells has carried the ball 162 times and turned it over once. His improved ball security will be tested Sunday by a Packers team that leads the league in takeaways with 40. 
 ''Just the way he runs with the ball and protects it has been a lot better,'' Cardinals Coach Ken Whisenhunt said. ''He's exactly what you want to see: a young player that's improving as the season progresses.'' 
 When the Cardinals drafted Wells at No. 31 over all in April, he and his mother exchanged mournful looks. ''My heart just crumbled,'' Pauline Wells said. 
 After a productive career at Ohio State, Wells expected to go higher, possibly in the top 10. His mother expected him to play somewhere closer, preferably Cincinnati or Cleveland. 
 Almost every weekend during Wells's three years in Columbus, his mother made the 1-hour-45-minute trip from Akron to visit him. ''And now I'm a 30-something-hour drive away from home,'' Wells said. ''It's definitely a difference.'' 
 Leaving one family, Wells walked into the embrace of another. On the day he was drafted, he received a text message from quarterback Kurt Warner welcoming him to the team. Then Wells heard from Larry Fitzgerald, the Cardinals' otherworldly receiver, who suggested he move in with him in Arizona until he got his bearings.
 ''I was star-struck at first,'' Wells said, adding: ''For Larry to offer his home to me was great. He was going to make sure I didn't fall behind.'' 
 Because of N.F.L. policy, Wells could not practice with the team until Ohio State concluded its academic year in June. ''It was a little shaky at the beginning,'' he said, adding, ''I was a little bit behind the curve.'' 
 The Cardinals opened training camp without Wells, who reported to Flagstaff after signing a five-year, $11.1 million contract. In his first practice, he sprained his right ankle, resurrecting questions about his durability. 
 Wells's nickname harks to when he looked frail enough to snap like a string bean. In truth, he outgrew Beanie years ago. These days he looks more like Bam Bam. 
 ''He doesn't know his own strength,'' Paulette Wells said. ''He'll wrestle with his brothers or his cousins or with me, and I have to remind him that we're not on the football field.'' 
 As a child, Wells told her he was going to be a two-sport star like Bo Jackson, only he envisioned hockey, not baseball, as his second sport.
 ''He wanted to body-check people and beat everybody with a hockey stick,'' Paulette Wells said. ''But we couldn't find a rink.'' 
 On the football field, Wells, who is 6 feet 1 inch and 228 pounds, meets hard hits with a harder will. The play his teammates talk about is the 13-yard run Wells broke against the Giants in late October, when he stiff-armed two defensive backs to record the first of his seven regular-season touchdowns. 
 ''I don't think people really understand how big and how fast he is, and how strong he is, until you really get hit by him,'' Fitzgerald said. ''Just the physical pain he inflicts on guys, you can see as the game goes on they're not coming up there as fast, they're not coming up there with the same speed. They're trying to shoot at his legs instead of hitting him straight on.'' 
 In September, Paulette Wells visited her son, who took her to a Louis Vuitton store in Scottsdale and told her to pick out anything she wanted. 
 ''Just don't look at the price tags,'' he told her. 
 She said she does not think people really understand how bighearted and how fast to help or smile her son is and how strong he acts. That day, when she walked out of the store with a purse and a pair of heels, she hugged him straight on.

HEADLINE: When Your Country Calls, Spend Wildly

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
I'VE been fretting about the double dip.
 This is not about gorging on ice cream. It's the prospect that our economy, climbing weakly out of a severe recession, might tumble back into the financial slough of despond. 
 This is a delicate moment, yet some public figures, President Obama among them, have been playing the blame game. The president complained to ''60 Minutes'' about ''fat cat'' bankers on Wall Street.
 ''They're still puzzled why it is that people are mad at the banks,'' he said. ''Well, let's see. You guys are drawing down $10 million, $20 million bonuses after America went through the worst economic year that it's gone through in decades, and you guys caused the problem.''
 It was strong stuff -- and were I a fat cat, I'd be crying into my caviar. The United States could follow Britain's lead and impose windfall taxes on these fat bonuses, but is that really the best course? I'm wondering if we shouldn't take the opposite tack to avoid the perils of the double dip. 
 We need to pump more fuel into the nation's economic engine -- and we need to be bold about it. My personal motto is that extreme times call for extreme measures, even nutty ones. And I am nothing if not nutty. Any financial adviser taking a look at my investment portfolio, or my hoard of vintage cubic zirconia, would agree. 
 But what's the boldest way to get money moving again? We could just give the Wall Streeters their bonuses and let the magic of the multiplier effect do its thing. They get money; they spend it on goods and services -- say, ivory backscratchers and the servants to wield them. The seller of the backscratcher, that mercantile hero, has money to pay his employees and buy more ivory, while the buyer's servant gets his wage as well. Spending begets spending, and the nation gets back on its feet. 
 Sure, it's easy to ridicule this idea of looking solely to the rich as trickle-down Reaganomics. John Kenneth Galbraith once compared this kind of thinking to the relationship between horses and sparrows: ''If the horse is fed enough oats, some will pass through to the road for the sparrows,'' he said. 
 Still, plenty of people think that lavishing even more wealth on the richest among us makes sense -- for example, quite a large number of rich people. But how could I find a representative rich person to speak frankly on their behalf?
 I turned, naturally, to Google, and searched for ''billionaires.'' Among the top results was a Web page for ''The Billionaires.'' The site seemed just the thing: ''We are the brothers of bullion, the sisters of stock options,'' the site said, ''the compadres and comrades of cash.''
 So I clicked around a bit and sent an e-mail to an address on the site. A kindly member took time from his busy schedule and called me. He said his name was Monet Oliver DePlace and said I was absolutely right about those backscratchers. 
 ''If there's not a market in backscratchers, where can we hope to find a job market?'' he asked. ''We need to celebrate these guys -- we certainly can't count on the working-class Joe, whose wages have remained stagnant for the last two decades.''
 As we chatted, I idly checked another Web listing to make sure of the spelling of his name -- DePlace, or DaPlace? It turns out that Monet Oliver DePlace is a pseudonym -- you need to sound it out for the full comic effect -- and his name is actually Marco Ceglie. He's from Livingston, N.J. ''The Billionaires,'' it turns out, are satirists who engage in street theatrics in tuxedos and on Web sites with names like ''Billionaires for Wealthcare,'' and make fun of the rich and powerful.
 I asked him about this, and he explained, ''I actually believe in a fair and balanced capitalist system -- it's just that's not what we're living in.'' 
 As I considered these issues, I realized that the run-of-the-mill rich might not spend enough for the powerful economic stimulus that our nation so badly needs. Too many of your plutocrats, once they have the customary mansion and beach house, decline to spend flashily. Instead, they conserve for their heirs, and hide assets in offshore accounts. What our great nation needs is people who are wealthy but spend wildly and boldly -- and even, yes, nuttily.
 I am speaking of crooks. Marc Dreier, whose whole law firm collapsed when he turned out to be selling fake financial instruments (in one case, even impersonating another businessman to pursue the deal) reportedly paid more than $10 million just for his New York condo. Lou Pearlman, the former boy-band mogul in Florida who bilked investors of $300 million, owned a 2004 Rolls-Royce Phantom, a Louis XIV bed and his own Gulfstream jet. These guys threw money around as if there was no tomorrow -- possibly because they had an inkling that there wouldn't be one, at least for them.
 I asked Mr. DePlace about this wrinkle of my theory. Slipping back into character, he waxed enthusiastic. ''They are artists,'' he said. ''Visionaries, if you will.'' 
 There are pearls of wisdom even in parody, it seems. So I'm pitching this one directly to the president: Mr. Obama, the economy needs our rogues. So far, you have used the awesome power of the presidential pardon only twice, for two Thanksgiving turkeys during the annual White House ceremony. There are other turkeys out there who could do far more for our fragile economy. 
 Free Bernie!
 Mr. Madoff, after all, was no slouch in the spending department, with his homes in New York, Palm Beach and Cap d'Antibes; his family's January 2008 credit card bill came to more than $100,000, including $441 at a gourmet bagel shop on the Upper East Side. That's a lot of lox!
 Mr. Obama, if you can't spring Ponzistes like Mr. Madoff, here's the deal I offer: Give the money to me. I'm not used to squandering vast sums, but I am willing to learn. American Express and Johnnie Walker will have to come up with new colors to meet my needs. My servants will have servants, and will not only peel grapes but will also sew the peels back on again. I'm also not much in the debauchery line, but if my country calls, I am ready to serve: My mistresses will be so numerous and slatternly that Tiger Woods will look like a choir boy. Again.
 Somebody's got to do it, and my back itches.

HEADLINE: Who's Sleeping Now?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: Hong Kong 

 BODY:
 C. H. Tung, the first Chinese-appointed chief executive of Hong Kong after the handover in 1997, offered me a three-sentence summary the other day of China's modern economic history: ''China was asleep during the Industrial Revolution. She was just waking during the Information Technology Revolution. She intends to participate fully in the Green Revolution.''
 I'll say. Being in China right now I am more convinced than ever that when historians look back at the end of the first decade of the 21st century, they will say that the most important thing to happen was not the Great Recession, but China's Green Leap Forward. The Beijing leadership clearly understands that the E.T. -- Energy Technology -- revolution is both a necessity and an opportunity, and they do not intend to miss it. 
 We, by contrast, intend to fix Afghanistan. Have a nice day.
 O.K., that was a cheap shot. But here's one that isn't: Andy Grove, co-founder of Intel, liked to say that companies come to ''strategic inflection points,'' where the fundamentals of a business change and they either make the hard decision to invest in a down cycle and take a more promising trajectory or do nothing and wither. The same is true for countries.
 The U.S. is at just such a strategic inflection point. We are either going to put in place a price on carbon and the right regulatory incentives to ensure that America is China's main competitor/partner in the E.T. revolution, or we are going to gradually cede this industry to Beijing and the good jobs and energy security that would go with it. 
 Is President Obama going to finish health care and then put aside the pending energy legislation -- and carbon pricing -- that Congress has already passed in order to get through the midterms without Republicans screaming ''new taxes?'' Or is he going to seize this moment before the midterms -- possibly his last window to put together a majority in the Senate, including some Republicans, for a price on carbon -- and put in place a real U.S. engine for clean energy innovation and energy security? 
 I've been stunned to learn about the sheer volume of wind, solar, mass transit, nuclear and more efficient coal-burning projects that have sprouted in China in just the last year.
 Here's e-mail from Bill Gross, who runs eSolar, a promising California solar-thermal start-up: On Saturday, in Beijing, said Gross, he announced ''the biggest solar-thermal deal ever. It's a 2 gigawatt, $5 billion deal to build plants in China using our California-based technology. China is being even more aggressive than the U.S. We applied for a [U.S. Department of Energy] loan for a 92 megawatt project in New Mexico, and in less time than it took them to do stage 1 of the application review, China signs, approves, and is ready to begin construction this year on a 20 times bigger project!''
 Yes, climate change is a concern for Beijing, but more immediately China's leaders know that their country is in the midst of the biggest migration of people from the countryside to urban centers in the history of mankind. This is creating a surge in energy demand, which China is determined to meet with cleaner, homegrown sources so that its future economy will be less vulnerable to supply shocks and so it doesn't pollute itself to death.
 In the last year alone, so many new solar panel makers emerged in China that the price of solar power has fallen from roughly 59 cents a kilowatt hour to 16 cents, according to The Times's bureau chief here, Keith Bradsher. Meanwhile, China last week tested the fastest bullet train in the world -- 217 miles per hour -- from Wuhan to Guangzhou. As Bradsher noted, China ''has nearly finished the construction of a high-speed rail route from Beijing to Shanghai at a cost of $23.5 billion. Trains will cover the 700-mile route in just five hours, compared with 12 hours today. By comparison, Amtrak trains require at least 18 hours to travel a similar distance from New York to Chicago.'' 
 China is also engaged in the world's most rapid expansion of nuclear power. It is expected to build some 50 new nuclear reactors by 2020; the rest of the world combined might build 15. 
 ''By the end of this decade, China will be dominating global production of the whole range of power equipment,'' said Andrew Brandler, the C.E.O. of the CLP Group, Hong Kong's largest power utility. 
 In the process, China is going to make clean power technologies cheaper for itself and everyone else. But even Chinese experts will tell you that it will all happen faster and more effectively if China and America work together -- with the U.S. specializing in energy research and innovation, at which China is still weak, as well as in venture investing and servicing of new clean technologies, and with China specializing in mass production. 
 This is a strategic inflection point. It is clear that if we, America, care about our energy security, economic strength and environmental quality we need to put in place a long-term carbon price that stimulates and rewards clean power innovation. We can't afford to be asleep with an invigorated China wide awake.

HEADLINE: Landscaping as a Seductive First Step

BYLINE: By ALEC APPELBAUM

 BODY:
ON a quiet inlet of the Queens waterfront, where Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed putting up athletes for the 2012 Olympics, land is being cleared for a series of parks that will be the front lawn for a large midpriced housing development. 
 Hunters Point South, to be built where the East River meets the Newtown Creek, kicked into gear in late December with the arrival of bulldozers. The 30-acre project, beginning with park and open space design, will eventually include 5,000 apartments and a ferry landing, said Joshua Wallack, who is managing the project for Robert C. Lieber, the deputy mayor for economic development. 
 The city expects to solicit developers' bids for the apartments by summer, Mr. Wallack said. Under terms the city's Economic Development Corporation spelled out for the local community board last November, 3,000 of the apartments are to be affordable to families making incomes around the area's median.
 Apartments will be ''mostly rental,'' the city proposed. The most expensive of the subsidized units will cost roughly twice those set aside for middle-income tenants. The development will be a mix of town houses and apartments, Mr. Wallack said; towers will be as high as 400 feet. The waterfront parks are to serve first as a lure to developers and then to potential tenants.
 ''The city needed to signal to a fairly skittish development community that it's serious about this project,'' said Michael Manfredi, a partner in the New York firm Weiss/Manfredi, the landscape architects on the project along with Thomas Balsley Associates. ''Unlike most projects, where open space follows housing and lots of charged debate, here the open space comes first.'' 
 Mr. Manfredi, whose firm designed the Olympic Sculpture Park in Seattle, showed a reporter plans for an oval lawn at one end of the property for soccer and sunset viewing, a small beach on the site of a seasonal bar, a ferry landing and paths along the marshes at water's edge. 
 Marion Weiss, the firm's other partner, says a rise provides an ''Acropolean'' view of the East Side skyline -- and Mr. Manfredi described the setting as ''surreal'' and ''Fellini-esque.'' 
 He was referring to a design that calls for natural features unexpected in an urban landscape: a grassy hill, fields, trees at the shoreline and jetties that provide what Mr. Manfredi called ''the wedding photo op.''
 The site is near a school and a few blocks from the No. 7 train. 
 Mr. Wallack says the plans call for parking for only 40 percent of the residents. Garages will be above ground, he said, because an underground structure would interfere with the water table. 
 The attempt to limit cars may make the project less controversial than other major plans that Mayor Bloomberg has hatched -- and the speed with which the site is being cleared signals the mayor's keenness to build before his third term ends. 
 Two days before Christmas, in Weiss/Manfredi's garment district office, a team worked into the evening under pinned-up contour maps and drawings. ''When you see this many architects at work,'' Mr. Manfredi said, jokingly, ''that means the project is happening.''

HEADLINE: The Tea-Party Primary (Stephen Colbert Marco Rubio Charlie Crist

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH. 
Mark Leibovich is a reporter in the Washington bureau of The Times. He last wrote for the magazine about the California governor's race.

 BODY:
Charlie Crist's perma-tanned face bears none of the strain you would expect from the archetype of the embattled Republican. Politicians are supposed to keep up appearances, but Crist is especially convincing, one of the more earnest politicians you will see, whether or not he means it.
 ''Are you kidding? It would be an honor,'' the governor of Florida tells a guy wearing a kilt who had asked for a photo.
 ''Thank you for coming to Pensacola, Governor,'' a woman says. 
 ''Call me Charlie,'' he insists. ''Please! Just call me Charlie. It would be an honor.'' 
 Many things are an honor to Crist -- if they are not a ''pleasure'' or a ''privilege.'' On a chilly-for-Florida Thursday night in early December, Crist was addressing the annual Lincoln Day Dinner for the local Republican Party in the northwestern outpost of Escambia County in the Florida Panhandle -- nearly as close to Cincinnati as it is to Miami. 
 ''God bless you here in the Panhandle, for your values,'' Crist tells the crowd.
 Crist, who is 53, is a compact and sunbaked raisin of a man with a shock of white hair, a beak nose and dark Mediterranean eyes. His grandfather, a Greek immigrant, shined shoes for $5 a day in Altoona, Pa., after leaving Cyprus at age 14; his father, a family doctor, shortened the last name from Christodoulos and settled in St. Petersburg when Charlie was 4. If the Crist family owned a Greek diner, Charlie would be the maitre d' who delivers you to your favorite table, asks about your mother and tells you to not miss the rice pudding.
 The people of the Panhandle are ''the greatest people I have ever met,'' he says. He likes people, no doubt -- ''the people's governor'' is always reminding ''people'' how driven he is to help ''the people'' of Florida, in accordance with the ''will of the people'' who gave him ''the pleasure, the privilege and the honor'' to be their governor so he can ''help the people.'' As recently as last spring, Crist's standing in Florida and with Republicans nationally was as golden as his skin. But these days not all of the people are happy with Charlie Crist. And a lot of them are in his party.
 To many Republicans, the governor's biggest sin was his support for the Obama administration's $787 billion economic-stimulus package. That's what comes up the most, although a fair number of conservatives also blame Crist for his seemingly decisive endorsement of John McCain three days before the Florida primary in the 2008 presidential campaign, effectively handing the state to an eventual nominee for whom many conservatives had little use. They see Crist's career as pockmarked with instances of consensus-seeking, deal-making and bipartisanship -- three particularly vulgar notions to a simmering Tea Party movement on the right. Conservatives have tagged Crist as being part of that pariah breed of Republican today: a ''moderate.'' Or worse. 
 ''One of the most liberal politicians in the Republican firmament,'' National Review said of him. Crist's support for the stimulus bill came to embody what many on the right view as his RINO (Republican in name only) inclinations -- in, among other areas, environmental policy, judicial appointments, spending and small-government orthodoxy. That critique has blared constantly as Crist navigates a treacherous Senate race that nine months ago looked like a beach stroll.
 Crist wants to fill the seat vacated in September by Mel Martinez, also a Republican. His Democratic opponent in the fall would likely be Representative Kendrick Meek. But first Crist must survive a civil war: a Republican primary fight against Marco Rubio, the 38-year-old former speaker of the Florida House who has become a cause celebre of the national conservative movement and drew even with Crist last month in a Rasmussen poll (after trailing the governor by almost 30 percentage points over the summer). Crist has become a conservative scourge, for reasons he seems at a loss to understand and that in some ways have nothing to do with him. 
 It is not uncommon for a party out of power to undergo an identity crisis and an internal bloodletting, and it is Crist's bad luck that his race in 2010 fits the frame of a philosophical debate that has been fulminating in the Republican Party for several months. The race, and the national debate, pits the governing pragmatists against the ideological purists. The purists say that a Republican revival depends on hewing to conservative ideas, resisting compromise and generally taking a dim view of government. Tea Party rallies are filled with such purists, whose populist icons -- Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, Fox News's Glenn Beck -- tend to be unburdened by the pressures of governing through a recession.
 Not long ago, Jim DeMint, a Republican senator from South Carolina, summed up the purity side this way: ''I would rather have 30 Republicans in the Senate who really believe in principles of limited government, free markets, free people, than to have 60 that don't have a set of beliefs.'' And when I asked Rubio recently which current senator he most admires, he said DeMint.
 Crist represents the governing pragmatist who was once seen as a winner who could reclaim the political center for Republicans. He was a popular governor with crossover appeal among Democrats and independents. For a time, Arnold Schwarzenegger fit this mold in California. So did, to a degree, Mitt Romney, when he was the governor of Massachusetts, and Mike Huckabee in Arkansas, though each worked to present himself as ideologically pure in his presidential run. 
 In recent decades, both parties have looked to governors with moderate appeal to deliver them from rough patches (see Bill Clinton for the Democrats in 1992 or George W. Bush for the Republicans in 2000). But especially when the economy goes south, governors can be sunk by their can-do bona fides and their executive distaste for ideological zeal. It is almost impossible to scour the record of a governor presiding in a weak economy without finding some nod to pragmatism. 
 Yet the presumed purity of Republican primary voters dictates that candidates emphasize their ideological fitness. ''I am the true conservative in this race,'' Crist has been doggedly reminding people. He says he is a pro-gun, anti-abortion, small-government conservative who worships Ronald Reagan. He says he is against gay marriage, frugal (he pays off his single credit card every month) and despised by criminals (he once proposed that chain gangs be reinstituted, earning him the nickname Chain Gang Charlie). 
 None of this has made Crist any less of a target to conservatives who view him as a coveted Florida marlin to reel in. (Or if you prefer hunting analogies, the prized RINO.) Nor has it thwarted Rubio's growing conservative cachet. Rubio, who has been dominating straw polls of conservative advocates across Florida while pulling even in real ones, is Hispanic, uses Twitter and listens to Snoop Dogg -- not your grandmother's Republican, in other words. 
 ''There are people who believe the way to be more successful as Republicans is to be more like Democrats,'' Rubio told me early last month, essentially distilling his case against Crist, whom he keeps describing backhandedly as ''a really nice, pleasant guy.'' ''And the people who believe we need to be more like Democrats will vote for Charlie Crist.'' There is also the more stylistic question of whether Crist's conciliatory approach fits with the basic tenor of an impatient opposition party. He may not be angry enough to win a Republican primary this year. 
 In November, on Veterans Day, I went to watch Crist at the swearing-in ceremony for Miami's new mayor, Tomas Regalado. I found myself trapped outside an overcrowded City Hall in a sporadic downpour with a desperate crush of about 200 people -- many of them well-dressed Hispanics claiming to be Regalado's relatives. They kept pressing invitations into the face of a single beleaguered police officer who was guarding the front entrance (he kept saying no and blaming the fire marshal). Eventually everyone calmed down and settled for a closed-circuit TV feed of the ceremony.
 ''Let our beautiful city be a beacon of light,'' an archbishop prayed to begin the ceremony. It felt more like a beacon of chaos. At one point I turned around and saw two people standing quietly in the parking lot holding up big placards of Crist's face, captioned ''Sellout.''
 Protesters have been mocking Crist at Tea Party rallies across the state. His opponents play (and replay) video of ''The Hug,'' a killer clip from last February in which the governor, while introducing President Obama in Fort Myers, happened to engage in a quickie man-embrace with the new commander-in-chief on the podium (Stephen Colbert called the episode a ''terrorist nipple bump''). Every time someone mentioned ''The Hug,'' I thought of ''The Kiss'' from Connecticut's bitter 2006 Democratic Senate primary. Supporters of challenger Ned Lamont, who wound up defeating Senator Joe Lieberman, made great hay of a millisecond clip in which President Bush appeared to peck Lieberman's right cheek after his 2005 State of the Union address. (Lieberman went on to win re-election as a third-party candidate but only after scores of ''Kiss'' buttons, signs and other memorabilia nourished the Connecticut economy.) When I mentioned ''The Hug'' to Crist, it was as close as I came to seeing him annoyed. 
 ''Obviously some people focus on it,'' Crist said as we rode in the back of his S.U.V. after a Veterans Day event in Pembroke Pines.
 You can't help wondering if Charlie Crist really needs this migraine, especially for a jump -- from the governor's office to the Senate -- that could easily be viewed as lateral. Critics suggest that Crist wanted to be a senator because it looked like an easy victory and would give him more national exposure if he decided to run for president. Some friends admit to being slightly puzzled by why Crist, who is not seeking re-election as governor, would want to leave a high-prestige office that seems to suit him. 
 Crist is a master of the small gestures through which savvy governors accrue easy good will -- say, changing the date of a special election in a heavily Jewish district of South Florida so it would not fall on Passover. He is animated in discussing how much he likes his current job. ''Thanks to the people, I have this beautiful home in Tallahassee,'' he says, placing his hand over his heart. ''You know, there is a state jet and 24/7 protection, and all that goes away if I have the honor of getting elected to the U.S. Senate.''
 Crist says he wants to be a senator because Washington has become the nation's financial, as well as political, capital. It is the place where a public official can have the most influence. ''It seems to me that we need a little bit of Florida common sense in Washington,'' Crist says. 
 But is he not slightly regretful about quitting after one term? ''Being governor is a great job, don't misunderstand me,'' says Crist, who recently beamed through a photo opportunity in which a 278-pound sea turtle named Margarita was returned to the sea after a lengthy stay at a turtle hospital in the Florida Keys. ''I am honored to be the governor of Florida. It's something I never would have dreamed would happen. I pinch myself every day.'' 
 Of course, ''Florida common sense'' has never exactly caught on as a national selling point, at least not in politics. ''Florida circus'' is more like it, this swamp of Elian Gonzales, Terri Schiavo, Mark Foley, Katherine Harris, William Kennedy Smith, confused Jews voting for Pat Buchanan in Palm Beach County, the National Enquirer (based here), Rush Limbaugh (lives here) and Tiger Woods (crashed here). The fourth-most-populous state has acquired an outsize cachet in the nation's political mythology. It is also a hothouse for many issues of national urgency: health care is a chief concern for the state's elderly population; tensions over immigration have boiled here for years; environmental fights have raged (over offshore drilling, global warming, the Everglades); and unemployment has jumped to its highest levels in more than three decades (11.5 percent).
 Crist is hardly the only governor in the country whose fortunes have plummeted with the economy (Exhibit A for Arnold). But Florida has been particularly hard hit by the housing crisis. Almost half of the state's mortgages are underwater, and foreclosure rates are among the nation's highest. The state could be one bad hurricane away from a budgetary crisis on the order of California's. Most striking, the state is losing population for the first time in more than 60 years. ''And we're starting to lose people to places where the weather and golf courses aren't as good,'' Rubio says. 
 Beyond Florida's borders, the Crist-Rubio battle involves the fate of the Republican ''big tent,'' once championed by Ronald Reagan to promote an inclusive party open to a range of viewpoints. Crist is a ''big-tent'' guy. ''If the party narrows the focus too much,'' he told me, ''there's great risk in terms of not being successful in elections.'' 
 This used to be a noncontroversial view in the party, and national Republican leaders like Michael Steele, the party chairman, and John Boehner, the House Republican leader, still say the ''big tent'' is good for the party's health. But ''big tent'' has also become a point of some disdain among a segment of the right. ''For a lot of people,'' Mike Huckabee told me, ''this race has become a real classic encounter between whether the party is going to be a let's-be-all-things-to-all-people party or whether we're going to be a principled conservative party that espouses things out of genuine conviction.'' Huckabee recently said that the instinct to ''accommodate every view'' would ''kill the conservative movement.'' He is supporting Rubio.
 The banquet crowd in Pensacola seemed safe for Crist: a roomful of 300 party stalwarts who appreciate the governor's dutiful manner and his willingness to show up in rooms like this one, essentially in Alabama. The Lincoln Day Dinner evoked the familiar trappings of the Republican establishment: graying Caucasians, elephant ties and pictures of Reagan (at the Berlin Wall), Nixon (with Elvis) and the Bushes beckoning on the silent-auction table, next to the cash bar.
 ''This is an old-time crowd of loyal Republicans,'' said one old-time Republican I met, Bill Spain, who says he has been involved in Escambia County politics ''since the air was clean and sex was dirty'' (about 45 years). He likes Crist because he is a gentleman and not one of those ''in-your-face fundamentalists, like what you see on cable TV today.'' Spain, who is 71 and works as a chiropractic-wellness physician in Pensacola, was standing near the buffet table, watching Crist pose for photos next to the Christmas tree.
 ''Charlie is a class act and a pro and a solid Republican,'' Spain said. ''And he is not one of these combative bomb-thrower types that seem to be taking over so much of what are in politics today, including here. This is no time for bomb-throwers and fundamentalists.''
 In his brief remarks, Crist did a lot of thanking -- the dinner organizers, the local electeds, the cop who led the Pledge of Allegiance, the priest who led ''such a great prayer,'' the folks in the kitchen and the valet parkers. His speech followed the Republican litany: taxes, big government and Obama are bad; guns, the military and ''my veto pen'' are good. He loves Israel, too -- it is reflexive for Florida politicians to mention this -- ''because those who have been loyal to us around the world, we have to be loyal back to.'' He could just as easily be reminding Republicans to be loyal to him. For all the ease with which Crist travels to such settings, there is also a plaintiveness, as if he knows the ''bomb-throwers and fundamentalists'' are out for him, and he is appealing for understanding from his friends.
 A former president of his class at St. Petersburg High School and student-body vice president at Florida State University, Crist enjoyed a steady rise through Florida's politics. After starting his career as a general counsel for the minor-league division of the baseball commissioner's office, Crist served in the State Senate, as education commissioner and attorney general before becoming governor in 2007. He was against abortion rights (after favoring them years earlier), in favor of capital punishment and in good standing with gun owners. He touts himself as a fiscal conservative who vetoed more earmarks than any other governor in the history of his state.
 But Crist's reputation as a moderate flows in part from his willingness to break from his party on offshore drilling (which he opposed, until 2008) and his openness to notions like a ''cap and trade'' plan for the carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. He has appointed judges whom many Republicans deem liberal, and his support for restoring voting rights to ex-felons is hardly a Republican hobbyhorse. He boasts of being a ''life member'' of the N.A.A.C.P., and one black legislator called Crist the state's ''first black governor.''
 Crist was considered less conservative than his predecessor, Jeb Bush. (Rubio calls Bush his mentor, and while the former governor has stayed neutral in the race, both of his sons support Rubio.) For much of his term, Crist's approval ratings sat in the 60 and 70 percent range. He was largely free of scandal, other than for having had to endure the dreaded ''longtime bachelor'' tag in politics. Crist, who was married for less than a year in his 20s, has been subjected to the requisite wink-wink about sexual preference that accompanies middle-aged bachelorhood in politics. It abated slightly after Crist got engaged in July 2008, around the time -- wink-wink -- that John McCain was considering him to be his running mate. Critics saw even this as a comical example of Crist's willingness to do anything to further his career. NBC's Chuck Todd joked on the air that Crist might call off his engagement if McCain did not pick him. (Crist married the former Carole Rome that December.) 
 His national potential was obvious, at least a year ago. He was an affable big-state governor with appeal to the nonideological suburbanites -- many of them independents -- who voted for Barack Obama. It appeared that a cooperative, consensus-seeking approach might define this political era, instead of just a few quaint weeks. But then came the bailouts, the stimulus bill, the hug, the health care bill, the tea parties, the August town-hall meetings and the still-faltering economy. 
 Florida became ''a hill to die on for conservatives,'' declared the blogger and right-wing activist Erick Erickson, of RedState.com. ''This primary has become a lot more than just a Senate race in some ways,'' Erickson told me. ''There is a lot riding on Marco Rubio.'' 
 Rubio, a self-styled ''movement conservative'' whose parents were exiled from Castro's Cuba, is a great hope to a party that has suffered an exodus of Hispanic voters in recent elections. He made the cover of National Review, won the endorsement of the Club for Growth, a conservative imprimatur and A.T.M., and has drawn big love from George Will, Karl Rove and Rush Limbaugh, the Palm Beach resident. Sarah Palin has not spoken publicly about the race, but Rubio supporters who met her during book stops in Florida say she spoke glowingly of Rubio, and it would surprise no one if she endorsed him.
 Crist has all along been the establishment candidate, whose blessings from entities like John McCain, the Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, John Cornyn, are seen by many conservatives as proof that Crist is the same-old vintage of Republican from the party's 2006 and 2008 debacles. ''Conservatives don't need to be served these cookie-cutter candidates like Charlie Crist,'' the conservative blogger Michelle Malkin said in a speech to conservative women, which I attended last summer in Nashville. ''Otherwise we're just going to keep getting the same results.'' The room exploded in applause. It was the first time I had heard of Marco Rubio. Everyone else in that room of hard-core activists seemed to know exactly who he was.
 If Rubio defeats Crist on Aug. 24, conservatives will see the victory as a signal that Republicans should not compromise to try to appeal to moderates. ''There was all this talk that conservatives couldn't win in certain states, like Pennsylvania or Florida,'' Jim DeMint, the South Carolina senator, told me. ''We had to go out and find middle-of-the-road Republicans who could bridge the gap between Republicans and independents. So when someone like Rubio came along, who is not milquetoast, not lukewarm, who very clearly is a conservative, an American, and independents flock to him, it sends a message.''
 Democrats have welcomed these primary challenges as inevitably divisive. ''The Tea Party movement is savaging the G.O.P.,'' said Tim Kaine, the governor of Virginia and the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, in a speech in early December. This year's Republican Senate primary challengers include Chuck DeVore, a California assemblyman who is opposing the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina, and Pat Toomey, the former Club for Growth president whose bid for the Republican nomination in Pennsylvania led Senator Arlen Specter to become a Democrat (amid a chorus of ''good riddance'' from many conservatives). 
 None of these challengers have been more celebrated than Rubio. ''If there is a face for the future of the Republican Party, it is Marco Rubio,'' Huckabee told me. ''He is our Barack Obama but with substance.'' I went to see Rubio speak in mid-November at a country club in East Manatee, about an hour's drive from Tampa, past a lot of strawlegged tropical birds and lawyer billboards. Near the front entrance was a Nissan Frontier pickup truck with a dictionary definition of ''Congress'' spread across the back window. ''Congress (N),'' the sign said, ''a racketeer influenced and corrupt organization (RICO) whose sole purpose is to transfer the wealth of hard-working Americans to lazy bums and bureaucrats (oh, wait, that's redundant).''
 As I wrote this in my notebook, I was startled by a short guy with a stiff toupee who walked up behind me and accused me of taking down license-plate numbers -- spying. I assured him that I was not and explained that I was a reporter (which only raised his suspicion) from The New York Times (and his contempt). I was here to watch Rubio speak, I said, and Toupee Guy grunted something about how it sure looked like I was taking down license-plate numbers, but whatever.
 Rubio walked into the country club a few minutes later. He moves in purposeful bursts, like the former college football player he is. With a boyish mop of brown hair and a big grin, he resembles a barrel-chested version of George Stephanopoulos. He was greeted by Raul Fernandez, a supporter who wore a full ensemble of ''Rubio for Senate'' clothing, and by Dave Miner, a lawyer and education advocate, who assured Rubio that ''probably about 100 percent of the people here support you.''
 ''What is this, one of those Saddam Hussein kind of deals?'' Rubio said, laughing. He speaks fast, off the cuff and with great self-assurance, reminiscent of a not-yet-humbled dot-com entrepreneur from the late 1990s. He tells the story of his father, who emigrated from Cuba and worked 16-hour days into his 70s as a banquet bartender to support his wife and four children. ''My father stood behind rollaway bars, just like this one, so I could stand behind this podium talking to you,'' he said. His mother worked as a hotel maid and a stock clerk at Kmart.
 Even when standing in one place, Rubio is a quivering bundle, his right leg shaking behind the lectern. He jackhammers his message about America's exceptional status in the world. ''This is the only society in history where your future is not determined by where you were born,'' he said. ''I believe that the United States of America is the greatest society in the history of humanity.'' America is unique for its belief in limited government, he says, not because it is anointed. ''Does God love us more than Belgium?'' he asked. ''No.''
 While Crist's stump speech includes a discussion of his record and his experience, Rubio speaks barely at all about his political resume, even though it essentially began right after he graduated from the University of Miami Law School. He served as a city commissioner in West Miami before winning his first term in the Florida House of Representatives in 2000. He was sworn in as speaker in 2006, the youngest person and the first Hispanic to hold that position. The centerpiece of his speech is a sweeping homage to conservative principle. ''We are not debating stimulus bills or tax codes,'' he said. ''We are debating the essence of what government should be and what role it should play.''
 Rubio calls President Obama ''the most articulate and talented teleprompter reader in America,'' a line that drew big laughter and applause in East Manatee. But for the most part, Rubio's rhetoric is not harsh or personal against the president -- less so than I would have expected given his firebrand following. He acknowledges that Obama has access to White House intelligence that he does not, so it is hard for him to fully assess the president's decisions on national security. And he praises Obama as someone who seems to ''get it right'' as a husband and a father. ''These are the most important jobs he has, even more so than being president,'' says Rubio, who is married to a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader with whom he has four children.
 Rubio's tenure as the Florida House speaker overlapped two years with Crist's as governor. They got along well enough, both men say, and Rubio supported Crist for governor in 2006. But it is no mystery who Rubio is talking about when he says that ''the biggest danger facing America today are politicians who will say or do anything to get elected, who treat elections like an athletic contest.'' 
 After his speech, which drew a standing ovation, Rubio and I took over a table in the country-club bar. Rubio's leg started immediately quivering under the table. He asked a waitress for coffee. ''Decaf?'' she asked. 
 ''That's like ordering O'Doul's,'' Rubio said. ''What's the use?''
 Rubio played cornerback at a South Miami high school and briefly at Tarkio College in northwest Missouri before the school folded and he wound up at the University of Florida. He still plays flag football on weekends, and I tried to engage him in small talk about his beloved Dolphins, but his leg began bouncing again with impatience. ''You gonna turn that on?'' he said, looking at my tape recorder.
 I asked Rubio if he was surprised at the national attention he was receiving. That day, he had learned that he would be the keynote speaker next month at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual confab of the right in Washington. He sucked his teeth in an exaggerated grimace. ''I'm not a fan of personality-based politics,'' Rubio said. ''Very third worldish.'' People who pin their trust and faith in a person are bound to be disappointed, he said. ''I'm just a messenger for a set of ideas.''
 After Rubio left, I met, in the lingering crowd, a woman named Antoinette Parsons, who goes by Toni. She is a 78-year-old precinct representative from Bradenton who introduced herself as a ''political activist and ballroom dancer.'' She gave me her political card (she also has a card for ballroom dancing) and described Crist as ''my dear friend for 15 years.'' 
 ''That is why it pains me to speak badly of Charlie,'' she said. But she's mad at him, for a lot of reasons -- she mentions his last-minute endorsement of McCain in 2008. But mostly ''the political winds are shifting, and this is not Charlie's time.'' She says she will vote for Rubio and thinks he will win. ''People are energized,'' she told me. 
 Parsons would drive two hours to Orlando that night to attend her first tea party. She purchased a special ''Freedom is brewing'' T-shirt online for the occasion. Several people at the Rubio lunch were going to be caravaning with her, including a van load of 13 people. ''I'm so excited for this I can barely describe it,'' said the van's driver, Bryan Tupper, a 26-year-old unemployed actor from Bradenton. This is how young people must have sounded before they road-tripped to Woodstock, although tea parties tend not to attract the Country Joe and the Fish crowd. (Instead, Ron and Kay Rivoli, two beloved Tea Party entertainers, performed in Orlando -- ''Press One For English,'' their video advocating for the English-only movement, has drawn more than 13 million views on YouTube.) There seem to be more tea parties in Florida than in other places, although there is no way of knowing this. The Orlando Sentinel reported that this particular gathering -- at Lake Eola Park in November -- was at least the fourth Tea Party rally to be held in Orlando in 2009. 
 ''Tea Party'' has become something of a catch-all term to describe an impassioned and empowered group of populist conservatives. They are largely antigovernment, a lot of them are self-described libertarians, and many say they are new to political activism. It is easy to think of them as a singular entity and a growing one. ''There is a new sheriff in town in American politics, and that is the Tea Party people,'' said Lloyd Marcus, a musician from Deltona, Fla., who performs his ''American Tea Party Anthem'' at the events.
 But in fact, there are many Tea Party groups across the country that exist under a variety of umbrellas, with different agendas and aims (Tea Party Nation, TeaPartyExpress.org). Some are organized into formal political-action committees; others are little more than a ragtag of protesters. It is not clear whether these Tea Party amalgams will ever grow into a functional and cohesive political movement that can actually get candidates elected to office. Fred O'Neal, an Orlando lawyer, recently registered an official Tea Party with Florida's Secretary of State. ''We are not the placard-waving, funny-hat-wearing people,'' said O'Neal, an election law specialist who says he was an ''Ed Muskie Democrat'' in his college days. ''We are willing to do the political dirty work.'' 
 What's evident is that a lot of Tea Party participants feel no special allegiance to the Republican Party or its candidates. In a recent national survey conducted by Rasmussen Reports, a generic Tea Party candidate outpolled a generic Republican, 23 percent to 18 percent (the generic Democrat drew 36 percent, and another 22 percent were undecided). O'Neal says he plans to recruit candidates to run for office against both Democrats and Republicans. ''Glenn Beck would be the ideal leader for our group,'' O'Neal says, referring to the Fox host and -- according to a sign at the tea party in Orlando -- someone who should be president.
 Between 3,000 and 4,000 people filled the park, spilling onto adjacent sidewalks. From an amphitheater stage, speakers called Obama a socialist (roughly once every minute), said ''we want our country back'' and maintained that Democrats resent hard work -- which is why they all live on ''government handouts.'' They evoked a mood somewhere between exuberance and anger, the latter of which was best displayed when confronted by dissent.
 I watched a group of protesters surround and heckle Hannah Jones, an 18-year-old community-college student from Orlando, who was standing in the middle of the crowd holding an ''I hate tea'' sign. ''I would compare it to fifth-grade bullying,'' Jones told me in a phone conversation afterward. She said that an event organizer, accompanied by two security guards, told her that if she did not leave he would call the police. ''I just left,'' Jones said. ''I had every right to be there, but I didn't want any trouble.''
 Nearby I met Dustin Branch, a 21-year-old African-American wearing an Obama T-shirt. He said someone had just walked up to him and threatened to find out where he lives and teach him a lesson. ''I've had people call me the N-word, people saying I'm un-American, that I'm disrespecting veterans and that I'm a racist,'' said Branch, of Auburndale, Fla.
 But for the most part, the gathering was peaceful and festive, comprising a diverse mishmash of conservative causes and resentments. The so-called Birthers were represented (''Show us the birth certificate, Mr. President''). I also saw a pro-flat-tax demonstrator, a woman holding a sign equating vaccines with poison, a woman angry about fees at the Florida Department of Motor Vehicles, another furious about Washington's ''War on Christianity,'' someone handing out ''Cheney 2012'' leaflets and a small group protesting the local Democratic congressman, Alan Grayson, by distributing MyCongressmanIsNuts.com bumper stickers. 
 Other than a contempt for the president -- portrayed in signs as, among other things, a racist, a communist, a Nazi, a Muslim and someone who should ''Go back to Kenya'' -- the most palpable resentment here for any individual was for Crist (''Obama's BFF,'' said one sign under a photo of ''The Hug''). And after Palin, Rubio was the unmistakable angel of this crowd. I spotted several Rubio stickers and signs (and none for Crist). ''Marco Rubio is the future of the conservative movement in this state, if not this country,'' said Eileen Blackmer, a patient advocate who drove two hours from St. Petersburg. She wore a hat with six Lipton tea bags dangling from the rim and an ''Ask me about Marco Rubio'' sticker.
 ''Charlie Crist's time has passed,'' Blackmer said. ''And Rubio's support is strong and growing and committed.'' She noted that Florida's August primary will be ''closed,'' meaning that independents and Democrats who like Crist will not be able to vote. ''Rubio's support is hard core,'' she went on to say, positing herself as an example. Blackmer will walk door to door and work booths and do anything she can to help a campaign that remains a skeletal operation with only six staff members across the state. ''I don't need to be paid, either,'' she said. ''We're not Acorn.''
 The so-called Republican establishment is under great duress, if not siege. ''I do believe that our party has people trying to pull it in different directions,'' says Jim Greer, the chairman of the Florida Republican Party. I spoke to him before the Republican dinner in Pensacola. He was sitting in a holding room before Crist arrived.
 After he was elected governor in 2006, Crist picked Greer to be chairman of the party; Greer in turn says he supports Crist. ''We cannot be a party that is angry,'' Greer told me, sounding somewhat like a harassed substitute teacher getting pelted with spitballs from every direction. ''We can't be a party that doesn't provide leadership and solutions to the challenges.''
 Greer is the face of the Republican establishment in Florida -- and it is not a calm face. He has bulged eyes and reddened cheeks. Greer kept describing his predicament as ''challenging'' -- the go-to word these days for any public person loath to admit troublesome circumstances but who is clearly enduring them.
 ''I think there is a lack of understanding of what elected leaders are faced with when it comes to decision-making,'' Greer said, addressing the criticism Crist has received from conservatives. ''But at the end of the day, I think it's just all-around frustration with some in our party who have a very pure philosophy of how you should govern. People want a common-sense approach to governing. And approaching it with purity won't get anything done.'' (On Jan. 5, Greer announced that he would resign as party chairman in February.)
 Greer says he is convinced that Republicans will come together after the primary and support the nominee. Crist and Rubio have said they would support each other against Kendrick Meek, and there is no viable third-party candidate on the Florida horizon. Fred O'Neal, of the formal Florida Tea Party, told me that even if his group nominated its own candidate, it would ask him to quit if it appeared that he were helping Meek. 
 Yet there was a telling moment at the Pensacola dinner when Greer, following Crist on the program, put in his plug for party unity. ''The opposition is not in our party,'' Greer told the thinning crowd. ''It's the Democrats.'' Someone applauded, and Greer thanked him. ''At least one person agrees,'' he said.
 Bob Smith, a former Republican senator from New Hampshire who moved to Sarasota in 2003, is critical of Greer for favoring Crist in the primary: ''There is clearly a war going on in the Republican Party.'' Smith is a 68-year-old Vietnam veteran who jumped into this war himself recently by entering the Senate primary. ''The sooner the party's leadership recognizes that,'' he added, ''the better off they'll be.'' There are moderates and conservatives who will operate inside the party, he maintained, and a group of conservatives who operate independently of it -- ''the Tea Party folks,'' he said.
 Smith went on, ''I'm intent on showing people that I am the only one in this race with real-world experience and Senate experience.'' In his two terms -- from 1990 to 2002 -- Smith gained a reputation as a bit of an odd duck. He briefly declared himself an independent in 1999, and he also briefly endorsed John Kerry's presidential campaign in 2004 after charging that George W. Bush and his political guru Karl Rove ''broke their word'' to him by supporting his opponent in the 2002 Republican primary, John Sununu. (Smith later retracted the Kerry endorsement.)
 Smith is a major long shot to win the primary. He has been invisible in polls and has raised little money. But he could have an impact on the race, more likely to the detriment of Rubio by siphoning off anti-Crist voters. Smith is especially critical of Rubio, mentioning that Rubio spent public money getting his office renovated and also supported a publicly financed project that included the installation of artificial turf on a field where he happened to play flag football. Clearly Rubio wants no part of him -- he backed out of a scheduled forum in October in which he would have shared a stage with Smith (Crist was not there). 
 ''Who?'' Rubio said with a straight face when I asked him about Smith. He actually seemed startled by the question. 
 By contrast, Crist has started referring to ''my opponents.''
 One of Crist's gifts as a politician is that he gives exceedingly disciplined interviews -- also known as bland ones. He stays strenuously on message, refrains from asides and is big on platitudes. He is friendly and solicitous, to be sure -- always good about punctuating sentences with the name of the person he is addressing. ''You want some food, Mark?'' he asked me in November as he surveyed the cafeteria food at a nursing home for veterans in South Florida. ''There is some supremely good chow here,'' he said. (''I love peas!'' he boomed a few seconds later to a cafeteria worker.) 
 We repaired to a small library, next to the chapel. Crist wore a crisp navy suit and sipped from a can of Red Bull Sugarfree. A few days earlier, Bill Owens, a Democrat, had won a surprise victory in New York's 23rd Congressional District, a nationally resonant contest in which the Republican nominee, Dede Scozzafava, was deemed too moderate by a large number of conservatives (including national figures like Palin), who instead rallied to a third-party purist, the Conservative Party nominee, Doug Hoffman. Scozzafava dropped out a few days before the election. 
 I asked Crist what lesson he took from the New York race. ''The Democrat won,'' he said. ''It is the first time in over 100 years that a Republican has not represented that district. Beyond that, I don't know how much to take from it.'' 
 Here is how Rubio answered the same question: ''The only lesson,'' he told me, ''is that there is an active and organized conservative movement in America that is willing to take on the Republican establishment.''
 Both Rubio and Crist say that the Florida race would not be analogous to New York unless a third-party candidate ran in the general election. Even so, the purity-versus-pragmatism dynamic is at the root of the Florida race, as it was in New York. Crist says that being ''in the arena'' imposes a pragmatism on any elected leader. He mentioned his support for the stimulus bill. ''There is a significant difference between being a legislator and being the C.E.O. of a state,'' he said. ''You have a duty to the people.'' Crist points out that stimulus funds allowed 20,000 teachers in Florida to keep their jobs. ''I could have made a political statement and said, 'Well, too bad for you, teachers, I'm not going to take that money.' Well come on, I don't know what kind of a cold heart is able to do that. But I don't have a cold heart in my chest.'' 
 And while the photos of Crist hugging Obama might look bad (''I nearly lost my lunch,'' Huckabee told me), Crist said the hug was the ''civil and respectful'' thing to do. It was Obama's first visit to Florida as president. ''It's how I was raised,'' he said. ''It's the president of the United States. And I don't apologize for it.'' When Obama visited Jacksonville in October, the governor stayed away and said he did not know about the visit -- a claim later contradicted by e-mail messages obtained by The St. Petersburg Times.
 When I returned to Florida a few weeks later, Crist was enduring a series of small nicks. Scott Rothstein, a Fort Lauderdale lawyer who is one of Crist's friends and donors, had been arrested on federal charges of operating a $1.2 billion dollar Ponzi scheme. A few days before I arrived, it was reported that callers to Florida's KidCare hot line were being mistakenly redirected to a sex-chat line (''Hey there, sexy guy''). I mentioned this to Crist -- in the vein of, ''Governor, you can't buy a break'' -- and he winced. 
 ''It's all right,'' he said, taking a deep breath. ''It will work out.''
 Rubio's celebrity had continued to grow. I saw him get a raucous standing ovation after he spoke to Florida Tax Watch, a taxpayers-advocacy group, at the Breakers resort in Palm Beach. ''I see myself as the warm-up act to the Rolling Stones,'' said Florida's senate president, Jeff Atwater, who came on right before Rubio.
 Crist taped a video message to the group, but the sound system in the Ponce de Leon Ballroom kept coming on prematurely. ''I'm Charlie Crist,'' the deep, disjointed voice of the governor stuttered a few times over the loudspeaker during one of the other speeches. (My first thought was that this was some sort of prank, but it apparently was not.)
 As the race has tightened, Crist has attacked Rubio's conservative credentials on the environment, taxes and immigration, in a daily flurry of press releases. ''We are fully engaged now,'' says Eric Eikenberg, Crist's former chief of staff who recently took over the campaign. 
 Campaigns are ultimately decided by the practical and the tangible -- fund raising, organizing, votes. Crist has a large advantage in statewide organization and name recognition, even as he has suffered a free fall in polls in November and December. He raised nearly $8 million in the first three quarters of 2009, compared to $1.6 million for Rubio. It's also worth noting that grass-roots excitement and news-media attention do not automatically translate into a functional political organization -- a lesson many candidates have learned, most spectacularly Howard Dean in Iowa in 2004.
 In December, I went to visit Crist at the governor's mansion in Tallahassee on a Friday morning after leaving Pensacola at 5:30 a.m., stopping for breakfast at a Waffle House, passing a massive ''Pray for America'' billboard on I-10 and seeing my first Crist bumper sticker of the week -- in the town of Bagdad, Fla. Crist greeted me downstairs near the front entrance, smelling of cologne and looking morning fresh after his daily swim in a heated outdoor pool. He sat on a couch in the den and asked his personal assistant if she could adjust the overhead fan.
 ''That's a great question,'' Crist said after I asked him when it became toxic for Republicans to admit to being moderates. (Crist says everything is ''a great question.'') As if to underscore this toxicity, Crist bobbed his way through a sequence of questions about whether in fact there should be a place for moderates in the Republican Party.
 ''I hope there's room for a lot of people in the Republican Party,'' he told me.
 ''Yes, but what about moderates?'' I said.
 ''Uh, that's up for the people to decide,'' he said.
 There are scores of quiet and loyal Republicans who are turning out for his events, Crist said. In the end, he believes that his supporters will greatly outnumber (if not outshout) his detractors. The straw polls he is losing have very few participants anyway, he says -- when you put them all together, maybe a total of 1,000 votes. ''In a state like Florida, with almost 20 million people, that's not that much,'' he said -- a statement that Al Gore might not agree with.
 Crist told me that two of the senators he most admires are John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who have reputations for forging bipartisan alliances -- and who have drawn their share of hellfire from conservative purists. He also mentioned John Thune, the mild-mannered South Dakotan with a tan almost as impressive as his own (Crist claims no artificial help, by the way). He would model himself in the Senate after his mentor, Connie Mack, the former Republican senator from Florida for whom he once worked. ''This is a guy who is as principled as anyone I have ever met,'' Crist told me. ''And at the same time he was civil in how he comported himself.''
 Crist said he has not attended any tea parties and that he is not concerned about the hostility his name elicits at them. ''I have a job to do,'' he said. ''When I was elected governor, my job was to look out for the people of Florida, and that's what I'm doing. When you're in the cheapseats, it's easy to take political shots.''
 I asked Crist if his Tea Party critics are in ''the cheap seats.'' 
 No, he said. He meant his opponents.

HEADLINE: For Top Bonuses On Wall Street, 7 Figures or 8?

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Everyone on Wall Street is fixated on The Number. 
 The bank bonus season, that annual rite of big money and bigger egos, begins in earnest this week, and it looks as if it will be one of the largest and most controversial blowouts the industry has ever seen. 
 Bank executives are grappling with a question that exasperates, even infuriates, many recession-weary Americans: Just how big should their paydays be? Despite calls for restraint from Washington and a chafed public, resurgent banks are preparing to pay out bonuses that rival those of the boom years. The haul, in cash and stock, will run into many billions of dollars. 
 Industry executives acknowledge that the numbers being tossed around -- six-, seven- and even eight-figure sums for some chief executives and top producers -- will probably stun the many Americans still hurting from the financial collapse and ensuing Great Recession. 
 Goldman Sachs is expected to pay its employees an average of about $595,000 apiece for 2009, one of the most profitable years in its 141-year history. Workers in the investment bank of JPMorgan Chase stand to collect about $463,000 on average. 
 Many executives are bracing for more scrutiny of pay from Washington, as well as from officials like Andrew M. Cuomo, the attorney general of New York, who last year demanded that banks disclose details about their bonus payments. Some bankers worry that the United States, like Britain, might create an extra tax on bank bonuses, and Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio, is proposing legislation to do so. 
 Those worries aside, few banks are taking immediate steps to reduce bonuses substantially. Instead, Wall Street is confronting a dilemma of riches: How to wrap its eye-popping paychecks in a mantle of moderation. Because of the potential blowback, some major banks are adjusting their pay practices, paring or even eliminating some cash bonuses in favor of stock awards and reducing the portion of their revenue earmarked for pay. 
 Some bank executives contend that financial institutions are beginning to recognize that they must recalibrate pay for a post-bailout world. 
 ''The debate has shifted in the last nine months or so from just 'less cash, more stock' to 'what's the overall number?' '' said Robert P. Kelly, the chairman and chief executive of the Bank of New York Mellon. Like many other bank chiefs, Mr. Kelly favors rewarding employees with more long-term stock and less cash to tether their fortunes to the success of their companies. 
 Though Wall Street bankers and traders earn six-figure base salaries, they generally receive most of their pay as a bonus based on the previous year's performance. While average bonuses are expected to hover around half a million dollars, they will not be evenly distributed. Senior banking executives and top Wall Street producers expect to reap millions. Last year, the big winners were bond and currency traders, as well as investment bankers specializing in health care.
 Even some industry veterans warn that such paydays could further tarnish the financial industry's sullied reputation. John S. Reed, a founder of Citigroup, said Wall Street would not fully regain the public's trust until banks scaled back bonuses for good -- something that, to many, seems a distant prospect. 
 ''There is nothing I've seen that gives me the slightest feeling that these people have learned anything from the crisis,'' Mr. Reed said. ''They just don't get it. They are off in a different world.''
 The power that the federal government once had over banker pay has waned in recent months as most big banks have started repaying the billions of dollars in federal aid that propped them up during the crisis. All have benefited from an array of federal programs and low interest rate policies that enabled the industry to roar back in profitability in 2009. 
 This year, compensation will again eat up much of Wall Street's revenue. During the first nine months of 2009, five of the largest banks that received federal aid -- Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley -- together set aside about $90 billion for compensation. That figure includes salaries, benefits and bonuses, but at several companies, bonuses make up more than half of compensation.
 Goldman broke with its peers in December and announced that its top 30 executives would be paid only in stock. Nearly everyone on Wall Street is waiting to see how much stock is awarded to Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman's chairman and chief executive, who is a lightning rod for criticism over executive pay. In 2007, Mr. Blankfein was paid $68 million, a Wall Street record. He did not receive a bonus in 2008.
 Goldman put aside $16.7 billion for compensation during the first nine months of 2009. 
 Responding to criticism over its pay practices, Goldman has already begun decreasing the percentage of revenue that it pays to employees. The bank set aside 50 percent in the first quarter, but that figure fell to 48 percent and then to 43 percent in the next two quarters. 
 JPMorgan executives and board members have also been wrestling with how much pay is appropriate.
 ''There are legitimate conflicts between the firm feeling like it is performing well and the public's prevailing view that the Street was bailed out,'' said one senior JPMorgan executive who was not authorized to speak for the company. 
 JPMorgan's investment bank, which employs about 25,000 people, has already reduced the share of revenue going to the compensation pool, from 40 percent in the first quarter to 37 percent in the third quarter. 
 At Bank of America, traders and bankers are wondering how much Brian T. Moynihan, the bank's new chief, will be awarded for 2010. Bank of America, which is still absorbing Merrill Lynch, is expected to pay large bonuses, given the bank's sizable trading profits. 
 Bank of America has also introduced provisions that would enable it to reclaim employees' pay in the event that the bank's business sours, and it is increasing the percentage of bonuses paid in the form of stock. 
 ''We're paying for results, and there were some areas of the company that had terrific results, and they will be compensated for that,'' said Bob Stickler, a Bank of America spokesman. 
 At Morgan Stanley, which has had weaker trading revenue than the other banks, managers are focusing on how to pay stars in line with the industry. The bank created a pay program this year for its top 25 workers, tying a fifth of their deferred pay to metrics based on the company's later performance. 
 A company spokesman, Mark Lake, said: ''Morgan Stanley's board and management clearly understands the extraordinary environment in which we operate and, as a result, have made a series of changes to the firm's compensation practices.''
 The top 25 executives will be paid mostly in stock and deferred cash payments. John J. Mack, the chairman, is forgoing a bonus. He retired as chief executive at the end of 2009.
 At Citigroup, whose sprawling consumer banking business is still ailing, some managers were disappointed in recent weeks by the preliminary estimates of their bonus pools, according to people familiar with the matter. Citigroup's overall 2009 bonus pool is expected to be about $5.3 billion, about the same as it was for 2008, although the bank has far fewer employees.
 The highest bonus awarded to a Citigroup executive is already known: The bank said in a regulatory filing last week that the head of its investment bank, John Havens, would receive $9 million in stock. But the bank's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, is forgoing a bonus and taking a salary of just $1.

HEADLINE: Yours for Under $1 Million

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
TWO years ago, unemployment was around 5 percent, the average price paid for an apartment in Manhattan was nearing $1.7 million, and Eliot Spitzer had a good shot at becoming president. 
 ''For a while there, we had to tell people that if they wanted to buy a $1 million condo, they were looking at a one-bedroom,'' said Pamela Liebman, the president of the Corcoran Group. 
 Today, things look a bit different. 
 Now, $1 million will buy much more space -- even a three-bedroom apartment fine for raising a few children in the city. That price change can mean the difference between choosing to stay in the city and deciding to move to the suburbs. 
 Of course, you can still easily spend $3 million or $4 million on a three-bedroom in a doorman building on Park Avenue, and a ceiling of $1 million won't get you a Classic 6 on the Upper West Side. 
 But far more agreeably priced three-bedrooms are out there. And while they tend to be on the small side, the compromises they demand are not deal-breakers -- no mountain of stairs to climb, for instance. 
 There is, for example, a three-bedroom apartment for sale for $950,000 on the 15th floor of a doorman building at 444 East 75th Street and York Avenue. The apartment, 15DE -- a combination of two units, a studio and a two-bedroom -- is about 1,440 square feet, with lots of closet space, a small office and views of the East River. 
 The building does have drawbacks. Buses stop nearby, but it's a hike from the subway, and the maintenance is high, almost $3,000 a month. So the broker, Debra Hoffman-Brill, a vice president of the Corcoran Group, says she priced the apartment accordingly. 
 ''I have great affection for the building,'' said the seller, Bill Nolan, who served on the board for many years. ''It's just time for me to go.'' 
 Unfortunately for Mr. Nolan, this is an especially bad time to be selling a three-bedroom apartment. 
 According to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, the median price paid for a three-bedroom in Manhattan fell 42.0 percent, from $4.05 million the fourth quarter of 2008 to $2.35 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. In that same period, two-bedrooms fell 23.3 percent, one-bedrooms 7.6 percent, and studios 10.7 percent.
 But that big drop in the price of three-bedrooms does not mean that demand for them has dried up. It indicates that fewer large, pricey apartments -- the kinds of places that push average prices up -- have sold.
 The average size of the three-bedrooms that closed in the fourth quarter of 2008 in Manhattan was about 2,650 square feet. A year later, it was about 2,100 square feet. That's a 21 percent drop in size, which accounts for half the drop in price.
 ''These three-bedrooms are somewhere between the size of an average two- and an average three-bedroom,'' Mr. Miller said of the apartments selling today. ''There's more living space devoted to bedrooms than to a living room or a dining room.''
 Financing is one reason small three-bedroom apartments move faster than larger ones. Getting a mortgage is still difficult, especially when it comes to nonconforming, or ''jumbo'' mortgages, which in Manhattan is anything over $729,750. 
 ''People are looking to trade up from a one- or a two-bedroom and still qualify for a mortgage,'' Mr. Miller said. 
 Brokers are advising sellers to price their apartments below $1 million to make it easier for buyers to secure financing, and also so that buyers can avoid the 1 percent mansion tax that kicks in at that threshold. 
 At 112 West 72nd Street, Apartment 7BC, a three-bedroom, was originally priced at $1.1 million, which would have required the buyer to pay a mansion tax of about $11,000. But after six weeks, the sellers dropped the price to $995,000. 
 ''People get really caught up psychologically over this 1 percent tax,'' said Jessica Cohen, an executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, and the lead broker on the apartment. ''We wanted to open up the buyer pool to get a qualified buyer more quickly.'' 
 But Apartment 7BC is a combination of a small two-bedroom and a studio, so the living spaces are meager -- the apartment measures only about 1,000 square feet. It also needs to be renovated. Still, it is in a prewar building on the Upper West Side with excellent subway access. The common charge is $689 and the real estate taxes are $712. 
 If you don't mind living a bit farther from the subway, you might be able to get some of that space back. 
 A three-bedroom apartment at 568 Grand Street, on the Lower East Side, is on the market through Halstead Property for $899,000. On the seventh floor, it has about 1,600 square feet, two bathrooms and a balcony. 
 This apartment is one of about 1,700 units in the East River Housing Corporation co-op, a four-building complex built in the 1950s by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. 
 ''If you're willing to be a 10- to 15-minute walk from the train,'' said Jeremy Bolger, a vice president of Halstead Property, ''it's pretty much the best value you're going to get for your dollar -- in lower Manhattan, at least.'' 
 Or you can look uptown. At 370 West 118th Street in Harlem, a three-bedroom is listed at $770,000. In a prewar building, the condo has two bathrooms, a washer dryer and Morningside Park views. At about 1,100 square feet, it has a common charge of $591.73 a month, and a tax abatement until 2034.
 ''You're under $600 a month'' in common charges, said Goldine Eismann, an agent at Halstead Property, the exclusive agent on the property. ''Once people can come up with the financing, then they won't have all this extra burden besides their mortgage.''
 Three-bedroom apartments for less than $1 million may also be had in sought-after parts of Brooklyn --even some for less than $750,000. A small three-bedroom at 656 Baltic Street, on the edge of Park Slope, for example, is listed at $725,000. 
 The apartment was put up for sale in May, at $799,000. But sales in the building have been slow going, in part because 656 Baltic, 1980s construction, was empty, having been completely remodeled by a developer. Most banks won't lend to potential buyers in a building until a certain percentage of the project is sold -- sometimes as much as 70 percent.
 The building on Baltic has three apartments, and two are now in contract. The remaining unit, a three-bedroom with a balcony, is just under 1,100 square feet. 
 The broker, Teri Cavanaugh of the Corcoran Group, says banks have told her that financing should be available. ''Because it's a three-unit building, it was difficult for a while to get that first person to sign a contract,'' Ms. Cavanaugh said. ''It's just been a trying year.'' 
 ''And now,'' she added, ''we've finally got traction.''

HEADLINE: Obama Urges Quick Action On Overhaul

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama said Saturday that Americans would see immediate benefits from a landmark overhaul of the nation's health insurance system, and he urged Congress to reconcile swiftly differences on the legislation so it could be signed into law in the coming weeks. 
 ''Once I sign health insurance reform into law, doctors and patients will have more control over their health care decisions, and insurance company bureaucrats will have less,'' Mr. Obama said. ''All told, these changes represent the most sweeping reforms and toughest restrictions on insurance companies that this country has ever known.''
 In his weekly Saturday address, Mr. Obama highlighted elements of the plan that would take effect soon after enactment of the bill. 
 He said people with pre-existing illnesses would be able to buy affordable insurance, children with pre-existing conditions would no longer be denied coverage and small-business owners who could not afford to cover employees would receive tax credits to buy insurance.
 ''What every American should know is that once I sign health insurance reform into law, there are dozens of protections and benefits that will take effect this year,'' Mr. Obama said.
 Most of the proposed changes in the bill would not take effect until 2014, but the president used his weekly address to try to raise the urgency for the legislation.
 The competing versions of the plan in the House and Senate would require most Americans to get health insurance and would provide subsidies for those who could not afford it. 
 But significant differences remain over how to accomplish that goal, including what taxes would be raised.
 In his address, the president said the health insurance overhaul was needed to improve the economic fortunes for the nation's middle class.
 ''We need to rebuild our economy in such a way that our families can feel a measure of security again,'' Mr. Obama said.

HEADLINE: Ford's Bet: It's a Small World After All

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich. 

 BODY:
 HE blew into the Ford Motor Company in 2006 as an outsider from a different industry, and he was hailed as the latest in a long line of purported saviors of a faltering, century-old automotive icon.
 At the time, skeptics in the clubby world of auto executives whispered that the newcomer, Alan R. Mulally, would be swallowed up by the complexities of the car business, his ebullient personality smothered by the feudal infighting for which Ford had long been famous.
 Yet three years into his tenure as chief executive -- and with a host of still nettlesome challenges awaiting him -- Mr. Mulally has thus far proved to be the unifying figure that Ford has needed for decades.
 His vision is distilled in the laminated, wallet-size cards carried by tens of thousands of Ford employees that spell out his management principles beneath a simple heading: ''One Ford ... One Team ... One Plan ... One Goal.'' And on Monday, at the opening press conference of the 2010 Detroit auto show, Mr. Mulally will unveil the car that embodies his strategy for returning Ford to its status as a leader in the global auto industry. 
 That car, the new Ford Focus, is arguably as important to Mr. Mulally as the Model T was to Henry Ford, the founder. Despite some previous efforts, the Focus is Ford's first truly global car -- a single vehicle designed and engineered for customers in every region of the world and sold under one name. It is small, fuel-efficient and packed with technology and safety features that, Mr. Mulally believes, will appeal to consumers in Europe, Asia and the Americas.
 The car also represents what Mr. Mulally calls the ''proof point'' of everything he has done since joining Ford after a 37-year career with Boeing: he hopes that the vehicle will provide a rolling blueprint for generations of Ford cars to come.
 ''If we were going to be world-class, we needed to pull together and leverage and use our global assets around the world to create a powerhouse 'One Ford,' '' he said in an interview in his office at Ford's headquarters. ''It's exactly why we are here.''
 In an industry populated by naysayers and familiar with wrenching disappointment, Mr. Mulally's doubters have largely disappeared because he has already delivered more than what was expected of him when he replaced Ford's chairman, William C. Ford Jr., as chief executive.
 One of Mr. Mulally's first, prescient acts in 2006 was to borrow $24 billion, which later gave Ford the cash it needed to stave off the government-sponsored bankruptcies of its crosstown rivals General Motors and Chrysler. He has also shifted Ford's emphasis away from trucks and sport utility vehicles to cars and crossover vehicles, and dumped luxury brands like Land Rover, Jaguar and Aston-Martin that were consuming Ford's resources and distracting management.
 Perhaps most important, Ford has shrunk drastically, shedding jobs and factories to better align its production with demand. For decades, Ford executives and workers labored inside a bureaucracy that made decision-making cumbersome and often undermined dexterous responses to market shifts. It was a system that also withstood repeated efforts by others to streamline it. 
 But under Mr. Mulally's hand -- and in response to a downturn that threatened the very existence of Detroit's Big Three -- Ford has finally started to run a tighter ship.
 All of this is beginning to show up in Ford's bottom line. It reported $1 billion in earnings in the third quarter of 2009, its first profitable quarter in nearly two years. Mr. Mulally, however, says he doesn't expect Ford to become ''consistently'' profitable until 2011. (Coincidentally, that's when the new Focus will begin appearing in sizable volumes in the United States and Europe.)
 While the Focus is only one of several new products on the way, it is the centerpiece of Ford's transformation from a truck-heavy manufacturer to a producer of smaller, lighter and more environmentally friendly passenger cars. 
 The impact of the Focus on Ford's global operations is even more significant. While Ford has been an international company since early in the 20th century, its overseas divisions have long operated as semiautonomous units geared to individual markets.
 In the 1990s, Alexander Trotman, then its chief executive, developed a plan called Ford 2000 to standardize some vehicles around the world. The new system saved money, but the products it yielded were successes in some markets and flops in others. The initiative was summarily dropped by Mr. Trotman's successor, Jacques A. Nasser.
 Upon his arrival, Mr. Mulally took his own shot at knitting together Ford's far-flung operations, seeking the economies of scale that a ''world car'' could bring.
 ''Why are we doing it this way?'' he asks. ''Because we believe the customer requirements are going to be more the same around the world than they are different.''
 INDUSTRY analysts have long derided Detroit automakers as being overly fixated on the United States market and unable to see how vehicles designed for Europeans and Asians could appeal to American consumers.
 ''There's nothing revolutionary about selling the same car around the world,'' says John Casesa, an industry consultant. ''Toyota does it. BMW does it. But the Detroit companies were always disproportionately run around their North American strategy.''
 In that regard, the Focus is Ford's first big bet that it can effectively sell a single, largely uniform car -- with variations to come later -- in several global markets. Currently, the company has three engineering ''platforms'' serving what the industry calls the C-car segment -- essentially, compact vehicles the size of a Toyota Corolla or a Honda Civic. The three platforms account for annual sales of about 1.1 million vehicles, although the various models are substantially different inside and out.
 The new Focus is built on one platform for all markets, from Shanghai to Seville to Seattle. The platform is also flexible enough that it can be adapted for different body styles, whether hatchbacks or small crossover vehicles.
 Within a few years, Ford expects to sell as many as two million vehicles a year off the new C-car platform and to save billions of dollars in costs by avoiding multiple platforms.
 ''The Focus represents the first tangible evidence of a global strategy,'' says Mr. Casesa. ''For the first time, Ford is executing it and not just talking about it.''
 A YOUTHFUL-LOOKING 64-year-old with close-cropped red hair and a toothy smile, Mr. Mulally is relentlessly optimistic and perpetually in motion. Educated in engineering at the University of Kansas, a father of five and married for nearly 40 years, he can be so exuberant that he'll sometimes hug people the first time he meets them.
 But Ford executives quickly learned that beneath that sunny disposition was a demanding and competitive executive.
 ''The very first conversation I had with Alan was around the opportunities that we had never taken full advantage of here at Ford,'' says Derrick M. Kuzak, a 30-year Ford veteran and the head of global product development.
 Mr. Mulally saw Ford as a messy conglomerate of brands, divisions and international businesses that obscured its best asset: the Ford brand and its blue oval badge.
 Why, he asked executives repeatedly, did the company insist on pouring money and resources into Volvos and Jaguars when its Ford product line was a mishmash of Mustangs, S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks?
 ''We made a strategic decision to move from a house of brands to a laser focus on Ford,'' Mr. Mulally says. ''That brand clarity was going to be absolutely essential and a competitive advantage.''
 He was also prepared to stake Ford's future on a thesis that consumers around the world are becoming more and more alike, and that what they want in a car is the same in China and India as it is in Germany or the United States.
 After all, customers in disparate markets were already showing preferences for the same attributes in cars: safety, technology, fuel efficiency and appearance. The Internet was allowing car buyers everywhere to pore over the specifications of vehicles available in the United States or Europe, enabling consumers in developing countries to home in on quality products in mature markets and empowering them not to settle for lesser products.
 ''Everybody knows everything, and everybody knows what's available,'' says Mr. Mulally. ''You look at the reasons people buy vehicles, and all those requirements are coming together.''
 The first planning sessions for the global Focus kicked off in late 2007, a year after Mr. Mulally came aboard. He told executives that it was crucial to design a single model that could serve many markets, and challenged the conventional wisdom that parts of the car had to be tailor-made for different regions of the world.
 Gunnar Herrmann, head of the Focus project, recalled how Mr. Mulally kept referring to his years of developing airplanes that were the same no matter where they flew.
 ''He said, you guys are always doing multiple doors on these cars; at Boeing, we have only one door,'' Mr. Herrmann remembers.
 Mr. Kuzak and Mr. Herrmann were assigned to create a development team that had European engineers and designers at its core, but also included members from Asia and the Americas. Mr. Herrmann assigned the team to develop a ''program paper'' that laid out projections for production volumes, market-share targets and competition. He says he ended up receiving a hefty document larded with traditional Ford approaches to doing business. 
 The paper was 150 pages long and contained separate analyses for Europe, Asia and North America. Rather than zeroing in on common goals for the three regions, the sections emphasized the differences. Mr. Herrmann says he threw it back at the team. ''Where is the common denominator here, so we can do a single car?'' he recalls asking.
 His boss, Mr. Kuzak, had spent his three decades with Ford working here and abroad and was keenly aware of how the company's past practices could weigh it down -- and how important it was to embrace Mr. Mulally's emphasis on global product development.
 ''It would allow us to bring our vehicles to market quicker than we have ever been able to do in the past,'' Mr. Kuzak says. ''The benefits were in the neighborhood of 25 percent to almost 50 percent quicker time to market.''
 So the Focus team ended up rallying around a few main objectives. The car had to drive and handle like a European sedan and have the creature comforts like wireless Internet access that American consumers demanded. 
 When it came to designing the exterior of the vehicle, the team faced a quandary. Whereas European and American buyers appreciate flair, Chinese consumers, in particular, have more conservative tastes. In the past, Mr. Herrmann, said, Ford would have designed separate bumpers and headlights for the different markets. That approach, however, wouldn't fly with Mr. Mulally.
 In the end, the Focus team came up with a front end with a low-set, three-part grille and tapered headlights. The look is striking but not too flashy, and the team was given freer rein to make the hatchback version sportier than the four-door sedan model.
 TOWARD the end of 2008, Ford conducted dozens of market research clinics with potential customers in several countries. In the clinics, the team learned that it could tailor the interior of the Focus for different regions by simply changing colors and materials rather than pursuing larger design changes that would have been more complex and expensive to manufacture.
 The development process entered the home stretch last April, when the first prototypes were presented to Mr. Kuzak for a test drive. Beyond look and feel, he was focused on sound: he wanted to be sure the car was quiet when driven.''We needed to elevate customers' perception of our cars,'' he says. ''When I drive the vehicle, I am the customer. We needed it to be refined.''
 The team gathered at the company's test track in Lommel, Belgium, on the day Mr. Kuzak came to test the Focus. ''Any time the boss drives the prototype, you think, 'I hope we survive this,' '' says Mr. Herrmann. But after he had driven the car, Mr. Kuzak broke into a big smile. ''They exceeded my expectations,'' Mr. Kuzak recalls.
 THE Focus is also serving as a laboratory for sweeping changes in how Ford markets its vehicles. Ford's previous C-car models had not only different and distinct engineering platforms, but also as many as 20 advertising campaigns. James Farley, Ford's global marketing chief, said the new Focus would have just four or five ad strategies around the world.
 Mr. Farley says that in the past, Ford had to shape the ads based on vehicles' differences. Now, any variation will be based on the campaign's audience.
 ''This is not a one-size-fits-all effort,'' he cautions. ''But the diversity of the marketing is created by the customers we want to reach, and not by the differences in the vehicles.''
 Analysts view the Focus project as a significant step forward for a company that, for years, had been burdened by the weight of its own complexity. Aaron Bragman, an analyst with IHS Global Insight, compared the new direction to Toyota's systemic approach of building high-quality vehicles that have a singular identity and global appeal.
 ''In its history, Toyota's growth was basically organic,'' says Mr. Bragman. ''They used the same production system everywhere, and sold the same cars everywhere. Their success was all in the execution.''
 For his part, Mr. Mulally has long been an unabashed admirer of Toyota, and he relishes the comparison. He also makes no apologies for Ford's dependence in the past on selling pickup trucks and big S.U.V.'s to earn profits. With the new Focus and other passenger cars in the product pipeline, he expects to compete head-on with Toyota, Honda and other leaders in the car market.
 That won't be easy. Japanese auto companies still dominate the small-car segment in the United States, and their customers have proved very loyal to the brands. G.M., now out of bankruptcy and well financed with government money, is also laying the groundwork for its own product offensive. 
 Moreover, Ford has yet to prove it can command healthy prices for cars that were historically sold on the cheap.
 ''The biggest issue that Ford is going to have to deal with is convincing hundreds of thousands of people to pay premium prices for small cars that used to be a bargain,'' says Joseph Phillippi, a principal of Auto Trends Consulting.
 Mr. Mulally promises that Ford is up to the challenge. ''We can make cars and make them profitable,'' he says. ''You know how much money Toyota has made on cars? The new Ford can make money on all of its vehicles.''
 He concedes that Ford's rebirth is a work in progress. But within three years, as many as 80 percent of Ford's products will be built on global platforms, Mr. Mulally says. It is the essence of a strategy to simplify a sprawling, complicated company, leverage its still vast resources and talent, and try to change its direction forever.
 The company must still show that it can earn profits quarter after quarter, and not allow its costs to creep up in its pursuit of more sales worldwide. And Mr. Mulally has to be wary of overconfidence after his recent success. ''There's no question that he has to keep the pressure on constantly,'' says Mr. Phillippi.
 Ford did dodge the bankruptcy bullet that hit G.M. and Chrysler, and many consumers are gravitating to it precisely because the company did not need a government bailout. That momentum should help as it brings new cars like the Focus to its dealer showrooms. 
 What Ford won't do is change direction again, at least not under Mr. Mulally's watch. He promises that he -- and Ford's 200,000 employees -- will not waver from his ''point of view'' about the future of the auto industry.
 ''That is what strategy is all about,'' he says. ''It's about a point of view about the future and then making decisions based on that. The worst thing you can do is not have a point of view, and not make decisions.''

HEADLINE: Time for a Repair Job And a Reality Check

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
''DETROIT'' is shorthand for the American automobile industry in the way that Hollywood is a catch-all term for movies and television. Just as the studios don't make many films in Hollywood anymore, automakers don't build many cars in Detroit. Yet like its Tinseltown counterpart, the Motor City remains a beacon, even if the glow has dimmed. 
 Comparisons to Detroit's past glories are inevitable as the industry gathers downtown for the 2010 North American International Auto Show. Two days of press previews start Monday -- the show is open to the public Jan. 16-24 -- and organizers promise at least 40 new models. (Caveat: at auto shows, the word ''new'' is liberally applied.)
This year, beneath the manufactured hoopla and forced enthusiasm, the mood could be almost post-apocalyptic: Pontiac and Saturn have vanished. Saab's death seems imminent. The Chinese are buying Hummer. General Motors and Chrysler, each trying to rise after being laid low by bankruptcy, will come to the party without top hat or tails; Chrysler will not formally introduce any production-ready cars; G.M. will have only a couple. 
 Chrysler used to be the king of car show choreography, staging elaborate model introductions -- minivans playing leapfrog, Jeeps crashing through convention-hall windows, cattle drives through the streets. This year, the company has not scheduled even a single news conference. Instead, its Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep vehicles will share a display area with its new overseer, Fiat.
 This show may lack some of the usual air of anticipation, not to mention smoke machines, pulsing music and glamorous models pulling sheets off pie-in-the-sky concept cars.
 Other international auto shows have been taking their lumps as well. The 2009 British Motor Show was canceled, Frankfurt was downsized and non-Japanese automakers pulled out of Tokyo. But the reigning shows may not be losing relevance so much as they are being stretched to the breaking point by their proliferation. 
 Not long ago there was a core of blockbuster events: Detroit, Geneva, Frankfurt, Tokyo. These have been joined by shows in emerging markets that aspire to prominence -- in Australia, China, India and the Middle East.
 Manufacturers are struggling to come up with enough new models and concept cars -- crowd-pleasing design studies that often provide hints of future vehicles -- to promote at so many shows. So they are increasingly trying to engage the public with alternatives like simulators, hands-on exhibits and interactive displays.
 ''You will notice that Ford will have not one concept vehicle on the floor this year -- not one,'' said Marisa Bradley, Ford's manager for the Detroit show. ''Instead we are focusing on real vehicles, in real time, that are the real deal.''
 Sam Locricchio, a spokesman for the Detroit show's organizers, said the event's darkest hour probably came last year when the economy seemed to be on the precipice and auto sales were plunging. Things are looking up, he said, for 2010.
 ''The world didn't think we could pull off the show last year, but it not only survived but surprised,'' Mr. Locricchio said in an e-mail message. ''This year, I don't think we would ever say, 'Yup, hard times are done!' But, there is a certain spirit of, if not all-out optimism, certainly direction.''
 Ford, which withstood Detroit's cataclysm and didn't take a government bailout, brought out 14 new or revised models last year. But did that spurt leave the model pipeline nearly empty?
 ''No, not true at all,'' Ms. Bradley said. She pointed to the redesigned Focus compact that will be revealed at Detroit, as well as a freshened Lincoln MKX crossover. ''We will have no shortage of new vehicles and new technologies.''
 In an example of the trend toward direct public engagement, G.M. will have a driving route around Cobo Center, where the show takes place, so consumers can try its cars. (Alas, the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid will not be offered.)
 Inside Cobo, G.M. has tried to revamp its 85,000-square-foot exhibit so that visitors won't see the ghosts of Hummer, Pontiac, Saturn and Saab. Filling those holes will be interactive displays and exhibits of new technology like direct-injection engines and the Volt's electric propulsion system. In contrast to Ford, G.M. plans to roll out concept cars from each of its four remaining brands (Buick, Cadillac, Chevy and GMC). 
 Cobo has itself changed since last year's touch-and-go show, which several manufacturers abandoned at the last minute. German automakers threatened a mass exodus over the center's faulty wiring, malfunctioning heating and air-conditioning, leaking roof, clogged toilets and inoperative security and fire-safety systems. Organizers have overseen some $3 million in repairs and other improvements to Cobo in recent weeks; millions of additional dollars in upgrades are promised.
 Although Porsche still refuses to show vehicles here -- the company says it doesn't sell enough cars to Detroiters -- other German brands will be represented. BMW is showing a new hybrid, the Concept ActiveE, Mercedes-Benz will formally introduce the E-Class Cabriolet and Audi will display its redesigned A8 flagship sedan.
 Most automakers, it seems, are just happy to be back -- to have survived. But they have fewer new models: many were canceled or put on hold for financial reasons. And the industry is trying to make a transition to greener cars.
 That transition will be prominent. The basement, usually packed with start-ups, customizers, accessory companies and small foreign automakers, will instead feature a short EcoXperience driving route for green vehicles. On the main floor, an eclectic mix of electric vehicles will populate a new Electric Avenue display.
 These E.V.'s, along with hybrids and other alternative vehicles, are likely to be stars at the show: Audi, BMW, Hyundai, Tesla and Toyota will be among those offering glimpses of high-mileage cars of the not-so-distant future.
 Kurt Antonius, a spokesman for American Honda, which will unveil its CR-Z hybrid sports coupe here, said: ''This is really two auto shows. One is for the public; some huge percentage of auto show attendees are within six months of actually buying a car. That is an absolutely prime demographic for us -- one we can't find anywhere else.
 ''The other show is for the industry. As an industry gathering, Detroit has no equal. It is the place to see and be seen. In that regard, it really is like a premiere in Hollywood.''

HEADLINE: Origin of the Species, From an Alien View

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
WHERE did humankind come from?
 If you're going to ask Zecharia Sitchin, be ready for a ''Planet of the Apes'' scenario: spaceships and hieroglyphics, genetic mutations and mutinous space aliens in gold mines.
 It sounds like science fiction, but Mr. Sitchin is sure this is how it all went down hundreds of thousands of years ago in Mesopotamia. Humans were genetically engineered by extraterrestrials, he said, pointing to ancient texts to prove it. 
 In Mr. Sitchin's Upper West Side kitchen, evolution and creationism collide. He is an apparently sane, sharp, University of London-educated 89-year-old who has spent his life arguing that people evolved with a little genetic intervention from ancient astronauts who came to Earth and needed laborers to mine gold to bring back to Nibiru, a planet we have yet to recognize.
 Outlandish, yes, but also somehow intriguing from this cute, distinguished old man whom you may have seen shuffling slowly down Broadway with his cane, and thought, ''Is Art Carney still alive?''
 So you bring your laptop to his kitchen table, as if to take dictation, and ask what to write about him. He pads slowly to the stove and puts on the kettle.
 ''Well, you could start by calling me the most controversial 89-year-old man in New York,'' Mr. Sitchin says. ''Or you could just say I write books. I understand you've got to have an opening sentence, but describing my theories in a sentence, or even something like a newspaper article, is impossible. It will make me look silly.''
 Mr. Sitchin has been called silly before -- by scientists, historians and archaeologists who dismiss his theories as pseudoscience and fault their underpinnings: his translations of ancient texts and his understanding of physics. And yet, he has a devoted following of readers.
 His 13 books, with names like ''Genesis Revisited'' and ''The Earth Chronicles,'' have sold millions of copies and been translated into 25 languages. ''And Albanian is coming,'' he notes, spooning the Taster's Choice into two mugs.
 Mr. Sitchin himself represents a remarkable feat of urban evolution that often goes unnoticed. He lives alone, in the sprawling prewar apartment he has inhabited for 54 years, maintaining his independence by relying on the infrastructure many Manhattanites take for granted. 
 He works away on his latest book, answers fan mail, and at midday, reaches for his cane, floppy hat and overcoat, and rides the elevator down from the second floor to the lobby. The doorman hails him a cab for the $4 ride to a nearby diner, Cafe Eighty Two on Broadway, for the lunch special, the chicken gyro, where there are other elderly people doing the same.
 The Upper West Side is Mr. Sitchin's Mesopotamia, Broadway a fertile valley. He has Lincoln Center, Zabar's, Fairway, dry cleaners that deliver and a galaxy of take-out restaurants. For research, the New York Public Library is down on 42nd Street, and the archives of the Jewish Theological Seminary up on Broadway at 122nd Street.
 ''In Florida, if you don't have a car, you might as well lay down and die,'' he said. ''I've been all over the Western world and I know of no other place where an older person like myself can survive on his own. I raise my hand, and my chauffeured car -- a yellow cab -- takes me anywhere. I can call any restaurant or store and get what I need delivered in minutes.''
 He slides over a cup of coffee in a mug with a 30th anniversary logo for ''The Twelfth Planet,'' his seminal first book, now in its 45th printing. It stated his basic theory, based largely on his reading of texts preserved on clay tablets from the pre-Babylonian era in ancient Mesopotamia, the so-called cradle of the civilization of Sumer.
 Born in Russia and raised in Israel, Mr. Sitchin studied economics in London and worked as a journalist and editor in Israel before moving to New York in 1952. Here, he was an executive at a shipping company and, with his wife of 66 years (she died in 2007), raised two daughters. He spent his free time studying, leading archaeological tours to ancient sites and spreading his unusual gospel.
 Starting in childhood, he has studied ancient Hebrew, Akkadian and Sumerian, the language of the ancient Mesopotamians, who brought you geometry, astronomy, the chariot and the lunar calendar. And in the etchings of Sumerian pre-cuneiform script -- the oldest example of writing -- are stories of creation and the cosmos that most consider myth and allegory, but that Mr. Sitchin takes literally. 
 In his kitchen, Mr. Sitchin pulled two Danish out of a Zabar's bag and began to explain. It starts with the planet Nibiru, whose long, elliptical orbit brings it near Earth once every 3,600 years or so. The planet's inhabitants were technologically advanced humanlike beings, Mr. Sitchin said, standing about nine feet tall. Some 450,000 years ago, they detected reserves of gold in southeast Africa and made a colonial expedition to Earth, splashing down in what is now the Persian Gulf.
 Mr. Sitchin said these Nibiru-ites recruited laborers from Earth's erect primates to build eight great cities. Enki, who became the Sumerians' god of science, bestowed some of the Nibiru-ites' advanced genetic makeup upon these bipeds so they could work as miners.
 This is how Mr. Sitchin explains what scientists attribute to evolution. He says the aliens' cities were washed away in a great flood 30,000 years ago, after which they began passing on their knowledge to humans. He showed a photograph of a woodcarving from 7,000 B.C. of a large man handing over a plow to a smaller man: Ah, the passing on of agricultural knowledge. Anyway, he said, the Nibiru-ites finally jetted home in their spacecraft, around 550 B.C.
 ''This is in the texts; I'm not making it up,'' Mr. Sitchin said, finishing his coffee. ''They wanted to create primitive workers from the homo erectus and give him the genes to allow him to think and use tools.''
 He showed photographs of ancient Sumerian carvings and etchings showing what he said were alien gods dressed in space helmets and suits. He pointed to something he called Nibiru in diagrams of the solar system.
 Quite a theory -- has he sold it to Hollywood?
 ''Oh no, not yet,'' he said solemnly. ''I'm waiting for Spielberg.''

HEADLINE: Peacefully Adrift As the Big River Just Rolls Along

BYLINE: By PAUL SCHNEIDER. 
PAUL SCHNEIDER is the author, most recently, of ''Bonnie and Clyde: The Lives Behind the Legend.''

 BODY:
THE same drifting log had caught up with our kayaks again. It was sometime during our third day on the Mississippi River, or was it the fourth day, or the second or fifth? I'd lost myself again in a silent reverie, allowing my kayak to spin lazily along the great river's western shoreline, like a bright yellow leaf with some kind of exotic beetle in a life vest perched in the middle of it. 
 The current turned the bow first toward the unbroken line of trees and the muddy banks covered with mysterious animal tracks. Then to the downriver view, with my son's kayak similarly gyrating a hundred yards ahead, beneath the limestone bluffs of the Missouri shore. Then across the nearly mile-wide glassy black river to the line of hazy sky and thin band of flat green on the far side that looked more like an Amazon shore than Illinois. Countless swallows dipped and dived. How much time had passed on this particular spiral drift? A half-hour? A million years? Who knew? Who cared? ''Peace, like a river,'' goes the old hymn. 
 The Mississippi is full of driftwood, large and small, but I thought I recognized the log passing by in the current of the main channel, 75 yards away, because its stumpy branch sticking up aft and a smaller one forward had reminded me of the George Caleb Bingham painting of a fur trader and his cat in a flatboat. Now it had somehow found a sweet line of lesser resistance and was cruising in mid-river right past me, as if it were late for a board meeting down in Memphis or Baton Rouge. 
 I dug in with my paddle. ''Come on,'' I said as I passed both son and log, ''let's put some muscle into it for a while.'' With surprisingly little effort, barely more than letting the weight of the paddle fall into the water on either side, a sea kayak can be kept fairly ripping along in the Mississippi current at a very satisfying seven miles an hour. In no time the fur trading log was far behind us and we were speeding on toward ... toward ... toward ... 
 The truth is, my 15-year-old son and I didn't have specific destinations in mind on this kayaking trip in June. We hadn't come to the Mississippi to prove or conquer anything. We just came to see what the most storied river in America had to offer a couple of supplicants with plastic boats and a week and a half with which to play. 
 We put in a few miles south of St. Louis but we didn't know precisely how far we were going to go down the Father of Waters. We didn't know whether we were going to camp every night on islands and sandbars, or stay in the small towns along the way. We didn't know whether we were going to paddle hard to put miles under the hull or drift along like Huck (him?) and Jim (me?). It didn't matter. The point was to experience the Mississippi from water level. 
 The Old Man, of course, was rolling on toward New Orleans, but we had no intention of going even a tenth that far. All we knew for certain was that we were headed toward that next corner there, and then around it to whatever lay beyond. With our holds full of power bars and instant oatmeal, we were hoping for sunshine but ready for rain.
 Having no strict plan in place did not mean no planning was done, of course. With about 2,300 miles of river to choose from, we had to decide which section to paddle. We settled on the stretch just below St. Louis, in part because above St. Louis the Army Corps of Engineers has bottled up the river with locks and dams that stretch all the way to Minneapolis, making it more of a series of extremely pretty lakes than a rolling river.
 What's more, Missouri and Illinois are where, in a 190-mile stretch, the three great tributaries of the Mississippi come together. The Missouri, the Upper Mississippi and the Ohio can each lay some claim to being the true source of the mighty lower river of myth and mud: the roughly 1,300-mile Upper Mississippi, the river of the Great North Woods, has the historical claim to the name, but the Missouri, the ''river of the West,'' is, at more than 2,000 miles, the longest of the three by far.
 The 980-mile Ohio, meanwhile, the line between slave and free and more recently the corroding keel of the industrial heartland, brings more water to the party than the other two combined. So we chose the stretch from St. Louis downriver to Cairo, Ill., where the Ohio comes in.
 For weeks before our departure I amused myself plotting waypoints into my little hand-held GPS unit. I selected likely stopovers from topographical maps, looked up satellite photos and downloaded navigational charts. I cut and pasted and Googled, creating a personal guide with likely campsites and historical places to visit. Then, a few days before we were set to leave (driving from the East Coast), I called Hoppies Marina in Imperial, Mo., where I hoped we could park the car while we were on the river.
 ''This is Hoppie,'' said a friendly male voice belonging to Charles Hopkins. ''I suppose it would be fine to leave your truck here,'' he said. ''But, you know, that river is up. It's just about at flood in St. Louis right now, and the Corps says it will be at flood tomorrow.'' 
 Flood? Blithely assuming that by mid-June the river would be down in its summer mode, I had not even bothered to check the Corps of Engineers Web site that gives daily water levels. A quick check confirmed that the reading at St. Louis was 29 feet and rising toward flood level, 30 feet. The ''technical'' flood level does not mean water in the streets of river towns, but Mr. Hopkins explained that it did mean that all the pretty sandbars and campsites I had scoped out online would be underwater.
 It meant as well that the current would be swifter and angrier about the countless submerged rock groins, jetties and other ''improvements'' constructed by the Corps of Engineers to keep the lower river navigable. It meant, in Mr. Hopkins's opinion, that we shouldn't be getting on the river in human-powered boats. ''You want that reading at around 15 feet in St. Louis,'' he advised. ''That's when the rock dikes come out of the water.'' 
 We delayed our departure a few days and then did some exploring on land. In Davenport, Iowa, we ate krautdogs and watched the Quad Cities River Bandits play their Clinton, Iowa, rivals, the LumberKings, before a nearly sold-out home crowd. With the river as a backdrop, Modern Woodmen Park is arguably the prettiest modernized ballpark in all of professional baseball. ''We don't have to look retro,'' says the team owner, David Heller. ''Our ballpark was built in 1931 with W.P.A. funds. We are retro.''
 We made the Mark Twain pilgrimage to Hannibal, Mo., where we saw and genuflected at ''the house,'' ''the fence,'' ''the cave'' and ''the cabin.'' Our favorite part was the homemade root beer and biscuits with gravy at the Mark Twain Family Restaurant.
 By the time we got to St. Louis, the river was at 19 feet and dropping. We gave it one more day, going first to the astonishing Gateway Arch, which, like the moonshots of the era when it was built, leaves one wondering whether it is the technical or the political achievement that seems the more improbable by today's standards. The architect, Eero Saarinen, supposedly wanted to build a monument that would last a thousand years.
 In the afternoon we drove across the river and headed to Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site in Collinsville, Ill., to see what was left of a city of mounds built a thousand years ago by members of what archaeologists call the Mississippian Culture. Their city was larger than London at the time and was (and still is) dominated by Monks Mound, a terraced earthwork comparable in volume to the Great Pyramid of Giza. For a long time, the Cahokia Mounds were essentially ignored, and many of them were flattened for farming and development, but now there's an impressive visitors' center. We walked the ancient plazas mostly in silence, trying to imagine them full of people.
 AT last the morning came when we put the kayaks in the river at Hoppies and pointed them downstream. Hoppies is a classic sort of place: a house, a barn, a boat shop, a couple of outbuildings, a ramp and a dock where you're more likely to find friendly guys working on their own well-traveled boats than a line of gleaming fiberglass trophies with bad puns for names. Hoppie and his wife, Fern, are usually around, talking or lending a hand. And, of course, there's the river, brown and beautiful, rolling by without a care. 
 Human-powered trips -- walking, hiking, paddling or cycling -- usually begin with a warm-up period -- hours or days of getting into the rhythm of the trip, letting go of where you came from, falling into the vibe. But that is not the case with launching a small boat on the Mississippi. 
 As soon as you are in the water, you know immediately that you belong to the river. It commands every sense. There's the sound a truly big river makes -- not loud, but nonetheless vast and soothing, more like a wind over grasses than a waterfall. There is an odor to the river as well, vaguely sweet and earthy, though oddly more like the sea than like a mountain lake. In no time Hoppies was lost far behind us, as if removed not just geographically, but in time as well. We were away.
 Three sounds regularly punctuated the background music. One was the occasional wail of freight trains along tracks parallel to the river on the Missouri side. The arrival of trains is said to have been a death knell for the era of fabulous steamboats, but their songs today are neither unpleasant nor particularly lonesome; with miles of river bank on both sides undisturbed by houses or other signs of human impact, the occasional passing trains seemed to be friendly, if oblivious, fellow travelers.
 The same could be said for the barges that ply the river in both directions, emitting a low, diesel roar and loaded with grain, gravel, giant rocks, oil and other commodities. Visions of these football-field-sized beasts swamping and slap-chopping our tiny boats had cost me sleep in the weeks leading up to our trip, and I certainly would not advise playing chicken with one in a fog, or traveling around a bend in mid-channel. But without diminishing the importance of vigilance and common nautical sense, there is nothing in their wakes to alarm a moderately experienced sea kayaker.
 The most common sound is the surprisingly loud complaining of the river when it drops over and around the various contrivances of the engineers. It seemed to us that an Army Corps reading of 17 to 19 feet at St. Louis was actually better for paddlers than 15 feet, because the higher water covers the miscellaneous rock works, giving the visual impression of a free river. What's more, once a paddler is comfortable with the current, the quickening drop, followed by the clot of whirlpools and eddies, creates interludes of adrenaline, which is to say fun.
 The higher water also assured us that the chutes and sloughs that pass behind and around the various islands would have adequate water for passage, and it was along those narrower passages -- though they were often big enough to be important rivers in any other part of the country -- that we occasionally spotted deer, beaver, small water snakes, large herons and birds of prey. We looked for, but never saw, the coyotes we heard howling at night, sometimes closer to our campsites than we might have liked. 
 One afternoon we surprised a local family out catfishing; they were the only other recreationists we saw on the entire voyage. ''Hey, come on over,'' they called out from their campsite, a cluster of wall tents hidden almost entirely in the woods. ''We got fresh fish frying and cold beer.'' A very good combo indeed. 
 We might have seen more wildlife had we gotten up with the dawn and paddled till dusk, but we chose instead to read into the nights by the lights of our headlamps and sleep late; whether this was the influence of my teenage companion or the lull of the river I can't say. We also might have covered more miles, but we stuck to our plan of no plan and dawdled with abandon. 
 On the Missouri side of the river we stopped once to check whether a dark spot in the bluff was the opening to a cave -- it was not. We stopped another time to take a close look at a long row of boxcars on a siding. I will neither confirm nor deny that we climbed a ladder and ran along the top of the cars, high over the Mississippi, jumping from car to car, pretending to be Ernest Borgnine and Keith Carradine in ''Emperor of the North Pole.'' 
 On the Illinois side, we stashed our kayaks partway up One Mile Race Creek and walked along the levee about a mile to Fort de Chartres. Constructed in the 1750s and now fully restored, the fort was the military and administrative center for what was the breadbasket of French Colonial activity in North America. A few weeks before we arrived, the fort had been stuffed to the turrets with ''living historians'' dressed up as fur traders, native trappers and French infantry come for the annual jamboree, but when we got there it was deserted, except for the friendly woman in the gift shop who sold us ice-cold Sprites and told us about her technique in the tomahawk-throwing competitions. 
 ''Pretty much everyone around here throws a little,'' she told us. 
 Ducking out of there, we headed down the river to Ste. Genevieve, where we again stashed the kayaks in the woods and walked into town. We checked into a hotel, took hot showers, ate big steaks followed by enormous bowls of homemade ice cream, slept in beds and watched ball on television, but we were otherwise very well behaved for a couple of boatmen just in off the river. 
 Once a rival to St. Louis as the most important French community between New Orleans and the Great Lakes, Ste. Genevieve is a remarkably well-preserved town of historic houses, antiques shops and art galleries. Like virtually all of the towns we visited, however, it appeared to be highly detached from the river that was its original reason for existence: except for a sign showing historic flood levels, you might not know you were in a river town. 
 While we tarried in Ste. Genevieve, and the tiny towns of Tower Rock and Herculaneum, and spent a day hiking the bluffs at Trail of Tears State Park, and the better part of another day goofing around trying to catch fish, the river was rising. By the time we left Trail of Tears, the best camping sandbars were gone and the river was up in the trees in many places; the word was it was still coming up. When we got to Cape Girardeau, which has a wall to keep the river out of the town, it was no longer as much fun, and I took a Greyhound bus back up to St. Louis to get our car.
 ''What are you so worried about?'' said my son as I hemmed and hawed and generally second-guessed our decision to get off the river a few days early. ''We thought we might do 150 miles of the Mississippi,'' he said, ''and we did about 105. No one else we know has even done that.''
 He was right, of course. But later that day we drove down to Cairo, a town that doesn't look as if it's been hit by the recession; it looks as if it's been hit by a bomb (think Jimmy Carter in the South Bronx in 1977). 
 We sneaked into the seemingly abandoned and overgrown Fort Defiance Park and stood at the tip, where the massive Ohio River coming in from the East makes the Mississippi look more like the nephew of waters than the patriarch. It's a surprisingly peaceful confluence of giants -- one seemingly clear and dark, the other chalky with mud. We stood there until we worried that someone might break into our lonely car, loaded with our kayaks, up in the parking lot. 
 ''I'll be back,'' I thought as we turned and jogged back. ''There's more drifting to do.''
 NAVIGATING THE FATHER OF WATERS
 PLANNING A TRIP 
 The Army Corps of Engineers posts Mississippi River levels at a variety of locations (mvs-wc.mvs.usace.army.mil/dresriv.html) and also has downloadable navigational charts (www2.mvr.usace.army.mil/NIC2/mrcharts.cfm). 
 Hoppies Marina is across the tracks at the end of a road in Imperial, Mo. (6018 Windsor Harbor Lane; 636-467-6154), but you should call ahead and make sure there's room by the barn if you plan to leave a car there. The owners may not quote you an official fee, but a reasonable traveler will give something in return for the privilege of launching and parking at the marina. 
 WHERE TO STAY (AND EAT)
 While traveling on the river, you can camp anywhere that isn't posted as private property. On the stretch between St. Louis and Cairo, Ill., the sandbars that form at the ends of islands are often good spots. Because mud is a fact of life on the Mississippi -- even on top of sand -- campers should take plastic tarps for ground cloths and plenty of fresh water.
 There are public campsites at Fort Kaskaskia State Historic Site (4372 Park Road, Ellis Grove, Ill.; 618-859-3741; www.illinoishistory.gov/hs/fort--kaskaskia.htm) and at Trail of Tears State Park (429 Moccasin Springs, Jackson, Mo.; 573-290-5268; www.mostateparks.com/trailoftears.htm). 
 The Hotel Ste. Genevieve (Main and Merchant Streets, Ste. Genevieve, Mo.; 573-883-3562) is a serviceable place that didn't question our arrival in water sandals. Doubles from $55. At the nearby Inn St. Gemme Beauvais (78 North Main Street, also in Ste. Genevieve; 573-883-5744; www.bbhost.com/innstgemme/), doubles start at $89. 
 The Anvil Saloon (46 South Third Street, Ste. Genevieve; 573-883-7323) has been restoring river travelers since 1855. The Anvil steak (ribeye) comes with memorable onion rings for $18.95.

HEADLINE: 10 Ways to Cut Your Travel Costs This Year

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
LAST year was arguably the year of the travel deal, with resorts and airlines practically begging for bookings, and many travelers finding bargain airfares and hotel rooms as a result. But airlines have cut back capacity, meaning there will be fewer seats going unsold, and resorts may not be as quick to cut rates to attract guests, now that the economy looks as if it might be on a slight rebound. So now is the perfect time to review your booking strategy. Here are 10 simple steps you can take to help cut your travel costs in 2010. 
 1. Sign Up for a Twitter Account 
 An increasing number of travel companies are using Twitter to market their brands, often by tweeting exclusive deals to followers. JetBlue calls out last-minute discounts at JetBlueCheeps on Tuesday mornings. A recent example: ''$89 BOS to LAS this Sat. LAS to BOS this Mon. or Tues. 25 seats avail or til 6 pm ET.'' Fairmont Hotels offers its Twitter followers special discounts before anyone else. Farecompare's ''flyfrom'' Twitter feed offers location-specific fare sales when you plug in your home airport's three-letter code, as in flyfromNYC. 
 All you need to do is sign up for a free account at Twitter.com and start following the companies you like or travel experts who do the work for you. (You can find me at MichelleHiggins.)
 2. Find the Cheapest Dates to Fly
 ITASoftware.com, which provides the technological backbone for many airfare shopping sites, allows users to scan an entire month's fares for the least expensive rate. (Log in as a ''guest'' and click on ''month-long search.'' ) In January, the 28th and 30th were the cheapest dates to fly nonstop to London from New York ($536) for a week's vacation, according to a recent search. The next best was Saturday, Jan. 23, at $640. To book the ticket, users must go to another site. Kayak.com has a flexible-dates option (registration is required) and a calendar that shows the best fares found by other Kayak users in the last 48 hours. Bing Travel, the Microsoft search engine, offers a similar option, found under ''plan trips,'' about halfway down the page. 
 3. Consider Nearby Airports
 A recent Web search showed nonstop flights from Los Angeles International Airport to Miami International from $299 round trip on American in early January. But flying into Fort Lauderdale, roughly 30 miles north of Miami, was $219 on Virgin America, an $80 saving.
 4. Go Against the Grain 
 If possible, avoid popular travel dates like holidays and spring break because airlines have begun to charge anywhere from $10 to $30 extra at those times. Farecompare.com offers a handy breakdown of the new fees by date, airline and amount. Early-morning and late-night flights may also be cheaper depending on the route.
 5. Track Price Even After Buying
 Airlines have long offered to refund the difference in their fares (minus a change fee) in the form of a voucher to customers who ask. Using your confirmation number, Yapta.com will automatically track the price of your ticket, taking the airline's fees into consideration, and send you, without charge, an e-mail message or Twitter alert notifying you of the lower price. You can then call the airline to claim the credit. 
 Similarly, Travelocity.com promises to refund the difference in price for prepaid hotel reservations if you find the same room for a cheaper rate online before check-in.
 6. Take the Bus
 Cheap express buses with names like BoltBus, Megabus and Washington Deluxe have become increasingly popular along the Northeast Corridor and elsewhere, with seats for $25 or less, depending on when you reserve. With amenities like more legroom, power plugs at every seat and free Wi-Fi, the bus ride, though longer, can often be more tolerable than a flight that costs 10 times as much. Search for seats at GotoBus.com or BusJunction.com.
 7. Roll the Dice
 Sites like Priceline.com, Hotwire.com and Lastminutetravel.com offer deep discounts to travelers willing to pay before learning the names of the hotels, airlines or car rental agencies they're committing to. To help you find the best rate, Biddingfortravel.com and Betterbidding.com provide strategic advice and offer tips from other travelers on how to navigate the system. 
 Getaroom.com offers a new twist to this gamble that may be more agreeable for risk-averse travelers. Unlike these other discounters, Getaroom tells customers the name of the hotel and price before booking. But it offers an even lower rate through its call center -- typically 10 to 25 percent off -- to travelers willing to pay for the room before finding out just how much of a discount they're getting. 
 8. Go Rental
 Tourists in most European cities can easily pay $200 a night for basic hotel rooms. By contrast, an apartment or villa can be rented for as little as $1,100 a week in Paris or Rome. Homeaway.com, Zonder.com and Rentalo.com are just a few of the many rental Web sites available. Some specialize in specific regions like Rentvillas.com for Europe or Wimco.com for the Caribbean. 
 9. Make Yourself at Home
 For a 6 to 12 percent booking fee, AirBnB.com connects budget travelers with locals who are offering a place to bed down. The Times's Frugal Traveler, Matt Gross, described it as ''a cross between CouchSurfing.com and the vacation rentals section of Craigslist.'' There were more than 2,000 listings in a recent search for New York including a futon in a one-bedroom near Gramercy Park ($65) and a bedroom with private bath and separate entrance in Hell's Kitchen ($150).
 10. Study the Fine Print
 Play close attention to which airline you are actually flying, particularly on international flights. With code sharing, you may book a flight to Paris on Delta, for instance, and end up traveling with Air France, a code share partner with Delta. 
 But while the flight may be the same, the price often is not. Sometimes the difference can be negligible -- say, $609 on SAS on a January nonstop flight from Newark Airport to Stockholm versus $627 for that same flight when booked through United. Or $817 for an American flight from New York to Lima versus the $693 that same flight would cost when booked through American's code share partner, LAN.
 There are times though when the difference can be substantial, particularly when the code share partner may be a foreign carrier not well known to American travelers. 
 Here are some examples, based on a search on Kayak.com for flights in late January, where the round-trip fares vary greatly depending on which code share partner you book through. (Click on ''details'' for a breakdown of the flight's particulars.) New York to Singapore: $1,319 on Cathay Pacific; $1,817 on American. New York to Marrakesh: $1,098 on Royal Air Maroc; $3,257 on Delta. New York to Cairo: $908 on Egypt Air; a stunning $4,650 on United.

HEADLINE: 36 Hours: New York City

BYLINE: By AMY VIRSHUP

 BODY:
URBAN renewal. The phrase conjures up government-backed megaprojects from the '70s, but it's organic to New York, where someone is always getting off the bus, train or plane. In the last year, the city has opened a hot new park, Lincoln Center celebrated its 50th anniversary with a major face-lift that includes a new fountain with 353 custom-made, computer-controlled nozzles, and the center of cool shifted innumerable times (but it's probably still somewhere in Brooklyn).
 Friday
 5 p.m. 1)GET YOUR TICKETS 
 As part of its anniversary celebration, Lincoln Center has remade the grim Harmony Atrium just southeast of the main campus (Broadway between 62nd and 63rd Streets) into a visitors' center and ticketing space named for David Rubenstein (that's what you get when you give $10 million). Along with a face-lift, the atrium got a new box office, selling same-day discount tickets at 25 to 50 percent off regular prices (with a two-ticket-per-person limit) for performances at Lincoln Center and all its constituent organizations -- including the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic and the City Opera (new.lincolncenter.org/live/). Check what's on and pick up a pair.
 6 p.m. 2) PRETHEATER PRIX FIXE
 Daniel Boulud's New York culinary empire now runs from the Bowery to the Upper East Side. Just across from Lincoln Center, his Bar Boulud (1900 Broadway near 64th Street; 212-595-0303; www.danielnyc.com) is the perfect perch for a pre-performance meal. Terrines, sliced meats and cheeses (the last divided into categories like Bloomy, Stinky and Old & Hard) are the heart of the menu, but there's also a $42 three-course prix-fixe option that includes such classic choices as a salade nicoise, roasted chicken breast and house-made ice cream or sorbet. For the full experience, sit at the charcuterie bar where the view includes fromage de tete ''Gilles Verot'' (that's headcheese for those who don't speak French). Afterward, grab a drink at the Alice Tully Hall lobby bar before curtain time.
 Saturday
 10 a.m. 3) BREAKFAST, RETRO-STYLE 
 The Standard Grill is tucked under the High Line at the base of the Standard Hotel (848 Washington Street at West 13th Street; 212-645-4100; www.thestandardgrill.com). Despite the hotel's Brutalism-Meets-Miami-Beach exterior, the dining room is pure retro: a tile-vaulted ceiling, penny (as in real pennies) floor, red leather banquettes. The menu is pleasingly retro, too: Try warm cinnamon-and-sugar-crusted doughnuts made on the spot -- 3 for $6 -- or maybe ultra-sweet French toast with bananas and rum sauce, $10.
 11 a.m. 4)WALK ALONG THE TRACKS
 Just down the block at the corner of Gansevoort and Washington Streets are the southernmost stairs to the High Line, the immensely popular linear park created on what was once an abandoned freight rail line. After a decade-long effort, the first section of the park (running from Gansevoort to 20th Street) opened in June; on summer weekends as many as 20,000 people a day visited. Winter brings the walkway a quieter, almost derelict beauty, with bare tree limbs and the seed heads of grasses swaying in the wind off the Hudson. Winter hours are from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.; www.thehighline.org.
 1 p.m. 5)BROOKLYN BOUTIQUES
 Once known as the city of churches, Brooklyn these days might be called the borough of boutiques. For a taste of the local aesthetic, check out Court Street in the Cobble Hill neighborhood (take the 2/3 or 4/5 trains to Borough Hall and then walk south along Court to Atlantic). At Serene Rose (200 Court; 718-522-5927; www.serenerose.com), a dangly pair of earrings hand crocheted from gold-filled wire ($140) would be the perfect accent to one of the party frocks. Tiny Fork & Pencil (221a Court; 718-488-8855; forkandpencil.com) sells housewares, toys and antiques. The proceeds go to support local charities. Papel New York (225 Court; 718-422-0255; papelnewyork.com) sells sleek paper goods, including sheets of wrapping paper ($2.50 to $3 a sheet) that will class up even the smallest of gifts. Need to refuel? The Stumptown Coffee at Cafe Pedlar (210 Court; 718-855-7129; cafepedlar.com) is roasted nearby in Red Hook, and you can pick up a bag of Hair Bender blend beans ($12 for 12 ounces) along with your espresso ($2.50). Or stop at the Chocolate Room (269 Court; 718-246-2600; www.thechocolateroombrooklyn.com), which sells its own homemade chocolate caramel popcorn ($4.50 for a quarter-pound bag).
 8 p.m. 6)SEAFOOD ON THE PARK
 Sleek and highly polished, Marea (240 Central Park South; 212-582-5100; www.marea-nyc.com), in the old San Domenico space just east of Columbus Circle, is like some movie version of New York except, yes, that really is a fallen mogul pitching new investors at the table next to yours. The menu is devoted to an Italian spin on fish. Share an order of the unctuous ricci (sea urchin, lardo and sea salt draped bruschetta-like over toast; $15), then choose among the crudo (raw fish), oysters and antipasti. For a main course you can get a whole fish roasted or sauteed, then choose your sauce (the limone is good with the Dover sole) and side dish. The four-course prix fixe is $89.
 10 p.m. 7)COCKTAILS AND CODES
 If you're talking cocktails in New York these days, you need to know two words: speakeasy and artisanal. Behind hidden entrances requiring secret codes, bartenders are mixing up concoctions with names like Corpse Reviver No. 2 (gin, Cointreau, Lillet Blanc, lemon and absinthe) that only seem old-fashioned. That particular drink ($13) is assembled by the garter-sleeved bartenders at Little Branch (20 Seventh Avenue South at Leroy Street; 212-929-4360). Cash only.
 Sunday
 10 a.m. 8)COMFORT FOOD 
 The name's an oxymoron and the kitchen is probably smaller than yours, but Little Giant (85 Orchard Street at the corner of Broome; 212-226-5047; www.littlegiantnyc.com) turns out slightly refined comfort food that has crowds piling up on the sidewalks of the gentrifying Lower East Side. Little Giant serves a ''Trucker's Breakfast'' ($16), but the bacon with it will be hand sliced and the mushrooms cremini. Cash only.
 11 a.m. 9)ART SCENE STROLL
 The anchor of the Lower East Side art scene is the New Museum of Contemporary Art (235 Bowery at Prince Street; 212-219-1222; www.newmuseum.org), designed by the Japanese firm Sanaa to look like a series of off-kilter boxes, which opened to raves in 2007. If Chelsea remains the hot spot for grand gesture galleries -- old industrial spaces with room for massive Serras -- the Lower East Side offers a growing number of storefront spots, where artists and gallerists with big ambitions work small for now. The Rachel Uffner Gallery at 47 Orchard Street (212-274-0064; racheluffnergallery.com) has been drawing strong reviews for its stable of artists, and the Bridge Gallery at 98 Orchard Street (212-674-6320; bridgegalleryny.com) specializes in architecture and design.
 1 p.m. 10)SUGAR RUSH
 A giant Gummi rat. How New York is that? You can pick one up to take home, along with giant pixie sticks (99 cents), wax fangs, Mallo Cups and classics like Hot Tamales and Mike and Ikes at Economy Candy (108 Rivington Street; 212-254-1531; www.economycandy.com). Crammed with what seems like every candy bar ever known, plus hard candies by the pound, nuts and dried fruits, it's a playground for the sugar-obsessed. 
 THE BASICS
 New York is served by three area airports: Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Liberty. From J.F.K. to Midtown, the taxi fare is a flat $45, plus tolls and tip. You can also take the AirTrain to Jamaica ($5 one way), and then connect to either the Long Island Rail Road or the New York City subway to ride into Manhattan. From La Guardia, a taxi will cost from $21 to $30, plus tolls and tip. From Newark, the taxi fare is a flat $50 to $60, plus tolls and tip. Another alternative is the AirTrain, connecting Newark airport to Pennsylvania Station via New Jersey Transit (one way fare: $15). There are also bus, shuttle van and limousine services from all three airports. 
 Ink48 is the latest New York hotel opened by Kimpton, known for its collection of designy boutique hotels. The location, 11th Avenue and 48th Street, is convenient only if you're planning on buying a car (auto dealerships line this stretch of 11th Avenue). But the rooms are spacious and well-designed (by the Rockwell Group). In December, the hotel was still in its ''rough draft phase,'' which meant the restaurant and bar weren't open and construction was continuing. A king deluxe room with views to the north or east was $207; rates will go up once the hotel is fully open (653 11th Avenue; 877-843-8869; ink48.com).
 The British group Firmdale (Number 16, among others, in London) has opened its first New York offshoot, the 86-room Crosby Street Hotel in the SoHo neighborhood (79 Crosby Street; 888-559-5508; www.thecrosbystreethotel.com). A 335-square-foot superior room is $495 a night. 
 Steps from Lincoln Center, the newly refurbished Empire Hotel (44 West 63rd Street; 212-265-7400; www.empirehotelnyc.com) couldn't be more convenient for opera or ballet lovers. Standard queen rooms starting at $229 a night come with free Wi-Fi and iPod docking stations.

HEADLINE: How to Gauge the Rush to Emerging Markets

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
IN 2009, emerging markets flew higher than a frigate bird, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index returning 74.5 percent. Latin America, the top performer among MSCI's developing-market indexes, returned nearly 98 percent. 
 As investors scurried to cash in, emerging-market mutual funds swelled, attracting more than $80 billion in new money, according to EPFR Global, a tracker of market data in Cambridge, Mass. That was the highest annual inflow since EPFR began keeping track, beating the previous record by more than $25 billion.
 Those kinds of numbers, at a time when economies in the United States, Europe and Japan are ailing, have raised the possibility that emerging markets are surging toward an investment bubble. 
 ''A lot of the emerging markets have bounced back strongly from last fall and now look a little on the expensive side,'' said John R. Chisholm, co-manager of the Acadian Emerging Markets fund. Mr. Chisholm's fund, which invests throughout the developing world, had a total return of 77 percent last year.
 Emerging-market stocks have long been among the most volatile investments, zigzagging more, on average, than developed-market shares. In 2008, when the Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 38.5 percent, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell 54 percent. 
 Returns in developing markets have regularly been sapped by crises, like the Mexican peso devaluation in 1994 and the Asian financial flu in 1997. The announcement in November that Dubai would delay repayment of some of its debts raised the possibility of yet another round of woe.
 Because of the possibility of future blow-ups like these, advisers have long said that average investors should put only a small portion of their assets, if any, into emerging markets. Yet some investment professionals have begun to question whether today's developing world is really as risky as its reputation -- and to suggest that less sophisticated investors might consider putting more of their money there.
 Jim O'Neill, head of global economic research at Goldman Sachs, is among the best-known proponents of that view. In 2001, Mr. O'Neill coined the acronym ''BRIC'' as shorthand for the four largest economies in the developing world: Brazil, Russia, India and China. He argues that these countries, with hefty populations and solid economic fundamentals, should outpace the developed world over the next several decades.
 ''Because of the financial crisis, some people started to believe the BRIC thing was finished,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''I'd argue that three of the four -- especially China, but also Brazil and India -- have demonstrated that they can live without U.S. growth leadership.'' 
 Those three have resumed strong growth, despite the struggles in the developed world. Russia has lagged because of dependence on oil and gas, whose prices fell sharply with the recession. ''It's easy to dismiss Russia after oil prices lost 75 percent of their value in six months,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''Let's see later this year how they're doing.''
 The overall recent performance of emerging markets has led Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School of University of Pennsylvania, to conclude that they may be a better deal today than just a few years ago. ''They've weathered a severe shock very well,'' he said. Thus, investors aren't foolish to buy the shares, even after the recent rapid price rise, he said.
 The average price-to-earnings multiple for Chinese listings, for example, was in the low 20s in late 2009 and was projected to be 18 or 19 this year, he said. ''That's not cheap, but it's not crazy for a rapidly growing country,'' he said. ''It's not the 50 of 2007, when I was saying don't go in there.''
 Edmund J. Harriss, investment director at Guinness Atkinson in London, pointed to car sales as a harbinger of prospects for China and other big emerging markets. He said China would probably report 12 million sales for 2009, beating the United States by two million. ''The size of the emerging economies is reaching a stage where they can sustain big growth in personal consumption,'' he said. ''If you get that, you should be looking to invest. That's what drove America from the 1950s onward.''
 Mr. Harriss oversees three Guinness Atkinson funds. The largest, the China & Hong Kong fund, had a total return of 92 percent last year. Among its biggest holdings at midyear were China Mobile, a telecom, and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation.
 Even proponents caution that emerging markets, despite their promise, remain risky. If a big crisis arises -- perhaps widespread political unrest in China -- it could sow broader panic, with investors fleeing as fast as they piled in. ''Be aware that you can easily lose half of your investment in a few months,'' said Mr. Chisholm of Acadian.
 Risk is the reason that Towers Perrin, the employee-benefits consultant, often steers retirement plan managers away from including emerging-markets funds in 401(k) plans, said Darrell S. Zechman, a consultant in its Chicago office.
 Many Americans don't understand that investments in markets outside the United States entail currency and political risk along with the usual stock-market zigzags, he said. Such investors may also time investments poorly. ''Traditionally, this is an asset class where people chase returns -- they read in the news about a huge run-up and dump a lot of money in just before the market turns,'' he said. ''They get in at the peak and ride down to the trough.''
 Towers Perrin typically suggests that retirement plans offer broad-based international funds, which can invest in any market outside the United States but keep most of their money in developed ones, Mr. Zechman said. 
 INVESTORS considering emerging markets might also want to ponder bird dung. Both bird droppings -- specifically, guano deposited on Peruvian islands -- and financial assets have produced speculative frenzies, said Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard and an author of a recent book on financial crises.
 In the 1800s, foreigners became enchanted with guano's promise as a fertilizer and scooped up Peruvian bonds, Professor Rogoff said. Soon enough, the boom went bust, and Peru defaulted on its debt, wiping out the investors.
 ''It's comical from a 21st-century perspective,'' he said. ''But guano was a huge technological advance for farming at the time.''

 BODY:
THE NEWS The world's tallest building, the 160-story, 2,717-foot Burj Khalifa, officially opened in Dubai. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Begun five years ago at the height of a boom in Dubai, the tower opened at a bad time. Long the brash striver among the United Arab Emirates, Dubai in recent months has been so beset by debts and a real estate crash that it turned to Abu Dhabi for a $10 billion bailout loan -- and then renamed the building, begun as the Burj Dubai, in honor of the emir of Abu Dhabi, Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan. The Burj's apartments and commercial space are said to be 90 percent sold, but at a cost: some other premium buildings in Dubai are lying half-empty. 
 THE NEWS Iran has quietly been hiding a large part of its nuclear program in networks of tunnels and bunkers across the country, making the facilities much harder for the West to keep track of -- or potentially, to attack from the air, it was reported last week. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Iran has a long history of skill at tunneling, and its president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was an engineer and tunnel expert before entering politics. To keep Iran's nuclear facilities from slipping out of its reach, the Pentagon is racing to develop a 15-ton guided bomb called the Massive Ordnance Penetrator that is meant to break through tunnel defenses and destroy what is inside with a lethal blast of air. 
 THE NEWS Automakers and technology companies introduced powerful new Internet-connected computer systems for the dashboards of cars at the annual Consumer Electronics Show. The ''infotainment systems,'' as they are called, are expected to reach the market later this year.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Manufacturers promised safeguards like hands-free voice control and allowing complex functions like Internet browsing only when the car is parked. Still, safety experts and regulators were aghast at the idea of further distractions, especially visual ones, for drivers who already get into trouble using mobile phones and other gadgets while behind the wheel. 
 THE NEWS The Allman Brothers Band said that their annual run of New York concert dates, booked into the Beacon Theater every March since 1989, would be played this year at the United Palace Theater in Washington Heights instead. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS ''Cirque du Soleil bought it out from under us,'' the band's singer and keyboard player, Gregg Allman, said of the Beacon, which the band has filled with Southern rock fans 190 times in the past 20 years. The circus has leased the recently renovated 2,800-seat theater, an Upper West Side landmark, from January through June and possibly longer, to rehearse and present a show entitled ''Banana Shpeel.''
 THE NEWS The population of Harlem, the Manhattan neighborhood that has been synonymous with black urban America for more than a century, is now only about 40 percent black, according to census data.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Harlem benefited greatly during the economic boom and the steady decline in crime in New York since the 1990s. New housing was built, older homes were rehabilitated and the population, which fell sharply in the 1970's and thereafter, started growing again, including an influx of white residents, the first such influx in decades. Meanwhile, eroding barriers to integration made it easier for blacks to live in other areas of the city and suburbs.

HEADLINE: PHOTOS: A Star in the Kitchen Offers Hints of Summer

BYLINE: By DAVID CORCORAN

 BODY:
WHEN it opened last May, Alice's instantly became one of New Jersey's most inviting restaurants, a big, bright, barn-red cracker box of a building with plenty of porch and killer views of Lake Hopatcong -- the state's largest lake and one of its loveliest, rimmed with forests and spiky with sailboats, a playground for the second-home set. 
 O.K., I hear you saying. Sounds like a nice summer restaurant. Why are you telling me this in January? 
 Well, there's news. For diners who pay attention to chefs' comings and goings, it can be summed up in two words: David Drake. 
 Mr. Drake, 50, is a kitchen superstar, the winner of ecstatic reviews everywhere he has cooked: the Frog and the Peach and Daryl in New Brunswick, the Stage House in Scotch Plains, and his namesake restaurant, David Drake, in Rahway. Last July, Alice Szigethy -- a Manhattanite and Lake Hopatcong second-home dweller who had opened her namesake restaurant just two months earlier -- found herself at irreparable odds with her chef. She needed help in a hurry, she said, and Mr. Drake happened to need a full-time job. (While his Rahway restaurant remains open, he says it has been slapped hard by the recession and he has stopped paying himself a salary.) 
 This is a little like needing a quarterback when Brett Favre happens to be on the market. Mr. Drake stepped in on fourth-and-long, and he took command in a hurry. ''It was a challenge,'' he recalled in a recent telephone interview. ''I'm used to working with experienced cooks. Here, I said, 'Julienne these carrots,' and they didn't know what I was talking about.''
 Ms. Szigethy and Mr. Drake are using these cold, slow months to get their bearings, to figure out just what the lakeside restaurant should be before the mobs descend in June and July. Alice's is still a work in progress, but a meal there offers enticing glimmers of nights to come.
 The style is middle American and upscale casual: that much is clear not just from the decor -- barn-wood posts and beams, lots of glass, a companionable bar that extends onto the porch in warm weather -- but from down-home touches like warm corn muffins in the bread basket and spectacularly crunchy, meaty onion rings. The staff runs to winsome, T-shirted young locals without much food knowledge but with a genuine enthusiasm for everything, from the ice cream (made by the deservedly beloved Jefferson Dairy, on Route 15) to the customers (''You guys were a pleasure!'').
 To these easygoing surroundings Mr. Drake brings a high level of culinary sophistication and an appreciation for the simple virtues of fresh food. He shapes his cooking around vegetables, not protein; it's no surprise that soups like mushroom, acorn squash and potato-leek are built on a subtle vegetable stock so the flavors of their named ingredients can take center stage. Or that in a special like grilled mahi-mahi, the accompanying ratatouille -- a sort of horizontal napoleon of sliced yellow squash and eggplant over a rousing tomato sauce -- almost stole the show. 
 Luckily, in that case the fish was terrific. Other seafood dishes weren't so fortunate: scallops were salty and overdone, upstaged by their accompaniment, a delicately spicy mushroom risotto; and swordfish had plenty of character but was dry from overcooking. So was chicken fried in a peppery bread-crumb crust. Skirt steak, however, was handsomely charred and agreeably gamy, with the just-right accompaniment of mushrooms and grilled leeks. 
 As a former pastry chef at the legendary, lamented Ryland Inn, Mr. Drake is entitled to take pride in a line of straightforward but delectable desserts: hot chocolate cake with fabulous raspberry compote and a scoop of Jefferson's vanilla; white-chocolate bread pudding, gooey and fine; and a Tatin-like apple tart with a glorious mahogany crust (another scoop of vanilla, please). Think of them as a promissory note for a meal, a few months from now, that may truly take your breath away.

HEADLINE: City's Jazz Scene Grows With Do-It-Yourself Trend

BYLINE: By NEIL TESSER. 
Neil Tesser has written about jazz and hosted Chicago jazz radio programs for more than 35 years.

 BODY:
Surveying the chaos at 1540 West North Avenue, it is hard to believe this former sports bar will soon be a sleek new jazz club. 
 Up front sits a half-built stage. Piles of new and old wood, along with pipes and conduits tagged for disposal, litter the dust-scuffed floor. In back are strewn five big-screen plasma TVs and various kitchen devices.
''You can't believe how much progress we've made in just two weeks,'' Greg Pasenko, the 60-year-old co-proprietor, said a few days into the new year. 
 The club, named Club Blujazz for the record label owned by Mr. Pasenko and his wife, Diane Delin, will expand the recent do-it-yourself trend characterizing Chicago's multifaceted jazz scene, which is second only to New York's. 
 Despite the recession, this trend has little to do with musicians seeking income to supplement their performance fees. It is more to establish control over their performance venues -- or at least to ensure they do not disappear.
 In the case of Club Blujazz, the owners want a home for their music that is not subject to the whims of other presenters. Mr. Pasenko, a guitarist-vocalist, and Ms. Delin, a violinist, will each have a regular weekly showcase at the club, alongside local, national and European artists.
 Chicago has precedents for the concept. In the 1950s, the pianist Ahmad Jamal ran his own club, the Alhambra, and in the 1960s the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians produced concerts when its avant-garde offerings baffled club owners. But at no time in recent memory have as many jazz musicians been actively involved as presenters, curators and entrepreneurs. 
 Club Blujazz will be the second musician-owned jazz club in the city, joining the Velvet Lounge, which the 80-year-old saxophone legend Fred Anderson established east of Chinatown in 1982. The scene also boasts at least three major weekly series programmed by acclaimed younger musicians. One of them, the sax player Dave Rempis, presents new-jazz concerts in a cozy space called Elastic, at 2830 North Milwaukee Avenue.
 ''In my tenure here, there are now probably as many spaces to play as ever, many of them qualitatively better than those of the past,'' said Mr. Rempis, who has lived in Chicago since 1993. ''But most of the places I play are owned or run by musicians, which makes a big difference in expectations. They're primarily interested in the music, instead of just filling a jazz night on their calendar.'' 
 Mr. Rempis's shows are on Thursdays, following a tradition that began in the late 1990s with Ken Vandermark, a 1999 MacArthur Fellow and world-renowned reedman.
 Mr. Vandermark hosted a Thursday-night series at various clubs starting in 1998 because many local venues were unwilling to present the postmodern free jazz played by his bands and artists from New York and Europe. When he stopped in 2002, Mr. Rempis took up the slack, encouraged by a group of college friends who had set up a funky performance space on Cermak Avenue. 
 ''For my generation, the idea of making a living as a jazz musician isn't really possible -- especially playing creative music,'' said Mr. Rempis, using a common term for noncommercial jazz. ''We needed to come up with our own environments, basically. Most club owners want to sell drinks and want to present music that people can talk over.'' 
 Mr. Rempis is also a principal in Umbrella Music, a loose confederation of presenters that emerged from a crisis in performance venues in 2005. At the Hungry Brain, 2319 West Belmont Avenue, limited capacity was hindering the growth of the Sunday night Transmission Series run by the cornetist Josh Berman and the drummer Mike Reed. At the same time, Elastic lost its space because of licensing problems, and the Velvet Lounge was being forced out of its previous location, with its resurrection plans still hazy. 
 ''Our playing landscape was disappearing,'' Mr. Reed said.
 Out of this came Umbrella Music, whose members produce and cross-promote the shows at Elastic, the Hungry Brain and The Hideout, hidden away at 1354 West Wabansia Avenue. (Mr. Reed's experience as a promoter extends beyond jazz: he co-produces the nationally known indie-rock Pitchfork Festival, which last year drew 55,000 fans over three days.)
 Like the owners of Club Blujazz, Mr. Reed was partly motivated by the musicians' equivalent of estate planning. 
 ''At the end of my 20s, I was still bartending to earn a living, and I was wondering what my 40s would be like,'' he said. ''I was never going to make real money, retirement money, as a musician. So basically, I needed a job.'' 
 After working on other live-music events, Mr. Reed said he decided that ''if those chuckleheads can do this, then so can I.''
 ''But it's also a matter of holding on to Chicago's unique cultural capital,'' he said. ''New York and L.A. have pulled all the capital from other, smaller cities. We need to make sure that we have something that stays here. And if the resources don't exist, you have to do it yourself.''

HEADLINE: Different Paths, Similar Successes

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
AFTER starting with a whimper, 2009 finished with a roar, as a variety of investing approaches yielded double-digit returns in the fourth quarter. 
 Three of the quarter's top-performing fund managers do their work in disparate ways. One favors old-fashioned stock-picking, hunting mainly in the United States for midcapitalization stocks. Another focuses on a single region: Latin America. The third uses high-level math to invest in commodities. 
 Hewing to the Midcaps 
 Thyra Zerhusen, manager of the fund, has overseen her fund for more than a decade. During that time, its name has changed, but her approach has not. 
 She seeks out midcap stocks -- companies with market capitalizations from $1 billion to $12 billion -- that other investors may overlook or shun. She often invests in companies that have stumbled or were created when a division spun out of another outfit. Her fund had a total return of 11.8 percent for the quarter and 66.6 percent for the year. 
 Ms. Zerhusen, a native of Germany who trained to be a scientist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, the alma mater of Albert Einstein, sometimes holds investments for years. On average, she sells only a fifth of the roughly 40 stocks in her portfolio annually; that reduces trading costs and taxable gains. Her fund has an expense ratio of 1.16 percent, meaning that of every $1,000 invested, $11.60 goes to paying bills. 
 She favors tech stocks, if not always of the Silicon Valley style. Defining the sector broadly, she also buys industrial companies that she thinks have a technological edge. ''We want companies that make their customers more efficient or productive,'' she said. 
 Consider BorgWarner, the auto parts maker. Its turbochargers bolster fuel efficiency and engine power, particularly in smaller diesels, she said. As countries and consumers seek better mileage from cars, BorgWarner is seeing increasing demand. 
 BorgWarner exemplifies another of her themes: it gathers a hefty share of its sales outside the United States. ''About 48 percent of our holdings have 50 percent or more of their revenues coming from outside the U.S.,'' she said. ''You hear about large-cap companies doing that, but these are midcaps. The U.S. economy is weak, but these guys are doing well in China and South America.'' 
 A South American Surge
 South America -- and emerging markets generally -- sizzled in 2009. Brazil's economy, in particular, chugged along despite the slowdown in the developed world. The country's stock market advanced, too, with the benchmark Bovespa index returning more than 80 percent. 
 Brazil's performance gave a boost to managers like Adam J. Kutas, whose funds specialize in Latin American investing. Mr. Kutas manages , whose total return was 13.3 percent for the fourth quarter and 91.6 percent for the year. 
 ''Latin America did so well because investors finally understood the changes that Brazil had put in place'' over several years, Mr. Kutas said. Today, the country has a much-improved central bank, solid macroeconomic management and a growing consumer class, he said. And it has begun to produce companies like Petroleo Brasileiro, or Petrobras -- an oil driller that was Mr. Kutas's biggest holding at the end of September -- that are among the world leaders in their industries.
 ''One of the main reasons that Petrobras has grown into a $200 billion company is that it's one of the few oil companies in the world that grows its production,'' he said. A bonus, he added, is that ''it has good corporate governance.'' Like Ms. Zerhusen, Mr. Kutas clings to stocks he likes. He keeps his average holding for about two years. His fund has an expense ratio of 1.07 percent. 
 A potential risk of any Latin America fund is hefty exposure to the tremors and quakes of commodity prices; natural-resources companies are among the region's stalwarts. In November, the energy and materials sectors accounted for about 40 percent of Mr. Kutas's fund. In contrast, energy and materials make up about 15 percent of the Standard & Poor's 500 index. 
 Commodities and TIPS
 Commodities do not just color the investments at the fund. They, along with Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are most of the portfolio. The fund, managed by Mihir P. Worah, combines commodities and TIPS to create a hedge against inflation and provide diversification beyond stocks and standard bonds. 
 In 2009, both commodities and TIPS performed well. With developed-world governments spending heavily to jump-start their economies, investors bid them up in expectation of eventual inflation, Mr. Worah said. But they had also lost much of their value in the panic of 2008, leaving room for rebound. ''Both got to unrealistically cheap levels, so half of the outperformance was just coming back to reasonable levels,'' he said. 
 Thanks to Mr. Worah's use of mathematical modeling and derivatives, the fund belongs to the broad class of quantitative, or ''quant,'' funds. And Mr. Worah is about as quantitative as managers come. He holds a doctorate in theoretical physics from the University of Chicago. The cancellation in the 1990s of an atom-smashing supercollider project in Texas left him without data to test his theories.
 ''Without data, I was just a mathematician,'' he said. He switched to money management, where his math ability equipped him for managing bonds. 
 His fund combines mathematical modeling with Pimco's bond expertise. First, using derivative contracts, he reconstructs the Dow JonesUBS Commodities Index, giving clients an investment exposure equivalent to that of buying the index's 19 commodities. Where his calculations find pricing inefficiencies, he makes small tilts against the index, substituting, say, a heating-oil derivative contract for a gasoline one. 
 Buying commodity derivatives requires that he put up, on the margin, only a small amount of fund's cash. He invests the rest of the money in bonds, mostly TIPS. 
 ''Commodities protect you from a different kind inflation than TIPS do,'' he said. ''Commodities reflect prices at the wholesale level -- things like crude oil, copper and wheat.'' TIPS, he noted, are indexed to the Consumer Price Index ''and reflect prices of things like bread, cars and airline tickets.'' 
 If Mr. Worah makes prudent choices in his bets against the index and his selection of bonds, he can deliver additional performance, as he did in 2009. His fund has an expense ratio of 1.60 percent and had a total return of 11.8 percent for the fourth quarter and 39.8 percent for the year.

HEADLINE: Comfort Food for the Family Crowd

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
This cozy local standby -- ''Comfortable Food,'' its awning says -- sits in a tiny storefront at 1310 Cortelyou Road in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, a neighborhood that has been saddled recently with the modifier ''slowly gentrifying'' because of its influx of economically unchallenged residents. Serving brunch, burgers and a decent-looking meatloaf, it attracts a family crowd, including two sisters who grew up around the corner on Rugby Road. One of them was accompanied by her 2-year-old daughter. 
 IN THE SEATS Sophia Francis, co-owner of the Cortelyou Early Childhood Center (a family business located down the block); her toddler daughter, Christina; and the elder Francis sibling, Donette, an English professor at Binghamton University specializing in African-American and Caribbean literature.
 ON THE PLATES For Sophia, a half-pound turkey burger on whole wheat toast with a side of French-fried sweet potatoes ($10); for Donette, the buttery-crusted chicken pot pie with mushrooms and your basic fancy lettuce ($15.) Christina was interested almost exclusively in the fries.
 WHY THEY CAME Convenience: The sisters were born and raised and still live in Ditmas Park (Donette, quite the Brooklyn hardcore, commutes to work in Binghamton, about 180 miles away). Also, community: The sisters like to keep things in the neighborhood.
 WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT ''We were actually just discussing a proposal for a charter school in the community that's due in Albany on Monday,'' Sophia said. Donette, the wordsmith of the two, added between a bite, ''I'm her editor.'' The school is to be called the Una Clarke School, in honor of the area's former councilwoman, and if its charter is accepted by the state, it will educate 282 students from kindergarten through fifth grade. ''It's a good proposal,'' Donette said. ''I mean, it's much improved from the first go-round. I plan to work on it for the next eight hours. That's why she's buying me lunch.''

HEADLINE: Sonoma: A 'Slow City,' But Also a Walled One?

BYLINE: By DANIEL WEINTRAUB. 
Daniel Weintraub has reported on California politics and policy for more than 20 years.

 BODY:
The wine country town of Sonoma has long been derided as ''Slow-noma'' by bored teenagers looking for something to do at night. Now the adults are trying to make that snail-paced life a virtue. 
 The city of just under 10,000 is preparing to celebrate its official designation as a ''slow city'' by an international group that promotes sustainability and a leisurely pace of living. Sonoma is the first place in the United States to win the title. 
 To many residents, the award is confirmation of a concerted attempt to preserve an old-country, village atmosphere in town, where growth is limited, chain stores are discouraged and civic life revolves around a historic downtown plaza that gave birth to the Bear Flag revolt that sheared California from Mexico more than 150 years ago. 
 ''This is a real honor,'' said Virginia Hubbell, a consultant to nonprofit groups and philanthropists who directs a foundation that pushed hard for the designation. She sees the moment not only as recognition for past policies but also as a catalyst for the future. 
 But some critics see the ''slow city'' label as further evidence that Sonoma has walled itself off as an enclave for the rich and nearly famous -- well-to-do executives and wealthy retirees who have pulled up the drawbridge and left little room for low-income workers or even their own grown children.
 ''The danger is that a slow city ends up as a city for the geriatric rich and the trustafarians,'' said Joel Kotkin, an urban analyst and author of ''The City, a Global History.'' 
 He added: ''Think of Italy -- a very, very low birth rate and a stagnant economy. But a great lifestyle if you have money. A good life now, but what comes for the next generation?''
 Indeed, the average home sold in Sonoma in December went for more than $700,000. The city is whiter, older and wealthier than the rest of California and most of the Bay Area. Many of Sonoma's residents, if they work, commute to other wine country towns or to San Francisco, an hour away. Much of the city's work force must drive in from elsewhere. They cannot afford to live there.
 ''It's got an affluent demography juxtaposed on a relatively impoverished Hispanic population,'' said Robert Eyler, chairman of the economics department at Sonoma State University. ''It has that underbelly that sort of stays off the radar.''
 But Mr. Eyler said Sonoma's economy, built around the wine industry and the tourism it spawns, is healthier than most in the region. The town has nurtured small business and protected the neighboring vineyards in a way that shields it from big cyclical swings. Unemployment is about 7.5 percent in the city, compared with 10 percent in Sonoma County and 12.3 percent statewide.
 Among the qualities that qualified Sonoma for membership in the Italy-based Cittaslow organization were its promotion of renewable energy and its friendliness to pedestrians and bicycles. The city was recently recognized by Environment California, a nonprofit lobbying group, for having the fifth-highest number of solar-powered homes per capita in the state. And last year the League of American Bicyclists gave Sonoma a bronze-level designation for its efforts to improve safety and access for cyclists. 
 The city has two weekly farmers' markets, and the school district has moved to put gardens on every campus, with some of the produce going to the school menu and some of it sold to neighborhood families.
 Ms. Hubbell rejects any notion that the ''slow city'' movement is elitist. Part of the foundation's work, she said, will be a citywide assessment of needs that will reach out to low-income residents and workers. 
 ''Our community has been quite separated,'' Ms. Hubbell acknowledged. ''One of the main reasons for my excitement about the project is the chance to work with children all over the town, work with the families, connect the families and make everybody feel they are part of the whole fabric of the community in a way that perhaps they have not been in the past.''
 That is one thing in Sonoma she wants to see move quickly. 
 ''Every town can get better,'' she said. ''And that's what we are going to be doing.''

HEADLINE: THE 31 PLACES TO GO IN 2010

 BODY:
1. Sri Lanka
 For a quarter century, Sri Lanka seems to have been plagued by misfortune, including a brutal civil war between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil minority. But the conflict finally ended last May, ushering in a more peaceful era for this teardrop-shaped island off India's coast, rich in natural beauty and cultural splendors.
 The island, with a population of just 20 million, feels like one big tropical zoo: elephants roam freely, water buffaloes idle in paddy fields and monkeys swing from trees. And then there's the pristine coastline. The miles of sugary white sand flanked by bamboo groves that were off-limits to most visitors until recently are a happy, if unintended byproduct of the war.
 Among the most scenic, if difficult stretches to reach, is Nilaveli Beach in the Tamil north. While a few military checkpoints remain, vacationers can lounge on poolside hammocks under palm trees or snorkel in its crystal-clear waters. Or they can order cocktails at the Nilaveli Beach Hotel (www .tangerinehotels.com/nilavelibeach), a collection of recently renovated bungalows with private terraces. 
 An international airport in Matara, on the island's southern shore, is under construction, which will make the gorgeous beaches near the seaside village of Galle easier to get to. Decimated by the tsunami in 2004, the surrounding coastline is now teeming with stylish guesthouses and boutique hotels.
 Unawatuna, a crescent-shaped beach a few miles south of Galle, may be furthest along. Higher-end hotels there include Thambapanni Retreat (www.thambapanni.biz), which features four-poster beds, yoga and an ayurvedic spa. The Sun House (www.thesunhouse.com), in Galle, looks like a place where the Queen of England might stay, with its mango courtyard and colonial decor. One stylish place tucked within Galle's city walls is the Galle Fort Hotel (www.galleforthotel .com), a refurbished gem merchant's house run by a couple of Aussies. LIONEL BEEHNER
 2. Patagonia Wine Country
 Ten years ago, a group of adventurous winemakers set their sights on an Argentine valley called San Patricio del Chanar, an unusually fertile and eerily beautiful corner of Patagonia. They plowed, planted and waited. The outcome? A blossoming wine country with delicious pinot noirs and malbecs and smartly designed wineries.
 One of the area's pioneers, the 2,000-acre Bodega del Fin del Mundo (www.bodegadelfindelmundo.com), which works with the influential wine consultant Michel Rolland, is racking up international medals for its complex merlot, cabernet and malbec blends. And NQN (bodeganqn.com.ar), which is associated with the Argentine oenologist Roberto de la Mota, has seen its 2006 Coleccion NQN Malbec get 92 points from Wine Enthusiast. Nearby is the new Valle Perdido winery (www .valleperdido.com.ar), which includes an 18-room resort surrounded by vineyards. At the spa, ask for antioxidant wine-infused treatments. PAOLA SINGER
 3. Seoul
 Forget Tokyo. Design aficionados are now heading to Seoul. They have been drawn by the Korean capital's glammed-up cafes and restaurants, immaculate art galleries and monumental fashion palaces like the sprawling outpost of Milan's 10 Corso Como and the widely noted Ann Demeulemeester store -- an avant-garde Chia Pet covered in vegetation.
 And now Seoul, under its design-obsessed mayor, Oh Sehoon, is the 2010 World Design Capital. The title, bestowed by a prominent council of industrial designers, means a year's worth of design parties, exhibitions, conferences and other revelries. Most are still being planned (go to wdc2010.seoul .go.kr for updates). A highlight will no doubt be the third annual Seoul Design Fair (Sept. 17 to Oct. 7), the city's answer to the design weeks in Milan and New York, which last year drew 2.5 million people and featured a cavalcade of events under two enormous inflatable structures set up at the city's Olympic stadium. ARIC CHEN
 4. Mysore
 You've completed 200 hours of teacher training, mastered flying crow pose and even spent a week at yoga surf camp. What's next? Yogis seeking transcontinental bliss head these days to Mysore, the City of Palaces, in southern India.
 The yogi pilgrimage was sparked by Ashtanga yoga, a rigorous sweat-producing, breath-synchronized regimen of poses popularized by the beloved Krishna Pattabhi Jois, who died at 94 in 2009. Mr. Jois's grandson is now director of the Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute (www.kpjayi.org). First month's tuition is 27,530 rupees, or $600 at 46 rupees to the dollar. Classes generally require a onemonth commitment.
 Too much time or money? Mysore's yoga boom now has shalas catering to every need. Off the mat, the yoga tribe hobnobs at Anu's Bamboo Hut or the Regaalis Hotel pool, studies Sanskrit, gets an ayurveda treatment or tours the maharaja's palace. After studying at the Mysore mother ship, a yogi's street cred is undeniable. Wait! Delete that thought! Status yoga is odious! Namaste. MARY BILLARD
 5. Copenhagen
 As thousands of environmentalists heckled world leaders in Copenhagen last month for the climate summit, a solitary unifying note could be heard amid the cacophony of discord: the Danish capital has already emerged as one of the world's greenest -- and maybe coolest -- cities.
 Copenhageners don't simply preach the ''progressive city'' ethos, they live it. Long, flat urban thoroughfares are hemmed with bicycle paths where locals glide around the city, tourists saddle up on the free bikes that dot the city center, and fashion bloggers take notes on the latest cycle chic (see copenhagencyclechic.com). Over in the harbor district, a public bath at Osterbro, due to open in 2010, will complement the two swimming areas set off on Copenhagen's inner harbor, a formerly polluted waterway recently transformed into the city's summertime hub.
 Away from all the modernism and the happy cyclists, cultural thrill-seekers are being coaxed to the once dangerous district of Norrebro, which has arguably become Copenhagen's edgiest hub. A heady mix of hipsters, students and immigrants mingle in the cafes and galleries around the district's focal square, Sankt Hans Torv, and the city's young and excitable night owls can be found dancing in local clubs until the early hours.

 Waiting in The Wings
 6. Koh Kood
 Is this the next Koh Samui? The Trat islands are emerging as Thailand's new luxury outpost. Inaccessible for many years because of tensions with neighboring Cambodia and a poor transportation infrastructure, islands like Koh Kood are starting to draw venturesome paradise seekers, thanks in part to new direct flights to the port city of Trat. The recent opening of Soneva Kiri, a 42-villa suite retreat by the Six Senses brand (www.sixsenses.com /Soneva-Kiri), definitely ratchets up the high-end quotient on this Robinson Crusoe-like island. Coming soon: X2 Koh Kood (www.x2resorts .com), a designer eco-resort with 14 pool villas. GISELA WILLIAMS
 7. Damascus
 The next Marrakesh? Perhaps mindful of the way that renovations of historic riads have drawn upscale travelers to Marrakesh, Damascus hoteliers are trying to mine tourism gold in the rundown buildings of the Syrian capital's Old City. These 18thcentury homes -- many with inviting courtyards and rooftop terraces -- are now boutique hotels, like the nine-room Old Vine (www .oldvinehotel.com) and the Hanania (www.hananiahotel.com), which doubles as a hotel and a small museum. DON DUNCAN
 8. Cesme
 The next Bodrum? While revelers continue to descend upon that seaside retreat, another corner of Turkey's Aegean coastline has begun to emerge as a stylish alternative: the once-sleepy villages of the Cesme Peninsula. The main draw is Alacati, a sheltered beach town that last summer was the site of the Professional Windsurfers Association Slalom World Cup. Scheduled to open in the spring, the seven-room Hotel Nars Alacati (www.nars.com.tr), set in a converted 19th-century mansion, promises to become the popular weekend gathering spot for Istanbul's smart set, along with the adjoining garden restaurant, Mesa Luna. ANDREW FERREN
 9. Antarctica
 This may be the last year that Antarctica is open to mass tourism -- not because the ice is melting too fast (though it is), but because of restrictions that would severely curtail travel around the fragile continent.
 Until recently, most vessels passing through Antarctica were limited to scientific expeditions, but an exploding number of tourists now flock to what is arguably the world's last great wilderness. The tourism boom, scientists argue, poses a major environmental threat. Indeed, several passenger ships have run aground in recent years.
 Countries that manage Antarctica are calling for limits on the number of tourist ships, for fortified hulls that can withstand sea ice and for a ban on the use of so-called heavy oils. A ban on heavy oil, which is expected to be adopted by the International Maritime Organization later this year, would effectively block big cruise ships.
 With the new rules taking effect within two years, tour operators are promoting 2010 as the last year to visit Antarctica, while, at the same time, procuring lighter vessels that would be permitted. Abercrombie & Kent, for example, is introducing a new ship, Le Boreal (www.abercrombiekent.com), which its public relations firm argues ''meets all the environmental regulations, so access to Antarctica via A&K will not be affected.''
 Launching this year, the compact luxury ship holds 199 passengers and features an outdoor heated pool, steam rooms and private balconies that offer intimate views of some of the world's remaining glaciers. DENNY LEE
 10. Leipzig
 In 2010, Leipzig, a small industrial city in the former East Germany with an illustrious past, will be marking the 325th anniversary of the birth of its former resident Johann Sebastian Bach and the 200th birthday of Robert Schumann with concerts, festivals and a reopened Bach Museum (www.bach -leipzig.de).
 But the city's cultural high note is likely to be the Neo Rauch retrospective opening in April at the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts (www.mdbk.de), a show devoted to the father of the New Leipzig School of artists, a scene that for the past decade has been the toast of the contemporary art world. The art cognoscenti will also make their way to the Spinnerei (www.spinnerei.de), a former cotton mill that is home to 11 galleries, a cafe and a quirky new pension called the Meisterzimmer (www .meisterzimmer.de), with rooms starting at 50 euros, or $70 at $1.40 to the euro.
 The city is also making a splash on the musical front.Moon Harbour Recordings and Kann Records, two indie labels producing innovative electronica from D.J.'s, are based here. Sevensol and Matthias Tanzmann will undoubtedly be lugging their laptops to Leipzig Pop Up (www.leipzig -popup.de), a trade fair and music festival taking place in May. Otherwise, gigs can be heard yearround in the city's underbelly of abandoned factories and squats that look a lot like Berlin -- maybe 10 years ago. GISELA WILLIAMS
 Showing the World
 11. Los Angeles
 Visitors love to bemoan the lack of an old-fashioned cultural neighborhood in Los Angeles. In truth, the city has as many thriving art spots as it does ZIP codes. Last October, the pioneering Culver City gallery Blum & Poe (2727 South La Cienega Boulevard; 310-836-2062; www.blumandpoe.com) inaugurated an airy 21,000-square-foot space; in July, the veteran local dealer Thomas Solomon (427 Bernard Street; 323-427-1687; www .thomassolomongallery.com) opened a space in Chinatown. And the powerhouse New York galleries L&M Arts and Matthew Marks are scheduled to open prominent spaces in 2010.
 Local museums, many of which struggled financially in recent years, are back afloat. The Museum of Contemporary Art (www.moca.org) is celebrating its 30th birthday with a huge exhibition of 500 highlights from its outstanding collection of postwar art. In October, the vast Los Angeles County Museum of Art (www.lacma.org) will get even bigger when it unveils a Renzo Piano-designed addition to its multiacre mid-Wilshire campus. And the billionaire collector Eli Broad, who has been both savior and villain to just about every major museum in town, is now looking to plant his own museum in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica or a third unnamed location. ANDREW FERREN
 12. Shanghai
 To many, the idea of a World Expo might seem like a dated, superfluous throwback from some preglobalized age. (Remember the one in Aichi, Japan? Enough said.) But tell that to the 70 million who are expected to attend Expo 2010 in Shanghai.
 This is China, after all. And following up on Beijing's spectacular Olympics, Shanghai is pulling out all the stops. From May 1 to Oct. 31, more than 200 national and other pavilions will straddle the city's Huangpu River, turning a two-square-mile site into an architectural playground: Switzerland will be represented by a building shaped like a map of that country, complete with a rooftop chairlift, while England is in the celebrated hands of the designer Thomas Heatherwick, who is fashioning what looks like a big, hairy marshmallow. Other attention grabbers include Macao, taking the form of a walkthrough bunny, and the United Arab Emirates, which hired Foster + Partners to build a ''sand dune.'' (By contrast, the United States pavilion might be mistaken for a suburban office park.)
 In the run-up to the Expo, Shanghai seems to have taken this year's theme, ''Better City, Better Life,'' to heart, spending tens of billions of dollars to upgrade the city. The riverfront Bund promenade is getting a makeover with parks and pedestrianfriendly sidewalks, while the subway is being dramatically expanded -- including several new stations serving the World Expo site. ARIC CHEN
 13. Mumbai
 On the one-year anniversary of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, citizens painted a one-kilometer stretch of wall in South Mumbai with murals to show their love and hope for the city. The initiative, by a group of organizations that included the Mumbai Arts Project (MAP), which is dedicated to creating public art projects, is just one sign that Mumbai's art scene is on the rebound.
 A walk through the newly dubbed Colaba Art District yields no fewer than five contemporary art galleries. In the second half of 2009, two contemporary galleries opened: Gallery BMB (www.gallerybmb .com), which brought in big-name artists from around the globe for its first show (look for an exhibition focusing on new Indian women artists, starting on Feb. 8), and Volte (www.volte.in), a gallery, cafe and bookstore. Just down the street is Project 88 (www.project88.in), an outpost of Gallery 88 in Calcutta, focused on up-and-coming Indian and South Asian artists. The large, simple one-room space will show the artist Hemali Bhuta with an installation on the ceiling and archival prints on the walls, starting Jan. 18. Also nearby is Gallery Maskara (www.gallerymaskara.com), in a converted cotton storehouse; starting March 15, the space will host paintings, sculpture and watercolors by T. Venkanna, a popular artist based in nearby Vadodara. LINDSAY CLINTON
 14. Minorca
 While the beat of disco pounds in Ibiza and Majorca, their quiet sister Minorca offers a tranquil contrast to the glitz next door. The entire island is a Unesco Biosphere Reserve, so the Spanish megahotel development frenzy of the last decade has largely skipped over this patch of the Mediterranean. That means miles of beaches --some 120 of them, in fact, like the northern sweep of crystal-clear swimming waters in the coves called Cala d'Algaiarens, with fine sand and rolling dunes. And Minorca's eco-diversity extends well beyond the coasts: forests, deep gorges, wetlands, salt marshes and hillsides covered in lush greenery that sometimes look more New England than Mediterranean. Even the island's sun-bleached towns -- Mahon and Ciutadella, each combining elements of their British colonial heritage, Moorish roots and modern Spanish identity -- are more peaceful than their Majorcan equivalents.
 The ideal visit to Minorca celebrates islanders' emphasis on agritourism -- sleeping in rural establishments like Ca Na Xini (www.canaxini.com), a dairy farm that offers an eight-room temple to modernism inside the shell of a centuryold manor home. It's like spring break for eco-conscious adults. SARAH WILDMAN
 15. Costa Rica
 Costa Rica has been on any eco-minded traveler's radar for years, but with a new birding route in the northeast region of the country, there's a new reason to pay the country a visit. Opened in early 2009, the Costa Rican Bird Route (www.costaricanbirdroute.com) encompasses 13 far-flung nature reserves with phenomenal avian diversity -- the sites are home to more than 500 bird species.
 Travelers can explore the route on their own with a map ($12.95 when ordered online) or hire a local guide to lead the way. The most popular leg of the route centers on the Sarapiqui-San Carlos region, one of the last remaining habitats of the endangered and prized great green macaw. The landscape along the route runs from wetlands and river explorations to high rain forest canopies and waterfalls; birders can visit renowned tropical biological research stations, stay in newly built eco-lodges and hike or canoe through local family-run reserves in search of rare raptors, herons and kingfishers. BONNIE TSUI
 16. Marrakesh
 The ancient walls of Marrakesh must have protected the city from the global recession. Luxury boutique hotels, which began opening a few years ago, are now popping like Champagne corks over this historic and atmospheric North African city.
 La Mamounia, a famed playground for celebrities like Mick Jagger and Charlie Chaplin, reopened in November after a $176 million face-lift by the Parisian designer Jacques Garcia (www .mamounia.com). At its dazzling launch party, Jennifer Aniston, Orlando Bloom and Gwyneth Paltrow walked the red carpet, Jose Carreras sang, and Cirque du Soleil acrobats wrapped in Christmas lights scaled the hotel walls.
 ''There was caviar galore,'' said Sandra Zwollo, a Dutch expatriate who lived in La Mamounia for three years. ''And not only does the new La Mamounia reflect what is happening in Marrakesh at the moment, it is greatly contributing to it.''
 Ms. Zwollo herself is adding to the glamour of the city. Later this month, she plans to open Harem (www.harem -escape.com), a wellness retreat just for women, set on a stunning 12-acre estate in the city's outskirts surrounded by olive and palm groves.
 But it all pales in comparison to the palatial Royal Mansour, scheduled to open in 2010. Owned by King Mohammed VI of Morocco, who is largely responsible for the country's newfound glamour, the jaw-dropping resort is built along the city's ancient walls and has been designed almost like a minimedina with Andalusian-style courtyards.
 The 20,000-square-foot royal suite will have a private swimming pool, home theater, gym and private hammam. The resort will also feature three restaurants overseen by the three-star Michelin chef Yannick Alleno.
 There's more. By the end of 2010, the Mandarin Oriental Jnan Rahma, which looks like something out of a Merchant- Ivory movie, and a 140-room Four Seasons are both expected to open, while a Rocco Forte resort and W Hotel are in the works for 2011. GISELA WILLIAMS
 17. Las Vegas
 Despite a 4 percent drop in visitors in 2009, and the fact that several Las Vegas hotels have drastically slashed their rates to attract bargain-seeking travelers, a number of ambitious developers seem to think there is still money to be made in Sin City.
 CityCenter, MGM's $8.5 billion, 67- acre resort complex, is the Strip's biggest headliner in 2010. Four of the six planned properties opened in December, including three hotels and a 500,000-square-foot luxury shopping mall (www.citycenter.com). The residential Veer Towers and the Harmon, a 400-room boutique hotel, are scheduled to open this year. The complex also houses Haze, a 25,000-square-foot nightclub, and Cirque du Soleil's seventh show, ''Viva Elvis,'' a tribute to the king of rock 'n' roll.
 This summer, the Encore, a Steve Wynn property, is unveiling an entertainment complex and ''beach club'' (complete with three pools and V.I.P. cabanas)., and a new nightclub, Surrender.
 A five-pool addition to Garden of the Gods Pool Oasis at Caesars Palace, set to open in March, will feature swimup gaming and an 18-foot waterfall. The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, which unveiled its Paradise Tower in July, added the all-suite HRH Tower in late December, as well as Vanity, a 14,000-squarefoot nightclub. ALLISON BUSACCA
 18. Bahia
 All eyes will turn to sultry Rio de Janeiro when it hosts the 2016 Olympic Games, but right now Brazil's white-hot destination may be the northeastern state of Bahia. With its distinctive African- influenced flavors, cultural diversity, palm-fringed beaches and a new crop of chic hotels, the region is fast emerging as a jet-set playground.
 In the village of Trancoso, a hideaway that gets more fashionable by the minute, the Dutch designer Wilbert Das (longtime creative director of the Diesel label) opened Uxua Casa Hotel (www .uxua.com) using recycled materials including old roof tiles and abandoned fishing boats. The hotel's colorful casas and lush gardens were a canvas for the 2010 Pirelli calendar, shot by the badboy photographer Terry Richardson.
 Speaking of the town's rising cachet, a luxury Fasano resort -- with 30 beachfront villas, a restaurant and a spa -- is in the works.
 In Salvador, known for its pulsing street carnival and the historic Pelourinho district, head to one of the city's boutique lodgings. Zank (www .zankhotel.com.br) recently opened in the residential Rio Vermelho section and seamlessly blends modern and classic styles, with exceptional views of the Atlantic Ocean just steps away. Nearby is the Pestana Bahia Lodge (www.pestana.com), with a hilltop infinity pool and sunny sea-view rooms.
 While there, don't miss ''The Kiss'' and ''The Thinker'' by Auguste Rodin, on temporary view at the Palacete das Artes (palacetedasartesrodinbahia .blogspot.com), which opened a gallery devoted to the French sculptor. PAOLA SINGER
 19. Istanbul
 The reputation of Istanbul's contemporary art scene has been steadily growing in recent years, with the Web site ArtKnowledgeNews.com recently calling it ''one of the most innovative in the world.'' That reputation is bound to be burnished even more this year, now that Istanbul has been named the 2010 European Capital of Culture (a designation it shares with Essen, Germany, and Pecs, Hungary).
 There will be a series of events, gallery shows and stage performances throughout the city to mark the occasion. (A complete list of events can be found at en.istanbul2010.org/index .htm.)
 But one of the best ways to get a crash course in what Istanbul's leading artists are up to right now is to spend some time wandering around the Misir Apartments (311/4 Istiklal Cadessi), right on the busy pedestrian thoroughfare that cuts through the trendy Beygolu neighborhood. Inside this elegant, early-20th-century building are some of the city's most cutting-edge art venues, like Galerist (www.galerist.com.tr) and Gallerie Nev (www.galerinevistanbul .com)
 Afterward, head to the rooftop terrace and have a drink at 360 Istanbul, a stylish bar and restaurant that offers stunning views of the city's skyline (360istanbul.com). STUART EMMRICH
 20. Shenzhen
 Chances are, the iPod in your pocket was made in Shenzhen, China. But this industrial powerhouse of a city on the Pearl River Delta in the southern region of the country, is more than just a factory town of sweatshops and bad smog -- and it has the high-class hotels and high rollers to prove it.
 Shenzhen is one of China's wealthiest cities, right up there with Shanghai and Beijing. Situated just a one-hour bullet train ride north of Hong Kong, the thriving city exemplifies China's breakneck transformation from peasant economy to capitalist giant. Its rapid rise can be traced back to 1979, when Deng Xiaoping selected the sleepy fishing port as a special economic zone. Money, bulldozers and cheap labor poured in. Dim sum joints and illicit massage parlors gave way to gleaming shopping malls and faceless skyscrapers. A city of 14 million sprang up seemingly overnight.
 So did a new travel destination. A 491- room Grand Hyatt (1881 Baoan Nan Road; www.shenzhen.grand.hyatt .com), with bay views, recently opened, joining the ranks of the Kempinski Hotel Shenzhen (Hai De San Dao, Hou Hai Bin Road; www.kempinski.com /shenzhen) and a Shangri-La (1002 Jianshe Road; www.shangri-la.com /shenzhen). Even late-night massage parlors have gone upscale and legit. The Queen Spa (Chunfeng Road; www .queenspa.cn) has sleeping pods, a theater and a juice bar -- all for under $15 a night -- plus massages that start at about $25.
 Affordable luxuries extend to shopping and eating. The jumble of stalls at Dongmen are clogged with pirated DVDs and knock-off handbags, while there are new fashionable restaurants in Shekou, a leafy district with an expatriate flavor. Shenzhen is getting greener, too. The city recently welcomed the first LEED-certified building in southern China: the aptly named Horizontal Skyscraper, billed to be as long as the Empire State Building is tall. LIONEL BEEHNER
 21. Macedonia
 One of the deepest lakes on the planet, with a dazzling Unesco World Heritage site of ancient dwellings rising high above its shores, Lake Ohrid in Macedonia is a local vacation star poised for greater international acclaim.
 In the tiered, terra-cotta-roofed city of Ohrid, 18 miles from the Albanian border, a lakefront settlement dating back to Neolithic times,Macedonians boast that on their side of the lake is a church, monastery or mosque for every day of the year, each full of resplendent frescoes, mosaics and icons. Notable attractions include the recently renovated church of St. Clement and St. Panteleimon at Plaosnik, an epic Byzantine masterpiece, and the 13th-century St. John of Kaneo, a limestone and brick monastery that juts out over transparent blue waters.
 An estimated $50 million renovation of the Ohrid Airport is planned for 2010, with more international flights expected by summer, and up to six new luxury hotels are in the works, including a $33 million property with construction scheduled to begin in March. Tourist attractions on Ohrid's beaches were upgraded last year with swank bars and dining spots complimented by bamboo and leather couchettes, with the hot spot Cuba Libre (www.cubalibreohrid .com) leading the way.
 Meanwhile, new government-financed archaeological digs around the lake regularly unearth treasures, like the 17 fifth-century tombs discovered last July. The find follows the 2008 opening of the Museum on Water, a re-created Bronze Age village built on stilts incorporating Ohrid artifacts. DINAH SPRITZER
 22. South Africa
 As host of the 2010 World Cup this summer, South Africa has gotten its game on with a flurry of new stadiums, new hotels and safari lodges.
 While soccer is being played across nine cities, much of the action off the field is taking place in Cape Town. Already known for its stunning beaches, mouthwatering cuisine and sophisticated night life, the city is welcoming highend hotels, including the recently opened One & Only Cape Town and the forthcoming Taj Cape Town (www .tajhotels.com/capetown). Set to open this month, the Taj will have 166 rooms, many with views of Table Mountain.
 Also scheduled to open in Cape Town this year -- but not in time for the World Cup -- is the second branch of the nascent Missoni Hotels group (the first property opened in Edinburgh last year, with future outposts planned for Kuwait, Brazil and Oman).
 Between matches, there's plenty of time to go on a safari. If money is no object, check out the Ulusaba (www.ulusaba. virgin.com), a private game reserve that's part of Richard Branson's collection of luxury vacation properties. It has opened the new Cliff Lodge, with private swimming pools and spectacular views of the bush. Prices start at 13,800 South African rand (around $1,878 at 7.35 rand to the dollar) a night for two. DENNY LEE
 23. Breckenridge
 The ski resort of Breckenridge is not content to be merely the party capital of the Colorado Rockies -- now it wants to be the Amsterdam, too. For its 150th birthday, the former mining town -- known for its anything-goes reputation among ski fanatics -- recently passed an ordinance to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana.
 But even without the law, Breckenridge has plenty going for it, and not just the town's main strip, which is already an apres-ski bonanza of Irish joints, upscale restaurants and boutique shops. The BreckConnect Gondola now whisks skiers from town to the slopes in a matter of minutes. And the bases at Peak 7 and Peak 8 are barely recognizable from a few years back. A case in point is the recently opened Grand Lodge on Peak 7 (866-664-9782; www .grandlodgeonpeak7.com), which just rolled out a full-service spa and fitness center called Soothe.
 Don't expect any Amsterdam-style ''coffee shops'' near the slopes anytime soon: the new ordinance applies only to the town of Breckenridge, not the mountain. LIONEL BEEHNER
 24. Montenegro
 On the northern edges of Montenegro, almost at the border of Albania, is an unusual land formation: a powdery, eight-mile-long beach called Velika Plaza (Long Beach) and a triangular island where the Bojana River meets the sea. The island is called Ada Bojana, and the area is quickly becoming a party destination for the young surfer set.
 While the fantastic weather and soft gray beaches have drawn Eastern Europeans for decades, breezy thermal winds are bringing kitesurfers from Germany, England and France, who are turning Velika Plaza into a wave-riding capital on the Adriatic.
 The cheap beer doesn't hurt, either. The area is so undeveloped that the only resort is a faded nudist camp popular with Germans. In the meantime, travelers who want to keep their clothes on can book a 26-euro room (about $37, at $1.40 to the euro) at the Hotel Mediteran (hotel-mediteran.com) in the small city of Ulcinj, a 15-minute water taxi ride north. GISELA WILLIAMS
 25. Vancouver Island
 Vancouver will have the sporting world's attention when it hosts the Winter Olympics this year, but the most rewarding outdoor exploration is found outside the city, away from the crowds and off the beaten path. Hop the BC Ferry (www.bcferries.com) from Vancouver to Nanaimo, on Vancouver Island's east coast, and drive three hours through mountain passes to the wild, dramatic west coast. The new Wild Pacific Trail (www.wildpacifictrail.com) skirts the rocky, rugged shoreline, overlooking sandy coves lined with driftwood and tidepools and the Pacific beyond them.
 The hiking trail is being built in sections (there are three of seven set up so far), hand-cut through dense old-growth forests of cedar and spruce, with viewing platforms that let hikers see turn-ofthe- 20th-century lighthouses, kayakers heading to nearby islands, and the annual gray whale migration (about 20,000 pass by the island from February to late May). The base for the Wild Pacific Trail is a folksy fishing village called Ucluelet, a former First Nations settlement dotted with seaside inns, bed-andbreakfasts and beach cabins like the Terrace Beach Resort (www .terracebeachresort.ca), which has direct access to the trail.

 26. Colombia
 Unfairly or not, Colombia is still known for its cocaine cartels and street violence, but cool-hunting travelers are calling it Latin America's next affordable hot spot.
 Bogota, its capital, has emerged as a role model of urban reinvention. Starting in the late 1990s, the city underwent a breathtaking transformation. Sidewalks, once used mainly forparking, are now lined with bicycle paths and tree-shaded cafes. An innovative bus system zips residents across the trafficcongested city. And museums and restaurants have opened in its historic center, including the refurbished Museo del Oro, which houses pre-Columbian treasures. Getting there is affordable, too. Jet- Blue recently began nonstop daily service to Bogota from Orlando, Fla., joining other carriers including Delta.
 Meanwhile, the picturesque coastal city of Cartagena, a Unesco World Heritage site, which has been experiencing a tourism surge in recent years, gets even more stylish. The latest addition is the Tcherassi Hotel + Spa (www .tcherassihotels.com), a seven-room boutique hotel designed by Silvia Tcherassi, a Colombian fashion designer. It has even prompted some travel bloggers to call Cartagena the next Buenos Aires. DENNY LEE
 27. Kitzbuhel
 Most Austrians know the Austrian town of Kitzbuhel as nothing less than a ski paradise, with 53 lifts and 104 miles of powdery slopes. But in the past few years, Kitzbuhel has started to earn a reputation for its high-end dining -- three restaurants with Michelin stars, with two more Michelin-starred joints outside town -- making this small Alpine village of just 8,439 inhabitants an up-and-coming attraction for food lovers as well.
 Many of the most celebrated kitchens are in hotels, like the five-star Hotel Tennerhof (www.tennerhof.com), with one Michelin star and three Gault-Millau toques, and the Hotel Schwarzer Adler, which houses the Neuwirt restaurant (www.restaurant-neuwirt.at), serving updated Central European fare like goose liver with baked almond milk and plums. The A-Rosa resort and spa (www.resort.a-rosa.de), is host to no fewer than three restaurants, including KAPS, which was awarded its Michelin star in November 2008 and is known for its ''Poor Man's Menu,'' a set dinner of traditional recipes from the region.
 The highest fliers, however, seem to hide outside the village: Rosengarten, the only restaurant in the area to earn two Michelin stars (it was upgraded to two in 2009), is less than four miles away in Kirchberg. From there, it is about a 30-minute drive to Restaurant Schindlhaus (www.schindlhaus.com) in Soll, where the Winkler brothers, Christian and Markus, run a kitchen known for its dedication to local ingredients.
 Naturally, you can't expect meals at a top ski destination to go cheap. If the high-end prices are beyond your means, try something a little more bucolic: the barn at the 400-year-old Stanglwirt hotel (www.stanglwirt.com), where a lovely stube, or pub, serves schnitzel and goulash next to grazing cows. EVAN RAIL
 28. Norway
 With an acclaimed new opera house and plenty of high-end dining options, Oslo is already a must-visit urban destination. But this year the focus should be on the wilds of the Norwegian countryside. With its dazzling Nordic light and dramatic landscape, Norway is perhaps the most unexplored and exotic corner of Europe. Having convinced the world that its fjords and southern coastline make the country a great summer getaway, Norwegians have begun showcasing its charms as a winter destination.
 Specialized trekking and ski tours like those offered by the Lyngen Lodge (www.lyngenlodge.com) can open up pristine areas of the north like the stunning Lyngen Alps, with high-speed boats to shuttle across the fjord to ski trails that would otherwise be inaccessible. And the country's indifference to trendy boutique hotels and splashy resorts -- long the lament of global tourism professionals -- is just what appeals to a more discerning clientele. Bespoke travel specialists like Ziniry (www.ziniry.com) excel at getting visitors deep into the scenery. Who needs a penthouse suite when you can book a lighthouse on a private island? ANDREW FERREN
 29. Gargano
 Far from the madding crowds of Amalfi and Cinque Terre, the Italian peninsula of Gargano sits on the Adriatic and boasts a checklist of summer-perfect Italian holiday options. The offerings are largely a part of the protected Gargano National Park, a swath of terrain encompassing everything from the oak and beech Foresta Umbra to the sheer chalk-colored cliffs and grottoes of the coast's Caribbean-clear waters to the postcard-worthy whitewashed villages that hug the sea. Twelve nautical miles offshore, accessible by boat and hydrofoil, are the Tremiti Islands, specks of land surrounded by a wealth of sea life and a marine reserve of their own.
 Looking for Romanesque churches and seaside fisherman's restaurants? Try Peschici and Vieste, larger than fishing villages but cozier than cities, with white walls and medieval centers. How about mountain hiking? Check. Gargano also offers the rarest of luxuries: fabulous food and lodging on the cheap -- campsites offer space for mere pocket change, while hotel rooms can be had for 30 to 60 euros a night ($42 to $84 at $1.40 to the euro) in Peschici. If saving on food is wallet-friendly enough, pay a bit more than 100 euros and stay at the Chiusa delle More (www .lachiusadellemore.it), a 16th-century farmhouse in the national park but still only yards from the sea. Meals are locavore, Gargano style, incorporating the farm's own vegetables and eggs. SARAH WILDMAN
 30. Kuala Lumpur
 While Phuket and Angkor Wat are tourism anchors in Southeast Asia, jetsetters in the region are heading these days to Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital that's quietly evolved into one of the area's coolest and friendliest cities. Not only are K.L.-ites diehard foodies, fiercely proud of a robust street food scene that straddles Chinese, Indian and Malay flavors -- check out the food blog EatingAsia (www.eatingasia .typepad.com) -- they're also shopaholics, spending weekends trawling boutiques for the latest looks emerging from the sophisticated local fashion scene.
 The country's media-appointed King of Fashion is Bernard Chandran, who recently stole the spotlight when Lady Gaga wore one of his candy-pink minidresses to an awards show in London. His concept store is at the KL Plaza on Jalan Bukit Bintang. Another designer to look out for is Khoon Hooi, known for streamlined yet feminine dresses in muted tones, sold at his flagship store in the ritzy Starhill Gallery; and Melinda Looi, who makes vintage-inspired cocktail dresses from chiffon.
 Bloggers at Tongue in Chic keep vigilant watch over the city's fashion temples, which are clustered along the streets of Jalan Telawi 2 and 3 in the suburb of Bangsar, a 15-minute cab ride from the city center. To showcase the young designers, the blog recently started Chic POP, a flea market held every three months at one of K.L.'s most prestigious dance clubs, Zouk (www .zoukclub.com.my). NAOMI LINDT
 31. Nepal
 San Francisco, Amsterdam and Provincetown? Been there. Mykonos and Ibiza? Done that. Looking for the next gay destination? How about the Himalayan country of Nepal? Yes, Nepal. In the roughly two years since the nation's supreme court ordered that gay, lesbians and transgendered people be afforded equal rights, this conservative, mostly-Hindu country appears to be moving ahead full throttle.
 Gay friendly clubs now dot its capital. (Go to www.utopia-asia.com for listings.) A ''third gender'' category is an option on national I.D. cards. Recently, a transgender beauty queen even got a photo op with the prime minister. And now there's a tourist agency in Katmandu that is promoting gay tourism to Nepal. Started by Sunil Babu Pant, an openly- gay legislator, Pink Mountain Travels and Tours (www.pinkyatra.com) promises to marry adventure travel with gay weddings. With talk that Nepal may legalize same-sex marriage this year as the country hammers out a new constitution (and, perhaps more importantly, deals with recent bouts of civil unrest), Mr. Pant is offering to hold nuptials at the Mount Everest base camp, jungle safari honeymoons and bridal processions on elephant back.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 24, 2010

 CORRECTION:
The cover article on Jan. 10 about 31 Places to Go in 2010 misidentified the opposing sides in the civil war that plagued Sri Lanka for a quarter century. The war was between the Sinhalese-dominated government and a separatist Tamil group, not between the Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minority. 
 The article also misstated the length of time of a train trip between Hong Kong and Shenzhen and misidentified the type of train used. The trip is by commuter train, not by a bullet train, and the trip to Shenzhen from Hong Kong usually takes under 45 minutes, not an hour. 
 And the article referred incorrectly to the area of Montenegro in which a beach and an island are located. Velika Plaza, an eight-mile beach, and the island of Ada Bojana are on the southern edges of Montenegro, not the northern edges.

HEADLINE: The Other Plot to Wreck America

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
THERE may not be a person in America without a strong opinion about what coulda, shoulda been done to prevent the underwear bomber from boarding that Christmas flight to Detroit. In the years since 9/11, we've all become counterterrorists. But in the 16 months since that other calamity in downtown New York -- the crash precipitated by the 9/15 failure of Lehman Brothers -- most of us are still ignorant about what Warren Buffett called the ''financial weapons of mass destruction'' that wrecked our economy. Fluent as we are in Al Qaeda and body scanners, when it comes to synthetic C.D.O.'s and credit-default swaps, not so much. 
 What we don't know will hurt us, and quite possibly on a more devastating scale than any Qaeda attack. Americans must be told the full story of how Wall Street gamed and inflated the housing bubble, made out like bandits, and then left millions of households in ruin. Without that reckoning, there will be no public clamor for serious reform of a financial system that was as cunningly breached as airline security at the Amsterdam airport. And without reform, another massive attack on our economic security is guaranteed. Now that it can count on government bailouts, Wall Street has more incentive than ever to pump up its risks -- secure that it can keep the bonanzas while we get stuck with the losses. 
 The window for change is rapidly closing. Health care, Afghanistan and the terrorism panic may have exhausted Washington's already limited capacity for heavy lifting, especially in an election year. The White House's chief economic hand, Lawrence Summers, has repeatedlyannounced that ''everybody agrees that the recession is over'' -- which is technically true from an economist's perspective and certainly true on Wall Street, where bailed-out banks are reporting record profits and bonuses. The contrary voices of Americans who have lost pay, jobs, homes and savings are either patronized or drowned out entirely by a political system where the banking lobby rules in both parties and the revolving door between finance and government never stops spinning.
 It's against this backdrop that this week's long-awaited initial public hearings of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission are so critical. This is the bipartisan panel that Congress mandated last spring to investigate the still murky story of what happened in the meltdown. Phil Angelides, the former California treasurer who is the inquiry's chairman, told me in interviews late last year that he has been busy deploying a tough investigative staff and will not allow the proceedings to devolve into a typical blue-ribbon Beltway exercise in toothless bloviation. 
 He wants to examine the financial sector's ''greed, stupidity, hubris and outright corruption'' -- from traders on the ground to the board room. ''It's important that we deliver new information,'' he said. ''We can't just rehash what we've known to date.'' He understands that if he fails to make news or to tell the story in a way that is comprehensible and compelling enough to arouse Americans to demand action, Wall Street and Washington will both keep moving on, unchallenged and unchastened. 
 Angelides gets it. But he has a tough act to follow: Ferdinand Pecora, the legendary prosecutor who served as chief counsel to the Senate committee that investigated the 1929 crash as F.D.R. took office. Pecora was a master of detail and drama. He riveted America even without the aid of television. His investigation led to indictments, jail sentences and, ultimately, key New Deal reforms -- the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Glass-Steagall Act, designed to prevent the formation of banks too big to fail.
 As it happened, a major Pecora target was the chief executive of National City Bank, the institution that would grow up to be Citigroup. Among other transgressions, National City had repackaged bad Latin American debt as new securities that it then sold to easily suckered investors during the frenzied 1920s boom. Once disaster struck, the bank's executives helped themselves to millions of dollars in interest-free loans. Yet their own employees had to keep ponying up salary deductions for decimated National City stock purchased at a heady precrash price.
 Trade bad Latin American debt for bad mortgage debt, and you have a partial portrait of Citigroup at the height of the housing bubble. The reckless Citi executives of our day may not have given themselves interest-free loans, but they often walked away with the short-term, illusionary profits while their employees were left with shredded jobs and 401(k)'s. Among those Citi executives was Robert Rubin, who, as the Clinton Treasury secretary, helped repeal the last vestiges of Glass-Steagall after years of Wall Street assault. Somewhere Pecora is turning in his grave
 Rubin has never apologized, let alone been held accountable. But he's hardly alone. Even after all the country has gone through, the titans who fueled the bubble are heedless. In last Sunday's Times, Sandy Weill, the former chief executive who built Citigroup (and recruited Rubin to its ranks), gave a remarkable interview to Katrina Brooker blaming his own hand-picked successor, Charles Prince, for his bank's implosion. Weill said he preferred to be remembered for his philanthropy. Good luck with that.
 Among his causes is Carnegie Hall, where he is chairman of the board. To see how far American capitalism has fallen, contrast Weill with the giant who built Carnegie Hall. Not only is Andrew Carnegie remembered for far more epic and generous philanthropy than Weill's -- some 1,600 public libraries, just for starters -- but also for creating a steel empire that actually helped build America's industrial infrastructure in the late 19th century. At Citi, Weill built little more than a bloated gambling casino. As Paul Volcker, the regrettably powerless chairman of Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, said recently, there is not ''one shred of neutral evidence'' that any financial innovation of the past 20 years has led to economic growth. Citi, that ''innovative'' banking supermarket, destroyed far more wealth than Weill can or will ever give away. 
 Even now -- despite its near-death experience, despite the departures of Weill, Prince and Rubin -- Citi remains as imperious as it was before 9/15. Its current chairman, Richard Parsons, was one of three executives (along with Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and John Mack of Morgan Stanley) who failed to show up at the mid-December White House meeting where President Obama implored bankers to increase lending. (The trio blamed fog for forcing them to participate by speakerphone, but the weather hadn't grounded their peers or Amtrak.) Last week, ABC World News was also stiffed by Citi, which refused to answer questions about its latest round of outrageous credit card rate increases and instead e-mailed a statement blaming its customers for ''not paying back their loans.'' This from a bank that still owes taxpayers $25 billion of its $45 billion handout! 
 If Citi, among the most egregious of Wall Street reprobates, feels it can get away with business as usual, it's because it fears no retribution. And it got more good news last week. Now that Chris Dodd is vacating the Senate, his chairmanship of the Banking Committee may fall next year to Tim Johnson of South Dakota, home to Citi's credit card operation. Johnson was the only Senate Democrat to vote against Congress's recent bill policing credit card abuses. 
 Though bad history shows every sign of repeating itself on Wall Street, it will take a near-miracle for Angelides to repeat Pecora's triumph. Our zoo of financial skullduggery is far more complex, with many more moving pieces, than that of the 1920s. The new inquiry does have subpoena power, but its entire budget, a mere $8 million, doesn't even match the lobbyingexpenditures for just three banks (Citi, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America) in the first nine months of 2009. The firms under scrutiny can pay for as many lawyers as they need to stall between now and Dec. 15, deadline day for the commission's report. 
 More daunting still is the inquiry's duty to reach into high places in the public sector as well as the private. The mystery of exactly what happened as TARP fell into place in the fateful fall of 2008 thickens by the day -- especially the behind-closed-door machinations surrounding the government rescue of A.I.G. and its counterparties. Last week, a Republican congressman, Darrell Issa of California, released e-mail showing that officials at the New York Fed, then led by Timothy Geithner, pressured A.I.G. to delay disclosing to the S.E.C. and the public the details on the billions of bailout dollars it was funneling to its trading partners. In this backdoor rescue, taxpayers unknowingly awarded banks like Goldman 100 cents on the dollar for their bets on mortgage-backed securities.
 Why was our money used to make these high-flying gamblers whole while ordinary Americans received no such beneficence? Nothing less than complete transparency will connect the dots. Among the big-name witnesses that the Angelides commission has called for next week is Goldman's Blankfein. Geithner, Henry Paulson and Ben Bernanke should be next.
 If they all skate away yet again by deflecting blame or mouthing pro forma mea culpas, it will be a sign that this inquiry, like so many other promises of reform since 9/15, is likely to leave Wall Street's status quo largely intact. That's the ticking-bomb scenario that truly imperils us all.

HEADLINE: Robert M. White Jr.

 BODY:
Mr. White, 45, is the founder and president of Real Capital Analytics, a Manhattan-based market research company that tracks commercial real estate sales and trends globally.
 Before starting R.C.A., in 2001, Mr. White spent 14 years working in real estate investment banking and as a broker, at Granite Partners, now called Savills, and at Eastdil Realty.
Q. What prompted you to start the company? 
 A. My friends on the Street --whether they are in M & A or municipal bonds -- could always say, ''In my industry the volume last week was X-hundred billion.'' Down to the penny. Nobody knew how many office buildings were traded in any given year or how big the volume was in this marketplace.
 I started collecting information and publishing quarterly reports for clients, and as we traveled around pitching business, I could see their eyes light up when they saw this marketplace quantified. A lot of the standard metrics that Wall Street uses to analyze financial markets were applicable, and I thought, hmm ... there's something there.
 Q. What is R.C.A.'s main focus? 
 A. We focus exclusively on the capital side -- the sales. We have 108 countries where we're tracking deals right now. We have data partnerships and researchers, and throughout the staff we have 17, 18 language capabilities.
 Q. Let's get right to the numbers for the New York market. 
 A. In 2009, the investment market came to a near-standstill in Manhattan. For all property types, 2009 will be below $7 billion in terms of sales in the New York City metropolitan area.
 That compares with $77 billion in 2007, so we're at 10 percent of volume from two years ago. It's also a big drop-off from 2008, which wasn't a good year, either; in 2008, we had $26 billion in sales, which still earned us the No. 2 spot globally, behind Tokyo. When you think of it, $7 billion in deals is nothing -- it's not much more than the price for Stuyvesant Town.
 Office sales are about $2.7 billion. In 2008, it was $15 billion, and at the peak, in 2007, it was $50 billion.
 Q. How many transactions? 
 A. For office properties $5 million or greater in Manhattan, there were 23. In 2007, there were 188; and in 2008, 84.
 Q. And for all property types? 
 A. It's 86 transactions. In 2008, 250 transactions; and then the peak in 2007, it was 488 transactions, including some buildings that were traded twice.
 Q. What was the biggest deal? 
 A. The biggest, and probably the most symbolic deal, was Worldwide Plaza. It was one of the last of the famous Macklowe Properties assets.
 Q. Where does New York rank globally right now? 
 A. The bad news is Manhattan has been knocked off the perennial perch as the No. 1 market. It's not even in the top 10 of all property types -- it's down to No. 13. In the office sector, New York fell to No. 8.
 Q. Which cities precede it? 
 A. Let's just talk office: there's London, Tokyo, Paris, Seoul, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Moscow. Even Moscow had more office sales than New York!
 Q. Do you find any of those markets of particular interest? 
 A. I'm watching very closely the pricing of office buildings in London, because that city is a very good template for where Manhattan is headed next. Manhattan and London have the world's largest financial, economic and cultural centers, so capital from all over the globe wants to be invested in real estate in usually one of those two markets. London started its downward descent maybe a year before New York, but in the past six months, and especially in the past 90 days, activity has exploded.
 Q. Is there a similar rebound on the horizon in New York? 
 A. A key factor in the turnaround in Europe has been foreign investors. They are responsible for about 80 percent of the deals in London over the past six months. And much of that money would like to be in New York. As cap rates fall in London and prices rise again, New York starts looking more attractive on a relative pricing basis.
 Q. Do you own real estate? 
 A. I own a brownstone on the Upper West Side. I bought it 15 years ago for $475,000, and used a second mortgage on it to start the company. Now I'm trying to decide: Should I renovate this place to a single-family, which could get the big bucks, or maybe hedge the bet and do a duplex?

HEADLINE: Suzanne Nam, John Brown

 BODY:
Suzanne Nam, a daughter of Eileen Prince of Ashland, Mass., and Kenneth E. Nam of Irvine, Calif., was married at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia on Saturday evening to John Wroughton Brown, a son of Clare R. Brown and William T. Brown of Glenside, Pa. The couple exchanged vows under a provision of Pennsylvania law that allows couples to marry without an officiant, as in the Quaker tradition.

HEADLINE: Failed Olympics Bid Leaves Neighborhood in Flux

BYLINE: By RACHEL CROMIDAS; Rachel Cromidas is a Chicago freelance writer. Ben Goldberger contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For much of Shannon Fischer's 20 years, community change in her Bronzeville neighborhood has come in the form of a wrecking ball.
 First, the Ida B. Wells housing projects fell, then the Robert Taylor homes, and now, within view of her apartment at 33rd Street and Cottage Grove, Michael Reese Hospital is coming down. Destruction can often lead to reconstruction, but hopes that Bronzeville might be revitalized as the site of an Olympic Village died in October when Chicago lost its bid for the 2016 Summer Games.
The neighborhood's residential market took a severe hit, and developers have put off major investments. Few developers, it seems, can get serious about new projects in Bronzeville until the City of Chicago reveals plans for the landmark Michael Reese site, 37 acres at the heart of a potentially promising lakefront neighborhood. 
 Ms. Fischer remains optimistic. Even though the blocks in her neighborhood alternate between new condominiums and empty lots, foot traffic is sparse -- and the only shopping center consists mostly of convenience stores and an auto repair shop -- she believes greater Bronzeville will have its day. 
 ''I think the neighborhood will continue to grow, considering there's different people, different races and age groups moving in,'' Ms. Fischer said. 
 Bronzeville was once a thriving ''black metropolis'' with hundreds of black-owned businesses and a booming night life. Its population swelled during the great migration of Southern blacks seeking jobs after World War I. 
 The poet Gwendolyn Brooks lived there, and in 1945, her first book of poetry -- ''A Street in Bronzeville'' -- brought her instant critical acclaim. Other notable residents included Richard Wright, the author of ''Native Son,'' and the jazz pioneer Louis Armstrong. 
 The area's decline began in the 1950s as it gradually lost its middle class and businesses started to close. Though Bronzeville is unlikely to reclaim its golden era, developers like Keith Giles see the potential for new growth, only he does not expect to reach it any time soon. 
 Last year, Mr. Giles's firm, Kargil Development, told the city that it was interested in developing the Olympic Village. The project would have helped Olympics promoters realize their vision of a new neighborhood that could bridge the gap between the resurgent Bronzeville community and the South Loop. 
 ''It was an exciting development opportunity for an international event,'' Mr. Giles said. 
 But with the Olympics impetus gone, banks not lending and no other financing in sight, Mr. Giles does not expect action soon on a Michael Reese site that might cost $1 billion to redevelop. 
 ''The development business right now is on sabbatical,'' he said. 
 While Mr. Giles's company considers another project nearby, it doesn't expect to see change soon.. ''Unfortunately, most everything has stopped,'' Mr. Giles said. ''There's new developments on one block, and you go across the street and there's a burned-out building.'' 
 Alderman Toni Preckwinkle, whose Fourth Ward includes the Reese campus, expects the city to release its plan for the site early this year. She said that a developer might be selected by the end of the year, but that the first buildings would most likely not be completed until 2012.
 Ms. Preckwinkle also said developers would ''prefer a clear site'' around Michael Reese, casting further doubt on the efforts of preservationists who are fighting to save nearby buildings designed in consultation with the architect Walter Gropius, founder of the influential Bauhaus School.
 Bernita Johnson-Gabriel, executive director of the Quad Communities Development Corporation, a neighborhood group that serves the Kenwood, Oakland and Douglas neighborhoods that make up greater Bronzeville, said hurdles to development included concerns about crime that are rooted in racial stereotypes. 
 ''We are a neighborhood of color,'' Ms. Johnson-Gabriel said. ''There's a perception of crime that obviously doesn't quite exist here the way it is portrayed.'' 
 Indeed, crime in the Douglas and neighboring Oakland neighborhoods fell steadily over the past decade, according to Chicago Police Department reports. Statistics show a 67 percent decline for Douglas -- to 1,074 crimes in 2009 from 3,290 in 1999 -- while Oakland's number fell by more than half, to fewer than 300 from 611. 
 Some of the city's larger development groups are pushing ahead despite a lack of clarity about the city's plans. One, Draper and Kramer, is proceeding on a 70-acre development just south of Michael Reese that it began planning three years ago. In addition to 2,000 high-rise apartment units, the Lake Meadows project will feature renovation of existing rental units and condominiums, construction of single-family town homes and expansion of a small shopping center on the corner of 35th Street and Cottage Grove.
 The firm will keep a close eye on the city's plan for the Michael Reese site. 
 ''We are very interested because it's a large development and right next door to our property,'' said Donald Vitek, vice president of acquisitions and development for Draper and Kramer.
 While some residents and developers want officials to move quickly on the city's plans for the Reese site, Mr. Vitek said a slower pace made sense. It will allow time to survey current community needs, he said, and possibly wait out a soured housing market.
 The Douglas neighborhood's new condos and town homes are selling for as little as $125 a square foot, a steep discount from similar South Loop properties. But Mr. Vitek predicted a steady increase in demand once the market improves.
 An Olympics aftershock is hitting the market for existing homes in the neighborhood, too. Pam Dempsey, a real estate broker for Bronzeville Properties, said home sales came to a standstill during the Olympics bidding process, as property owners waited for the decision on a site. Only after the bid failed did they look to sell. 
 ''They're now entering into a down market,'' Ms. Dempsey said. Prices for single-family homes in the area have declined to $100,000 to $200,000 now from $200,000 to $400,000 in mid-2007, she said. A high foreclosure rate has made the Bronzeville downturn worse than what has hit the South Loop or Hyde Park. 
 ''We've experienced a lot of really, really deeply discounted foreclosures,'' Ms. Dempsey said. ''You'll have a house that needs a ton of work going for maybe $35,000.''
 When development does come, she said, Bronzeville will benefit most if the retail part appeals to the same kind of newly affluent residents as those who have moved into the South Loop and Hyde Park. 
 ''Not the fast-food stuff we already have around here,'' Ms. Dempsey said, ''but nicer retail, like the stuff that came to the South Loop over the past 5 to 10 years. A wine shop or a cafe or bookstores -- these things will keep people in the neighborhood.''
 Joseph Schwietermann, director of the Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development at DePaul University, warned against easy comparisons between Bronzeville and the Hyde Park and South Loop neighborhoods. He attributes a combination of poor post-World War II urban planning and Bronzeville's history of slow growth as factors that have made Bronzeville less successful.
 ''It's easier to invest in housing with the hopes that retail will follow,'' Mr. Schwietermann said. But, he added, ''you can't assume that if you buildit, they will come.'' 
 In October, contractors hired by the city began tearing down the first of seven buildings on the Michael Reese campus slated for demolition. The timeline for development is not urgent, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Community Development said, because the city will not begin making mortgage payments on the property until 2014. 
 The department envisions a large-scale residential and retail complex with a mixture of affordable and market-rate housing, in addition to dry cleaners, coffee shops and other staple businesses of neighborhood life. Its stated goal is ''to build a community from scratch,'' and stimulate redevelopment on the lakefront south of McCormick Place.
 Byron Lindsey, manager of an auto repair shop, has seen little retail growth around the garage he has managed for nearly 20 years in what is now the Lake Meadows shopping center.
 But his business is down only slightly despite the slow economy, Mr. Lindsey said as he juggled a phone in each hand and spoke to customers from behind the counter. He has perceived an influx of higher-income residents over the past five years, which he expects will contribute to a comeback once the economy recovers. 
 Redevelopment of the Michael Reese property could be the key.
 ''It could really determine whether the community gets a kick-start on its way back,'' Mr. Lindsey said.

HEADLINE: Spitzer Calls Gillibrand's Views 'Wrong' and 'Malleable'

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON

 BODY:
Former Gov. Eliot Spitzer tore into Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand's performance in the office during an interview with an Albany radio station, and attacked Democratic leaders for protecting her. 
 In an interview on WAMC, Mr. Spitzer said he would not have appointed Ms. Gillibrand ''under any circumstance'' because her ''views on issues are either wrong or too malleable.''
 Gov. David A. Paterson appointed Ms. Gillibrand to the seat vacated by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who left the Senate to become secretary of state. She cultivated a reputation as a centrist in the House of Representatives, winning two elections in a conservative upstate district. But since her appointment, Ms. Gillibrand has staked out public positions more in line with the state's Democratic mainstream on some issues. 
 ''We need people in leadership now who know what they believe, who are willing to stand up and state what they believe and make tough decisions on critical issues relating to the economy, civil rights, issues of crime and punishment, guns, same-sex marriage,'' Mr. Spitzer told WAMC's Alan Chartock. ''And I just think on every one of those scores, she fails.''
 A spokesman for Ms. Gillibrand alluded to the failings of Mr. Spitzer, who resigned in 2008 after the revelation that he patronized a high-priced call girl service.
 ''Because of his own actions, it wasn't his call to make,'' said the spokesman, Glen Caplin. ''It's not surprising considering she was among the first Democrats to say he would need to step down if the allegations were true.''
 Mr. Spitzer was also critical of national Democrats' efforts to discourage primary challenges to Ms. Gillibrand.
 ''I think the White House should focus on creating jobs, getting health care reform, reforming our financial structure -- and it has in that area in particular done a very poor job -- rather than getting immersed in the local politics of New York State,'' Mr. Spitzer said in the interview. (WAMC's Web site linked to a brief post and transcript excerpts on a blog by the Times Union of Albany.) 
 Mr. Spitzer has also denounced the White House's efforts to dissuade Mr. Paterson from running for election this year. But in expressing disagreement with Mr. Paterson's choice, the former governor seemed to depart from his normal resistance to directly criticizing his successor.
 A spokeswoman for the governor had no comment. 
 Though many of the Democrats contemplating a challenge to Ms. Gillibrand have stood down, former Representative Harold E. Ford Jr. of Tennessee, who began working in New York three years ago, is seriously considering a run. He said he would not be ''bullied or intimidated'' by ''party bosses.''

HEADLINE: The Benefits of Tribal Gambling

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''The Shinnecocks, Recognized'' (editorial, Jan. 3) unfairly tarnishes tribal-government gaming. Reflexively linking casinos to ''tainted money ... addiction, crime and other social ills'' belies the truth about modern Indian gaming: it is responsible, respected and highly regulated. 
 Indian gaming has primed the pump of economic development on reservations across the country and helped to narrow the enormous gap between tribal and nontribal economies. But once economic growth is established, tribal governments increasingly use gaming proceeds to diversify into other economic enterprises both on and off their reservations. Through voluntary philanthropy and binding agreements with local governments, gaming tribes invest heavily to strengthen the social fabric of communities.
 The Shinnecocks enjoy unique options apart from casinos based on their prime location in the Hamptons, but this shouldn't deny them a casino -- nor detract from the enormous benefits tribal-government gaming has brought to tribes, tribal citizens and neighboring communities across the nation.
 Charles Altekruse Berkeley, Calif., Jan. 4, 2010
 The writer is a community relations consultant for tribes in California.
 To the Editor:
 I was disappointed, but not surprised, to see the editorial page trot out the same tired old claims about the casino industry in its attempt to advise the newly recognized Shinnecock tribe on the best course for economic development.
 As countless studies, local law enforcement agencies and the citizens of gaming jurisdictions continue to attest, casino gaming is a mainstream, highly regulated and safe form of entertainment for adults across the world.
 One need only visit Iowa, the first Midwestern state to liberalize gaming, to see if the moral fabric of the area remains intact 20 years later.

HEADLINE: Obama Says Benefits From Health Care Overhaul Would Be Immediate

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama said Saturday that Americans would see immediate benefits from a landmark overhaul of the nation's health insurance system and he urged Congress to swiftly reconcile differences over the legislation so it could be signed into law in the coming weeks. 
 ''Once I sign health insurance reform into law, doctors and patients will have more control over their health care decisions, and insurance company bureaucrats will have less,'' Mr. Obama said. ''All told, these changes represent the most sweeping reforms and toughest restrictions on insurance companies that this country has ever known.''
 In his weekly Saturday address, Mr. Obama highlighted elements of the plan that would take effect soon after enactment of the bill. He said the law would allow people with pre-existing illnesses to be able to buy affordable insurance, children with pre-existing conditions would no longer be denied coverage and small business owners who could not afford to cover employees would receive tax credits to buy insurance.
 ''What every American should know is that once I sign health insurance reform into law, there are dozens of protections and benefits that will take effect this year,'' Mr. Obama said.
 Most of the proposed changes in the bill would not take effect until 2014, but the president used his weekly address to try to raise the urgency for the legislation.
 The competing versions of the plan in the House and Senate would require most Americans to get health insurance and provide subsidies for those who cannot afford it. But significant differences remain over how to accomplish that goal, including what taxes will be raised.
 House Democrats, along with leaders of organized labor, oppose a provision in the Senate bill to impose a tax on top-shelf insurance plans. Mr. Obama will meet on Monday at the White House with top labor leaders to discuss their opposition to that provision of the bill. 
 In his address, the president said the health insurance overhaul was needed to improve the economic fortunes for the nation's middle class.
 ''We need to rebuild our economy in such a way that our families can feel a measure of security again,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Too many of the folks I've talked with this year, and whose stories I read in letters at night, tell me that they've known their own private recessions since long before economists declared one -- and they'll still feel the recession long after economists have declared it over.''

HEADLINE: Hotel Slump? Don't Tell Them

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
TO open a hotel in 2010 -- when the industry is in its worst slump in decades -- requires chutzpah.
 Who's got chutzpah? Donald Trump, for one. The Trump SoHo (www.trumpsohohotel.com), a 391-room hotel in Lower Manhattan, is expected to open this spring, towering over its low-rise neighbors with a lot of razzle-dazzle. 
 Oh, and Kelly Wearstler has chutzpah. The former Playboy centerfold is putting the finishing touches on the Viceroy Snowmass in Colorado and the Viceroy Anguilla in the Caribbean (www.viceroyhotelsandresorts.com). Both have the kind of glamour that have made Ms. Wearstler a top interior designer and Bravo TV star.
 And Giorgio Armani has chutzpah, or whatever it's called in Italian. This spring, he plans to unveil the first in a much-hyped chain of Armani Hotels (www.armanihotels.com). Where? In the Burj Dubai, the tallest building in the world. The hotel features lots of dark leather and wood and -- given Dubai's economic troubles -- will stand either as a symbol of rebirth or of hubris. 
 It won't be the only new hotel in the emirate. One & Only Resorts (www.oneandonlyresorts.com) is set to open a new resort on the tree-shaped Palm Jumeirah Island. So what if there's already a One & Only (the Royal Mirage) overlooking Palm Jumeirah Island? Call it the Two & Only.
 Another desert emirate sprouting new hotels is Dubai's oil-rich sister, Abu Dhabi. The biggest surprise there may be the Yas (www.theyashotel.com). Designed by Asymptote, the hot architecture firm based in New York, the 499-room Yas Hotel is covered in a shell of diamond-shaped glass panels, like a high-tech veil. Even more surprising, it bridges Abu Dhabi's new Formula One racetrack.
 While new hotels in the Middle East are making bold architectural statements, European hotels seem to be slipping into older buildings unobtrusively. In Venice, Philippe Starck designed the modern, 26-room Palazzina Grassi (www.palazzinagrassi.it) to disappear behind a 15th-century facade. In Amsterdam, the 23-room Canal House Hotel (www.canalhouse.nl) is set to open in a group of charming old houses on the Keizergracht, with canal views and contemporary styling. 
 In London, the Dean Street Townhouse (www.deanstreettownhouse.com) -- a 39-room hotel in what was once the Gargoyle Club -- has four-poster beds, hand-painted wallpapers and other retro-chic touches. And in Portugal, the Palacio do Freixo (www.pousadas.com), in Porto, occupies a magnificently restored Baroque palace and former factory next door. 
 Closer to home, the hotel boom doesn't seem to have slowed much in New York City. Vikram Chatwal, the hotelier behind the Dream Hotels in New York and Bangkok, is opening the Chatwal (www.vikramchatwalhotels.com) in the former Lambs Club on West 44th Street designed by the great Beaux-Arts architect Stanford White. An outpost of the Mondrian Hotel (www.mondrianhotel.com) is coming to SoHo, with design based on the 1946 Cocteau Surrealist film ''Beauty and the Beast'' and the ''Top Chef'' alum Sam Talbot manning the kitchen. 
 Also expected to open are the W Downtown (www.whotels.com), with views of the World Trade Center site, and Fashion 26 (www.wyndham.com), a Wyndham Hotel that takes its cue from the Fashion Institute of Technology, its 26th Street neighbor. The Kimpton chain, known for its affordable, boutique-ish hotels, will open the Eventi (www.eventihotel.com) in the Chelsea neighborhood. And Patrik Horstmann, the longtime manager of the Gansevoort Hotel, will open the Nolitan (www.nolitanhotel.com), a boutique hotel just north of Little Italy. 
 Not all the openings are in Manhattan. The 321-room Sheraton Brooklyn (www.sheraton.com/brooklyn), near the MetroTech Center, is expected to open in March, and will be one of the borough's largest new hotels in decades. Elsewhere in the Americas: In Cartagena, Colombia, the Sofitel Santa Clara (www.hotelsantaclara.com) is opening in a former monastery that dates from 1621. And in Mexico, in another sign of Acapulco's rebirth, Banyan Tree Hotels and Resorts, the Singapore-based chain, plans to open the Banyan Tree Cabo Marques (www.banyantree.com/en/cabomarques).
 Asia, meanwhile, continues to add hotels at a furious pace. In Thailand, Ritz-Carlton Reserve opens Phulay Bay (www.phulaybay.com), a 54-villa resort in the southern town of Krabi that offers private butlers and meditation classes taught by monks. Not far away, W Hotels is planning to open the W Retreat Koh Samui (www.whotels.com/kohsamui). 
 Anantara, a resort chain based in Bangkok, is opening the Anantara Kihavah Villas in the Maldives (www.kihavah-maldives.anantara.com), a secluded 82-villa resort with private swimming pools, thatched roofs and an underwater restaurant.
 Don't confuse Anantara with Aman -- the ne plus ultra chain that is set to open Amanfayun (www.amanfayun.com), a spectacular 42-room resort that evokes an ancient Chinese compound, about 20 minutes from Hangzhou, China. It's just one of hundreds of hotels expected to open in China in 2010, including three hotels from Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts (www.shangri-la.com), in Beijing, Guilin and Shanghai.
 Another growth market is India, where Starwood has more than a dozen hotels in the pipeline, including three Aloft hotels (www.alofthotels.com) and the Westin New Delhi Gurgaon (www.westin.com/gurgaon), scheduled to open in July. 
 The St. Regis is set to open its first hotel in Japan, in the heart of Osaka (www.stregis.com/osaka). In Tokyo, the Tokyu hotel group plans to open the Capital Hotel Tokyu (www.tokyuhotelsjapan.com) near the Imperial Palace. This is no capsule hotel -- the smallest room will be more than 400 square feet.
 Singapore is also bucking the global hotel downturn. The Wangz Hotel (www.wangzhotel.com) on Tiong Bahru Road occupies a futuristic cylindrical building (the shape is said to induce relaxation). Even more spectacular -- or gaudy -- is the Marina Bay Sands (www.marinabaysands.com), a giant resort composed of three 55-story towers, with a giant park on their shared roof. When it opens, the hotel-casino-resort is expected to feature a production of ''The Lion King,'' and restaurants by Mario Batali, Wolfgang Puck and Daniel Boulud. All three are known for their cuisine and for their chutzpah.

HEADLINE: Yours for Under $1 Million

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
TWO years ago, unemployment was around 5 percent, the average price paid for an apartment in Manhattan was nearing $1.7 million, and Eliot Spitzer had a good shot at becoming president. 
 ''For a while there, we had to tell people that if they wanted to buy a $1 million condo, they were looking at a one-bedroom,'' said Pamela Liebman, the president of the Corcoran Group.
Today, things look a bit different. 
 Now, $1 million will buy much more space -- even a three-bedroom apartment fine for raising a few children in the city. That price change can mean the difference between choosing to stay in the city and deciding to move to the suburbs. 
 Of course, you can still easily spend $3 million or $4 million on a three-bedroom in a doorman building on Park Avenue, and a ceiling of $1 million won't get you a Classic 6 on the Upper West Side. 
 But far more agreeably priced three-bedrooms are out there. And while they tend to be on the small side, the compromises they demand are not deal-breakers -- no mountain of stairs to climb, for instance. 
 There is, for example, a three-bedroom apartment for sale for $950,000 on the 15th floor of a doorman building at 444 East 75th Street and York Avenue. The apartment, 15DE -- a combination of two units, a studio and a two-bedroom -- is about 1,440 square feet, with lots of closet space, a small office and views of the East River. 
 The building does have drawbacks. Buses stop nearby, but it's a hike from the subway, and the maintenance is high, almost $3,000 a month. So the broker, Debra Hoffman-Brill, a vice president of the Corcoran Group, says she priced the apartment accordingly. 
 ''I have great affection for the building,'' said the seller, Bill Nolan, who served on the board for many years. ''It's just time for me to go.'' 
 Unfortunately for Mr. Nolan, this is an especially bad time to be selling a three-bedroom apartment. 
 According to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, the median price paid for a three-bedroom in Manhattan fell 42.0 percent, from $4.05 million the fourth quarter of 2008 to $2.35 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. In that same period, two-bedrooms fell 23.3 percent, one-bedrooms 7.6 percent, and studios 10.7 percent.
 But that big drop in the price of three-bedrooms does not mean that demand for them has dried up. It indicates that fewer large, pricey apartments -- the kinds of places that push average prices up -- have sold.
 The average size of the three-bedrooms that closed in the fourth quarter of 2008 in Manhattan was about 2,650 square feet. A year later, it was about 2,100 square feet. That's a 21 percent drop in size, which accounts for half the drop in price.
 ''These three-bedrooms are somewhere between the size of an average two- and an average three-bedroom,'' Mr. Miller said of the apartments selling today. ''There's more living space devoted to bedrooms than to a living room or a dining room.''
 Financing is one reason small three-bedroom apartments move faster than larger ones. Getting a mortgage is still difficult, especially when it comes to nonconforming, or ''jumbo'' mortgages, which in Manhattan is anything over $729,750. 
 ''People are looking to trade up from a one- or a two-bedroom and still qualify for a mortgage,'' Mr. Miller said. 
 Brokers are advising sellers to price their apartments below $1 million to make it easier for buyers to secure financing, and also so that buyers can avoid the 1 percent mansion tax that kicks in at that threshold. 
 At 112 West 72nd Street, Apartment 7BC, a three-bedroom, was originally priced at $1.1 million, which would have required the buyer to pay a mansion tax of about $11,000. But after six weeks, the sellers dropped the price to $995,000. 
 ''People get really caught up psychologically over this 1 percent tax,'' said Jessica Cohen, an executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, and the lead broker on the apartment. ''We wanted to open up the buyer pool to get a qualified buyer more quickly.'' 
 But Apartment 7BC is a combination of a small two-bedroom and a studio, so the living spaces are meager -- the apartment measures only about 1,000 square feet. It also needs to be renovated. Still, it is in a prewar building on the Upper West Side with excellent subway access. The common charge is $689 and the real estate taxes are $712. 
 If you don't mind living a bit farther from the subway, you might be able to get some of that space back. 
 A three-bedroom apartment at 568 Grand Street, on the Lower East Side, is on the market through Halstead Property for $899,000. On the seventh floor, it has about 1,600 square feet, two bathrooms and a balcony. 
 This apartment is one of about 1,700 units in the East River Housing Corporation co-op, a four-building complex built in the 1950s by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. 
 ''If you're willing to be a 10- to 15-minute walk from the train,'' said Jeremy Bolger, a vice president of Halstead Property, ''it's pretty much the best value you're going to get for your dollar -- in lower Manhattan, at least.'' 
 Or you can look uptown. At 370 West 118th Street in Harlem, a three-bedroom is listed at $770,000. In a prewar building, the condo has two bathrooms, a washer dryer and Morningside Park views. At about 1,100 square feet, it has a common charge of $591.73 a month, and a tax abatement until 2034.
 ''You're under $600 a month'' in common charges, said Goldine Eismann, an agent at Halstead Property, the exclusive agent on the property. ''Once people can come up with the financing, then they won't have all this extra burden besides their mortgage.''
 Three-bedroom apartments for less than $1 million may also be had in sought-after parts of Brooklyn --even some for less than $750,000. A small three-bedroom at 656 Baltic Street, on the edge of Park Slope, for example, is listed at $725,000. 
 The apartment was put up for sale in May, at $799,000. But sales in the building have been slow going, in part because 656 Baltic, 1980s construction, was empty, having been completely remodeled by a developer. Most banks won't lend to potential buyers in a building until a certain percentage of the project is sold -- sometimes as much as 70 percent.
 The building on Baltic has three apartments, and two are now in contract. The remaining unit, a three-bedroom with a balcony, is just under 1,100 square feet. 
 The broker, Teri Cavanaugh of the Corcoran Group, says banks have told her that financing should be available. ''Because it's a three-unit building, it was difficult for a while to get that first person to sign a contract,'' Ms. Cavanaugh said. ''It's just been a trying year.'' 
 ''And now,'' she added, ''we've finally got traction.''

HEADLINE: Heineken Nears a Deal With Femsa

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Heineken is close to buying the beer operations of Femsa, one of Mexico's biggest brewers, for $7.5 billion to $8 billion, people briefed on the matter said Sunday. The move would further consolidate the beer industry into a few global players. 
 The deal by the Netherlands-based Heineken could be announced as soon as Monday. It follows a monthslong sales process by Femsa, formally known as Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B., whose brands include Dos Equis and Tecate. Many analysts had expected SABMiller to prevail in the race for the Femsa unit, but it dropped out in recent weeks, these people said.
 Femsa's other holdings include a majority stake in Latin America's largest Coke bottler and in OXXO, a large convenience store chain in Latin America.
 Over the last decade, the beer industry has involved the rapid combining of various companies. The most notable deals included the 2002 sale of the Miller Brewing Company to South African Breweries for $3.6 billion and the 2008 acquisition of Anheuser-Busch by InBev for $52 billion. Heineken itself struck a major deal in 2008 by buying Scottish & Newcastle, Britain's largest brewer, in a joint deal with Carlsberg valued at $15 billion.
 A deal for Femsa would give Heineken a bigger foothold in Latin America, especially the highly profitable Mexican market. The two companies already share ties: Heineken distributes Dos Equis and other Femsa products in the United States.
 For Femsa, merging with Heineken could help bolster its competitive position, especially as it continues to battle its larger Mexican rival, Grupo Modelo.
 About a quarter of Femsa's 168 billion pesos ($12 billion) in revenue in 2008 came from its beer operations. The company posted about $1.6 billion in operating profit that year.
 A spokeswoman for Heineken declined to comment. A representative for Femsa could not be reached for comment. 
 News of Heineken's possible deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal online.

HEADLINE: China Becomes World's No. 1 Exporter, Passing Germany

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
China overtook Germany as the world's top exporter after China's December exports jumped 17.7 percent for their first increase in 14 months, data showed Sunday. 
 Exports for the last month of 2009 were $130.7 billion, data from the General Administration of Customs showed.
 That raised total 2009 exports to $1.2 trillion, ahead of the 816 billion euros ($1.17 trillion) for Germany forecast by its foreign trade organization, BGA.
 China's new status is largely symbolic, but it reflects the ability of its resilient, low-cost manufacturers to keep selling abroad despite a slump in global consumer demand as a result of the financial crisis.
 December's rebound was an ''important turning point'' for exporters, a customs agency economist, Huang Guohua, said on the government television network CCTV.
 ''We can say that China's export enterprises have completely emerged from their all-time low in exports.''
 Stronger foreign sales of Chinese goods could help to drive the country's recovery after demand plunged in 2008, forcing thousands of factories to close and throwing millions of laborers out of work.
 Helped by a 4 trillion renminbi ($586 billion) stimulus package, China's economic expansion accelerated to 8.9 percent for the third quarter of 2009. 
 The government says full-year growth should be 8.3 percent.
 Economists and Germany's national chamber of commerce said earlier that the country was likely to lose its longtime crown as top exporter.
 China is best known as a supplier of shoes, toys, furniture and other low-tech goods, while Germany exports machinery and other higher-value products.
 China surpassed the United States as the biggest auto market in 2009 and is on track to replace Japan as the world's second-largest economy soon.
 China passed Germany as the third-largest economy in 2007.
 Even though China overtook Germany as top exporter, the customs agency said total 2009 Chinese trade fell 13.9 percent from 2008.

Slumbering in a drab-looking office building here, Blue Sky Studios, the animated-movie division of 20th Century Fox, has long been dismissed as much of a threat. Nobody could catch DreamWorks and Pixar, moviedom figured, especially not a quiet studio that got its start with an animated laxative commercial.
 So much for that theory.
 Blue Sky's most recent release, ''Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,'' was easily the No. 1 animated film of 2009 at the global box office, selling $888 million in tickets and dwarfing the totals for ''Up'' from Pixar and ''Monsters vs. Aliens'' from DreamWorks. Moreover, Blue Sky did it with about half the budget. Pixar and DreamWorks each lavished an estimated $175 million on their entries; Blue Sky spent about $90 million. 
 Adjusted for inflation, ''Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs'' ranks as the third biggest computer-animated movie of all time, behind ''Shrek 2'' (DreamWorks), which sold $1.1 billion worldwide, and ''Finding Nemo'' (Pixar), which hit $1 billion.
 ''Nobody has ever come close to challenging Pixar and DreamWorks at that highest threshold before,'' said Jerry Beck, an animation historian and co-operator of the news blog CartoonBrew.com.
 The two animation superpowers would probably scoff at the notion that Blue Sky no longer sits at the children's table. DreamWorks will deliver three features this year. Pixar has delivered 10 hits in a row, racking up four Academy Awards for best animated feature along the way.
 In contrast, Blue Sky will not deliver a film at all in 2010, has an up-and-down track record -- the ''Ice Age'' trilogy is huge, but ''Robots'' was soft -- and has never won the animated feature Oscar. ''Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs'' was also easier to sell as the third installment of a popular franchise and was also more of an international phenomenon than a domestic one; both ''Up'' and ''Monsters vs. Aliens'' outperformed it in North America.
 ''Over the years, it didn't seem like Fox even took them seriously,'' Mr. Beck said. (In early 2002, Fox contemplated selling the studio.) ''And even though Blue Sky has found hits, there are still quality questions.''
 Blue Sky's corporate bosses are crowing nonetheless.
 ''The quality of the work is up there with anything that is done from any company in the business,'' said Tom Rothman, a chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment. Added Vanessa Morrison, president of Fox Animation Studios, which includes Blue Sky: ''Being away from Hollywood really helps to incubate talent. Our films really take people to a place they've never been before.''
 Blue Sky now has an incredible amount of pressure to keep the hits coming. A fourth ''Ice Age'' is in the works -- the studio is working to nail down agreements with the voice cast -- and Chris Wedge, a Blue Sky co-founder and the director of the first ''Ice Age,'' is working to develop ''The Leaf Men,'' based on the book by William Joyce.
 Next up, however, is an original 3-D feature called ''Rio,'' planned for release in April 2011. Set in Rio de Janeiro, the movie is billed as a comedy-adventure that centers on Blu, a rare macaw who thinks he is the last of his kind. When he discovers there is another -- and that it's a she -- he leaves his small Minnesota town for Rio. Mayhem ensues.
 The cast includes Anne Hathaway, Tracy Morgan, George Lopez and Jesse Eisenberg, of ''Zombieland'' fame. Carlos Saldanha, the Brazilian-born director of ''Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,'' among other Blue Sky films, will also direct ''Rio.''
 ''We're working really hard to raise the bar here -- the realism of the harbor, how the slums look, the way the feathers on our bird characters move,'' said Brian Keane, Blue Sky's chief operating officer.
 Computer-animated movies have become anything but child's play to Hollywood. Aside from their box-office potential, these pictures can deliver enormous merchandising profits and -- so far at least -- are holding up better in the DVD aisle than their live-action counterparts. Partly that is because of their power as electronic baby sitters.
 But the animation gold rush is increasing in intensity as cinematic technology evolves. When Pixar and DreamWorks pioneered the art of concocting entire three-dimensional worlds out of nothing but computer code, at least at the multiplex, the technology was more than others could easily copy.
 Not anymore. Upstart studios like Imagi Animation Studios (''Astro Boy'') are now able to take advantage of breakthroughs bankrolled by the animation giants. The likes of Warner Brothers, Sony and Universal Pictures are also racing to mine the genre, spending hundreds of millions on movies like ''Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs'' and a sequel to ''Happy Feet.''
 ''Avatar,'' which relies on newly developed motion-capture equipment and has sold over $1 billion at the global box office, is to a large extent an animated film.
 Blue Sky got its start in 1987, opening above a dentist's office in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. Dulcolax was its first customer, but the studio soon made a name for itself in animation circles for taking on quirky, dark projects. ''Bunny,'' about a tattered rabbit, won the 1998 Oscar for an animated short. Other work included ''Joe's Apartment,'' the MTV Films comedy featuring thousands of singing cockroaches, and the talking fish episode from the ''The Sopranos.''
 At Blue Sky headquarters in Greenwich, about 400 employees toil on the big commercial films required by Fox, which bought the studio in 1997. The work can be draining -- each animator delivers only about four or five seconds of footage each week -- but there are all of the creature comforts associated with creative enterprises: video games, a big gym, free cereal. Mr. Keane is hiring 40 more employees.
 Lately, it has been all ''Rio'' all the time. Animators working on the film recently took a trip to the Bronx Zoo to sketch birds, and others have learned to samba in the name of their craft. On a recent afternoon, workers headed to Blue Sky's auditorium -- some via scooter -- for a demonstration of the Brazilian martial art capoeira. About 100 artists sketched and asked questions about incorporating the moves into ''Rio.''
 ''We might not be very Hollywood out here, but we still know how to have fun,'' Mr. Keane said.

HEADLINE: A Meager Existence on Food Stamps

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Living on Nothing but Food Stamps'' (''The Safety Net'' series, front page, Jan. 3):
 Economic hard times have thrown more men, white people and two-parent households into poverty. Before this, most people saw government benefits as the sole province of poor and demonized women on welfare, lazy welfare queens who had kids for money and cheated the government. But the pejorative comments have more or less died down. 
 Instead, service agencies and local officials welcome the newcomers while family and friends thank (once-maligned) government programs for saving the day. 
 As the nation discovers that people fall into poverty because of economic forces beyond their control, there seems to be more sympathy and understanding to go around. Let's hope this generosity of spirit outlasts the current downturn and spreads from the new poor to all the poor -- especially since middle-class families and major corporations also take government benefits that cost taxpayers plenty but don't think of themselves as on the dole.
 Mimi Abramovitz New York, Jan. 6, 2010
 The writer, a professor of social policy at Hunter College School of Social Work and the Graduate Center, City University of New York, is the author of ''Regulating the Lives of Women: Social Welfare Policy From Colonial Times to the Present.''
 To the Editor:
 Your article highlights the stark contrast between the effectiveness of food stamps and the weakness of other safety-net programs. 
 You report that in Florida last June, 192,000 families with children received food stamps and had no other income. According to state data, in that same month, only 56,000 families received cash assistance from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. This means that for every family that received cash assistance, more than three families who were eligible for help did not. 
 Across the country, TANF programs are simply not responding adequately to the recession. The TANF block grant is due for reauthorization this year, and Congress must take timely action to extend the program with a renewed focus on poverty alleviation and preventing material hardship among children and families, especially those who are particularly vulnerable because of circumstances like disability, domestic violence or homelessness.
 Congress should also extend the additional TANF financing provided under the recovery law, which will otherwise expire in September, so that state budget cuts do not cause even further hardship among these very poor families.

 The writer is a senior policy analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy.
 To the Editor:
 You report that the main welfare program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, ''has scarcely expanded during the recession.'' But you did not mention certain details about some of the potential reasons for that lack of expansion. 
 As a state employee (now retired), I was an administrative hearing officer during Illinois's implementation of TANF in 1997. As a replacement for the prior federal welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, TANF imposed stricter requirements and longer waiting periods on applicants before qualifying for cash assistance. 
 While many middle-class people would applaud the idea of mandating that applicants/recipients attend several appointments during the process to determine or redetermine their eligibility, many destitute people simply do not have the carfare, gas money or reliable child care to comply.
 Such people may have their applications denied or cases canceled as a result of missing such appointments if they are unable to prove ''good cause.'' Others might not comply because of untreated depression. 
 Moreover, with some exceptions, TANF recipients face a five-year lifetime limit on cash benefits. Knowing this may lead some people who may already have received benefits during a prior period before the current recession hit to try to get by on no income for as long as possible so as not to exhaust the remaining time left during which they might qualify for benefits.
 Amy Laiken Chicago, Jan. 3, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Public assistance like food stamps and welfare does not create dependency. It cripples people because it is inadequate, inaccessible and degrading. It forces people to wait too long for help and then gives them far less than they need to survive. 
 By the time they have received aid for even one year, they have borrowed from family, friends and high-interest, under-the-table lenders; sold off every asset they own, including most clothing; endured the frequent loss of phone, utilities, housing and transportation; and lost their self-esteem.
 Why is a person worthy of help until the day he or she exhausts unemployment benefits, but the day after, when public assistance becomes necessary, folks like Representative John Linder of Georgia, quoted in your article, seem to view them as too lazy to work?

HEADLINE: Aflac Is Leaving Its Agency, and Taking the Duck

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE familiar duck is front and center as Aflac expands efforts that began last year to tell consumers more about how its insurance products work. But the relationship between Aflac and the agency that created the character in 1999 is ending.
 In recent days, a cartoon version of the duck turned up on billboards in high-traffic sites like Times Square, bearing a mysterious Web address, youdontknowquack.com. On Monday, a multimedia campaign will direct consumers to a second Web address to reveal what the message means. 
 In a commercial, an announcer declares, ''If all you know about us is'' -- and at that point the duck interrupts, shouting, ''Aflac!'' -- ''then you don't know quack,'' the announcer continues.
 ''To find out all the ways Aflac's got you covered,'' the announcer concludes, ''visit knowquack.com.''
 The agency behind the campaign is the Tallahassee, Fla., office of Zimmerman Advertising, part of the Omnicom Group. The Kaplan Thaler Group in New York, a Publicis Groupe agency that has created ads for Aflac since October 1999, played only a supporting role.
 It turned out that as the campaign was being readied, executives at Aflac were considering placing their creative account in review. News of the review was reported on Dec. 22 by AdWeek.com, which followed with a report that Kaplan Thaler had decided against taking part.
 ''It's been 10 years, and a lot has changed in 10 years,'' said Jeff Charney, senior vice president and chief marketing officer of Aflac -- formally, the American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus, based in Columbus, Ga. He is among those changes, having joined Aflac in November 2008.
 Aflac has hired a search consultant, Select Resources International, to oversee the review, Mr. Charney said. It could be completed by early March. Aflac spends about $75 million each year on advertising.
 Kaplan Thaler, in a statement, attributed its decision to a policy against participating in reviews for accounts it already handles. Frequently, such reviews end with the account leaving the incumbent agency.
 The odds against Kaplan Thaler's retaining the Aflac assignment were also long because after years of humorous ads using the outspoken duck to generate high levels of awareness for the Aflac brand -- along with double-digit sales gains for Aflac products -- the economic crisis hit the company hard. After all, insurance is for workers, not the unemployed. 
 ''We are pleased to know that the Aflac duck will continue to be the cornerstone of the advertising going forward,'' the Kaplan Thaler statement said. ''We wish Aflac, and our fine-feathered friend, continued success and the very best.''
 Mr. Charney echoed the Kaplan Thaler sentiments.
 ''We love the duck,'' he said, and ''we love what Kaplan Thaler has done for us.''
 However, in ''looking at the next 10 years for the duck,'' he added, ''we're looking for the best partner to be fresh and creative and innovative.''
 Mr. Charney praised a campaign created in April by Kaplan Thaler that began the efforts to better explain Aflac's supplemental insurance coverage, which pays cash benefits to people unable to work because of sickness or injury. Aspects of that campaign will be part of the new campaign, he said, among them the word ''Aflacts'' to describe information about the policies and a theme, ''We've got you under our wing.''
 ''Consumers really loved it,'' Mr. Charney said, referring to the Kaplan Thaler work, ''and our salespeople loved it.''
 ''We wanted to take it further, take it to the next level,'' he added, saying the ''You don't know quack'' campaign, created by Zimmerman, does that because ''it cracks through the clutter and gets you to understand the facts about Aflac.''
 ''We wanted to make sure we have the agency that could portray the duck in the most relevant way,'' Mr. Charney said, and produce campaigns that would integrate traditional media like television and print with nontraditional approaches like social media, events, sponsorships, promotions and merchandise.
 The new campaign is such an initiative, he added, because it is composed of 45 elements that include presences on Facebook and YouTube; trivia questions on TV; a line of duck clothing; a Quack energy drink; video clips called ''duckumentaries,'' featuring customers talking about experiences with Aflac; commercials during the NBC coverage of the Winter Olympics; and a Nascar car bearing the cartoon duck and the ''You don't know quack'' theme.
 As Kaplan Thaler winds up work for Aflac, the agency is starting on an assignment as the lead agency for NAPA Auto Parts, which it landed four days before the Aflac news became known. The agency also recently became the creative agency for the Wendy's fast-food chain, owned by the Wendy's/Arby's Group.
 Kaplan Thaler is also a finalist in a review for the creative account of the retailer Ikea. That review includes the incumbent agency, which is Deutsch in New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.

 CORRECTION:

HEADLINE: New Chief To Be Named For Los Angeles Museum

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL; Compiled by RACHEL LEE HARRIS

 BODY:
There is almost no such thing as a secret in the art world, so when the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles announces its new director at a news conference on Monday morning, the name everyone is expecting to hear is that of Jeffrey Deitch. Neither Mr. Deitch, right, nor officials at the museum returned calls asking for comment, but several experts with knowledge of the search said that Eli Broad, the arts patron who pledged $30 million to save the museum when it was on the brink of financial collapse in 2008, reached out to many unconventional art-world personalities, including Tobias Meyer, head of Sotheby's contemporary art department worldwide and Sotheby's principal auctioneer, as well as Samuel Keller, the art fair impresario who ran Art Basel and Art Basel Miami Beach until he became director of the Beyeler Foundation in Riehen, Switzerland, in 2006. While the Harvard-educated Mr. Deitch has vast experience working with artists, selling artworks and presenting shows, he has never had a job that involved fund-raising, which is a crucial part of a museum director's portfolio. He has, however, worn many hats. In 1979 he helped start an art advisory service for wealthy clients at Citibank. 
He has also been a private art dealer, and in 1996 founded Deitch Projects, which now has two spaces in New York; in 1997 Sotheby's bought 50 percent of Deitch Projects, a relationship that has since dissolved. Besides running his galleries Mr. Deitch worked at Sotheby's managing its 20th-century Art Gallery Program for a few years. Among the artists he has represented are Jeff Koons; the Japanese photographer and performing artist Mariko Mori; Dash Snow; and the British team Tim Noble and Sue Webster.

HEADLINE: Teaching Green, Beyond Recycling

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO and SINDYA N. BHANOO

 BODY:
Jose Chirino, a 10th grader in Brooklyn with shoulder-length hair and a thin mustache, says flatly that his high school was his last choice. 
 ''They're experimenting on us,'' he said, recalling his first impression of the Green School in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which laces an environmental theme into most of its coursework. 
 Jennifer Auceda, 17, was similarly wary, given that she wanted to be a singer and never saw herself as a ''science person.'' 
 ''I thought it was going to be about the inside of trees,'' she said. 
 But the two reluctant recruits, who had both failed to get into the high schools they favored, said they were won over after realizing that the school casts a wide net. 
 Rather than simply covering predictable topics like recycling and tree planting, they say, it has alerted them to problems like sooty air and negative media representations of their neighborhoods. 
 ''Green is not just the environment,'' Jennifer said. ''It's politics, government, social justice.''
 ''We do a lot of things other schools are not doing,'' said Jose, 15. ''I feel like we're doing something important.''
 While plenty of city schools, from elementary to secondary, teach students about environmental issues like endangered species or global warming, places like the Green School put an overwhelming emphasis on civic involvement. 
 The students are encouraged to delve into local issues that may affect them and their families, like contamination in waterways like the Gowanus Canal, water quality or the razing of low-scale housing.
 ''You can't have a kid in a violent neighborhood and say, 'Let's talk about the polar bear,' '' said Karali Pitzele, one of the school's two co-directors.
 Across the nation, the range of green schools form a fledgling network, with some of them benefiting from state grants and mandates to incorporate environmental education into the curriculum. 
 They have found eager partners in groups like the Sierra Club and the National Wildlife Federation, which provide lesson plans or money for field trips, and in private and government agencies that are making concerted environmental efforts in communities and cities. 
 Alison Suffet Diaz, founder of the Environmental Charter High School in Los Angeles, says the focus on environment hits particularly close to home in poor communities that she says are disproportionately affected by problems like contamination from industrial sites.
 If grass-roots change is needed to address those issues, she said, ''it can't just be a rich person's desire to be green.''
 Still, Randall E. Solomon, executive director of the New Jersey Sustainable State Institute at Rutgers University, which guides New Jersey towns on environmental efforts, said that green schools were not just a niche phenomenon for the poor or for the wealthy. ''It's also mainstream public schools that are taking this on,'' he said.
 It is hard to pin down how many private, and charter and traditional public schools nationwide have adopted an environmental theme. Many are new; some have a low profile. They do not share uniform standards that define them as green. 
 The Green Charter Schools Network, based in Madison, Wis., says it has counted about 200 green charter schools nationwide.
 In New York, the green school phenomenon feeds into an effort to break up the city's enormous high schools into smaller learning settings, a centerpiece of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's overhaul of the school system. 
 At least 11 traditional and charter green schools at varying grade levels have opened in the last six years, officials at the city's Department of Education say, while cautioning that they were counting only those that identified themselves by name as ''green'' or ''environmental.''
 Many of the schools have yet to graduate their first class, and their progress reports show grades from A to D, school officials said. 
 The Growing Up Green Charter School, an elementary school in Long Island City, Queens, opened in September with one kindergarten and one first grade class. It plans to expand gradually through grade five. 
 On a recent afternoon, in a classroom that is also home to an army of compost bin worms and a bearded dragon named Daphne, two dozen first-grade students thrust their hands into bags of potting soil while taking turns planting squash seeds, beans and corn kernels in plastic containers. 
 The task at hand was to answer the question of the day, posed by a sign in the back of the classroom: ''How do we get our food?''
 But the real point, said the children's teacher, Michelle Robles, was to help them understand how the local environment affects food choices, and the need to tend to the soil, air, water and plants.
 ''If you take care of plants, they can grow and grow so we can cook them,'' Alayla Mack, 6, said after the lesson.
 Some green schools in New York chiefly emphasize the environmental sciences or teach skills that will prepare students for careers in renewable energy or other pillars of a greener economy. 
 The Urban Assembly School for Green Careers, a high school on Manhattan's Upper West Side, opened this year with a ninth-grade class and a focus on job skills needed for the design and operation of energy-efficient buildings. 
 Gregg Betheil, who heads the Office of Postsecondary Pathways and Planning in the city's Department of Education, said the school sprang out of specific efforts to match secondary education to labor trends and to the city's own goal of attracting more green industry. 
 Students learn hands-on skills like installing insulation and solar panels in preparation for entering the work force after graduation or pursuing college degrees in fields like engineering. 
 ''We've got some schools investing in the skills kids need to compete,'' Mr. Betheil said. ''No way is this a fad.''
 At the more civic-oriented Green School in Brooklyn, teachers send the students out into their neighborhoods to record public service announcements and videos about smoking and air pollution. They also walk the streets to map trees and trash cans, then incorporate their findings into mural sketches for geometry class. 
 In a recent class, students watched trailers for the films ''2012,'' about humans struggling to survive a global apocalypse, and ''Precious,'' about an abused teenager who finds a form of salvation in learning to read and write. The goal was to analyze the media messages telegraphed by the trailers before starting on their own videos.
 At elementary schools, teachers in the lower grades emphasize hands-on projects like building habitats for specific environments, like teepees, or mapping the path of trash from their classroom bin to a landfill. 
 ''It helps them learn early how their choices make an impact,'' said Barbara Weber, 43, whose 6-year-old son, Lawless Morse, is in first grade at Growing Up Green in Long Island City. 
 Ms. Weber, a textile designer from Jackson Heights, Queens, said she had already noticed some changes in Lawless. After a week of studying habitats, she said, he asked why many homes in their neighborhood were made of brick. He also peppers her with questions about how and where various animals live. 
 Lawless, wearing neatly pressed khakis and a polo shirt with an embroidered ''Growing Up Green'' logo on a recent morning, said he really liked school. 
 But as it turns out, a movie -- ''Wall-E,'' about a garbage-collecting robot on an Earth bereft of inhabitants -- seems to have made an even bigger impression on him. 
 ''All the people were gone because they littered so much,'' he said. ''That's why we reduce, reuse and recycle.''

HEADLINE: NBC Expects Winter Olympics To Lose Money for the Network

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
NBC expects to lose money on its broadcast of the Vancouver Olympics, the first loss on an Olympics broadcast package in the network's history, an NBC executive said Sunday. 
 Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Universal Sports and the executive producer of the network's Olympics broadcasts, told reporters at a meeting of the Television Critics Association in Pasadena, Calif., that sales of advertising for the Olympics schedule had picked up recently after lagging far below forecasts through the summer and fall. He attributed the drop to the economic slump.
 But advertising revenue would not be enough to overcome the sharp increases in license fees that NBC had agreed to pay to broadcast the Olympics, he said.
 ''Sales, which were slow in the spring and early summer due to the economy, have taken off, and we are well on our way'' to match the advertising revenue the network gathered for the Olympic Games in Torino, Italy, and Salt Lake City, Mr. Ebersol said.
 ''We will, for the first time in all our years I've been with the Games, lose money on the Olympics,'' he said. ''But it won't be because the sales didn't come around.''
 NBC paid more than $2 billion for the domestic rights to broadcast the summer and winter Olympics in 2010 and 2012. That amount was over a third more than it paid for the previous round of Olympics broadcasting rights.

HEADLINE: Not All Said and Done: Behind-the-Scenes Bickering in the '08 Campaign

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
GAME CHANGE 
 Obama and the Clintons, McCain and Palin, and the Race of a Lifetime 
 By John Heilemann and Mark Halperin 
 448 pages. Harper. $27.99 
 Why another book on the 2008 campaign, a year after the inauguration of President Obama? What more is there to say about a race that was covered day in and day out by newspapers, magazines, television, radio and bloggers? Is there anything more to learn about the candidates -- and does it matter to an American public now focused on unemployment and health care and terrorism?
 The veteran political reporters John Heilemann and Mark Halperin think they do have something new to say. ''What was missing'' from the wall-to-wall coverage and what ''might be of enduring value,'' they write in their buzzy new book ''Game Change,'' was ''an intimate portrait of the candidates and spouses who (in our judgment) stood a reasonable chance of occupying the White House.'' 
 They proceed in these pages to serve up a spicy smorgasbord of observations, revelations and allegations -- some that are based on impressive legwork and access, some that simply crystallize rumors and whispers from the campaign trail, and some that it's hard to verify independently as more than spin or speculation on the part of unnamed sources. The authors mix savvy political analysis in these pages with detailed reconstructions of scenes and conversations they did not witness firsthand (like an exchange that Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bill Clinton had on a beach in Anguilla). They employ the same sort of technique Bob Woodward has pioneered in his best-selling books: relying heavily on ''deep background'' interviews, along with e-mail messages, memorandums and other forms of documentation to create a novelistic narrative that often reflects the views of the authors' most cooperative or voluble sources. Unlike Mr. Woodward's last two books this volume has no source notes at the end. 
 The authors write that one of Mrs. Clinton's ''senior-most lieutenants'' watched her ''bitter and befuddled reaction'' to her loss in Iowa, and thought for the first time, ''This woman shouldn't be president.'' They write that during debate preps, some staff members assigned to Sarah Palin by the McCain campaign discussed the ''threatening possibility: that Palin was mentally unstable.'' They add that several of Senator John McCain's lieutenants agreed that if it looked as if their candidate might actually win in November, they would have to discuss how to relegate Ms. Palin ''to the largely ceremonial role that premodern vice presidents inhabited'': ''it was inconceivable'' that ''if McCain fell ill or died, the country be left in the hands of a President Palin.'' 
 In addition Mr. Heilemann, who works for New York magazine, and Mr. Halperin, for Time magazine, write that Mrs. Clinton, encouraged by her husband and aides, considered running for president in 2004 but ended up listening to her daughter, Chelsea, who argued that she needed to finish her Senate term. They write that Mr. Clinton and George W. Bush ''spoke more often than almost anyone knew'' -- that ''from time to time, when 43 was bored, he would call 42 to chew the fat.'' And they assert that Mrs. Clinton blew an opportunity to win the endorsement of Caroline Kennedy, who, they say, had been ''dreading a call from Hillary'' asking her to go to Iowa on her behalf, knowing, the authors write, that ''once she had campaigned for Clinton, siding with Obama would be off the table.'' Instead of making the call herself, Mrs. Clinton had one of her staffers phone Ms. Kennedy, who ducked the call.
 In another passage, which was widely reported over the weekend, Mr. Halperin and Mr. Heilemann write that the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, encouraged Mr. Obama to run early on, arguing that ''the country was ready to embrace a black presidential candidate, especially one such as Obama -- a 'light-skinned' African American 'with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one.' '' Over the weekend Mr. Reid called the president to apologize for his choice of words. Other senators, including Charles E. Schumer, Byron L. Dorgan, Ben Nelson, Bill Nelson, Barbara Boxer and Edward M. Kennedy, the authors add, were also nudging Mr. Obama, then a senator, to take the plunge, though most would ''root for Obama secretly,'' as they feared retribution from the Clintons should Mrs. Clinton eventually prevail. 
 Mrs. Clinton, long the front-runner in the race, was so confident of winning, Mr. Heilemann and Mr. Halperin write, that she went so far as to start thinking about her choice of a running mate in fall 2007: she ''had already determined without a sliver of doubt that she was not going to choose Obama,'' they say, and told her aides that Evan Bayh, Joseph R. Biden Jr., Tom Vilsack and Ted Strickland were at the top of her short list. Around the same time, they write, Mrs. Clinton asked her friend Roger Altman, deputy Treasury secretary in her husband's administration, to lead a secret project -- planning her transition to the White House based on the assumption that a year later she would win the general election. 
 Mr. Heilemann wrote incisively about Mrs. Clinton in the pages of New York magazine -- chunks of his reportage and analysis, taken directly from his articles, appear in this book -- and there is more revealing material about her and Mr. Clinton in this volume than the other candidates and their wives. The authors not only dissect the dysfunctional, conflict-ridden Clinton campaign -- something that has already been done in detail by many other reporters -- but they also emphasize that communication difficulties between the Clintons exacerbated that campaign's problems. 
 They write that Mrs. Clinton ''couldn't bear to confront her husband directly'' after his heated words about Mr. Obama caused an uproar in South Carolina, and asked aides ''to implore him either to leave the state or to pipe down.'' They write that Patti Solis Doyle, Cheryl Mills and Howard Wolfson ''formed a war room within a war room inside Hillaryland, dedicated to managing the threat posed by Bill's libido.'' And they quote one ''old Clinton hand'' who suggests that Mrs. Clinton stayed in the primary race to the bitter end, because Mr. Clinton's approval mattered a lot to her, and ''throwing in the towel would mark her as a failure in his eyes.'' 
 In a fascinating account about Mrs. Clinton's initial decision to decline the post of secretary of state, Mr. Halperin and Mr. Heilemann paraphrase a conversation between the two former rivals in which, they contend, Mrs. Clinton brought up the Bill issue: ''You know my husband, she said. You've seen what happens. We're going to be explaining something that he said every other day. You know I can't control him, and at some point he'll be a problem.''
 The authors describe the Obamas' marriage as a model one (''Obama adored his wife'' and ''didn't even bother to pretend that he enjoyed anyone else's company remotely as much as he relished being with her and their daughters''), but their portraits of the other candidates' contentious spousal relationships actually make the Clintons' partnership seem like a happy one in comparison.
 Mr. Halperin and Mr. Heilemann write, for instance, that the strategist John Weaver suspected the rumor CindyMcCain had a ''long-term boyfriend'' in Arizona ''was rooted in truth,'' and that the McCains ''fought in front of others, during small meetings and before large events, to the amazement and discomfort of the staff.'' The authors say that Mrs. McCain accused the senator of ruining her life, that she never wanted him to run again for president, and that ''when it came time to film campaign videos of the couple, the camera crews had to roll for hours to capture a few minutes of warmth.'' 
 As for John and Elizabeth Edwards, the authors are even harsher. They describe in detail Mr. Edwards's infatuation with the video maker Rielle Hunter -- whose behavior they call ''freaky, wildly inappropriate, and all too visible,'' and they write that he continued to nurse delusional hopes of being named attorney general in an Obama administration even after the National Enquirer ran a photograph of him holding Ms. Hunter's new baby. In the wake of the first Enquirer story about Mr. Edwards's affair, the authors write, Mrs. Edwards ''was sobbing, out of control, incoherent,'' and vented her fury on the ''very aides who had kept the matter from mushrooming'' further. 
 Edwards aides, Mr. Heilemann and Mr. Halperin write, felt that their boss had become increasingly megalomaniacal and narcissistic over the years, and that while the aides had sympathy for Mrs. Edwards's struggle with cancer, they regarded her as a badgering, often irrational presence on the campaign. ''The nearly universal assessment among them,'' Mr. Halperin and Mr. Heilemann write of the Edwards aides, ''was that there was no one on the national stage for whom the disparity between public image and private reality was vaster or more disturbing. What the world saw in Elizabeth: a valiant, determined, heroic everywoman. What the Edwards insiders saw: an abusive, intrusive, paranoid, condescending crazywoman.'' 
 Though this book focuses on personal matters, not policy concerns, and though some of what will be its most talked about passages fall into the realm of gossip and reflect the views of chatty and, in some cases, bitter, regretful or spin-conscious aides, the volume does leave the reader with a vivid, visceral sense of the campaign and a keen understanding of the paradoxes and contingencies of history. The authors note, for instance, that had Mrs. Clinton decided to run for president in 2004, John Kerry might not have become the Democratic nominee that year and would not have had the opportunity to choose as the convention's keynote speaker a young and then largely unknown Illinois state legislator by the name of Barack Obama.

HEADLINE: Fight to Reverse California's Same-Sex Marriage Ban Heads to Courtroom

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
The last time David Boies and Theodore B. Olson battled in a courtroom, the presidency hung in the balance as they represented opposite sides arguing the fate of the 2000 election. 
 So Mr. Boies, who worked for Al Gore in the 2000 case, says he has some perspective on their latest fight. It finds him and Mr. Olson, one of the nation's most prominent conservative litigators, working together in an attempt to overturn Proposition 8, the 2008 California ballot measure that outlawed same-sex marriage. 
 ''About nine years ago, people accused me of losing the whole country,'' said Mr. Boies, a Democrat. ''But this time, Ted and I are together.'' 
 Opening statements were expected Monday in Federal District Court in San Francisco, in a case that is being anxiously watched by gay rights groups and supporters of traditional marriage nationwide. 
 ''It's not just a trial of gay marriage,'' said Maggie Gallagher, the president of the National Organization for Marriage, a backer of Proposition 8 and other measures to forbid same-sex marriage nationwide. ''It's a trial of the majority of the American people.''
 The case comes at a time when gay groups have suffered several setbacks, including the defeat of same-sex marriage legislation in New York and New Jersey and a vote last fall that overturned such unions in Maine. Efforts to overturn Proposition 8 with another ballot measure in California also face uncertain prospects, with most major groups having decided to wait until at least 2012 to go back to the voters. 
 All of which has heightened expectations for the Boies and Olson case, filed in the spring after the California Supreme Court upheld Proposition 8, which passed with 52 percent of the vote after a bruising and costly campaign. 
 Groups advocating equal rights for gay people were planning to rally in front of the courthouse here on Monday morning, and officials were expecting large crowds in the courtroom and in a separate viewing room. Live video and audio were to be piped into federal courthouses in California, New York, Oregon and Washington. 
 In addition, under a decision last week by Judge Vaughn R. Walker, the district court's chief judge, who is hearing the case, the trial was to be videotaped and distributed online. Supporters of Proposition 8 have objected to that, and they appealed to the United States Supreme Court on Saturday to keep cameras out of the courtroom.
 ''The record is already replete with evidence showing that any publicizing of support for Prop. 8 has inevitably led to harassment, economic reprisal, threats and even physical violence,'' Charles J. Cooper, the lead counsel for the defense, wrote in a brief to the court. ''In this atmosphere, witnesses are understandably quite distressed at the prospect of their testimony being broadcast worldwide.'' 
 Indeed, several of the figures who helped pass Proposition 8 are expected to be called to testify under oath, something that gay rights advocates hope will play in their favor. 
 ''It has the potential to be an extraordinarily powerful teaching moment because it's going to be televised,'' said Jennifer C. Pizer, senior counsel and national marriage project director with the gay civil rights group Lambda Legal in Los Angeles. ''This is usually just bandied about on attack TV shows. But this promises to be a serious examination of the arguments in a trial setting, with evidence and cross-examination.''
 During the trial, which is expected to last three weeks, Mr. Olson and Mr. Boies plan to argue that Proposition 8 violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection and due process. 
 ''The biggest challenge with any of the judges we'll face is simply to get them to focus on the law and the facts and not on the inertia of history,'' Mr. Boies said. ''I think the only real argument that the other side has is, 'This is the way its always been.' '' 
 But supporters of Proposition 8 say that California voters were well within their rights to establish marriage as between a man and a woman, as voters in more than two dozen other states have done. 
 ''There are very sound public policy reasons to define marriage as one man and woman, including the inevitable fact when you put men and women together, they produce children,'' said Jordan Lorence, senior counsel with the Alliance Defense Fund, a conservative Arizona-based group that will argue for Proposition 8. ''To put that under the microscope of a compelling state interest test is the wrong thing for the court to be doing.'' 
 Some gay rights groups were also initially skeptical of the case, fearing that Mr. Olson and Mr. Boies lacked expertise in the issue and that a loss in federal court could set back efforts for years to come. But most have since rallied behind it. 
 ''I think that having Olson and Boies lead this effort is phenomenal because it's not just gay rights activists pushing,'' said Geoff Kors, the executive director of Equality California, a gay rights group. ''It shows that this is not a partisan issue and not an ideological issue. It's a clear constitutional issue.''
 The case is being financed by a recently established nonprofit advocacy group, the American Foundation for Equal Rights. Chad Griffin, the president of the group's board, said he had been cheered by the surge of support for the case. ''We're all on the same page,'' he said ''We all have the same goals.''
 Mr. Griffin, a communications specialist who served in the Clinton administration, hired Mr. Boies and Mr. Olson, who are ideologically opposed but are friendly outside the courtroom. On Friday, both men were ensconced in a suite of legal offices in downtown San Francisco, prepping witnesses and getting ready for trial. 
 And while anticipation was running high, Mr. Boies said that much of the testimony would probably ''be a little boring,'' even if it were televised. 
 ''You don't get the drama in the presentation,'' he said, ''that exists in the importance of the issue.''

HEADLINE: Action, and Now Reaction

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
The founders built the House of Representatives to act. And throughout President Obama's first year, the House has acted.
 From economic stimulus to energy, from health care to financial regulation and jobs, House leaders marshaled the votes for Mr. Obama's priorities.
 But now, 10 months before midterm elections, the majority's political fate has mostly slipped beyond its control. Facing a deeply unsettled electorate, House Democrats instead rely on external factors for survival: Senate counterparts' ability to complete their shared agenda, Mr. Obama's ability to revive public confidence, the United States economy's ability to generate jobs. 
 Last week's Labor Department report, showing persistent 10 percent unemployment and the unexpected loss of 85,000 jobs in December, was not reassuring.
 ''This is a tough context in which we find ourselves,'' said Representative Steny H. Hoyer, the House majority leader. So tough that Mr. Hoyer defines victory in 2010 as including a steep erosion in Democratic strength.
 In an interview, Mr. Hoyer, a 15-term Democrat from Maryland, accepted that his 256-member caucus would shrink, and said he was aiming merely to prevent it from plummeting below the 218 needed to maintain control.
 Out on a Limb
 No one missed Speaker Nancy Pelosi's recent jab at Mr. Obama when she pointed out campaign stances that he has since set aside. More surprising is that there has been so little grousing.
 Mr. Obama asked for energy legislation establishing a controversial cap-and-trade system for limiting carbon emissions to curb climate change. The House passed it in June; the Senate has not acted.
 Mr. Obama sought a health care overhaul including a ''public option'' for insurance coverage. The House passed one in November; the Senate discarded that politically volatile provision.
 Mr. Obama requested new regulations for Wall Street to prevent a repeat of the financial system's near collapse in 2008. The House delivered in December; the Senate has not.
 Mr. Hoyer would not complain about the heavy White House agenda that has put vulnerable Democrats at risk, or the Senate's inability to keep pace. Mr. Obama had no choice but to confront the problems he campaigned on and inherited, the majority leader noted, and Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, needs his entire 60-seat majority on the toughest floor fights.
 That limits the House's ability to bargain for provisions backed by liberals, like the health care public option. The left faces more disappointment on the Afghanistan war, where Mr. Obama is on track to win majority support for the 30,000 additional troops he is seeking.
 ''The president, as commander in chief, has made a determination,'' Mr. Hoyer observed, and ''ultimately the House and the Senate are going to support the president.''
 That could further drain enthusiasm from party activists at a time when conservative ire over Mr. Obama's agenda fuels Republican campaigns. Instead of heat, Democratic candidates must count on the cool pragmatism of Mr. Obama's governance to rally their voters.
 ''Has he compromised?'' Mr. Hoyer asked. ''Of course he's compromised. Does either base want compromise? They don't.''
 No More Naps
 House leaders now join Mr. Obama in a difficult balancing act: backing new spending to create jobs while promoting the long-term goal of closing a mammoth budget deficit.
 ''What you have to do is convince the American public and members of Congress that in order to get to a fiscal balance, you've got to have a growing economy,'' Mr. Hoyer said. ''In order to have a growing economy, you've got to create jobs and invest in growing that economy.''
 The difficulty of making that case was evident in last month's vote on a $174 billion jobs bill. Democratic leaders muscled it through by a vote of 217-212, as many deficit-conscious moderates refused to go along.
 It was a radical shift in the political winds that propelled Democratic victories in 2006 and 2008. Mr. Obama's job approval rating hovers around 50 percent, with ratings for Congress at roughly half that level. Charlie Cook, the political handicapper, considers 39 Democratic seats in jeopardy, compared with just 11 Republican seats.
 Democratic strategists insist that their ability to control the Congressional agenda, their organizational and fund-raising prowess and Republican infighting can help avert the sort of landslide defeat they suffered under President Bill Clinton 16 years ago. In 1994 ''we were caught napping,'' Mr. Hoyer said. ''Nobody's caught napping now.''
 Working on heightened alert, Democrats are honing an economic argument that Republicans favored during the Bush administration: that the stock market has risen sharply since economic stimulus legislation passed. But polls suggest that the unemployment rate, which has also risen substantially, is more politically consequential.
 Unless the governing party can demonstrate a turnaround in the job market, House Democrats know they can do little about the political wave heading toward them but react.

HEADLINE: Higher Price Tag Enters Negotiations

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As White House and Congressional negotiators work toward an agreement on a final version of sweeping health care legislation, they seem likely to push the 10-year price tag closer to the $1.05 trillion cost of the House-passed bill while relying on new taxes proposed by the Senate, probably including a bigger increase in the Medicare payroll tax than currently proposed. 
 As small teams of Congressional staff members work furiously to hash out the final differences between the two versions, Congressional leaders and White House officials are trying to navigate an increasingly difficult set of competing demands while also fulfilling President Obama's top goals: that the legislation not add to the deficit, that it reduce long-term health spending and that it cost around $900 billion. 
 Virtually all of the demands put forward in the end-stage talks would require raising the cost of the Senate bill, projected by the Congressional Budget Office at $871 billion over 10 years. 
 The demands include insistence by the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and other House Democrats that the bill provide more generous subsidies to help lower-income people buy private health insurance -- an added cost of tens of billions of dollars. 
 In addition, Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, and lawmakers and governors from other states are pressing for the federal government to pay the full cost of a planned expansion of Medicaid, which would add $25 billion to $30 billion to the bill. In the Senate bill, the federal government would pay the total cost for only Nebraska, a change that helped win Mr. Nelson's vote but that even he has said was unfair. 
 On Monday, labor leaders will head to the White House to press Mr. Obama to make changes to a proposed excise tax on high-cost insurance policies because they fear that the tax will hit many generous union-sponsored health plans. The 40 percent excise tax would apply to any cost above $8,500 for individual policies and $23,000 for family plans. Raising those thresholds, as labor leaders want, could cost $50 billion. 
 On Sunday, on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' Christina D. Romer, the chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, indicated that the administration was willing to negotiate on the tax. 
 Many House Democrats are opposed to the excise tax, and Ms. Pelosi told her caucus during a conference call on Thursday that ''until everything is agreed to, nothing is agreed to.'' 
 But policymakers at the Capitol and the White House have little wiggle room. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Senate bill would reduce federal deficits through 2019 by $132 billion. Of that, $72 billion would come from premiums that would be paid into a new long-term care insurance program, and Senate leaders promised to set that money aside to help pay for future long-term care benefits. 
 Once that money and other funds already pegged to Social Security are removed from the equation, the Senate bill would reduce future deficits through 2019 by less than $10 billion. The only way to add to the Senate bill without increasing the deficit would be to raise taxes further or to find additional ways to cut costs. Negotiators are trying to do both. 
 The Senate bill now calls for raising the Medicare payroll tax for individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000, which would generate about $87 billion over 10 years. The House bill, in turn, would impose an income tax surcharge on individuals earning more than $500,000 and couples earning more than $1 million, which would generate $460 billion. 
 By ramping up the proposed increase in the Medicare payroll tax, and adding a handful of smaller revenue raisers, officials could generate another $100 billion or more to help meet the outstanding demands and overcome the final obstacles to an agreement, which they hope to get approved by each chamber in Congress and sent to Mr. Obama for his signature before he gives his State of the Union speech sometime early next month. 
 As staff talks continue, broad parameters of an agreement are coming into focus. Mr. Obama last week effectively resolved two big disputes by insisting that the final legislation include the proposed excise tax on high-cost insurance plans and the Senate proposal for an independent commission to recommend future cost savings in Medicare and throughout the health care industry. The House did not include either. 
 Ms. Pelosi and House Democrats are pressing for changes to the proposed subsidies that would increase premium assistance and reduce out-of-pocket costs for individuals and families earning less than 250 percent of the federal poverty level -- roughly $55,000 for a family of four. But subsidies as generous as those in the House bill seem out of reach. 
 House Democrats are pushing hard for a national insurance exchange, or marketplace, rather than the state exchanges proposed by the Senate.
 Aside from finalizing the subsidy levels, one of the biggest disagreements is where to set the new Medicaid eligibility thresholds. The Senate calls for opening Medicaid to all individuals and families earning up to 133 percent of the poverty level, while the House would grant benefits up to 150 percent of the poverty level. In most states, childless adults currently cannot enroll in Medicaid. 
 House Democratic leaders have generally accepted that they will have to drop their proposal of a government-run health insurance plan, or public option, because the Senate would not approve it. What remains to be worked out are potential concessions that House Democrats want in exchange for eliminating the public option. 
 The White House communications director, Dan Pfeiffer, warned against predicting any final outcome. 
 ''The president is working with the speaker and the majority leader to bridge the few remaining differences,'' he said in a statement. ''There have been and will continue to be many discussions on the staff level, but at this point these are just discussions. Those saying they know where the bill is going to end up are making less-than-educated guesses.''

HEADLINE: Debt Plan in Argentina Sets Bank Against the President

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO 

 BODY:
A disputed plan by President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina to use billions of dollars in foreign currency reserves to repay debt has inflamed political tensions in that country, Latin America's third-largest economy.
 Mrs. Kirchner's cash-poor government is seeking to use $6.5 billion of Argentina's nearly $48 billion in central bank reserves to help cover $13 billion in international debt that is due this year. She has not explained in detail how the central bank reserves would be replenished.
 But after her central bank president, Martin Redrado, refused to support the plan, Mrs. Kirchner fired him by decree on Thursday. One day later a federal judge, Maria Jose Sarmiento, blocked Mrs. Kirchner's plan to tap the reserves and ordered Mr. Redrado reinstated, saying that only Congress could remove him. 
 On Saturday the government appealed the two court rulings, Cabinet Chief Anibal Fernandez said on television.
 The standoff between the president and her central bank has shaken Argentina's financial markets, and opposition politicians have charged that the government is seeking to undermine the bank's autonomy. It has also highlighted what critics call Mrs. Kirchner's tendency to try to govern by decree, and her willingness to seize seemingly autonomous funds to try to maintain populist economic policies and increase her flagging popularity, political analysts said.
 The latest move suggests that the president is unwilling to adjust her governing style, even after her wing of the Peronist Party lost control of Congress in elections last June.
 ''This is the beginning of what will probably be a long and complicated battle between the government and Congress and, potentially, the Supreme Court,'' said Daniel Kerner, analyst with the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm in New York.
 Argentina's Congress is in recess until March, but opposition lawmakers, including Vice President Julio Cobos, called on lawmakers last week to return early for an emergency session of the lower house on Jan. 20. 
 Mr. Fernandez, the cabinet chief, said in a radio interview that Mr. Cobos was behind Mr. Redrado's decision to not resign after Mrs. Kirchner requested it. Mr. Cobos, who has said he would run for president in 2011, has been at odds with Mrs. Kirchner since voting against a plan to increase export taxes on soybeans.
 Mr. Redrado said Friday that he was convinced that he had fulfilled his mission ''to protect the savings of all Argentines'' by rejecting the government's call to dismiss him. He noted that the central bank had had 55 presidents in its 75-year history. ''That makes the Argentine system unstable,'' he said.
 Argentina's economic policies, including heavy subsidies of food and fuel, and outside criticism of its reporting of economic statistics have hampered its ability to lure foreign investment and contributed to heavy capital flight over the past two years.
 Still, financial markets responded positively in recent weeks to the government's announcements that it would restructure $20 billion in foreign debt from the 2001-2 default.
 The decision to use central bank reserves echoes Mrs. Kirchner's moves to retake control of the private airline Aerolineas Argentinas last year and to seize $30 billion in private pension funds.
 On Friday, she defended her move to tap central bank reserves, saying in a televised appearance that it would keep Argentina from paying ''fat profits'' to speculators. ''It is much better to use the reserves than to borrow at interest rates of 15 or 14 percent, when the reserves are barely earning 0.5 or 1 percent,'' she said. ''A person with just an elementary school education would understand this.''
 Judge Sarmiento refused to hear appeals over the weekend. She complained that a police vehicle had been posted outside her home as a means of apparent government pressure. ''This doesn't seem reasonable,'' she said in an interview with TeleNoticias, a TV channel. ''There is a patrol car at my house and I have never asked for a guard at any moment. I don't need one.''
 Mr. Kerner of the Eurasia Group said that if the government successfully appealed the court's suspension of its latest decree, it is possible it would be able to spend central bank reserves before Congress or the Supreme Court had a chance to declare the decree unconstitutional.

HEADLINE: Learning From Europe

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
As health care reform nears the finish line, there is much wailing and rending of garments among conservatives. And I'm not just talking about the tea partiers. Even calmer conservatives have been issuing dire warnings that Obamacare will turn America into a European-style social democracy. And everyone knows that Europe has lost all its economic dynamism. 
 Strange to say, however, what everyone knows isn't true. Europe has its economic troubles; who doesn't? But the story you hear all the time -- of a stagnant economy in which high taxes and generous social benefits have undermined incentives, stalling growth and innovation -- bears little resemblance to the surprisingly positive facts. The real lesson from Europe is actually the opposite of what conservatives claim: Europe is an economic success, and that success shows that social democracy works. 
 Actually, Europe's economic success should be obvious even without statistics. For those Americans who have visited Paris: did it look poor and backward? What about Frankfurt or London? You should always bear in mind that when the question is which to believe -- official economic statistics or your own lying eyes -- the eyes have it.
 In any case, the statistics confirm what the eyes see.
 It's true that the U.S. economy has grown faster than that of Europe for the past generation. Since 1980 -- when our politics took a sharp turn to the right, while Europe's didn't -- America's real G.D.P. has grown, on average, 3 percent per year. Meanwhile, the E.U. 15 -- the bloc of 15 countries that were members of the European Union before it was enlarged to include a number of former Communist nations -- has grown only 2.2 percent a year. America rules!
 Or maybe not. All this really says is that we've had faster population growth. Since 1980, per capita real G.D.P. -- which is what matters for living standards -- has risen at about the same rate in America and in the E.U. 15: 1.95 percent a year here; 1.83 percent there.
 What about technology? In the late 1990s you could argue that the revolution in information technology was passing Europe by. But Europe has since caught up in many ways. Broadband, in particular, is just about as widespread in Europe as it is in the United States, and it's much faster and cheaper.
 And what about jobs? Here America arguably does better: European unemployment rates are usually substantially higher than the rate here, and the employed fraction of the population lower. But if your vision is of millions of prime-working-age adults sitting idle, living on the dole, think again. In 2008, 80 percent of adults aged 25 to 54 in the E.U. 15 were employed (and 83 percent in France). That's about the same as in the United States. Europeans are less likely than we are to work when young or old, but is that entirely a bad thing?
 And Europeans are quite productive, too: they work fewer hours, but output per hour in France and Germany is close to U.S. levels.
 The point isn't that Europe is utopia. Like the United States, it's having trouble grappling with the current financial crisis. Like the United States, Europe's big nations face serious long-run fiscal issues -- and like some individual U.S. states, some European countries are teetering on the edge of fiscal crisis. (Sacramento is now the Athens of America -- in a bad way.) But taking the longer view, the European economy works; it grows; it's as dynamic, all in all, as our own.
 So why do we get such a different picture from many pundits? Because according to the prevailing economic dogma in this country -- and I'm talking here about many Democrats as well as essentially all Republicans -- European-style social democracy should be an utter disaster. And people tend to see what they want to see.
 After all, while reports of Europe's economic demise are greatly exaggerated, reports of its high taxes and generous benefits aren't. Taxes in major European nations range from 36 to 44 percent of G.D.P., compared with 28 in the United States. Universal health care is, well, universal. Social expenditure is vastly higher than it is here. 
 So if there were anything to the economic assumptions that dominate U.S. public discussion -- above all, the belief that even modestly higher taxes on the rich and benefits for the less well off would drastically undermine incentives to work, invest and innovate -- Europe would be the stagnant, decaying economy of legend. But it isn't.
 Europe is often held up as a cautionary tale, a demonstration that if you try to make the economy less brutal, to take better care of your fellow citizens when they're down on their luck, you end up killing economic progress. But what European experience actually demonstrates is the opposite: social justice and progress can go hand in hand.

HEADLINE: In Weather Anything but Tropical, Florida's Fish Crop Is Freezing

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: LAKELAND, Fla. 

 BODY:
Frosted oranges, strawberries encased in ice: the images of Florida's freezes are familiar, sad and earthy. But just past the crop rows here in the state's agricultural core, there swims another sizable industry that has suffered more than any other because of this year's unusually long cold snap -- tropical fish. 
 The little guys are dying by the millions. 
 A severe guppy shortage has already emerged, according to distributors, while fish farmers statewide expect losses of more than 50 percent as African cichlids, marble mollies, danios and other cheerful-looking varieties sink like pebbles to the bottom of freshwater ponds across Florida. 
 ''It could be devastating,'' said Ray Quillen, the owner of Urban Tropical, holding a few angelfish he hoped to save by moving them to indoor tanks. ''Not just for me, but for everyone.''
 The freezing temperatures have come at the worst possible time. Florida provides about half of the tropical fish sold nationwide (Asia provides most of the rest), and like oranges, the colorful pets sell best in winter. 
 The fish farmers who serve the $45-million-a-year industry here were already suffering because of the recession and a slow shift away from live hobbies and toward electronics. But the freeze has tipped them from glum to depressed. 
 ''It's bad,'' said David Boozer, executive director of the 120-member Florida Tropical Fish Farms Association. ''We were hoping for an economic turnaround to pull us up by our bootstraps, and that may happen, but we certainly didn't need 10 days of subnormal temperatures.'' 
 Florida, of course, thrives on warmth above all else. The Sunshine State has successfully sold a sweaterless life to retirees. For fish farmers, the subtropical temperatures and high water table made this the best place in America for the outdoor cultivation of tropical fish. 
 The first entrepreneurs got started in the 1930s, mostly around Miami. When land prices there spiked, the farmers moved here to the lake-filled area between Tampa and Orlando. 
 Their efforts tend to be hidden, down dirt roads on the edge of quiet towns, and largely ignored. As recently as a few years ago, tropical fish were the No. 1 cargo shipment out of Tampa International Airport, but fish farmers complain that not even the hobbyist who pays $100 for an emperor pleco gives much thought to the producer. 
 ''People know there are pet stores, they know there are fish,'' said Mr. Quillen, 49, who got into the business eight years ago after working as trucker. ''I guess they think they just appear or come from the wild.''
 In fact, they come from places like his -- a family-owned hatchery on 20 acres marked by 84 man-made, rectangular ponds the size of large swimming pools. There are a few greenhouses, too, steamy fish locker rooms filled with species bred to be red, green, striped, albino or bearded. 
 It is a world part science fiction -- with row after row of concrete water tanks built from the same molds as burial crypts -- and part simple farming: most of the workers end up muddy and pungent by the end of the day. 
 The freeze, however, has transformed the usual routine. Tropical fish begin to have problems when water temperatures dip below 60 degrees. So for most of the past week, as air temperatures collapsed into the 20s, farmers who should have been filling orders scrambled to cover ponds with plastic and to pump in warm water.
 Then, as the cold continued, they started to move as many fish indoors as they could.
 At Mr. Quillen's farm, that meant ditching millions of babies to make room for angelfish closer to the size needed for shipping. 
 At Imperial Tropicals, a few miles away, Mike Drawdy said the water temperatures in some of his ponds had dipped to 48 degrees when he checked them in the morning. That meant catastrophe -- and not just from the cold. 
 Mr. Drawdy pointed to a row of three-pronged prints in a pond's sandy bank. At dawn, he said, a scrum of wading birds feasted on the fish that were either dead or too cold to move. 
 Later in the day, workers pulled a net through the ponds to collect what they could. Only a few dozen fish came from waters that should have produced thousands. Yucatan mollies, marble mollies, pineapple swords -- every pond showed another population diminished. 
 Mr. Drawdy, 31, a commanding former Marine who joined his parents' business a few years ago, said it would take at least three months to bring the numbers back up to what they should be. 
 He dumped a small net of ink-black Yucatan mollies into a plastic bin on the back of a golf cart. ''This is enough to start a new pond if we had to,'' he said. ''But we were hoping for more.''
 Mr. Boozer, at the Tropical Fish Farms Association, said it would take weeks to determine the scope of the damage. In addition to the fish already dead in the ponds, he said, there will also be fish that die later from the temperature swings or from diseases like Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (also known as white spot disease, which makes a sick fish look as if it has been salted). 
 In the worst cases, federal aid might be available. Farmers with losses of more than 50 percent can file crop insurance claims with the Department of Agriculture to receive assistance. The area's congressman, Adam H. Putnam, a Republican, is closely monitoring the situation. 
 But for Mr. Quillen, Mr. Drawdy and many others, the frigid present is their main focus. They are hoping for high temperatures, or at least sunny days without wind. Those conditions help warm the ponds after a cold night. That helps save the fish. And that helps save their businesses. 
 ''There's nothing more we can do,'' Mr. Quillen said, standing in the cold. ''We've done everything.''

HEADLINE: Hope of Reprieve for Bond Investors

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE and ANTONY CURRIE

 BODY:
It's the slowest train wreck of the financial crisis: Commercial real estate is still screeching roughly two years after lenders jammed on the brakes.
 Case in point is the financial woes of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, the giant Manhattan apartment complexes acquired for $5.4 billion in 2006 by Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty. Yet while regional banks are braced for a damaging impact, mortgage-backed-bond investors are betting that they will escape with just a few scratches. 
 That's an astonishing turnaround from last year's panic. The Federal Reserve's pledge to prop up the market through a special lending facility helped, as did other measures that helped the financial world avoid total collapse. 
 A proxy for the $700 billion commercial mortgage bond market, Markit's CMBX AAA index, has risen substantially as investors have started to worry less. At first blush, that's hard to square with the real world. Commercial real estate prices are down around 44 percent from their peak, and regulators reckon that loans backed by office buildings, condos and hotels are one of the big risks of 2010. 
 That remains the case for banks, especially the small regional variety that poured money into speculative construction and development loans, where loss rates are expected to be especially high. But investors holding top-rated commercial mortgage-backed securities have much less to worry about now that apocalypse is off the table. 
 First, they aren't up against the wall as some banks are. Loans tucked into mortgage bonds tend to have much longer maturities than direct bank loans. A loan made in 2005 and repackaged into mortgage-backed securities could have another five years to run. By contrast, a 2005 loan still on a bank's books may well need to be refinanced this year. 
 Special loan servicing companies, which work on behalf of mortgage bond investors, can also modify loans should borrowers run into trouble. While this may mean bondholders are stuck with an investment longer than they would like, at least it keeps cash flowing. A Stuyvesant Town $3 billion loan is already in the hands of a special servicing company. 
 Commercial mortgage bonds in general are also far from subprime. Barclays Capital estimates losses on 2007 bonds at 16 percent, well below the 53 percent seen for subprime residential loans made the same year. Some banks with loans on their books won't be so lucky. But shaken commercial mortgage bond investors may indeed end up walking away from the crash.
 Post-Merger Bonuses
 Bank of America's crew on Wall Street can breathe a sigh of relief. It looks like the bank is set to hand out 2007-like bonuses to all its investment bankers and traders. If so, that will prevent a repeat of last year's mess, when Merrill Lynch employees scored big in the firm's last bonus round as an independent company while their new Bank of America colleagues got little. But leveling the bonus playing field is not a cultural cure-all. 
 There's no guarantee this will remove the lingering resentment the two-tier pay muddle has caused. But even if that's no longer an issue, it requires more than better bonuses to heal the wounds inflicted when two former rivals are forced together. It took years before tensions settled down after Chase bought J. P. Morgan, for example. In that case, last year's ousting of Bill Winters, the investment bank co-chief, exposed raw merger nerves long considered soothed. 
 That's not all. Bumper bonuses might be enough to keep some from actively seeking new employment. But that won't stop rivals from aggressively knocking. 
 Brian Moynihan, the newly appointed head of Bank of America, failed to inspire many of Merrill's deal makers during his short stint running the investment bank. And with ex-top managers from Merrill in senior positions elsewhere -- including Greg Fleming at Morgan Stanley -- Bank of America Merrill remains fertile poaching ground. 
 Washington could play a part, too. Bank of America could hand out more than $15 billion to bankers, traders and wealth managers for 2009, based on estimated revenue figures and Merrill's 2006 ratio of compensation to revenue. There's a good chance lawmakers and regulators will find that too much for a bank that has only just paid back the $45 billion of taxpayer aid that kept it standing -- and that lost money in each of the first three quarters last year after stripping out one-time items. 
 Equalizing bonuses certainly makes sense. But Bank of America has a long way to go before the combination with Merrill fulfills expectations.

HEADLINE: How It Went So Wrong

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
A decade ago, America Online merged with Time Warner in a deal valued at a stunning $350 billion. It was then, and is now, the largest merger in American business history. 
 The Internet, it was believed, was soon to vaporize mainstream media business models on the spot. America Online's frothy stock price made it worth twice as much as Time Warner's with less than half the cash flow.
 When the deal was announced on Jan. 10, 2000, Stephen M. Case, a co-founder of AOL, said, ''This is a historic moment in which new media has truly come of age.'' His counterpart at Time Warner, the philosopher chief executive Gerald M. Levin, who was fond of quoting the Bible and Camus, said the Internet had begun to ''create unprecedented and instantaneous access to every form of media and to unleash immense possibilities for economic growth, human understanding and creative expression.''
 The trail of despair in subsequent years included countless job losses, the decimation of retirement accounts, investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, and countless executive upheavals. Today, the combined values of the companies, which have been separated, is about one-seventh of their worth on the day of the merger. 
 To call the transaction the worst in history, as it is now taught in business schools, does not begin to tell the story of how some of the brightest minds in technology and media collaborated to produce a deal now regarded by many as a colossal mistake. 
 How did it happen?
 The romance between Mr. Case and Mr. Levin, they said in interviews with The New York Times, began in the fall of 1999 at a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of China at Tiananmen Square.
 MR. LEVIN I was seated for some reason in front of Steve Case and his wife and so we had a little chitchat. It was a stunning evening to be a part of that history. But this next thing that registered on me was that they seem to have a very sweet relationship and I liked that, and we had some fun, joked around, and so from a personality point of view we talked.
 MR. CASE There was all kinds of hoopla and parades in Tiananmen Square and a state dinner at the Hall of the People, and I remember Jerry had decided to have the Time Warner board meet in China that week and they were on a trip but they also attended some of these functions, so at these different functions I talked to various Time Warner board members, but I don't think I had any direct conversations with Jerry about the merger until probably a month later. 
 MR. LEVIN We're now back in the United States and I think Steve Case called me on the phone and in that conversation more than alluded to putting the companies together. I had my traditional script and quasi-legal background that when someone calls you on the phone, make sure they understand you're not for sale, which we certainly weren't, and decline any overture, which I did over the phone.
 In fact, Mr. Case and his team, including Robert W. Pittman, the company's president, had been plotting for months about how to use its high-priced stock to make a big acquisition. The company hired the investment bank Salomon Smith Barney, and its top media banker Eduardo Mestre, to consider various targets.
 MR. MESTRE It was one of the highlights of my career because I remember vividly sitting down with the AOL executives and going through with them their vision of how to combine AOL with a more traditional company in creating what at that time was going to be perceived as a company of the future.
 MR. PITTMAN It was a very heady time because 1999 was the first year the thesis that everybody was going to be on the Internet and every business was going to be on the Internet and it was going to be a primary means of communication finally was accepted; 1999 was the year it sort of kicked in, and I think when it kicked in people started saying, ''O.K., what's the big dream, what's the big idea, what do we need to do now?''
 We were actually deep in discussions with eBay to buy eBay and add them, had a little bit of discussion with Larry Probst over at Electronic Arts, and Steve had an idea that we should merge with Time Warner and me and a couple other people said there's no chance that's ever going to happen and I sort of paid no attention to it.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Levin was thinking deeply about how to transform Time Warner for the digital age.
 MR. LEVIN We were emerging from not just old media but from an analog world into a digital world, and philosophically people were beginning to understand that the digital world was a transformational universe. 
 Before AOL, Mr. Levin, prodded by Gordon Crawford, senior vice president at Capital Research Global Investors in Los Angeles, then the largest institutional shareholder of Time Warner, discussed a merger with Yahoo's founder, Jerry Yang.
 MR. CRAWFORD I was involved in putting the two of them together and kind of following the course of those discussions over the year, and over the course of 1999 those discussions morphed from the discussion of a partial stake to a full merger, and then in the late fall Jerry Yang decided he did not want to pursue it any further and I think terminated the discussions.
 Shortly after Mr. Case's initial phone call to Mr. Levin, the pair met for dinner and wine at the Rihga Royal, a hotel in Midtown Manhattan.
 MR. LEVIN Steve and I met at a hotel for several hours. The idea was not to talk about any transactional detail but to talk about philosophy and values, and it was several hours. I took away the fact that he had good values, which was important to me -- that his company was a real company.
 MR. CASE Initially, he was a little reluctant, just thinking it through, but did agree that it made sense for us to meet. So a week or two later we met and had dinner at a hotel in New York, and we were talking about what this company might be together and some of the benefits that could accrue strategically as well as how the company together might have a broader impact on society, and that kind of led to a series of discussions.
 Both sides assembled negotiating teams, and alerted a handful of top executives and bankers. At Time Warner, Mr. Levin kept only a small circle of people in the loop, including Richard D. Parsons, the company's president.
 MR. PARSONS Jerry came into my office and said that he had been talking with Steve, who he had gotten to know on a trip that he had taken abroad to China. And Jerry and Steve had gone and met, had a few dinners after that, and he said we have been talking to Steve about this and that he thought this was something we ought to do and him and Steve were sort of going down the road to see how it could work and he wanted to get my views.
 Fundamentally I thought it was a good idea. 
 Making the Deal
 The deal was sealed at a dinner in early January at Mr. Case's house in McLean, Va. The transaction was spun to the world as a merger of equals, but in reality AOL, with its more valuable stock, was acquiring Time Warner. AOL would own 55 percent of the new company and Time Warner, 45 percent. But the new board would have an equal number of AOL and Time Warner directors. Mr. Levin would be chief executive, and Mr. Case would be chairman.
 Over a weekend, the two sides conducted due diligence, with teams of lawyers camped out in two law offices in Manhattan. 
 Miraculously, news of the deal did not leak during the talks, and word trickled out only hours before the announcement on Jan. 10, 2000. 
 Over that weekend, Mr. Levin and Mr. Case began notifying more of the executives. Among these were Don Logan, then head of Time Inc., and Ted Leonsis, a division president at AOL. Many executives, including Timothy A. Boggs, then head of government relations at Time Warner, found out about the deal the day of the announcement in an 8 a.m. conference call. (Mr. Boggs is now associate rector at St. Albans Parish in Washington. Mr. Logan owns a minor-league baseball team in Birmingham, Ala., and Mr. Leonsis is an owner of the Washington Capitals and the Washington Wizards.)
 None were pleased with the news.
 MR. LOGAN Dumbest idea I had ever heard in my life.
 MR. LEONSIS I was one of the loudest advocates for not doing the deal.
 MR. BOGGS Just real regret and dread. My job was to make the case for this deal to governments around the world and to get all the regulatory clearances that were needed and to work with our antitrust lawyers to get those clearances to make the case to Congress and the media, to some extent, about this merger, and I was just frankly stunned and a bit knocked back on my heels by the prospect of securing all of those approvals. 
 I knew and I loved Time Warner. I saw it as a company with a vision and a set of values, and I saw AOL in a much less favorable light, much more opportunistic, made up of folks who were really trying to merely exploit the market they were in as opposed to developing something that was enduring, and I was very leery about this deal.
 The announcement was hailed as a momentous coming of age for the Internet and the triumph of the New Economy.
 MR. MESTRE If you go back and read what was written in The Journal and what was written in The Times about this transaction, you would have thought that it was the second coming of the Messiah. I'm sure that if one were to read those today one would find it amusing, maybe dated, but it was, for financial reporting, it was as soaring and this is the great epiphany-of-life kind of journalism and you read it and it brought tears to your eyes.
 Nina Munk, of Vanity Fair, wrote the book ''Fools Rush In: Steve Case, Jerry Levin, and the Unmaking of AOL Time Warner.'' 
 MS. MUNK I had one of my sources who told me he was listening to the radio on his way into work that morning when the deal was announced and he practically drove off the road. The Wall Street Journal, I think, had 19 or 20 separate articles on the intricacies of the deal and what it meant. The word ''transformative'' was used again and again, and we really believed with the rare exception of a very small number of skeptics, we really believed that this deal captured a transformation and that it spoke to a new direction that the world was taking.
 But some wanted to talk fashion: Mr. Levin showed up to the press conference without a tie, while Mr. Case dressed up.
 MR. LEVIN What most people don't recall is that I had stopped wearing a tie and jacket for quite some time. Once we had a music company in our building, I thought it was a constraint to wear a tie and jacket, so it wasn't planned but it was kind of a refreshing symbol. I was extremely happy -- ''high,'' I was going to say -- on an emotional high because I think when you actually announce something, it's the reflection of the news coming back at you. It makes it real. It puts it out on the stage. It validates what was internal before.
 MR. CASE The day of the announcement was bittersweet, frankly. On the one hand, obviously, it was an exciting time in bringing together the leading Internet company and the leading media company to create a new company that really had the potential to lead in this new century. At the same time, I recognized that my role was going to change.
 It was a moment of achievement after a decade or in some cases, in our case two decades, of trying to prove that this concept had real merit, suddenly the Internet had arrived and we're beginning this new century with a combination of these two great companies.
 On the steps of a church on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Tim Armstrong, then an executive at an upstart called Google and now AOL's chief executive, read about the deal.
 MR. ARMSTRONG I couldn't believe it. I just remember reading the deal and thinking the world had changed.
 The deal took a year to be approved by regulators. Robert Pitofsky, then the head of the Federal Trade Commission, allowed the deal to go forward, even as the F.T.C.'s own economists warned the deal did not make financial sense. It was the most significant media case to come before the commission, according to Mr. Pitofsky, since 1964, when CBS bought a big league baseball team.
 MR. PITOFSKY Now we have large communications cases, but at the time it was probably the biggest. There was CBS-New York Yankees; that would be the closest you could come to something like this.
 Our economists at the time said this deal doesn't make economic sense. I didn't see it that way, and I don't think the other commissioners did, but the economists immediately saw it didn't make financial sense.
 First Signs of a Clash
 The optimism surrounding the deal was brief. In May of 2000, the dot-com bubble began to burst and online advertising began to slow, making it difficult for AOL to meet the financial forecasts on which the deal was based. The world began moving quickly to high-speed Internet access, putting AOL's ubiquitous dial-up service in jeopardy.
 The companies had another problem: both sides seemed to hate one another.
 MR. PARSONS I remember saying at a vital board meeting where we approved this, that life was going to be different going forward because they're very different cultures, but I have to tell you, I underestimated how different.
 MR. LEONSIS The news release that they showed us and the positioning was that AOL would be the crown jewel, and I'd say, ''Well if we're the crown jewel, why are all our best and most important people leaving here and going to New York?'' In fact, if we were the crown jewel, you would go and take all of the best, most talented people at Time Warner and bring them here.
 In the summer of 2001, Alec Klein, then a reporter at The Washington Post, received an anonymous phone call.
 MR. KLEIN He tells me that someone had been suspended at AOL, a midlevel executive, and he tells me very little more than that and then hangs up on me.
 So I'd call so-and-so, and that person would say, ''I don't know anything, but why don't you try these three other people?'' and I kept doing this. Eventually I called the guy and I said: ''Hi, this is Alec Klein of The Washington Post.'' And the first thing out of his mouth was, ''How did you find me?'' I realized, here is the anonymous tipster who had first called me. 
 I persuaded him to meet me, and when we met he started to tell me more about what was going on and I started to meet other people through him and it started to grow into this network of different sources, all of whom had these secret documents from AOL.
 Mr. Klein's work uncovered that AOL had been improperly inflating its advertising revenue, and his stories that were published in 2002 prompted investigations by the S.E.C. and the Department of Justice. Eventually the company paid hefty fines and was forced to restate past earnings.
 The accounting scandal became a rallying cry for the Time Warner side. In 2003, Mr. Case stepped down as chairman. Today he runs his own private investment firm.
 MR. CASE For whatever reason, right or wrong, I had become kind of a magnet for a lot of anger and frustration, particularly with the Time Warner employees and also with shareholders and if we really were going to get the company on the right track and really capitalize on the promise of the merger, probably the best thing I could do was step aside and get out of the way.
 Mr. Levin, whose son Jonathan was murdered in 1997, had announced his retirement in December 2001. Today, he runs a holistic healing center in Santa Monica, Calif.
 MR. LEVIN When 9/11 occurred, it was obviously an emotional experience for everyone. For me, it was more personal because of the death of my son and probably never having really achieved any resolution.
 We had a board meeting scheduled for the 3rd of October, which was right after 9/11, and I said we can't have a board meeting, we're supposed to be in New York. And most people, particularly the AOL people, said business has to go forward and I was just emotional and got very upset. I then went to some Wall Street presentation -- and I made quite a few of them -- and when I was making my normal presentation, someone raised their hand and asked, can you give us the margin deterioration that will occur from all the extra spending on account of 9/11. I thought the question was out of line; I not only said it was out of line, I really emotionally went after the person asking the question, got up and walked out.
 The Deal Unwinds
 Many investors and employees lost millions of dollars, but no one lost more than Ted Turner, who at the time was the largest individual shareholder in the combined company.
 MR. TURNER I'd like to forget it. That's what goes through my mind. I almost didn't do this interview because I didn't want to dig it up again. Let it pass into history.
 The Time Warner-AOL merger should pass into history like the Vietnam War and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. It's one of the biggest disasters that have occurred to our country.
 I lost 80 percent of my worth and subsequently lost my job. We looked it up to see if I was the biggest loser of all time because I lost about $8 billion. But I don't think I was the biggest loser of all time. I think at one point Microsoft stock went down more than that for Bill Gates. I think he's the biggest winner and the biggest loser. I was in the top three or four of all time.
 Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the current chief of Time Warner, once dressed down Mr. Case in a meeting, saying, according to Mr. Klein's reporting: ''The only division that's not performing is yours. Every one of us is growing, making the numbers. The only problem in this construct is AOL.''
 MR. BEWKES I really have a strong point of view that it has never been an issue of culture at Time Warner. I know you're going to have people, for various reasons that they have individually, say there was the issue of culture at Time Warner. I think that in fact the employees at AOL and Time Warner worked together quite well to try to make the most of the merger, but they didn't solve the business fundamental challenges at AOL anymore than was solved at Yahoo, MSN, Lycos or I.A.C.
 The enduring debate is whether the deal collapsed because the concept was flawed at the start, or because the cultures were too different and the execution of the merger was a failure.
 MR. CASE It was a good idea, but the execution of it wasn't what it needed to be, and I accept responsibility for that. Everybody involved, I think, needs to accept responsibility for that, but that doesn't take away from the core strategic value of the idea.
 MR. LEVIN I used to think at the time it was a clash of cultures and a misreading of the dot-com bubble, but I now upon reflection believe that the transaction was undone by the Internet itself.
 I think it's something that no one could have foreseen, and to this day, whether Apple is going to dominate entertainment or whether Amazon is going to dominate publishing, all the old business plans are out the window. How do you get paid for content? And the consumer has access to everything and now it's going to be on a handheld device, so what I call the rolling thunder of the Internet started actually to eat its own, which was AOL. AOL was the Google of its time. It was how you got to the Internet, but it was using some old media business ideas that were undone by the Internet itself, and that's why Google came along.
 MR. PARSONS The business model sort of collapsed under us, and then finally this cultural matter. As I said, it was beyond certainly my abilities to figure out how to blend the old media and the new media culture. They were like different species, and in fact, they were species that were inherently at war.

HEADLINE: N.C.A.A. Wants the Young Madder About March

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
With this issue, In Advertising returns from its year-end hiatus. And because next Monday is a holiday, look for next week's issue on Tuesday, Jan. 19.
 Although ''March Madness'' is one of the best-known times of the year on the sports calendar, the National Collegiate Athletic Association is hoping to generate even more mania for its annual basketball tournament. To help accomplish that, the organization sought a campaign not from a Madison Avenue agency, a hip digital boutique or a gaggle of high-priced free-lancers but rather from 120 students of a marketing class.
 The students were seniors in the fall semester at the Farmer School of Business at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, taking a class called the Strategy Works Marketing Practicum. The class is intended to be experiential -- that is, giving the students a chance to present campaign ideas to actual marketers, which can use the concepts in advertising aimed at real consumers.
 There were several reasons why the N.C.A.A. turned to the students. Perhaps the most important was a surprising research finding: the ardency for the tournament is not quite what the organization would like it to be among Americans ages 22 or 23 and under. 
 For instance, ''in TV viewership, we haven't seen the growth we think we deserve in that demographic,'' says Peter Davis, director for corporate alliances at the N.C.A.A. in Indianapolis, who knew about the class because he was a marketing major at Miami who graduated from there in 1993.
 He took part in a predecessor to Strategy Works, he says, working on a project about a bleach product for Procter & Gamble, and ''to this day I lean on that experience.''
 So when it came to divining ways to develop ''programs that would create the next generation of fans and reach the under-23 audience, who better to learn from than the under-23 audience?'' Mr. Davis asks.
 There was also, Mr. Davis acknowledges, ''a budget question'' in that the timing of the initiative and the state of the economy meant ''there wasn't a lot of extra money floating around.''
 ''This was an opportunity to work with the demographic at a reasonable cost,'' Mr. Davis says. (Clients of Strategy Works pay the Farmer School fees in the range of $20,000 to $25,000.)
 And hiring the class for the campaign brought ''120 minds to work on my problem,'' he adds, ''instead of three or four'' as would be the case if he went to an agency.
 Mr. Davis and a colleague visited the Miami University campaign in late August, briefing the class on the assignment. The class was divided into five sections and each section was composed of four teams, for a total of 20 teams. Each section was assigned a member of the teaching faculty with whom to work.
 One of them was Gillian Oakenfull, associate professor of marketing and director for experiential learning in the marketing department at the Farmer School.
 ''We teach them strategy and tactics and how to work together,'' Ms. Oakenfull says, ''but the ideas need to come from them.''
 During the briefing, Mr. Davis told the students that the N.C.A.A. ''wanted to see some ideas for social networking,'' she recalls, ''but you don't have to tell them about social networking because they can't not do it.''
 ''Several of them are doing five things at once sometimes,'' Ms. Oakenfull says of the students, among them visiting Facebook, watching streaming video and chatting.
 In the weeks from late August through early December, the teams pursued the assignment in myriad ways, Ms. Oakenfull says. Some ''went back to their old high schools'' to interview students, she adds, some assembled focus groups, some conducted research online and ''some went to college basketball games.''
 As the end of the semester neared, the faculty discussed with the team members how to assemble and present their ideas and then organized a playoff tournament like the N.C.A.A.'s to select a winning campaign. 
 ''I'm a former N.C.A.A. athlete myself,'' Ms. Oakenfull says, who played tennis and ran track at Lamar University in Beaumont, Tex., ''and after that was a tournament director.''
 The work of each team was ranked by the faculty and they were placed in four pools, each pool composed of five teams. On Dec. 7, the first and second pools made presentations, followed two days later by the third and fourth pools.
 There were 24 judges, six for each pool, among them ''business people from around the state,'' Ms. Oakenfull says, and ''sports professionals from the Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland Cavaliers, Cincinnati Bengals and the Indy Racing League.'' Mr. Davis was on hand, too.
 The judges winnowed the 20 teams to 4, which of course were referred to, March Madness style, as the Final Four. In a five-hour session on Dec. 11, the process was completed, accompanied by college-sports trappings like the Miami University mascot and marching band.
 To encourage the finalists further, film from the finales of the N.C.A.A. tournament, known by a song on the soundtrack, ''One Shining Moment,'' was screened, with shots of Miami star athletes inserted.
 The four teams -- named M.V.P., myN.C.A.A., The Cinderella Story and 3.2.1 Consulting -- presented to Mr. Davis and four other judges, who selected two finalist teams, myN.C.A.A. and 3.2.1. 
 The members of those two teams underwent, head to head, a question-and-answer session with the judges, who then chose 3.2.1 as the winner.
 ''What surprised me right off the bat was the presentations themselves, the quality and the caliber,'' Mr. Davis says. ''I expected a certain level of delivery and was astonished at the actual level of delivery.''
 ''Going in, I said, 'Maybe I just thought a lot of myself when I was in the program,' '' he adds, laughing, ''but I would absolutely put their work up against the work of agencies I've worked with.''
 A motif common to the presentations was ''pointing out how we're lacking youth messaging,'' Mr. Davis says, amid the mix of campaigns the N.C.A.A. runs each year to promote March Madness. 
 ''They said, 'You could mean more to us,' '' he adds.
 The students also shared a focus on suggesting that the association talk to younger potential fans of college basketball ''as social beings,'' Mr. Davis, ''rather than as individuals,'' and they described how the organization could promote regular-season games more to cultivate interest in the tournament.
 What ultimately led to the selection of the 3.2.1 team, Mr. Davis says, is that its presentation was centered on an insight from interviews that ''everyone could remember their first college basketball game and the earlier you start watching the more likely you become an avid fan.''
 That led the 3.2.1 team to propose that the N.C.A.A. reach out to children ages 8 to 10, through their parents.
 ''The idea is to get to the parents through the social networking the parents are doing,'' Mr. Davis says, ''and have the parents create that 'first time' for their kids.''
 ''It's hitting a younger demographic through an older demographic we already do pretty good with,'' he adds. 
 Kristen Gollish, a member of the 3.2.1 team, says its approach was derived from conversations with Steve Lamping, a team member who is ''a huge fan'' of the Xavier University basketball team.
 ''We said to him, 'Why are you a fan?' and he talked about his first N.C.A.A. game whenhe was 8 and how he remembered it to this day,'' says Ms. Gollish, 22, who is from Palatine, Ill.
 ''The things you're into when you're 22 you probably got into when you were very young,'' she adds, so that tack ''made the most sense.'' The team suggested a theme, ''Focus on family, a history in the making,'' to be expressed through initiatives like family nights at games
 The other members of the team in addition to Ms. Gollish and Mr. Lamping, who is from Cincinnati, are Kelly Hasselfeld, from St. Louis; Mia Hennessey, also from St. Louis; and Allie Sweeney, also from Cincinnati.
 Other ideas proposed by the winning team include events and other promotions at warm-weather sites where students celebrate spring break and an experiential marketing effort called the Buzzer Beater Bus, which would appear games around the country throughout the regular season. 
 Mr. Davis says the N.C.A.A. intends to use ideas from 3.2.1 as well as from the presentations of other teams, adding that some will be shared with member universities as well.
 Ms. Gollish says the Strategy Works experience ''gave me an excellent idea of what the real world will be like.''
 Ms. Gollish can soon find out how accurate her perceptions are. After sifting through ''a few job offers,'' she says, she accepted one for a position after she graduates as a sales representative for the Hershey Company.
 Too bad she is not taking the Strategy Works class in the coming semester. The client, Ms. Oakenfull says, will be Nestle USA.

HEADLINE: Colorado Voters Crave Reform Of Health Care and Congress

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
DENVER -- Donny Seyfer, the manager of an auto repair shop here, had high hopes when President Obama and Congress tackled health care as their top priority early last year.
 ''This is good,'' Mr. Seyfer remembers thinking. He expected Congress to ''find out what Americans wanted.'' But, he said in an interview at his shop, the Congressional debate deteriorated into a partisan brawl, and Congress has virtually ignored his biggest concern: holding down health costs.
''I am an automotive diagnostician,'' Mr. Seyfer said. ''We look for the root cause of problems. If we treat the symptoms, the problem always comes back. With health care, we are not treating the root cause: Why does it cost so much?''
 Mr. Seyfer's disappointment was echoed in dozens of interviews here and in Fort Collins, Colo. People from both sides of the political spectrum -- and apolitical consumers -- said they were deeply skeptical about the health care bill being put together by Congress and the White House. 
 The concern illustrates the challenge Mr. Obama and Democratic lawmakers face in trying to meld House and Senate bills in a way that can be sold to the public. All kinds of issues are still in play, from how to cover abortion to whether to tax high-cost health plans.
 President Obama hopes to sign a bill that guarantees access to insurance, outlaws the denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions and subsidizes premiums for many low- and middle-income people. Heading into Congressional elections this fall, Democrats hope voters will reward them for a historic achievement.
 But Republicans are already using the bill as ammunition against Democrats who voted for it, like Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado.
 About 800,000 Colorado residents, representing one-sixth of the state's population, are uninsured. The state's politics are mixed and somewhat unpredictable. Colorado has a sizable contingent of people who want a single-payer government-financed health care system, as well as libertarians and Tea Party protesters opposed to big government.
 Few of those interviewed here expect to see direct benefits from the legislation. Many complained of sweetheart deals done to win votes in the Senate. Liberals and conservatives alike said Congress was too influenced by special interests. 
 Tamara L. Kirch, who is uninsured and stands to benefit from the legislation, bristled at the proposed requirement to buy insurance. 
 ''We have a frontier mentality,'' Ms. Kirch said. ''I don't want the government telling me what to do.'' (She feels the same way about abortion: ''The government should not tell a woman what to do with her womb.'')
 Democrats, Republicans and independents each account for about one-third of registered voters in Colorado.
 Mr. Obama carried the state with 54 percent of the vote in 2008. But Gov. Bill Ritter Jr., a Democrat who was facing a tough fight for re-election, pulled out of the race last week. 
 Representative Diana DeGette, a Democrat from Denver, is a champion of the bill passed by the House in November. But Representative Betsy Markey, a freshman Democrat from the district that includes Fort Collins, voted against it, saying the bill did not do enough to cut costs.
 Ron Vaughn, who provides health insurance to his 60 employees at Argonaut Wine and Liquor near the state Capitol, said: ''I'm a middle-of-the-road kind of guy. I want the Democrats out of my pocket and Republicans out of my bedroom. The one word I would use for what's going on in Washington is embarrassing. I am embarrassed for Republicans and for Democrats. They started out on the right foot, but it's degenerated.
 ''Republicans misled people and tried to scare seniors by putting out misinformation about death panels,'' Mr. Vaughn said. ''Then to pass a bill in the Senate, Democrats stooped to bartering for votes. It demeans the whole process.''
 James W. Noon, who runs a packaging supply business here, said he was irked to see Senate leaders secure votes by promising extra Medicaid money to Nebraska and Louisiana. 
 ''Don't they realize how dumb that looks?'' said Mr. Noon, a Republican.
 Michael R. Stone, a private investigator who describes himself as a political independent, was bothered by those deals, too.
 ''President Obama campaigned on a promise to change the way things are done in Washington,'' Mr. Stone said. ''But it seems like business as usual to me.''
 Richard F. Barkey, a former chairman of the Jefferson County Democratic Party and a leader of the advocacy group Health Care for All Colorado, said: ''We had huge expectations for President Obama and the Democrats in Congress. But they could not build a dam big enough to stop the flood of money from corporate interests that have influenced the health care debate.''
 Eliza Carney, a member of the same group, said, ''Obama and his administration have really -- I won't say betrayed, but -- disappointed us.''
 State Representative John M. Kefalas, a Democrat from Fort Collins, said: ''Not enough in either bill focuses on: How do you increase the value of our health care system? How do we bring down costs?''
 A government-run insurance company, or public option, could hold down costs by putting competitive pressure on private insurers, Mr. Kefalas said. But it was ''bumped out of the Senate bill because of special-interest influence,'' he said. 
 Brandon C. Shaffer, a Democrat who is president of the Colorado Senate, said, ''It's amazing to me how the insurance industry lobby has shaped the debate in Washington.''
 That sentiment was echoed on the other side of the political divide.
 ''Congress and this administration don't listen to us anymore,'' said Lesley A. Hollywood, a Republican and member of the Northern Colorado Tea Party group. ''They are catering to special interests, health insurance and pharmaceutical companies.''
 Colorado has been an incubator of innovation. Denver Health is considered a model for public hospitals. Health economists point to Grand Junction, Colo., to show how collaboration by doctors and hospitals can produce high-quality, low-cost care.
 And on Dec. 2, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.gave the nation's top award for high-quality care to the Poudre Valley Health System in Fort Collins.
 But Pamela G. Brock, a vice president of the Poudre Valley system, said it would be difficult to maintain that quality if Congress cut back Medicare payment rates, as proposed in the House and Senate bills.
 ''There is a big fear that the cuts in Medicare and other areas will put many hospitals out of business,'' Ms. Brock said. ''The cost of providing care does not seem to have been taken into account by people drafting the federal legislation. Congress talked to insurance companies, to the American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association and all the lobbyists, but not to many people actually providing care.''
 The strongest voice of support for the legislation came from Dr. Patricia A. Gabow, chief executive of the Denver Health and Hospital Authority, which runs the city's highly regarded public hospital. 
 The proposed expansion of Medicaid could be a boon to the hospital, where 46 percent of patients are uninsured, Dr. Gabow said. 
 Kraig W. Burleson, chief executive of the Inner City Health Center, a private nonprofit clinic for the uninsured in Denver, said: ''The Congressional debate has been very frustrating to watch. Political posturing by both parties has hindered work on the legislation and will mar the quality of the final product.''
 John Parvensky, president of the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, which runs the Stout Street Clinic here, was more hopeful. He said the federal legislation could have ''a tremendously positive impact,'' providing insurance to indigent single adults who received health care, mental health and addiction services at his clinic.
 In the last year, he said, the number of patients treated at the clinic increased about 20 percent, to 12,000. 
 ''The situation continues to get much worse while the debate in Washington goes on,'' Mr. Parvensky said.

HEADLINE: Healthy Aging, With Nary a Supplement

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
The Great Recession, so I'm told, has been great for one segment of the economy -- the makers of pills and potions that offer the promise of keeping people healthy. A middle-aged woman remarked as she perused the supplement shelves in my local health food store (I was buying bulgur): ''I can't afford to get sick. I lost my job and I have no health insurance.'' 
 Each year millions of people fall prey to false promises that this, that or the other formula or fortified food can protect their hearts, prevent cancer, improve memory, strengthen their bones, uncreak their joints, build their muscles, even enable them to burn extra calories without moving. 
 The desire to achieve a healthy old age is laudable indeed, and will be even more so in the future. According to a projection of the century-long rise in life expectancy published in The Lancet in October, more than half the children born since 2000 in wealthy countries can expect to celebrate their 100th birthday. 
 If so many of us are destined to become centenarians, it is all the more important to be able to enjoy those years unencumbered by chronic disease and disability. There is no virtue in simply living long; the goal should be to live long and well. 
 But while much is known about how to raise the odds of a healthy old age, only a minority of Americans incorporate into their lives what is likely to give them the biggest bang for their buck. Like the woman in the health food store, they'd rather rely on supplements of vitamins and minerals, fish oils and herbs, perhaps washed down with pricey antioxidant juices. 
 Unfortunately, sound evidence for the benefits of most such products is sorely lacking; in some cases the best scientific evidence has shown no benefit, and in a few cases has even shown harm. Human chemistry is far more complex than visionaries thought just two decades ago, when reputable scientists pushed for fortifying foods with substances they believed would prevent cancer and heart disease.
 The Longevity Diet
 After decades of government guidelines and advice from friends, family and physicians, Americans have made some improvements in their eating habits. On average, we consume less red meat and saturated fat and somewhat more whole grains, fruits and vegetables. Our processed foods were recently stripped of artery-clogging trans fats, thanks to a campaign that challenged the food industry to better protect American hearts. And our pigs (though, alas, not our people) have gotten much leaner in recent years. 
 But, and this is a big but, we are a long way from consuming the kind of diet most closely linked to a low risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke and dementia. That diet need not be strictly vegetarian, but it should emphasize plant-based foods over the meat and other products that come from animals that eat plants. The closer to the earth we eat, the healthier -- and leaner -- we are likely to be.
 Most of the evidence for the assumed health benefits of specific nutrients comes not from stuffing people with supplements but rather from observing the effects of eating foods rich in these nutrients. Supplements of antioxidants failed to protect against disease the way a diet rich in fruits and vegetables seems to. Rather than isolated nutrients, combinations of them, along with other perhaps unidentified substances in foods, are now thought to confer the observed health benefits. 
 You have no doubt heard much about the so-called Mediterranean diet, and with good reason. This eating style, in its classic form, is most closely linked to a healthy body and mind as people age: a lower risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease. It is loaded with nutrient-rich vegetables and fruits, beans and grains, fish and shellfish, but relatively little meat and poultry. Olive oil is the primary fat for cooking and eating, even replacing butter as a smear on bread.
 But the Mediterranean diet does not come in a pill or potion. You have to eat the foods to reap the rewards. Consider also taking supplements of two nutrients in otherwise short supply -- calcium and vitamin D. In addition to protecting bones from age-related decline, vitamin D in amounts of 800 to 1,000 international units daily for middle-aged and older adults may improve muscle strength (and thus reduce the risk of falls and fractures), help prevent several common cancers, counter depression and enhance cognitive function, various studies have suggested. 
 The second crucial ingredient is regular physical exercise. I know, you've heard this song before and you know you should do it, but ... fill in the blank: you hate exercise, you have no time, the weather is lousy, the children are sick, you're injured, you don't get enough sleep as it is. It's easy to find reasons not to exercise. 
 It's time to stop making excuses and make regular physical activity an integral part of your life, like eating, sleeping and brushing your teeth. You don't decide every day to do these things, you just do them. Likewise with exercise. 
 Move for Good Health
 The single most effective activity, studies have found, is an aerobic activity like brisk walking -- about 30 minutes a day. If you can't get out of the house, walk inside. Go up and down stairs, walk the hall, walk from room to room, walk in place. If walking doesn't suit you, try dancing to music.
 In a 2006 study of people aged 60 to 79, those who were assigned to walk briskly three days a week for 45 minutes a day experienced an increase in the brain's volume, especially in regions involved in memory, planning and multitasking.
 Even people already afflicted with chronic ailments -- heart or lung disease, arthritis, diabetes, depression, early dementia -- can reap significant health benefits from exercise, studies have found. 
 Americans have yet to learn what Hippocrates, the father of medicine, recognized in 400 B.C. ''All parts of the body which have a function if used in moderation and exercised in labors in which each is accustomed, become thereby healthy, well developed and age more slowly; but if unused and left idle they become liable to disease, defective in growth and age quickly.''
 So get off the couch and make this year the year you discover the joys and benefits of movement.

HEADLINE: Robbed, Then Scared; Armed, Then Arrested

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA

 BODY:
The night the robbers shoved their way in, Jason Baez lay on the living room floor, terrified. He worried for his children, asleep in their bedroom; for his wife, prostrate next to him; and for himself as two men brandished guns and a third accomplice, a woman, lashed Mr. Baez and his wife with duct tape and electrical cord. 
 His wife, Marlene Baez, was too angry to be scared. She cursed at the intruders until one of them finally said, ''Man, shut that woman up!'' 
 It was Sept. 28, 2006, the start of personal and financial disaster for the couple.
 Jason and Marlene had grown up blocks apart. They harbored grade school crushes on each other before they even knew what dating was. 
 Now, after nearly a dozen years of marriage, they were bound on the hard wooden floor of their East 101st Street apartment in Manhattan, wearing little more than T-shirts and underwear as the invaders tore through every nook looking for valuables. 
 If there was a bright note, it was that their older daughter was at her grandmother's, and that their two younger children, who usually woke at the slightest sound, slept through the half-hour ordeal. 
 The robbers took a video recorder, jewelry, wallets and other items. But more importantly, they stole the Baezes' sense of well-being. In the days that followed, they bought a hallway security camera and sat focused on it as if it were a Hollywood thriller. At night they lay awake startled by ordinary building creaks, remembering the robbers' parting words: ''Don't call the police or we'll come back and kill you'' -- advice they had ignored. 
 ''You'd hear any little noise and you'd think that's them again,'' said Ms. Baez, 31. 
 ''Everyone was a suspect to us,'' said Mr. Baez, 32. 
 Mr. Baez was so concerned, he bought a gun from a street dealer for $50, not even sure what he would do with it. And on the authorities' advice, the family moved away until the perpetrators could be caught. They rented a $1,600-a-month apartment in Jersey City, but were still responsible for the $745 monthly payments on their rent-stabilized apartment in Manhattan. By the time they returned, more than a year later, they were more than $10,000 in arrears. 
 Mr. Baez made $1,360 a month as a building porter. Ms. Baez was unemployed until a few months ago, when she found a job as a pharmacy cashier. 
 They got by, but struggled to catch up on the back rent. In April, the landlord began eviction proceedings. 
 The family sought help from the Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, a member agency of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven beneficiaries of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. With the group's help, the family obtained a $2,875.44 loan from the city's Human Resources Administration; a $2,000 loan from the Bridge Fund of New York, which works to prevent homelessness; a $1,490.12 grant from the Community Services Society; a $745.06 grant from Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York; a federal emergency housing grant for $745.06; and a Federation grant for $745.06. Catholic Charities and the Community Services Society are also Neediest Cases beneficiaries. 
 This year, for the first time since the robbery, they had a Christmas tree. The Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies delivered presents for the children. 
 Mr. Baez, meanwhile, is waiting to testify against one of the men in the home invasion case; the other is already in prison on an unrelated case. The woman was convicted in the home invasion last year. 
 It would have been a comforting end. But five months after the robbery, as Mr. Baez was visiting their Manhattan apartment to collect the mail, a police officer stopped him in the lobby and frisked him, he said. Finding nothing, the officer asked him if he had any drugs or weapons on him. Nervous, he decided to confess: ''I just got home-invaded in September and I have a weapon for my protection,'' Mr. Baez recalled telling the officer. 
 He was arrested, and despite having no criminal record, he faced up to three and a half years in prison. Prosecutors offered him a deal of one year if he pleaded guilty, and he accepted. He is to be sentenced Jan. 27. 
 ''We were afraid to fight it,'' Ms. Baez said. ''We couldn't be without him for three and a half years.'' 
 HOW TO HELP: Checks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund may be sent to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245. All gifts are acknowledged; special letters are not possible. A check intended for a particular agency should be written to and mailed to the agency, noting that it is a Neediest Cases gift.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Blocks Plan for Trial Webcast

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court indicated Monday that it might soon have something significant to say about whether and when video coverage of federal trials is appropriate.
 Shortly before a federal trial over same-sex marriage began in San Francisco, the court temporarily blocked a judge's plan to broadcast the trial on the Internet. Saying they needed more time to consider the issues, the justices said their order would remain in effect until Wednesday at 4 p.m. Eastern time.
 The Supreme Court does not allow video coverage of arguments in its courtroom, and cameras are routinely banned from most federal courtrooms. In an experiment begun last month, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which includes the Federal District Court in San Francisco, agreed to allow federal judges to permit cameras in civil cases. 
 The trial judge in the San Francisco case, Judge Vaughn R. Walker, had intended to allow streaming video to several federal courthouses around the nation and had planned to post it after the end of each day's proceedings on YouTube. The Supreme Court order allowed only ''streaming to other rooms'' within the San Francisco courthouse, where an overflow crowd of journalists and spectators attended the trial's opening on Monday.
 Justice Stephen G. Breyer dissented from the order. He agreed that further consideration of the issues was warranted and said he was ''pleased that the stay is time limited.'' But he said he would have considered the issues without a stay, in part because the defendants had not shown they were likely to suffer irreparable harm without one.
 In the trial, proponents of same-sex marriage hope to show that there is no adequate justification under the federal Constitution for Proposition 8, the California constitutional amendment overturning a decision of the state's Supreme Court allowing same-sex marriage. Opponents of such marriages say the federal challenge amounts to a pointless show trial in a community predisposed to favor the unions.
 In papers filed Saturday in the Supreme Court, Charles J. Cooper, a lawyer representing opponents of same-sex marriage, argued that a stay was needed to prevent ''harassment, economic reprisal, threat and even physical violence'' against witnesses prepared to testify in favor of Proposition 8. Some witnesses said they would withdraw if the trial was broadcast, the brief said.
 ''Whether to broadcast trial court proceedings, especially in controversial, high-profile cases such as this,'' Mr. Cooper said in urging the Supreme Court to intercede, ''is an issue of surpassing national importance.''
 In a response filed Sunday, Theodore B. Olson, representing proponents of same-sex marriage, said the case would affect hundreds of thousands of gay men and lesbians in California and thus warranted broadcast coverage. 
 ''Concerns about the possibility of compromised safety, witness intimidation or harassment of trial participants,'' Mr. Olson added, ''are utterly unsubstantiated and groundless speculation.''
 All of the witnesses said to fear harassment were paid experts named after Judge Walker first noted the possibility of broadcast coverage, Mr. Olson wrote, adding that the views of these experts were already well known.
 A coalition of news organizations also urged the Supreme Court not to grant a stay. Its brief noted that the case did not involve criminal fair-trial rights and would not be heard by a jury.
 ''Any witnesses will be testifying in open public court at the trial, with heavy accompanying publicity in the print and electronic media,'' Thomas R. Burke wrote for the news organizations. ''If the purported harms identified by petitioners exist at all, they will flow from the witnesses' mere participation in the trial.''

HEADLINE: High Energy Costs and Dollar's Decline Undermine Alcoa's Profit

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Alcoa, the aluminum producer, reported fourth-quarter profit on Monday that trailed analysts' estimates as the company faced higher energy and currency costs.
 The net loss of $277 million, or 28 cents a share, narrowed from a loss of $1.19 billion, or $1.49 a share, a year earlier, Alcoa said. Sales fell 4.5 percent, to $5.43 billion from $5.69 billion. 
 Excluding one-time items, Alcoa earned 1 cent a share, below analysts' estimates for earnings of 6 cents a share.
 Profit was hurt by higher energy prices and by the dollar's decline against the euro and the Brazilian real, a Deutsche Bank analyst, Jorge Beristain, said. 
 Alcoa's primary aluminum production rose 1.8 percent from the previous quarter, to 897,000 tons, and the company said it bought an additional 207,000 tons on the open market to satisfy purchase commitments.
 ''This quarter was disappointing, especially with the energy costs, and having to buy primary aluminum on the open market,'' said John Stephenson, an investment manager at First Asset Investment Management in Toronto. The miss on earnings was significant, he said.
 Alcoa, the first company in the Dow Jones industrial average to report results for the three months through December, fell 75 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $16.70 a share in after-hours trading. 
 Alcoa's sales benefited from aluminum prices that rose 18 percent in the quarter, to $2,230 a ton on the London Metal Exchange. The price Alcoa charged customers for the metal increased 9.3 percent from the previous quarter, the company said. 
 Revenue exceeded the $4.84 billion expected by analysts. 
 Alcoa, which is based in New York, cut about 21,500 jobs from June 2008 through December 2009 as the deteriorating global economy reduced demand for aluminum. 
 ''This was a tough year for the aluminum industry -- a price crash, demand destruction and credit crunch,'' the chief executive, Klaus Kleinfeld, said in the earnings statement. The company is ''facing continued headwinds from energy and currency costs.''

HEADLINE: Looking at Ways to Treat Depression

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Wrong Story About Depression'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 9): 
 Judith Warner is correct that antidepressants are frequently prescribed by primary-care doctors, often for the minor and moderate depressions referred to in the study getting recent media attention. 
 Depressions respond to psychotherapy. Ms. Warner is also correct that the effectiveness of this treatment very much depends on the individual practitioner. The practitioner can be a psychiatrist, a psychologist or a social worker. 
 The advantage of an evaluation by a well-trained psychiatrist is that the medical and drug-induced causes of depression can be better ruled out, and a judgment can be made whether the condition is of significant severity where the benefits of the addition of medication outweigh the risks. 
 Unfortunately, as with other fields, attempts to determine who are the best (performance measurements, published rankings, word of mouth) all have their flaws. There are many people suffering from severe depression, and we have to do a much better job ensuring that they get the best possible care.
 Jeffrey B. Freedman New York, Jan. 9, 2010
 The writer, a psychiatrist, is immediate past president of the New York County district branch of the American Psychiatric Association.
 To the Editor:
 I am one of those people referred to by Judith Warner who have been prescribing and studying antidepressants -- in my case, for 30 years. Every point made by Ms. Warner is dead-on:
 Antidepressants do work for people who are really depressed; they don't for people who aren't. Depression is frequently diagnosed in people who don't have it, and frequently not diagnosed in those who do. 
 Medications that work for depression are commonly misused, and types of psychotherapy that work for depression are commonly not used at all. The reasons for this state of affairs include mistrust of authority, stigma, big-stakes health care economics, cross-discipline rivalries and simplistic thinking (within the mental health care field as well as the general public). 
 The excesses of the media and the perverse incentives of our current health care delivery system make things worse. 
 I am, sadly, less hopeful than Ms. Warner that health care reform will help rectify things. I am more hopeful that advances in our understanding of depression itself will enable us to more accurately diagnose it, so that individuals in distress, whether from depression or other problems, get the help they actually need.
 Lawrence H. Price Providence, R.I., Jan. 9, 2010
 The writer, a psychiatrist, is professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University and clinical director and director of research at Butler Hospital.
 To the Editor:
 In her article about treatments for depression, Judith Warner cites a group of psychologists who said that ''relatively few psychologists learn or practice'' interventions that these researchers deemed ''effective.''
 Research since the 1970s has consistently established the effectiveness of psychotherapy for treatment of conditions like depression when the therapy is conducted by a highly trained person who holds to a philosophy of psychotherapy (the philosophy does not much matter, as long as the therapist has one).
 The more recent debate about ''evidence-based'' therapies is an old one in the psychological world, pitting our competent researchers against clinicians. 
 While researchers can investigate treatments in laboratory conditions, few clients fit into simple categories. Try applying an ''evidence-based treatment'' for a depressed, sexually abused child from a divorced family in which one parent is alcoholic and the child has a learning disability. Such clients do not tend to show up for laboratory studies and don't tend to respond to simple bromides.
 It is also untrue that psychologists do not learn about evidenced-based treatments. Nearly all psychologists in all states must take continuing education and are thereby exposed to the current research about psychological conditions and treatments. The best clinicians practice flexibility in approach, depending on the needs of their patients.
 James Brush Cincinnati, Jan. 9, 2010
 The writer, a child and adolescent psychologist, is a former president of the Ohio Psychological Association.
 To the Editor:
 The article by Judith Warner as well as the original study on depression are likely to do harm to many Americans with depression. For decades, it has been recognized that the recognition and treatment of depression require that primary-care physicians both screen for and, when appropriate, treat depression. This treatment may take many forms, including the use of pharmacologic agents. 
 Many of those who need treatment have no access to psychiatrists because of geographical distribution, restrictive insurance coverage, cost or a perceived stigma to being cared for by a psychiatrist. Thus, distortion or misinterpretation of the evidence about the treatment of depression will result in those who desperately need help not obtaining it.
 My colleagues and I spent many years in convincing family physicians and others that chronic depression is an important and treatable disease. Yes, some of the financing was from the pharmaceutical industry, but much of it came from federal agencies and others whose sole motivation was the health of the public. Because of this, we have made significant gains in the treatment of depression.

 Judith Warner hits the nail on the head: the more accurate story about mental health treatment is the lack of parity with the diagnosis and treatment of other illnesses like cancer, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. 
 People with emotional problems suffer stigma and are vulnerable to fragmented systems of care, and the pressure to prescribe as a quick fix for complex problems. Cost-effective, evidenced-based treatments in which judicious use of medication is combined with counseling reduce crippling symptoms and expand quality of life. 
 Whether or not we enable those with mental illness to recover dreams damaged by their disease remains an ethical challenge.

HEADLINE: Not All Ski Slopes Are Environmentally Equal, Study Concludes

BYLINE: By SINDYA N. BHANOO

 BODY:
Ski resorts are not as fun for the environment as they are for skiers. The damage to forested hills caused by the construction of ski slopes is obvious. Trees are cut down, ground is cleared, and the resulting slopes are maintained as the foundation for a yearly carpet of snow. 
 Some ski slopes, however, are more environmentally friendly than others, according to a new study. Cleared ski runs, where trees and other tall, woody plants are cut down to open skiing pathways, cause less damage to the natural ecosystem than graded ski runs, which are bulldozed, leaving little or no vegetation or shrubs. 
 ''Cleared slopes are actually more like forests than graded slopes,'' said Jennifer W. Burt, the lead author of the study, published in last month's issue of Ecological Applications. ''This was an unexpected result of our research,'' said Dr. Burt, who studied ski slope construction as part of her doctoral research. On cleared runs, seed banks are left intact, and small shrubs remain undamaged. Also left intact are the top layers of the soil, which support plant growth and more robust and diverse vegetation, which in turn support wildlife. 
 Machine-graded runs, on the other hand, remove topsoil and vegetation, significantly damaging the ecosystem. 
 Dr. Burt studied seven ski areas in and around the Lake Tahoe Basin, including Sugar Bowl, Heavenly, Kirkwood and Northstar-at-Tahoe, which all had both cleared and graded slopes. 
 Although she says she is the first to study graded and cleared slopes in the United States, a number of studies on ski slope ecology have been done in Europe. 
 European ski resorts, however, tend to be at higher elevations, where trees do not grow. 
 ''That's a very important distinction between U.S. ski resorts and the European ones,'' said Christian Rixen, an alpine ecosystem researcher at the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research. ''It's basically a question of forest or no forest.'' 
 In his work in Europe, Dr. Rixen also found that cleared runs cause less environmental damage, offering better growth opportunities to alpine tundra and other vegetation.
 When Dr. Burt asked resort managers why they create graded runs at all, she was told that they are smoother, which means less snow is needed to open a graded run than a comparable cleared run. On average, graded runs opened in the 2006-7 season a week earlier than cleared runs, Dr. Burt said. 
 ''I don't mind waiting a week or two if that's what it takes to have much reduced environmental impacts,'' said Dr. Burt, an avid skier herself. ''I think there are other skiers who would say the same.''
 A group called the Ski Area Citizen's Coalition, based in Colorado, maintains a Web site that grades ski resorts based on their impact on the environment. The group plans to incorporate the results from Dr. Burt's research into its grading system.
 While conservationists might argue against any kind of ski slope, Paul Joyce, the coalition's research director, pointed out that skiing has considerable economic benefits and offers millions of people a way to enjoy the outdoors. 
 However, he said, environmental interests are being sacrificed in favor of financial ones.
 ''In the last couple decades, it's turned into a giant moneymaking machine, and the Forest Service has become a party to this,'' Mr. Joyce said, referring to the fact that many ski resorts operate on United States Forest Service land. ''Skiers are out there enjoying the outdoors, often in harsh conditions, and we'd at least like to think of ourselves as green -- it's incumbent on the industry to make this the experience.''

HEADLINE: Losses at Landesbank May Bring Changes to Banking in Germany

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
Even in an era of bad banking deals, the case of Bayerische Landesbank, a bank based in Munich, stands out. 
 Its ill-fated attempt to expand in Eastern Europe has cost Bavarian taxpayers 3.7 billion euros ($5.4 billion). It has also led to a criminal investigation of the bank's former chief executive, which included the spectacle of Munich police and prosecutors raiding offices of an institution whose supervisory board is stacked with local politicians.
 The criminal investigation is a new twist in the troubled history of Germany's state-owned banks, but the sizable losses are not. Even before the most recent scandal, the Bayerische Landesbank, known as BayernLB, had required a taxpayer bailout equal to a quarter of the state's annual budget, in part caused by investments placed with banks in Iceland. 
 Taxpayers in Baden-Wurttemberg and Hamburg have also had to pump billions into their state-owned banks. In North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, WestLB in Dusseldorf needed 8 billion euros in government grants and loan guarantees to stay afloat after making disastrous investments that included derivatives tied to subprime mortgages in the United States.
 The Landesbank rescues -- reminiscent of the financial crises at American-backed lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae -- have placed a serious burden on German state governments already suffering from slumping tax revenue, as well as the federal government, which is helping to cover some losses. 
 ''They wasted billions that we could have spent on schools, police and streets,'' said Inge Aures, deputy chairwoman of a Landesbank oversight committee in the Bavarian legislature, referring to BayernLB. 
 But the problems of the Landesbanks could turn out to benefit the fragmented commercial banking sector, which has long struggled to produce global players. 
 Rivals, economists and European Union antitrust regulators have long complained that the state banks enjoy unfair advantages over commercial banks because they can raise money more cheaply, because of their implicit government backing. The public-sector institutions are a major reason Germany's big banks have the lowest profit margins, on average, in Western Europe, even though Germany is the largest economy. 
 Now, though, the Landesbanks are being forced to scale back operations to survive, creating more space for Deutsche Bank and other private-sector institutions. 
 ''The prospects for private banks will improve because the competition won't be as severe,'' said Dirk Schiereck, a professor of banking at the Technical University of Darmstadt. He estimates the Landesbanks will have to shrink their assets by half compared with 2008. 
 The German economics minister, Rainer Bruderle, told Der Tagesspiegel, the Berlin daily, in an interview published on Jan. 4 that the country needed only one Landesbank, rather than the seven it now has. But such severe consolidation is unlikely any time soon, because local politicians are reluctant to give up control over their Landesbanks, a potent source of influence in the local economy.
 There is also a risk that borrowing costs for companies could rise if there is less competition from the state banks -- one reason that politicians will resist privatizing the banks. However, they may be chastened enough by the recent losses to support mergers with other state-owned banks. 
 ''The political will to support mergers is higher than it has ever been,'' said Katharina Barten, a senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service, who added that she expected consolidation to take several years.
 The losses, however, are already forcing the banks to focus more on their main business -- lending to local companies. Landesbanks account for about a quarter of all commercial lending in Germany, more than Deutsche Bank and the other big private banks combined. 
 In recent years, institutions like BayernLB and WestLB opened branches overseas and moved into investment banking, with disastrous results. ''Those times are over,'' said Peter Altmiks, an economist at the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, a research group in Potsdam with ties to the pro-business FDP party. ''The majority of state governments have no ambitions to build these big banks anymore.''
 Commercial bankers say the state-supported banks have an unfair advantage because they face less pressure to be profitable and, with the state as owners, enjoy better credit ratings than their balance sheets would normally justify. 
 While conceding that some reforms are needed, Landesbank representatives argue that the institutions are essential, especially in hard times, because they provide capital to the midsize companies that drive the German economy. ''One Landesbank wouldn't be enough,'' said Stephan Rabe, a spokesman for the Association of German Public Sector Banks. Advocates also point out that private-sector institutions like Hypo Real Estate Holding and Commerzbank have required government aid.
 Pressure on the Landesbanks is also coming from European Union antitrust authorities. Regulators set harsh terms in return for approving a rescue plan for WestLB, obligating the bank to unload risky assets and cut its balance sheet in half to about 140 billion euros. 
 The state of North-Rhine Westphalia and other shareholders in WestLB, once Germany's largest public-sector bank with offices around the world, must also sell the bank to another Landesbank or a private-sector institution by the end of 2011, meaning it will cease to exist as an independent institution. And the bank must give up high-risk activities like using its own capital to trade in securities markets.
 The European Commission is not opposed to public ownership of banks in principle, said Jonathan Todd, a spokesman for Neelie Kroes, the European competition commissioner. ''Our concern is that the banks should be viable without further injections of public money,'' he said.
 Mr. Bruderle's call for Landesbank consolidation came amid new accusations involving BayernLB and its 2007 acquisition of the Hypo Group Alpe Adria, an Austrian institution with holdings in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and other countries in Eastern Europe. 
 The Munich prosecutor's office has confirmed that it is investigating possible fraud charges against the former Landesbank chief executive, Werner Schmidt, in connection with the price paid for Alpe Adria. Mr. Schmidt was forced out in early 2008. In October, about 100 law enforcement authorities seized documents during a raid of Landesbank offices in Munich.
 BayernLB has since given away Alpe Adria to the Austrian government, at a total loss to Bavarian taxpayers of 3.7 billion euros. That was on top of 10 billion euros in government aid BayernLB received to cover losses from bad securities investments.
 Though the disaster at BayernLB is ''really a tragedy,'' Mr. Altmiks of the Naumann Institute said, the case has revived a much-needed debate about the Landesbanks. ''It's now on the agenda again,'' he said.

HEADLINE: With New Attacks, Afghan War No Longer Pauses for Winter

BYLINE: By ROD NORDLAND; Reporting was contributed by Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan; Sangar Rahimi from Kabul; employees of The New York Times from Jalalabad and Helmand Province; and Nadim Audi from Paris.

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
Afghanistan's high mountains and harsh weather once meant that winter was a respite from much of the war's violence, but as the deaths of six Western soldiers in three separate attacks on Monday show, this winter is proving to be different.
 American military leaders and Taliban commanders are vowing to carry the fight to each other and skip the traditional winter vacation, and there is every sign that they are doing just that. 
 Though the trend has been building, in past years, the Taliban generally slipped off to sanctuaries in Pakistan, or just stayed home, while NATO forces enjoyed a drop in attacks and a steep decline in the body count from December through March. 
 A combination of factors has changed that. American troop levels nearly doubled in 2009, meaning more missions against the Taliban -- and more potential targets for them. Military crackdowns by Pakistan along the border have in some places made it harder for insurgents to flee there. 
 The Taliban have in any case consolidated their hold over large parts of southern Afghanistan and have less need to fall back than in previous years. Seeking to make a political point, they have also stepped up the frequency of their attacks and are now using methods like improvised explosive devices and suicide bomb attacks that are less affected by the weather.
 Both sides seem determined to make a larger political point by continuing to fight through the snow season. As Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the senior commander in Afghanistan, said in his report to President Obama in August, the Americans need to show that ''it is not a cyclical kinetic campaign based on a set 'fighting season'; rather it is a continuous yearlong effort'' to help the Afghan government win the support of people.
 The Taliban hope to undermine support for the war in Western countries before more American forces can arrive this year. 
 What happens in the winter ''shouldn't say much about the ability of the reinforcements, since most units won't arrive until spring and summer,'' said James Dobbins, an Afghan expert with the RAND Corporation. 
 ''If the situation seems to be getting worse and worse,'' he said, ''it may change public opinion even though it shouldn't, especially in countries where the war is more unpopular.'' 
 On Monday afternoon, three Americans were killed in a firefight in southern Afghanistan, according to a statement by NATO's International Security Assistance Force, which gave no further details.
 A Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousuf Ahmadi, reached by telephone, claimed that the Americans had been killed in an ambush in the Shah Wali Kot district in Kandahar Province by a single insurgent named Sardar Muhammad. Mr. Ahmadi said the insurgent hid along a path used by an American foot patrol in the heavily mountainous area, and then fired on the troops with an AK-47 automatic rifle. He claimed that Mr. Muhammad killed five American soldiers before the others returned fire and killed him. 
 The military also said that a member of the international forces was killed in southern Afghanistan by an improvised explosive device on Monday. And coalition forces reported that two service members were killed in eastern Afghanistan on Monday, without specifying nationalities. 
 Separately, the French government confirmed that at least one of its soldiers was killed and another badly wounded in what was apparently the same episode. 
 Rear Adm. Gregory J. Smith, a spokesman for the coalition forces, said winter had not slowed the war much this time. Insurgent activity has stayed at the level it reached in September, when attacks spiked in response to new troop arrivals. ''We don't look at the winter as a time when our activity is less; we intend to keep the tempo up,'' he said.
 Admiral Smith said the increase in deaths among coalition forces was due to an increase in troop numbers and a resulting increase in contact with enemy forces. Overall coalition fatalities rose from 295 in 2008 to 520 in 2009, according to icasualties.org, an independent organization that tracks military casualties. 
 Coalition forces are logging 500 violent encounters with insurgents every week, Admiral Smith said, an increase of 20 percent over the same time in 2008.
 ''The difference is we have more forces operating in more places'' where insurgents have long had sanctuaries, he said.
 The Taliban commander in Kandahar Province, Hafizullah Hafi, struck a similar note in a telephone interview. ''We are staying in the winter,'' he said. ''We have more fighters than they do, and they should not think that we are weak and we will not retreat in the winter.''
 Gen. Shir Muhammad Zazai, the corps commander of the Afghan National Army in Kandahar, maintained that Taliban attacks had actually decreased against Afghan forces -- though not against the Americans.
 ''This year, winter is the safest time for us,'' General Zazai said. ''It is calm. Incidents against Americans, though, are not calm. Against the Americans it's strange. It looks like the Taliban are staying to target the Americans and show that they are not weak and disappearing.'' 
 The spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense, Gen. Zahir Azimi, said it only seemed as if the Taliban were more active this winter because they were relying much more on improvised explosive devices, known as I.E.D.'s, and other tactics, rather than on carrying out offensives as they had in previous years.
 ''Two years ago they changed their tactics; now they're mostly resorting to roadside mines, I.E.D.'s, suicide attacks, guerrilla attacks like in Logar and the U.N. guesthouse,'' General Azimi said.
 He was referring to an attack by suicide bombers and gunmen on provincial headquarters in Logar Province south of Kabul, which killed six Afghan officials in August, and a raid on a United Nations house in Kabul, which killed five of the organization's staff members on Oct. 28.
 ''These sorts of attacks don't require a certain time or a certain season,'' he said. ''The winter helps them for planting I.E.D.'s; they just have to plant explosives in the snow.'' 
 Over the past year, more than 60 percent of all fatalities of allied troops were from these explosive devices, compared with 42 percent in 2007, according to data from icasualties.org.
 According to the Brookings Institution's Afghanistan Index, NATO fatalities dropped into the single digits in the winter, as did Afghan civilian casualties, in every year from 2001 to 2008. 
 Last December, though, American fatalities were six times as high as in the previous December, and coalition fatalities over all were up 29 percent.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Museum Taps Dealer as Director

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL and RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
After days of relentless rumors, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles confirmed on Monday that it had chosen Jeffrey Deitch, a veteran commercial dealer and deal maker, to be its new director, a straddling of the gallery and museum worlds that has few precedents.
 Mr. Deitch, 57, who also has extensive business credentials -- he has a Harvard M.B.A. and helped found Citibank's art advisory and art finance programs -- will take over a highly respected 30-year-old institution that found itself teetering on the brink of bankruptcy in 2008. Eli Broad, the billionaire collector and arts patron, bailed it out with a $30 million gift. 
 As part of that bailout, the museum's director, Jeremy Strick, resigned in December 2008. Mr. Broad, who was the chairman of the museum's board at its founding, said at the time he would not play a part in the museum's hiring of a new director, but he ended up serving on the search committee. And people in the art world who were informed about the selection process, but spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of alienating Mr. Broad, said he was deeply involved, seeking the advice of dealers and auction house executives, as well as artists, in consultation with the museum's board and advisers.
 Some other candidates who were said to be in serious contention for the job also came from outside the worlds of museums or academia, including Tobias Meyer, who runs Sotheby's contemporary art department worldwide and is its principal auctioneer, and Samuel Keller, the international art fair impresario, signaling that the search committee was seeking to shake up the usual model for museum leadership.
 In a brief interview on Monday, Mr. Deitch said: ''I feel as if I've been training for this position my entire life. I've always considered myself part of the whole field, because I've worked in museums.'' Most recently he wrote the strategic plan for the Mori Art Center in Tokyo, he said, adding that he ran his New York gallery, Deitch Projects, ''like an art center, with historic exhibitions where only minor things were for sale'' and helped create ambitious projects, like a recent floating installation by the street artist Swoon that he called ''practically unsalable.''
 By the time he formally takes over the museum on June 1, he said, he will have ceased all of his commercial activities and will have closed his gallery.
 In announcing the selection, Mr. Broad sought to distinguish Mr. Deitch from other commercial gallery owners. ''He's hardly a dealer like Larry Gagosian,'' he said, referring to the gallery owner widely considered one of the most successful in the world. ''Jeffrey's done national and international exhibitions. It was always clear he was never in it just for the money.''
 Mr. Broad added: ''It's time to redo the old museum model. The world has changed.''
 Since news of the selection began leaking last week, reaction in the art world has been widely varied. ''People are stunned -- no one saw this coming,'' said Steven P. Henry, director of the Paula Cooper Gallery in New York. ''They've made a risky choice. Jeffrey is someone with great enthusiasm and a lot of creative energy, but he's got a big learning curve.''
 But Ford W. Bell, president of the American Association of Museums, greeted the announcement with cautious optimism. 
 ''It's an interesting choice,'' Mr. Bell said. ''The key is: Can he run the institution and does he know the art? And we know he knows the art. He may need to win over some skeptics in the Los Angeles area and in the art world. But if he turns MOCA around and makes it back into the vital institution it has been for many years, he will be hailed as a hero.''
 Mr. Bell echoed Mr. Broad's view that the nonprofit museum world is a vastly more complicated place than it once was and that museum leaders must have much greater financial acumen.
 Mr. Deitch, who founded his gallery in 1996 and has an extensive personal art collection, has long worked as a private dealer and had a short stint at Sotheby's, managing its 20th-Century Art Gallery Program. In the 1990s he began a hugely ambitious project with Jeff Koons to create a series of stainless-steel sculptures whose fabrication costs almost led Mr. Deitch to financial ruin over the next 10 years. In 1997 Sotheby's came to his rescue by buying a half interest in his gallery, an arrangement that eventually came to an end.
 His skills at attracting and managing money will be needed as never before at the Museum of Contemporary Art. In 2008 the museum's endowment, which had been repeatedly tapped to pay for operating expenses, shrank to about $6 million, one of the lowest levels since the museum's founding, from $40 million at its height.
 As the economy eroded and the situation worsened, the museum considered joint ventures or mergers with several other Los Angeles institutions before Mr. Broad stepped in. In the year since the bailout, along with Mr. Broad's money, the museum has been able to raise $64 million toward a goal of $75 million.

HEADLINE: McDonald's Names U.S. Chief as Its No. 2 Executive

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
McDonald's, the fast-food company, said on Monday that it had promoted Don Thompson, the head of its United States division, to become its No. 2 executive. 
 Mr. Thompson succeeds Ralph Alvarez, who retired unexpectedly last month, citing health concerns. Like Mr. Alvarez, Mr. Thompson will have the dual titles of president and chief operating officer. 
 He becomes the third person to hold the No. 2 post at McDonald's since 2004, when the company lost two chief executives to fatal illnesses. Since then the company has stressed the importance of succession planning, and the No. 2 executive has been widely viewed as a chief executive in waiting.
 James A. Skinner, the chief executive, said Mr. Thompson would oversee operations at McDonald's nearly 32,000 restaurants worldwide. The company operates in more than 117 countries.
 Despite the importance of its international markets -- revenue from outside the United States made up nearly two-thirds of the company's total of $23.5 billion in 2008 -- a company press release and profile of Mr. Thompson showed little evidence of foreign experience. 
 Walt Riker, a company spokesman, said that Mr. Thompson had worked with the company's international restaurants when he was executive vice president of restaurant systems in 2004, a job that included involvement with such things as modernized drive-throughs, new cooking systems, cashless payment systems and new menu items. 
 McDonald's has a long history of choosing its top executives from within.
 Mr. Thompson, 46, started working at McDonald's in 1990 as an electrical engineer in the restaurant systems group. He then moved into restaurant operations and rose to executive posts in its West and Midwest divisions. In 2006 he was named president of the company's United States division, when Mr. Alvarez was promoted from that post to the No. 2 spot.
 Mr. Alvarez's predecessor, Michael J. Roberts, also left the company abruptly, reportedly over frustrations that Mr. Skinner, who became chief executive in 2004, had failed to step down as quickly as anticipated.
 McDonald's has been a success story during the global recession, reporting strong sales and generally outperforming its fast-food rivals. Possible signs of weakness began to show in the United States business late last year, however. Same-store sales in the United States for the month of November were down 0.6 percent compared with the same period the previous year, the company reported. But year-to-date same-store sales for the period that ended Nov. 30 were up 2.8 percent in the United States and 3.9 percent companywide.
 The company also announced on Monday that Jan Fields would succeed Mr. Thompson as president of its United States division. Ms. Fields had previously been the executive vice president in the division.

HEADLINE: President Signals Flexibility on Health Plan Tax

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and STEVEN GREENHOUSE; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama told union leaders at a private White House meeting on Monday that he remained committed to taxing high-cost insurance policies as a way to drive down health costs. But he also signaled that he was willing to amend the proposal to ''make this work for working families,'' a senior administration official said.
 The excise tax is a major point of contention as White House and Congressional negotiators seek agreement on a final version of a sweeping bill that would extend health coverage to more than 30 million Americans. The Senate version of the bill includes such a tax on employer-sponsored health benefits; the House version does not. Union leaders deeply oppose the tax. 
 Mr. Obama's remarks, at an hourlong session with a dozen labor leaders in the White House Roosevelt Room, came just hours after the new president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Richard L. Trumka, delivered a speech at the National Press Club in which he criticized the tax as a ''policy that benefits elites'' and warned that Democrats would pay a price at the polls if it was enacted. 
 Privately, Mr. Obama and the union officials used Monday's session to search for a sort of compromise, said a union leader who was briefed on the discussion. This official, who said the tone of the meeting was friendly, said it was clear that there would be some sort of excise tax in the final bill, but that the president ''threw out some new concepts'' in how it might be designed.
 The 40 percent excise tax would apply to any cost above $8,500 for individual policies and $23,000 for family plans; the Congressional Budget Office has estimated it would generate $149 billion in tax revenues over 10 years, which would help Mr. Obama meet his goal of passing a health bill that does not add to the federal deficit.
 According to one union survey, the tax would affect one in four union members. Some union officials, resigned to the likelihood that a final measure would include the tax, are pressing the White House to raise the thresholds at which it would kick in.
 Until now, Mr. Obama has taken a relatively hands-off approach to the specifics of the health care bill, instead leaving them to Congress. But last week, in a meeting with House leaders, he made clear his support for the excise tax, which many economists regard as an important way to bring down health care costs. The senior administration official, who insisted on anonymity to describe a private conversation, said Mr. Obama made that point at Monday's session.
 ''It was a frank conversation about the excise tax,'' the official said, adding, ''The president was very clear that he thinks this is a critical part of bringing down costs in the long term and bending the curve.''
 But in delving into the nitty-gritty of health care negotiations for the first time, Mr. Obama risks alienating members of the labor movement, who worked hard to elect him. 
 The machinists' union announced Monday that its executive council had unanimously voted to oppose any health bill that was financed by taxing the value of workers' existing health plans, and the general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, Harold A. Schaitberger, accused Mr. Obama of abandoning his campaign promise not to tax the middle class. 
 ''We held President Bush accountable when he made decisions that had a negative impact on our members' jobs and lives,'' Mr. Schaitberger, who did not attend the White House session, said in a statement. ''We will do the same with President Obama.''
 Mr. Trumka and other union leaders said before Monday's meeting that they intended to tell Mr. Obama that the tax would be economically and politically unwise. The union officials support a tax approved by the House: a surcharge on couples earning more than $1 million a year. 
 Several centrist Democrats have voiced discomfort with increasing taxes on wealthier taxpayers. But Mr. Trumka showed little sympathy for their view in his National Press Club speech.
 ''Instead of taxing the rich, the Senate bill taxes the middle class by taxing workers' health plans -- not just union members' health care,'' Mr. Trumka said. ''Most of the 31 million insured employees who would be hit by the excise tax are not union members.''
 On Capitol Hill, some House Democrats agreed. Representative Joe Courtney, Democrat of Connecticut, who has been leading opposition to the tax on high-cost health plans, said he did not see any path to imminent compromise. 
 ''Proponents of the tax minimize the scope of its impact,'' Mr. Courtney said. ''This is a larger issue than unions. This proposal has a much wider reach than the proponents ever acknowledge.''
 At a recent town-hall-style meeting in East Lyme, Conn., Mr. Courtney said, ''there was not a union person in the audience,'' but people were fired up with concern over the issue. 
 Mr. Courtney said raising the thresholds would not be enough to meet his concerns. Under the Senate bill, the thresholds would rise with inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index, plus one percentage point -- substantially less than the expected rise in health spending and insurance premiums.
 Lifting thresholds ''would not eliminate the flaw in the design of the tax,'' Mr. Courtney said. ''The tax would pick up more and more health plans.''

HEADLINE: A Future That Doesn't Guzzle

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
About 98 percent of the vehicles sold in the United States last year were powered by conventional gasoline engines, and hybrids occupied just a tiny niche. 
 But at the opening Monday of the big Detroit auto show, the internal-combustion engine seemed almost passe.
 The world's automakers unveiled a number of hybrid gas-electric and battery-powered models, several of which might not be available for years to come. 
 It is a telling sign of how much emphasis that car companies are placing on the electrification of vehicles -- even though consumers have yet to show widespread interest in alternatives to gas engines.
 ''Green technologies are the master key to the future of the automobile,'' said Thomas Weber, the head of research and development at Mercedes-Benz, which plans to deliver the first 200 of its B-Class F-Cell electric cars to customers in the United States and Europe this year.
 The focus on electric and hybrid cars is about more than just a desire to reduce oil dependency and help the environment, though those are the benefits that automakers cite as they unveil the new models. They also will help the automakers meet future emission regulations. ''The manufacturers have to play this game,'' said James Bell, executive market analyst for Kelley Blue Book. 
 The new standards, enacted last year by the Obama administration, require automakers' fleets to achieve 35.5 miles a gallon by 2016, up from 27.5 miles a gallon today.
 While automakers have to make vehicles that meet the more stringent regulations, consumers have shown little interest in buying them, aside from the brief period last year when gasoline prices spiked to more than $4 a gallon and hybrids were in short supply.
 ''Hybrids are less than 3 percent of the market, and they've been less than 3 percent for years,'' said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst with the research firm IHS Global Insight. ''The idea that people are going to immediately accept electric vehicles when hybrids are such a small part of the market is sort of dangerous.''
 Still, so many battery-powered cars are at the show that a section of this year's show floor, called ''Electric Avenue,'' was set aside for them. 
 The vehicles on display include the forthcoming Nissan Leaf -- the only model Nissan brought to Detroit -- and the 39-inch-wide Tango, priced at $85,000, from a company called Commuter Cars.
 Toyota, the leader in the current hybrid market, said on Monday that it would create a family of hybrids that would carry the name of its Prius sedan. It showed off a concept version of a car smaller than today's Prius, which it called the FT-CH, which could be part of that lineup.
 James E. Lentz, the president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., said the company planned to introduce hybrid powertrains across much of its lineup and thought that hybrids ''will become the core technology of the entire industry.''
 Honda, which is trying to better compete with Toyota in hybrids, introduced the CR-Z coupe, which will arrive at dealerships in several months.
 ''This vehicle is reflecting our efforts to make a hybrid car that is both fun to drive and also has very good fuel economy,'' Takanobu Ito, the Honda president, said. He also said that Honda's Acura luxury division would develop a hybrid model.
 Although most automakers have some type of electric or hybrid vehicle on the way, their strategies differ. General Motors is betting on its Chevrolet Volt, which is powered by batteries and has a small gasoline engine to extend the car's range.
 European carmakers are working on numerous electric-only cars, while Toyota and Honda are focusing on hybrids. The Ford Motor Company plans to build an electric version of its compact sedan, the Focus, starting in 2011.
 ''We don't know what the market is going to be for electric vehicles,'' William C. Ford Jr., Ford's executive chairman, said. ''A lot will depend on the ability of people to charge them at home, at work, at the mall. But we will be ready for the demand whatever it is, whether it becomes 10 percent of the market or 90 percent.''
 Robert A. Lutz, a vice chairman at G.M., said the company did not think pure electric cars were best in the United States in the near future, because drivers often traveled beyond the range of those cars.
 G.M. hopes consumers who want to drive on battery power for their daily commute, but have the ability to go longer distances, will be attracted to the Volt. The initial cost of the Volt -- an estimated $40,000, partly because of the range-extending technology -- could keep away some consumers.
 ''It's going to take us three generations of range-extended electric vehicles to get any anywhere near reasonable costs,'' said Thomas Stephens, G.M.'s vice chairman for product development. ''But if we're going to have to be ready for the demand in 2020, we have to be out there by 2010 with the first generation.''

HEADLINE: Heineken in Deal to Buy A Big Mexican Brewer

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED and CHRIS V. NICHOLSON; Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Heineken said Monday that it would buy the beer operations of Femsa, one of the biggest brewers in Mexico, in an all-share transaction that values the business at $7.6 billion. The move would further consolidate the beer industry into a few global players. 
 The move will make Heineken a ''more competitive player in Latin America, one of the world's most profitable and fastest-growing beer markets,'' the chairman and chief executive of Heineken, Jean-Francois van Boxmeer, said in a statement.
 Heineken will issue 86 million new shares to finance the deal, the first time it has done so for a takeover since 1968. 
 Heineken shares were up 1.075 euros, or 3.26 percent, to 34 euros on the Amsterdam exchange.
 After the deal closes, Femsa will hold 20 percent of the Heineken Group, making it one of the Dutch brewer's largest shareholders. Femsa will also have the right to appoint two nonexecutive directors. The transaction is expected be completed in the second quarter of 2010.
 Femsa, which is formally known as Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B., makes Dos Equis and Tecate. 
 ''It's a transformational deal for Heineken,'' said Marco Gulpers, beverage analyst at ING. ''We were expecting a deal north of $10 billion. The way they structured it, this is creating more value.''
 Over the last decade, companies in the beer industry have combined rapidly.
 One of the most notable deals included the 2002 sale of Miller Brewing of the United States to South African Breweries for $3.6 billion.
 Against the backdrop of ''the reconfiguration of the global brewing landscape, scale and geographic diversification are more important than ever,'' Jose Antonio Fernandez Carbajal, chairman and chief executive of Femsa, said in a statement Monday.
 Besides giving Heineken a bigger foothold in Latin America, especially the highly profitable Mexican market, the deal with Femsa also offers Heineken the 83 percent of Femsa's Brazilian beer business that the Dutch company does not already own.
 Femsa's share of the Mexican beer market is 43 percent; it has a 9 percent share in Brazil.
 For Femsa, merging with Heineken could help bolster its competitive position, especially as it continues to battle its larger Mexican rival, Grupo Modelo, in which AB InBev has a noncontrolling 50 percent stake. AB InBev is also strongly positioned in Brazil.
 About a quarter of Femsa's revenue in 2008 of 168 billion Mexican pesos ($13.3 billion) came from its beer operations. The company posted about $1.6 billion in operating profit that year.
 Heineken said in its statement that it expected the transaction would provide cost savings of 150 million euros ($218 million) a year, within three years.

HEADLINE: Fox Woos Conan O'Brien Despite NBC's Contract

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif. 

 BODY:
The dance between the Fox network and NBC's disaffected late-night host, Conan O'Brien, got livelier Monday when Kevin Reilly, the president of Fox Entertainment, spelled out in some detail how interested Fox would be in starting a late-night show starring Mr. O'Brien -- provided he found a way to extricate himself from his NBC contract.
 That could prove to be a difficult extraction, at least as some senior NBC executives see it. Despite the fact that Mr. O'Brien is being ejected from the 11:35 p.m. time period he was given in June and pushed to after midnight to make room for Jay Leno, NBC executives are expressing confidence that the network has not breached Mr. O'Brien's contract. 
 The reason? The contract, NBC is arguing, guaranteed Mr. O'Brien would be installed as host of ''The Tonight Show'' -- and unlike many other deals for late-night stars, Mr. O'Brien's contract contains no specific language about the time period the show would occupy, NBC executives said. NBC has said Mr. O'Brien's relocated show would be called ''The Tonight Show.''
 The contractual terms could affect Fox's pursuit of Mr. O'Brien in several ways. Mr. Reilly acknowledged that even if Mr. O'Brien found a home at Fox, NBC could insist that it had the right to keep Mr. O'Brien from starting a show for an extended period of time -- as long as a year or more.
 Mr. O'Brien's side has a different interpretation of whether NBC's actions constitute a breach; but both sides predicted that the issue would not end up in a legal battle. ''Nobody has the stomach for that,'' said a senior NBC executive, who asked not to be identified because of the unsettled contractual situation.
 Mr. Reilly said that he could not speak to any of the contractual issues that Mr. O'Brien may face. He said it was up to Mr. O'Brien to ''make the decision about his future.'' 
 That would surely mean accepting some financial loss, Mr. Reilly said, because any deal with Fox would not approach what Mr. O'Brien would still be owed under the terms of his NBC deal.
 How much that is may itself be the subject of some dispute. The senior NBC executive said that Mr. O'Brien would no longer be owed any of the $45 million that NBC had agreed to pay him as a penalty in case he never got a chance to host ''The Tonight Show.'' That would leave the cost for NBC as whatever amount was agreed to as a settlement of the contract.
 The NBC executive said that Mr. O'Brien was making considerably less than the $20 million a year previously reported and put the figure at ''closer to $10 million a year than $20 million.''
 Mr. Reilly said that Fox had spoken only briefly about the issue with Mr. O'Brien's representatives at the William Morris Endeavor agency, and that was mostly ''about commiserating'' over Mr. O'Brien's situation. (Mr. Reilly himself knows about being elbowed aside by NBC. Soon after signing a contract with that network in 2007, he was replaced as president of entertainment.)
 But Mr. Reilly strongly endorsed Mr. O'Brien.
 ''He would be a very compatible fit for our brand,'' he said. ''He is one of the few guys on the planet that has demonstrated he can do one of these shows every night.'' He added that building a successful late-night franchise, especially from scratch, ''is probably the hardest form in show business.'' 
 Mr. Reilly disputed the notion that Mr. O'Brien's reputation might have suffered from NBC's apparent conclusion that his ratings on ''The Tonight Show'' were unimpressive.
 ''I don't think he is damaged goods in the least,'' Mr. Reilly said. ''I think his show is working.'' 
 Several NBC executives suggested Fox might be more interested in tweaking NBC than seriously pursuing Mr. O'Brien, citing the costs of starting a late-night franchise -- which the NBC executive estimated at $70 million -- and issues the network might have with getting its local affiliates to give up lucrative syndicated programs, like reruns of ''Seinfeld,'' to make room.
 Mr. Reilly said the cost estimate sounded correct and acknowledged the affiliate question might be a thorny one. He confirmed that Fox retained the right in its affiliation agreements to start a late-night show and have all its stations carry it.
 ''But the affiliates are just coming through a very challenging business cycle,'' he said. ''They have gotten hit very hard by the recession so we're not going to be cavalier about this in the least.''

HEADLINE: China Rises Above Recession, Inviting Scrutiny

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
As much of the world struggles to clamber out of a serious recession, a gradual flow of economic power from West to East has turned into a flood.
 New high points, it seems, are reached daily. China surged past the United States to become the world's largest automobile market -- in units, if not in dollars, figures released Monday show. It also toppled Germany as the biggest exporter of manufactured goods, according to year-end trade data. World Bank estimates suggest that China -- the world's fifth-largest economy four years ago -- will shortly overtake Japan to claim the No. 2 spot.
 The shift of economic gravity to China has occurred partly because growth here remained robust even as the world's developed economies suffered the steepest drop in trade and economic output in decades. 
 But that did not happen by chance: China's decisive government intervention in the economy, combined with the defiant optimism of its companies and consumers, has propelled an economy that until recently had seemed tethered to the health of its major export markets, including the United States. 
 Beijing's state-run news media, indulging in a moment of self-congratulation, have hailed China's new economic prominence as proof of national superiority. 
 The country's economic miracle, the newspaper People's Daily boasted last week, exists because its leaders -- unlike those in other, unnamed nations -- can make quick decisions and ensure underlings carry them out. The Great Recession, the newspaper said, has laid bare cracks in plodding Western-style capitalism.
 Yet China confronts a number of challenges about its recent surge, including whether its formula for growth is sustainable, and how it will manage its increasingly strained economic relations with the outside world. Those are likely to prove challenging issues for a leadership unaccustomed to making policy under an international spotlight. 
 Sustaining a global-size economy is nowhere near as simple as building one, some Chinese and Western economists say. As the Chinese navigate toward a bigger role in the world financial system, they are already running into diplomatic and political headwinds.
 At home, ordinary citizens and economists alike worry that the government's decision to flood the economy with cash has created speculative bubbles -- in housing, in lending -- that could burst with disastrous effect. But curbing speculation requires moves, such as raising interest rates, that could crimp the sprees of investment and industrial expansion that are the main contributors to growth. 
 Abroad, the pressure on China to revalue its currency, the renminbi, is strengthening, and it seems sure to intensify after trade statistics released Sunday showed that China's yearlong downturn in export growth reversed in December. Keeping the renminbi fixed at a low rate against the dollar boosts China's exports and its economy. But increasingly, it angers its trade partners. 
 China once could wave off complaints about its currency policies, arguing that it was a developing nation entitled to a bit of slack from its Western customers. But with the world's fastest-growing economy -- and more than $2 trillion in foreign reserves -- that argument looks increasingly untenable. 
 ''At a time when you've got 10 percent unemployment in the U.S. and a very slow and gradual global recovery -- and China seems to be skyrocketing -- the pressure on the Chinese to change some of these policies, including the exchange-rate policy, is really going to grow this year,'' said Nicholas Consonery, a China analyst at Eurasia Group, a New York-based political risk research firm.
 In theory, China's growing economic clout should benefit everyone: in an interconnected world, growing trade creates jobs and money everywhere. 
 ''China's extremely important, no doubt about it. And over all, the more important China becomes, the better it is for the American economy,'' Scott Kennedy, who heads the Research Center for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University, said in an interview. 
 That Shanghai-assembled iPod, Mr. Kennedy said, is the product of American research and design and marketing, and most of the proceeds from its sale go back into American coffers. But China's rise also poses new risks both for Beijing and for its trading partners. 
 Its largely bruise-free journey through last year's economic crisis aside, not everyone is convinced that Beijing has eliminated threats to its financial and economic health. 
 Hit hard by an initial drop in exports that was frighteningly steep for a leadership that has long promised and delivered fast growth, China poured $585 billion in stimulus money into its domestic economy. Officials also ordered state-run banks to increase their lending by double that amount, triggering a spree of easy money that created jobs for migrant factory workers and fueled rises in the price of assets, like stocks and real estate.
 Some experts fear that too much of the stimulus money was put into unprofitable projects and bad loans that will be exposed in a few years. In that view, China's 2009 boom, in which automakers sold nearly 14 million cars and trucks, and housing prices doubled, is really a sign of an overheated economy at risk of serious recession down the road.
 Judged by the numbers, China's economy still looks robust. In Beijing, officials said, per capita gross domestic product is expected to exceed $4,000 this year, a 10 percent jump from 2009. Last month, the value of China's exports leaped by nearly a third over the same month in 2008 -- and imports jumped 55 percent, pointing toward growth in manufacturing.
 But a Chinese economic crisis, which could have been shrugged off a few years ago, would be a considerably more serious event in a world in which Beijing runs the second-largest economy.
 The government appears concerned. Last week, the central bank edged up the rate on an often-watched interbank loan, the first such hike in five months. That seemed to signal concern that the economy was expanding too quickly.
 Many experts see few signs of immediate danger. After all, they note, China has gone on splurges before -- building too many steel mills, and too many office buildings -- only to see the nation's breakneck growth sop up the excess capacity. With nearly a billion people still clawing to advance beyond peasant status, they say, China's growth story has many chapters ahead. 
 Mr. Kennedy, the Indiana University expert, said he was less certain that endless growth is such a panacea. ''No one defies economic laws,'' he said. ''Eventually you get it, whether you want it or not.''

HEADLINE: It Isn't Working for Anyone Else

 BODY:
China's economic strategy over the past two decades has been remarkably successful. By opening its doors to foreign investment and manipulating currency markets to keep the renminbi from rising against the dollar, it hitched itself to consumers in the industrial world and achieved spectacular growth. 
 While the strategy is still working for China, it is exacerbating economic weakness around the globe. If China keeps it up, other countries are likely to use their last available weapon -- protectionism -- to stop the onslaught of artificially cheap Chinese goods. A trade war is easy to start and hard to contain. It could hit everybody's exports, disrupting growth everywhere. 
 As China has flooded the world with exports, it has edged out suppliers from other developing countries. This was bad enough when the world economy was growing briskly. 
 Now China's strategy is doing considerably more harm. In many countries, fiscal stimulus efforts have been weakened by inflows of cheap Chinese imports that have soaked up some of the money added by these government programs.
 With global demand flagging, the Chinese government has manipulated its currency, the renminbi, even more aggressively. After having allowed the renminbi to appreciate gradually against the dollar for three years, in the summer of 2008 China re-established a hard peg, ensuring that the renminbi followed the dollar as the American currency fell against the euro and the yen. That has put enormous pressure on the economies of Europe and Japan. 
 If China continues its beggar-thy-neighbor currency policy, it will make it even harder for countries and the global economy to revive. As overextended governments wind down their fiscal stimulus, many economies will have to rely on exports as a crucial source of demand while their consumers restructure their sorry personal finances. 
 This task is made much more difficult if China is flooding the world with cheap goods. China's exports rebounded sharply in December after more than a year of decline. Its trade surplus -- after falling last year -- is expected to rebound sharply in 2010. 
 There are healthier strategies for China to follow. In particular, it could deploy some of its mountainous reserves at home to pay for long-neglected social spending: on health care, education and pensions. This would provide substantial economic stimulus and improve the lives of its people. 
 If it sticks to its cheap-renminbi guns, however, it is bound to draw a protectionist response. The Obama administration already has caved to political demands and slapped exceptional tariffs on Chinese tires and antidumping duties on steel pipes. Congress has been uncharacteristically quiet, but patience is wearing thin in Washington and everywhere. 
 India has filed a stack of trade complaints against China. And the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum recently urged the adoption of ''market-oriented exchange rates'' for Asian currencies, a reference to China's manipulation. 
 A trade war with China would be disastrous and bound to escalate around the world. Restraint is needed. But we fear no one is going to feel restrained if China doesn't change its strategy.

HEADLINE: States Lower Test Standards For Diploma

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

 BODY:
A law adopting statewide high school exams for graduation took effect in Pennsylvania on Saturday, with the goal of ensuring that students leaving high school are prepared for college and the workplace. But critics say the requirement has been so watered down that it is unlikely to have major impact.
 The situation in Pennsylvania mirrors what has happened in many of the 26 states that have adopted high school exit exams. As deadlines approached for schools to start making passage of the exams a requirement for graduation, and practice tests indicated that large numbers of students would fail, many states softened standards, delayed the requirement or added alternative paths to a diploma. 
 People who have studied the exams, which affect two-thirds of the nation's public school students, say they often fall short of officials' ambitious goals. 
 ''The real pattern in states has been that the standards are lowered so much that the exams end up not benefiting students who pass them while still hurting the students who fail them,'' said John Robert Warren, an expert on exit exams and a professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities.
 ''The exams are just challenging enough to reduce the graduation rate,'' Professor Warren added, ''but not challenging enough to have measurable consequences for how much students learn or for how prepared they are for life after high school.''
 In 2008, state officials in Alabama, Arizona and Washington delayed the start of the exit exam requirement and lowered standards after seeing that many students, including a disproportionate number of minorities, would fail the tests. 
 Many states have faced lawsuits over the proposed requirements amid accusations that the tests are unfair to students with disabilities, non-native speakers of English and students attending schools with fewer educational resources.
 These concerns have been bolstered by recent studies that indicate that the exams lead to increased dropout rates by one or two percentage points. 
 But proponents say that with the decline in manufacturing and the growth of the information economy, higher educational standards are needed to reinforce the value of a high school diploma. The exams, they argue, give school districts better incentives to succeed and ensure that no one will graduate without documented skills in specific subjects. 
 ''Momentum is definitely still moving in favor of states' adopting these exit exams,'' said John F. Jennings, the president of the Center on Education Policy, which publishes annual reports on high school exit exams. 
 Mr. Jennings added that this momentum was likely to grow next month when the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers, which represents state school superintendents, are to release a common core of state standards in English-language arts and mathematics for kindergarten through Grade 12. Federal officials have set aside $350 million for states to create tests that correspond to the new national standards, and Mr. Jennings said there was a good chance that states would consider adopting these new tests for their exit exams.
 Despite criticism of exit exams, some experts say that schools have benefited from them. Surveys indicate that teachers say the tests have brought clearer guidelines on curriculum, which they find helpful. And after the exam grades begin to count, students often start taking them more seriously, which causes passage rates to increase, Mr. Jennings said.
 Gerald L. Zahorchak, the secretary of education in Pennsylvania, is a strong advocate for the state's new tests, which will be phased in over the next five years.
 ''I want more than anything to be able to say with confidence that every Pennsylvania student who receives a diploma is ready for the real world,'' Dr. Zahorchak said.
 He added that in 2007-8, more than 20,000 public high school graduates who enrolled in a public higher education institution required some form of remedial help, with a total cost to taxpayers, students and parents in excess of $26 million.
 Nonetheless, responding to fervent opposition from legislators, teachers unions and advocates for parents who feared a loss of local control, Pennsylvania opted in October to allow school districts to substitute their own versions of the exit exams, with state approval, and to give students who fail multiple times alternative paths to graduation. 
 The rules in Pennsylvania require students to pass at least four courses, with the end-of-course exams counting for a third of the course grade. If students fail an exam or a section of an exam, they will have two chances to retake it. If they cannot pass after that, they have the option of doing a subject-specific project that is approved by district officials. 
 The exams are not cheap. Education officials in Pennsylvania estimate it will cost $176 million to develop and administer the tests and model curriculum through 2014-15, and about $31 million to administer each year after that.
 Because individual school systems in Pennsylvania can substitute their own exams, state officials and experts do not consider Pennsylvania among the 26 states that have official exit exams.
 Twenty-four states now use at least some part of the exams for federal accountability under the No Child Left Behind law, up from just two states in 2002, according to the center. 
 Eleven states use either a single comprehensive exam, or single exams in math and English, to evaluate what high school students have learned. The other 15 -- including Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Texas -- use end-of-course tests on multiple subjects. This approach tends to face less opposition because the incremental tests can be more easily linked to course content and can be used more directly to increase rigor in coursework.
 Also among those states using end-of-course exams is Arkansas, where seventh, eighth or ninth graders will this year for the first time be required to pass the end-of-course Algebra I test to qualify for a diploma.
 Critics of Arkansas's system say it fails to show true math proficiency because students have only to score 24 out of 100 to pass the test and those who fail will be granted two additional chances to take the test. After that, they can take a computerized tutorial that is followed by a test.
 Tom W. Kimbrell, the commissioner for the Department of Education in Arkansas, rejected that criticism. 
 ''The alternate options are not some escape valve that everyone gets to use,'' Dr. Kimbrell said. ''They are mechanisms that require the student and teachers to go back and actually learn the material.''
 But as deadlines have neared, the opposite concern has led many states to lower or delay their requirements.
 In Arizona, lawmakers extended a law in 2008 that was supposed to expire that permitted students who failed the exam to graduate if they met certain grade requirements.
 That same year state education officials in Alabama approved an emergency rule allowing students to graduate if they passed just three sections of the exit test, rather than all five, as long as two were math and reading.
 Washington lawmakers also eliminated the math section of the final exit exam in 2008 in favor of math exams to be administered at the end of each course.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 15, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about a lowering of standards for high school exit exams in many states misstated, in some copies, the annual increase in the number of dropouts for which recent studies blame the exams. It ranges from 35,000 to 70,000 nationwide -- not per state.

HEADLINE: A Push to Bring the S.S. United States Home

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The S.S. United States, which carried immigrants to America and vacationers to Europe faster than any other ocean liner, has not sailed into New York harbor in 40 years. But some fans of the giant ship are telling city officials that it should come home to Manhattan.
 Stripped of its interior appointments, streaked with rust, the United States has languished at a dock in Philadelphia for more than a decade. Several dreams of restoring it, as a passenger ship or a floating condominium, have been aborted. 
 Now, in a desperate attempt to avert its scrapping, a group calling itself the S.S. United States Conservancy is suggesting that the ship could be a floating hotel and tourist attraction on the Hudson River waterfront.
 Dan McSweeney, executive director of the conservancy, has pitched the idea to officials of the city's Economic Development Corporation and this week, he is scheduled to present it to a committee of Community Board 4. Mr. McSweeney emphasized in an interview that the notion is ''a very broad, general preliminary idea.''
 Rehabilitating the United States and moving it to New York would surely cost much more than $100 million. None of that money has been raised, Mr. McSweeney said. City officials have encouraged the group to pursue the venture but have yet to offer any financial support, he said.
 ''There is an economic reality here,'' Mr. McSweeney said. ''Saving the ship is a significant expense, and the return on that investment won't occur for some time.''
 At the moment, he said, he is sounding out local officials and trying to identify prominent people -- preferably, some who are very rich -- who will support and promote the plan. 
 As a first step, the ship would have to be purchased from Norwegian Cruise Line, which has owned it since 2003. The Norwegian company had intended to restore it and operate it on cruises out of American ports. But about a year ago, the company offered it for sale again, leaving enthusiasts to fear that it would be cut up for the value of its steel -- probably just a few million dollars.
 Bigger than the Titanic, and with two gigantic funnels that make it look almost like a caricature of an ocean liner, the 990-foot-long United States holds a special place in the hearts of its fans. It once was the fastest of all ocean liners. In July 1952, it steamed out of New York harbor on the first of its 400 ocean crossings. In 3 days, 10 hours and 40 minutes, it reached the coast of England, having shaved 10 hours off the Queen Mary's record time for the route.
 In one famous exchange as it passed the Queen Mary mid-ocean, the United States radioed: ''Sorry old girl.'' The reply from the Queen Mary: ''Your girls are faster than our girls.''
 The United States continued sailing until 1969, when the rise of jet travel diminished the allure of trans-Atlantic voyages. Since then, the 58-year-old ship has changed hands several times. One frustrated owner auctioned off all of its interior parts, including its bell, in 1981. It was later towed to Ukraine, where asbestos and other hazardous materials were removed.
 The ship is still structurally sound and its hollowed out interior is a ''blank slate'' that could be outfitted for a variety of uses, including a hotel with restaurants, bars and convention space, Mr. McSweeney said.
 New York is a natural place for the ship because the city was its home port and there are several potential berths for it along the Hudson, he said. In discussions with the Economic Development Corporation, Mr. McSweeney mentioned Governors Island as a possible site, as well, a corporation official said.
 Still, Mr. McSweeney has not given up on Philadelphia.
 ''We're really at the beginning of the whole process of either coming to New York or staying in Philadelphia,'' he said.
 That is if he can find a way to save the ship from the scrap heap of maritime history.

HEADLINE: Al Qaeda's Shadowland

BYLINE: By EDMUND J. HULL. 
Edmund J. Hull was the United States ambassador to Yemen from 2001 to 2004.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 AMERICANS are scrambling to understand Yemen, where Al Qaeda has recently surged and the Christmas Day plot against Northwest Flight 253 was hatched. It's not easy. Yemen has 5,000 years of history, complicated politics and daunting economic challenges. But we've made it more difficult to understand by allowing several myths to cloud our vision. Challenging these misconceptions is a first step toward comprehending and overcoming significant threats to American, Yemeni and international security.
 Myth 1:The Yemeni government's control does not extend much beyond the capital, Sana. 
 It's true that the government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh faces several security problems. Al Qaeda has operated there since the early 1990s, with its strength waxing and waning depending on the effectiveness of the government's counterterrorism efforts. Since 2004, the government has faced an insurrection in the north from a group called the Houthis, who would restore a religious ruler. There has also been growing separatist feeling in the southern regions that tried to secede in 1994. And many of the tribes in the north are well armed and operate largely outside the government structure. 
 None of this, however, means that the government is confined to ruling a city-state centered on Sana. The Yemeni Army and national police exert significant day-to-day control over most of the country, and almost everywhere else on an ad hoc basis. Yemen is much like the United States in the latter half of the 19th century, when the government faced a rebellious South and a Wild West, but was hardly powerless outside the East Coast. 
 Myth 2:Yemen is a Qaeda haven because it is the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden, who is supported by tribes in Hadhramaut Province.
 Osama bin Laden's father, Muhammad, was one of many Yemenis who achieved great success outside his native country. But the bin Ladens are not part of any politically significant tribe or clan, nor has the family sought to convert its wealth into power in Yemen. Osama bin Laden has some popularity, but no more so than elsewhere in the Islamic world. The Qaeda virus -- which has been present in Yemen since 1992, when Qaeda members bombed a hotel in Aden where American troops had been staying on their way to Somalia -- is the problem for Yemen, not Mr. bin Laden's ancestral ties.
 Myth 3:Yemen is torn by Sunni-Shiite divisions, much like Iraq.
 The Houthi rebellion is often described as Shiite resistance against a Sunni establishment. In fact, both the Houthis and President Saleh are followers of the Zaidi sect of Shiite Islam. Generally, there is no clear divide between Sunnis and Shiites in Yemen, although the Shiites tend to live in the north and northwest while the Sunnis, mostly members of the moderate Shafii school, predominate in the south and southeast. In any case, one's sect matters far less in Yemen than in countries like Lebanon or Iraq, and it's not unknown for Yemenis to convert from Sunni to Shiite as a matter of convenience.
 Myth 4:Yemeni tribes have an inherent affinity for Al Qaeda or terrorism.
 In 2002, Abu Ali al-Harithi, then Al Qaeda's leader in Yemen, was killed by an American drone in a strike that was coordinated with the Yemeni government. By tribal custom, any perceived illegitimate killing would have been grounds for a claim by the tribe against the government. No such claim was made. In fact, when receiving the body for burial, one of his kinsmen noted that ''he had chosen his path, and it had led to his death.'' 
 This was not an anomaly. In my experience, there is no deep-seeded affinity between Yemeni tribes and the Qaeda movement. Tribes tend to be opportunistic, not ideological, so the risk is that Al Qaeda will successfully exploit opportunities created by government neglect. There are also family affinities -- cousins, linked to uncles, linked to brothers. These do matter. But what matters most is the ''mujahedeen fraternity'' -- Yemenis with jihadist experience in Afghanistan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia or elsewhere. Finally, what would matter -- and significantly -- would be innocent casualties resulting from counterterrorism operations, which could well set off a tribal response.
 Forging an effective American counterterrorism policy in Yemen will be as difficult as it is necessary. But misreading Yemeni history and society can only complicate its conception and jeopardize its execution.

HEADLINE: Bank Is in Talks to Settle State Claims Over Merrill

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
A year after its controversial takeover of Merrill Lynch, Bank of America is discussing settling a troublesome state inquiry into the star-crossed deal and the billions of dollars in bonuses that Merrill hurriedly paid its employees. 
 As the banking industry braces for a furor over a new round of big bonuses, Bank of America is negotiating with the staff of the New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, to settle claims that the bank failed to adequately disclose the risks of the takeover to its shareholders, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Mr. Cuomo has also focused on the bonuses that Merrill paid despite its perilous financial condition. 
 While no settlement has been reached and the talks are continuing, Bank of America's new chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, is interested in bringing an end to myriad legal troubles plaguing the bank. The two sides met last Friday to discuss a possible deal. 
 With talks with Mr. Cuomo's office gathering force, Bank of America claimed a crucial legal victory in a separate federal case on Monday. A federal judge, Jed S. Rakoff, rejected a request by the Securities and Exchange Commission to broaden its claims against the bank, which center on the Merrill bonuses. The S.E.C. also said it did not plan to bring claims against individual executives at the bank. 
 The Bank of America-Merrill merger -- a pivotal moment in the financial crisis -- has caused headaches both for Bank of America and the S.E.C. Judge Rakoff previously rejected an initial $33 million settlement between the commission and the bank, calling the agreement too low and raising questions about the S.E.C.'s investigation. After Monday's ruling, the S.E.C. is left to pursue a narrow case, while Bank of America executives are trying to resolve various inquiries without dropping their position that its executives did nothing wrong, legal experts said.
 ''This is one more twist in a very complicated maze of parties with lots of agendas,'' said David Skeel, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who is watching the bank's cases. ''There's not an obvious way out for anybody here, the S.E.C. or the bank.''
 Judge Rakoff's latest ruling came on the same day that Mr. Cuomo's office, which has sought a prominent role in cases stemming from the financial collapse, demanded information on executive pay for 2009 from Bank of America and seven other big banks that received taxpayer bailout funds. In letters to the banks, Mr. Cuomo asked the companies to disclose various details about their bonus payouts. How or whether the banks would comply with that request was unclear.
 Bank of America appears to have become more amenable to working with state and federal officials since Kenneth D. Lewis announced his retirement as chief executive, which was effective on Jan. 1. Mr. Moynihan, bank insiders say, hopes to make a clean break with the legal problems left over from the Lewis years. The takeover of Merrill prompted scores of shareholder lawsuits, as well as state and federal investigations, and eventually helped drive Mr. Lewis from his post. 
 Judge Rakoff's ruling on Monday barred the S.E.C. from expanding its case but allowed it to file a new one, and the commission said in a statement that it would file a second complaint. That second complaint will focus on Merrill's gaping $15 billion in losses in the fourth quarter, which were not disclosed before the deal closed. The S.E.C. cases have some similarities to Mr. Cuomo's, which from the start focused on Merrill's losses. Such overlap may enable the S.E.C. to join Mr. Cuomo's office in a global settlement and thus avoid a trial that could be embarrassing should the S.E.C. lose.
 Unlike the S.E.C., Mr. Cuomo would like to have individual bank executives held responsible in the case, which could include individual fines. Those fines could come out of the executives' pensions.
 Bank analysts said the bank and its new chief executive were most likely evaluating whether the cost of a settlement was worth it for a clean footing. 
 ''It's a balance between the attention-grabbing headlines and settling too early,'' said John McDonald, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein.

 BODY:
President Obama will try to recoup for taxpayers as much as $120 billion of the money spent to bail out the financial system, most likely through a tax on large banks, administration and Congressional officials said Monday.
 The president has yet to settle on the details, and his senior economic advisers are weighing a number of options as they finish the budget proposal Mr. Obama will release next month. 
 The general idea is to devise a levy that would help reduce the budget deficit, which is now at a level not seen since World War II, and would also discourage the kinds of excessive risk-taking among financial institutions that led to a near collapse of Wall Street in 2008, the officials said. 
 But the president also has a political purpose -- to respond to the anger building across the country as big banks, having been rescued by the taxpayers, report record profits and begin paying out huge bonuses while millions of Americans remain out of work.
 The administration previously rejected two ideas that have received much attention in recent months: a transaction tax on financial trades and a special tax on executives' bonuses. 
 The most likely alternatives would be a tax based on the size and riskiness of an institution's loans and other financial holdings, or a tax on profits. 
 Lobbyists for bankers, taken by surprise, immediately objected to any new tax. They said financial institutions had been repaying their portion of the bailout money in full, with interest. Losses from the $700 billion bailout fund -- estimated to run as high as $120 billion -- are expected to come from the automobile companies and their finance arms, the insurance giant American International Group and programs to avert home foreclosures, and the president is aiming to recoup that money.
 ''It is perplexing to us,'' said Edward L. Yingling, president and chief executive of the American Bankers Association. He recalled that Mr. Obama recently had two White House meetings with bankers to urge them to provide more loans to credit-starved small businesses. But a tax, he said, would be ''a hit on banks that will decrease their ability to lend.''
 But the industry's objections carry less weight at a time when Mr. Obama is under intense pressure to crack down on Wall Street. In coming days, big banks are expected to begin announcing huge bonuses for their top executives and traders. A bipartisan commission charged with reporting on the causes of the financial crisis will begin a two-day hearing on Wednesday with testimony from the heads of four big banks: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. Meanwhile, industry opposition continues to stymie the president's initiative in Congress to tighten regulations.
 ''The president has talked on a number of occasions about ensuring that the money that taxpayers put up to rescue our financial system is paid back in full,'' Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, said.
 So has the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, who has drawn criticism from both the left and the right as not being tough enough on Wall Street. 
 Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the Democrat who is chairman of the House banking committee, said the president was required to seek recovery of any losses under the law that created the $700 billion financial rescue fund, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, in October 2008. The law did not spell out how to do so.
 ''I did know they were thinking about doing this and I encouraged them,'' Mr. Frank said.
 Mr. Frank and others in Congress said they did not know any details, and administration officials say no decisions have been made beyond the fact that a proposal will be in the budget. Mr. Obama has been meeting with Mr. Geithner and with Lawrence H. Summers, his senior White House economic adviser, to discuss options from the Treasury department. News of the decision to propose some kind of tax was first reported by Politico.
 The 27-nation European Union called for a global transactions tax in December, and last November Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain proposed the idea at a meeting of the Group of 20 developed and emerging nations, saying revenue could be stockpiled to finance any future bailouts. But Mr. Geithner has said a transaction tax, on trades of complicated derivatives and other financial instruments, would simply be passed through to investors and other customers, and could put American companies at a competitive disadvantage.
 Separately, Britain and France have proposed a large tax on financial executives' bonuses. Last year the administration successfully opposed a House bill that would have imposed a substantial levy on executive compensation, and officials continue to argue that corporate shareholders, not the government, should determine pay policies.
 Any fee that the president proposes is likely to exempt smaller banks, an official said. Community banks carry particular clout in Congress given their presence in nearly every member's district.
 ''Those that caused this train wreck ought to be the ones to pay to clean up the mess,'' said Stephen J. Verdier, an executive vice president at the Independent Community Bankers of America. ''The community bankers are every bit as much the victims as the average taxpayer in all this, so any tax ought to be devised with those principles in mind.''
 Losses from the $700 billion financial rescue are expected to be much less than initially feared, according to a Treasury report and government audit late last year. Besides banks' repayment of their bailout money with interest, the government also has made money by selling the bank warrants that it held as collateral for its loans to the institutions.

HEADLINE: W.T.O. to Review U.S. Tariff on Chinese Tires

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: GENEVA 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization said Monday that it would examine American import taxes on Chinese tires.
 The dispute focuses on a three-year tariff approved in September by President Obama, which aims to slow China's rapid export growth and protect American jobs in the tire sector. 
 It is the latest in a string of trade battles over subjects ranging from steel and song downloads to patents and poultry between the United States, the world's biggest importer, and China, the top exporter.
 The W.T.O. included China's complaint in an agenda published for a meeting on Jan. 19 of its dispute body. Washington delayed Beijing's request last month for the establishment of an investigative panel, but cannot do so again under W.T.O. rules.
 The panel will be asked to evaluate whether the American tariffs violate rules governing trade among the W.T.O.'s 153 members. Trade cases often take years to resolve, but can result in the W.T.O. authorizing retaliatory sanctions.
 President Obama ordered the higher tire tariffs for three years, including a 35 percent additional charge in the first year. It comes on top of a regular 4 percent tariff.
 China's exports have surged since joining the Geneva-based commerce referee in 2001, rankling manufacturers in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Critics say China's rise as a trade juggernaut has been aided by unfair policies that boost sales of Chinese goods abroad while limiting the amount of foreign products entering its own market.
 Tires imported from China are usually low-end models. While American-made, name-brand tires can easily run to more than $100 apiece, Chinese imports sometimes sell for half that. The tariffs would make them more expensive.
 The United States imported about 46 million tires from China in 2008, three times as many as in 2004. In that time, China's share of the American market went to almost 17 percent from less than 5 percent.
 The two countries are also squabbling over American imports of Chinese steel pipes. Last month, Washington imposed new duties on pipes mainly used in the oil and gas industries, affecting about $2.8 billion worth of Chinese exports.

HEADLINE: A Lofty Perch, Sure, But Reasons To Retool

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THERE is a joke about the enthusiastic disk jockey on a top-40 radio station who liked to introduce the hottest hit record as ''No. 1, and climbing higher every week.'' The reason the joke is still being told in an era of downloaded music is that it has always been difficult to drum up interest in an entertainment property that is already successful.
 A campaign to herald the start on Tuesday of the ninth season of ''American Idol'' reflects that challenge. On one hand, ''Idol'' could use a fresh promotional approach after some ratings declines last season, particularly among viewers in the important demographic groups of ages 12 to 17 and 18 to 49. 
 And there is potential fodder for new ads in the changes afoot among the judges for the ''American Idol'' singing competition. Ellen DeGeneres will join the panel to replace Paula Abdul. And this season will be the last for Simon Cowell, he announced on Monday, as he prepares to leave to develop another series, ''The X Factor,'' for an American introduction in fall 2011. 
 Offsetting those reasons for a different approach to promoting ''Idol'' is that despite the ratings dips and the judicial drama, it remains the most popular show on television. According to data from the Fox Broadcasting Company, which has carried the show since its arrival in the United States, ''Idol'' has been the No. 1 series in the Nielsen ratings for six consecutive seasons.
 As NBC learned recently about ''The Tonight Show,'' if something on TV is not broken, perhaps it ought not to be fixed.
 ''Even if it loses steam, it'll still be the most-watched show in prime time,'' Marc Berman, television analyst for the trade publication Mediaweek, said of ''Idol.''
 ''It's going to be hard for them to get viewers back,'' Mr. Berman said of Fox executives, because ''unless you're living in a cave you know the show.''
 That said, some former fans might return, he added, especially those curious to see how Ms. DeGeneres will fare.
 How well ''Idol'' performs this season has implications beyond bragging rights for Fox, because it is one of the most lucrative series in advertising revenue.
 TNS Media Intelligence, a unit of WPP, reported that ad revenue from ''American Idol'' grew to $843.3 million, from $463.4 million in the 2005 season.
 Although the 2009 total was down from $883.7 million in 2008, reflecting the impact of the economy, the five largest advertisers on ''Idol'' in 2009 -- in descending order, AT&T, Ford Motor, Coca-Cola, Walt Disney and Viacom -- spent more than they spent in 2008, TNS reported, $273.3 million compared with $257.6 million.
 The course Fox is pursuing to stimulate viewership for the new season is to evoke the emotions generated in earlier seasons. The campaign, created internally at Fox, is focused on the core aspects of the show, especially the idea that a talented anyone from anywhere could become the winner and be catapulted from obscurity to instant fame as the so-called American Idol.
 That is underlined by the theme of the campaign, ''They all start somewhere,'' and the device of a backstage pass that symbolizes the access the viewers are being offered to the process from beginning to end.
 In one commercial, an announcer declares, ''Every year, 'American Idol' returns to remind us that we all have a chance to make our dreams come true.'' In another spot, an announcer asserts, ''It doesn't matter who you are or where you're from.''
 Another way the new tack is manifested is with fresh-faced actors who appear in advertising on television, in magazines, online, on billboards, in social media and elsewhere. The actors portray would-be contestants at the start of what the show likes to call their journey: singing in the subway or the shower, behind the wheel of a pickup truck or in a garage band, in a booth in a parking lot or on the beach.
 ''I said this year has to be about getting back to basics, being real,'' said Joe Earley, executive vice president for marketing and communications at Fox in Los Angeles, part of the News Corporation.
 That compares with the ads for the most recent seasons, Mr. Earley said, when ''we were getting bigger and bigger, glossier and glossier, focusing on the event and the sheer spectacle.''
 ''We were creating C.G.I. worlds,'' he added, using the initials for computer-generated imagery, ''where tens of thousands of people were in a crowd applauding the American Idol'' or the contestants ''were as big as cities, towering over the Empire State Building, the St. Louis arch.''
 The scale is reverting to a more human level from a ''detached'' outlook, Mr. Earley said, not only because it better befits the series, but also because it reflects the change in the national mood after events like the economic crisis.
 ''We wanted to re-establish the joy and the fact that this is a journey,'' he added, by conveying that ''the big show you love, that changes lives, is back.''
 Plans call for Ms. DeGeneres to be mixed into the campaign with ads that take advantage of her humorous persona. For instance, in one spot she proclaims, ''I am the next American Idol'' -- then pauses to add the word ''judge.'' 
 For all the good vibrations, the campaign is not forgetting those viewers whose favorite part of the series is the awful auditions. Commercials appearing during football games on Fox are ''showing the fun, funny, sexy, outrageous side of 'Idol' as well,'' Mr. Earley said.
 Mr. Berman of Mediaweek predicted that the series ''will hold up'' this season, declining ''a little bit'' in the ratings but still dominating its competition.
 The return of ''Idol'' heralds a bumper crop of reality competition shows for the winter, among them new seasons for ''The Amazing Race,'' ''Celebrity Apprentice,'' ''Project Runway'' and ''Survivor.''

HEADLINE: The Life of the (Tea) Party: Comparing Social Protest Movements

BYLINE: DINAH MACK and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Lesson Plan | Comparing the Tea Party movement to other social protest movements in American history. 

 BODY:
Overview | What drives the current Tea Party movement and its protests? How does it compare with historical social movements? In this lesson, students explore the Tea Party movement, compare it to other social movements in American history and consider their impact.
Materials | Computers with Internet connection, a projector and research materials.
Warm-Up | Project on the board, read aloud from or give each student a copy of the handout "Name That Movement" (PDF). Tell them that the three sentences on the sheet, all taken from New York Times articles, refer to a political movement, but do not reveal which one. You may also want to obscure the fact that the movement is contemporary. Instruct them to try to fill in the blanks. When they are finished, share the answers: 

        
"Tea parties" (from the Opinionator blog post "Tea Parties to the Extreme").
        
"Tea party brigades" (from the Op-Ed column "Tea Party Teens").
        
"Tea Party"; "populist conservatives" (from The New York Times Sunday Magazine article "The First Senator From the Tea Party?").
Explain to the class that the modern-day Tea Party, based on the symbolism of the Boston Tea Party of 1773, was first suggested by the CNBC commentator Rick Santelli as a way to protest the federal stimulus package and government bailouts, the Obama administration and taxes. Protesters held events across the country on April 15, 2009, "tax day," and those protests turned into a movement.
Show these images from the April 15, 2009, protests. As you show each photograph, ask students to share their impressions and what they notice about slogans, costumes, props and the people pictured. What messages are the Tea Party protesters sending? What are they against? And what are they for? What other movements and protests does this one remind you of, and why?
Related | Two Times Op-Ed columnists have expressed differing points of view of the Tea Party movement. In "The Tea Party Teens," David Brooks writes about the movement's political beliefs and national popularity:
A year ago, the Obama supporters were the passionate ones. Now the Tea Party brigades have all the intensity.
The Tea Party movement is a large, fractious confederation of Americans who are defined by what they are against. They are against the concentrated power of the educated class. They believe big government, big business, big media and the affluent professionals are merging to form self-serving oligarchy - with bloated government, unsustainable deficits, high taxes and intrusive regulation.
The Tea Party movement is mostly famous for its flamboyant fringe. But it is now more popular than either major party. According to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 41 percent of Americans have a positive view of the Tea Party movement. Only 35 percent of Americans have a positive view of the Democrats, and only 28 percent have a positive view of the Republican Party.
The other column, by Charles M. Blow, "G.O.P. Grief and Grieving," criticizes the movement:
This is a limited, emotional reaction. It's a response to the trauma that is the Great Recession, the uncertainty and creeping suspicion about the risks being taken in Washington, a visceral reaction to Obama and an overwhelming sense of powerlessness and loss.
Simply put, it's about fear-fueled anger. But anger is not an idea. It's not a plan. And it's not a vision for the future. It is, however, the second stage of grief, right after denial and before bargaining.
Read both columns with your class, using the questions below.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension:

        
According to David Brooks, why has the decade started with the United States in a "sour mood"?
        
How does Brooks define the Tea Party movement and compare it to past movements in American history?
        
In what way does Brooks believe the Tea Party movement will be transformed? How does Brooks believel the movement will shape and influence politics over the next decade?
        
How does Charles Blow interpret the Tea Party movement? How do his views compare and contrast with Brooks'?
        
How does Blow describe anger? Why does he believe the right is on the wrong side of history? Why does he use the analogy to the stages of grief throughout his piece?
Activity | In his editorial, David Brooks writes, "American history is often driven by passionate outsiders who force themselves into the center of American life." Write this quote on the board and ask students to brainstorm examples of groups and/or social movements throughout American history that Brooks could be describing. (For a global history class, this could also be done with other protest movements from around the world.) Generate a list of social movements on the board.
If students are stuck, suggest movements or historical events that prompted movements. The final list might include movements like the Boston Tea Party, abolition, suffrage, feminism and women's rights, black power and civil rights, gay rights, hippie/anti-Vietnam War, unionization, anti-abortion, anti-nukes, pro-environment or "green," and so on.
Put students in small groups and assign each group to research a movement from the list and compare it to the modern Tea Party movement. To guide research, provide students with the handout "Comparing Social Protest Movements" (PDF).
Alternatively, assign students to compare the Tea Party movement with a specific movement from American history that the class is currently studying. In this version, each small group should research one aspect of both movements, using the list in the handout.
For a literature or political theory focus, have students compare the tenets of the Tea Party movement with the ideas expressed in Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged."
When research is complete, reconvene the class and have each group share its findings and synthesis statements. Then return to the statements about the Tea Party movement made by David Brooks and Charles Blow. Ask: Based on what you learned about the historical movements studied, do you think Brooks or Blow is more accurate in assessing the Tea Party movement? Why?
Finally, discuss the role social protest movements have played in American history, and, together, predict the effect the Tea Party movement will have in the next few years. Have students draw on historical examples and parallels to bolster their arguments.
Going Further | Students create a working glossary of terms for social movements over all and the Tea Party movement in particular, including populism, social justice, reform, conservative, liberal and so on, including article clips, quotations and images/illustrations for each term. They create posters with their terms and post them around the room or maintain their glossary in a class wiki, adding to it as relevant events occur.

HEADLINE: In New York Restaurants, the Rise of Rome

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
YEARS ago, New Yorkers in search of culinary enlightenment did not come back from Italy raving about Roman food. Rome was where your plane landed on the way to that dream trip to Tuscany. 
 Back at home, returned travelers could always find Roman icons like spaghetti alla carbonara, bucatini all'amatriciana, fritto misto and saltimbocca in scores of Italian restaurants. But in the last year or so, a half-dozen new places inspired by Rome, not the inevitable Tuscany, have opened around New York. Their menus plumb the repertory beyond the well-known crowd-pleasers.
 Simplicity is the hallmark of the cuisine. And it is starting to resonate with New Yorkers who will happily dig into a plate of tender yet crisp porchetta, the classic roast pig. Despite its ancient reputation as the voluptuous capital of an empire with a taste for peacocks at banquets, Rome offers more-basic satisfaction, food that fed shepherds and peasants reaching back over time. 
 Meats, especially oxtails, often bear the tagline alla vaccinara (''in the butcher's style''). Stracciatella, a broth thick with strands of egg, and saltimbocca, which should be small pieces of tender veal topped with prosciutto and sage, no cheese, and quickly sauteed with a splash of wine to ''jump into the mouth,'' are to Rome what pesto is to Genoa. 
 Dishes rely on humble cuts of meat, wild herbs, salted cod and simply dressed pasta. Black pepper, chili and salt are the seasonings of choice at the neighborhood trattorias to which Romans are fiercely loyal. And what better cuisine when the economy sours? 
 ''Roman food is comfort food. Cacio e pepe -- pasta with cheese and black pepper -- is mac and cheese,'' said John Fanning, a partner in Accademia di Vino in Manhattan, who once owned a wine bar in Rome. ''And now, with everyone crazy about nose-to-tail and oddball cuts of meat, Roman food fits right in,'' he said. ''They've always done food like that in Rome.''
 Not surprisingly, New York's new Roman landscape is full of carnivorous names. Testaccio, a new restaurant in Long Island City, is named for the slaughterhouse district in Rome and is decorated with old photos of that neighborhood. Danny Meyer, a restaurateur whose diverse inventory over two decades never touched Italy, recently opened Maialino, his affectionate vision of a Roman trattoria, with a name that means ''little pig.'' The name of Quinto Quarto, a brick-walled osteria in Greenwich Village, refers to offal, the ''fifth quarter'' of the animal that Roman butchers kept for themselves.
 In addition, Sora Lella, a branch of a restaurant in the Trastevere district of Rome, has opened in SoHo. (Emporio, another recently opened spot in that neighborhood, claims to be a Roman trattoria but without strong evidence on the menu.) Several Roman-style pizzerias bake oblong pies that are portioned with scissors, including Numero 28 Pizzeria Romana in SoHo, where the artichoke pizza is particularly appealing. 
 The chef at Testaccio, Ivan Beacco, delves into the Roman repertory with sturdy Roman-style baked gnocchi, made with semolina, not potatoes or ricotta. He and other chefs are happily serving earthy braised oxtails, golden fried sweetbreads and spicy casseroles of tripe. Some other increasingly common specialties include artichokes slowly cooked and seasoned with Rome's inevitable mint, or fried crisp in the Jewish Ghetto-style, and snowy house-cured salt cod, often served with pasta. 
 Properly made spaghetti alla carbonara mingles guanciale, the unsmoked bacon made from pork cheeks, with eggs and cheese, and no cream. The lush yet straightforward dish may have gotten its name from having been cooked over charcoal. Spaghetti alla gricia, meanwhile, is a shepherd's supper, combining pasta, guanciale and pecorino. Period. Spaghetti all'arrabbiata doesn't stint on the chilies. 
 The Roman newcomers join Cacio e Pepe and Lupa, two downtown restaurants that years ago began taking cues from unassuming Roman trattorias. 
 ''After we opened Babbo we wanted to do something simpler, an urban trattoria,'' said Joseph Bastianich, who opened Lupa with Mario Batali 11 years ago. ''We were ahead of the curve. Roman food makes a strong statement but it's easy to understand. Now New Yorkers want food that's simple and authentic.'' Others predated even Lupa, including Sandro's, Tevere and Lattanzi. 
 Recently, Roman food has become easier for home cooks, not just chefs, to prepare. Excellent guanciale is available from domestic artisanal producers. Puntarelle, the peppery dandelion-like greens that the Romans dress with anchovies, are being grown locally. Cheese shops stock sheep milk ricotta and Roman pecorino, even the younger cacio de Roma. In spring there will be baby lamb at some butchers. Special cuts of pasta, including bavette, a kind of thin, rumpled tagliatelle, are also turning up in markets and online.
 With such ingredients no longer a challenge, ''we can offer things that would have been much harder to do 20 years ago,'' said Nick Anderer, the chef of Maialino, who, like Mr. Meyer, became attracted to the food of Rome after studying there. ''We know how to make fresh bavette,'' he said of the pasta that he serves with salt cod, and which is turned out daily in the kitchen at Maialino, along with tonnarelli for cacio e pepe. Parts of Mr. Anderer's lamb become coppa, or head cheese in Rome.
 But it's not always so easy. ''You probably won't see rigatoni alla pajata anytime soon,'' Mr. Anderer said. Pajata is what Romans call the intestines of milk-fed lamb, a delicacy contributing creaminess and a musky flavor to this exotic Roman specialty. Good luck on this one, for now. 
 But there are plenty of other dishes for chefs and home cooks to discover: hand-cut spaghetti from Viterbo near Rome, called lombrichelli, which is similar to spaghetti alla chitarra and is tossed in a concentrated tomato sauce spiked with chili; and quickly sauteed lamb chops alla scottadito (''finger-burning''), or lamb stewed in Rome's signature Frascati wine, as at Maialino.
 Though you may find the Frascati for the stew pot in your local wine shop, the region of Lazio offers relatively little in the way of distinctive wines, with whites better known and often of higher quality than the rustic reds. So in the glass, even with Roman food, Tuscany might still be your destination.

 Recipe: Roman Style Baked Semolina Gnocchi Adapted from Testaccio 1 hour plus 4 hours' chilling
 Adapted from Testaccio 1 hour plus 4 hours' chilling
 1 quart plus 2 tablespoons whole milk
 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
 Salt
 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
 1 1/2 cups semolina flour
 1 3-ounce piece Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated
 3 large egg yolks, lightly beaten
 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
 2 cloves garlic, sliced
 1 medium onion, finely chopped
 1 14.5-ounce can chopped tomatoes
 Freshly ground black pepper.
 1. In a 3- to 4-quart saucepan, combine milk, nutmeg, salt and 4 tablespoons butter. Bring just to a boil, lower heat to medium and immediately start adding semolina in a thin stream, whisking constantly. Keep whisking to make a smooth mixture. Reduce heat to very low and cook, stirring, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in half the cheese and the egg yolks.
 2. Use some of the oil to grease a baking sheet. Spread hot dough on baking sheet to a thickness of 1/2 inch. Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until very cold, 4 hours or overnight. 
 3. Heat remaining oil in a saucepan, add garlic and onion, cook until soft and add tomatoes. Simmer gently about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.
 4. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Use a little remaining butter to grease a shallow baking dish about 9 by 13 inches. Use a 2- to 3-inch round cookie cutter or a glass to cut disks of chilled dough. Keep dipping cutter in cold water to prevent sticking. Lift disks off baking sheet and arrange, slightly overlapping, in baking dish. Scraps can be kneaded briefly and smoothed out to allow for a few additional disks. Sprinkle disks in dish with remaining cheese and dot with remaining butter. Bake about 15 minutes, until lightly browned.
 5. Gently reheat sauce. Serve gnocchi with some sauce alongside each portion. 
 Yield: 6 servings.

HEADLINE: Awaiting the Super Kickoff in Fort Lauderdale

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
The game will be over in one evening -- but for Fort Lauderdale hotels, the after-party could last years.
 On Feb. 7, Super Bowl XLIV will be played at Dolphin Stadium, at the northern edge of Miami-Dade County. But, in a break with the past, N.F.L. officials, Super Bowl sponsors and many of the journalists covering the game will be staying in Fort Lauderdale, 18 miles north of the stadium, rather than in Miami.
 The shift, according to Frank Supovitz, senior vice president for events at the National Football League, ''was a function of us just having been in South Florida three years ago'' -- when the 2007 Super Bowl was held in the same stadium. According to Mr. Supovitz, the N.F.L. ''wanted to present a Super Bowl that was new and fresh and looked different.'' That meant choosing locations in Fort Lauderdale, rather than Miami, for most bowl-related events.
 The move north could not have happened without a building boom that has transformed Fort Lauderdale. 
 On highway A1A, which skirts the ocean, the midcentury motels that once defined Fort Lauderdale are gone, replaced by a row of gigantic resort hotels, including the 374-room Hilton Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort, which opened in 2007; the roughly 200-room Ritz-Carlton, Fort Lauderdale (which opened in 2007 as a St. Regis); and the W Fort Lauderdale, a $205 million behemoth that opened in April, 2009. 
 Also on the strip is the 433-room Westin Beach Resort, Fort Lauderdale, which was the Sheraton Yankee Trader until 2008, when it closed for a makeover and a name change. Last July, the hotel unveiled a spa and gym and an ocean-view Starbucks. In December, it opened a 25,000-square-foot conference center. In a sign of the times, a small motel was torn down to make way for the center.
 For at least two weeks before the game, that conference center will house temporary N.F.L. offices, and all of the hotel's 433 rooms have been reserved by the league. 
 Once the Westin was chosen as the headquarters hotel, the league set out to secure other hotel rooms in close proximity to the Westin, creating a campus feel, Mr. Supovitz said. 
 When it was selected, in 2007, the new Westin was ''just a rendering and a set of blueprints,'' said the hotel's general manager, Amaury Piedra. Mr. Supovitz was confident the hotel would be done in time, given the exposure the Super Bowl would bring. ''We were vigilant, but not nervous,'' he said about the hotel's renovation.
 Around the same time, the league decided to put the Super Bowl media center in the Broward County Convention Center, also in Fort Lauderdale. Once that decision was made, ''we needed to make sure we had enough hotel rooms for the 4,000 or so accredited media who are there,'' Mr. Supovitz said. 
 Luckily, the Fort Lauderdale area has added some 3,200 hotel rooms -- or about 10 percent of its total -- in just the last five years, according to Nicki E. Grossman, president of the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
 The N.F.L. secured one hotel for each of the competing teams: the Harbor Beach Marriott Resort and Spa, in Fort Lauderdale, which has just completed its own $50 million renovation, for the A.F.C. champion, and the Intercontinental in downtown Miami for its N.F.C. rival. And because players bring friends and family, each team requires at least one ''spillover hotel,'' Mr. Supovitz said. 
 In addition, the league reserved rooms for thousands of sponsors, broadcasters and others, for both the Super Bowl and the Pro Bowl, which will be played in the same stadium on Jan. 31. Altogether, the league contracted for 15,238 rooms shortly before the location was announced in 2005. (At the time, the arena was called Dolphin Stadium. Since then, it has become Land Shark Stadium, in a temporary naming deal that will expire before the Super Bowl. It has also been known as Pro Player Stadium and Joe Robbie Stadium.)
 But last August, just before a Sept. 1 deadline in its contract with the hotels, the league released 5,000 of those rooms, which made big news in Miami. The Miami Herald named the Mandarin Oriental as one of 17 hotels that had been dropped entirely, and the Doubletree Grand in downtown Miami as one where the number of reservations was reduced. 
 Mr. Supovitz said that since Miami-Dade had the biggest room inventory, it was ''not surprising'' that the most dropped rooms were from there. He said the league released the rooms because the prices that it had agreed to four years ago were, in many cases, higher than the prices available today. Releasing the rooms gave fans and sponsors the ability to negotiate lower rates, he said. 
 That left Miami hoteliers with rooms to fill. Barry Moskowitz, vice president for sales at the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau, said in December that, compared to the last time the Super Bowl came to South Florida, rooms in Miami ''are available at more competitive rates. It all comes down to supply and demand.'' 
 At the Mandarin Oriental, Jill DeMone, the director for sales and marketing, said some rooms were still available during the Super Bowl, but that the hotel was filling up. ''Not everybody wants to be in Fort Lauderdale. Some people still want to be in Miami, so we're still doing very well,'' she said.
 In Fort Lauderdale, where hoteliers know the guests are coming, the pressures are different. Mr. Piedra has spent four years getting the Westin ready for its Super Bowl debut. At the same time, he has also managed the transformation of the former Sheraton Yankee Clipper, a beachfront resort about a mile south of the Westin, into the new Sheraton Fort Lauderdale Beach Hotel. 
 All of its roughly 450 rooms have been booked by the N.F.L. for employees and sponsors, he said. But the last stage of the renovation will not be finished until about a week before the game, he said. The Super Bowl provided a deadline, he added, for work that would have been done anyway. 
 But the construction projects were begun during a flush economy. Hotel occupancy in Fort Lauderdale declined in the 12 months through November 2009, the last month for which figures were available, even as the average room rate fell more than 16 percent, according to Smith Travel Research. And the high-end Fort Lauderdale hotels face stiff competition. Thirteen hotels, nine of them new or completely remodeled, are part of a group that the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention and Visitors Bureau has named the Lauderdale Luxe collection (each of which has four-star, four-diamond or better ranking, full-service restaurant and spa).
 ''There is no question that we've never needed a Super Bowl as badly as we need this one,'' Ms. Grossman of the visitors bureau said.

HEADLINE: California Panel Considers Money From Climate Rules

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Offering an early glimpse of how California might manage a central element of its ambitious greenhouse-gas law, a state committee has recommended that residents receive cash or tax breaks resulting from auctions of emission allowances to industries and other polluters. 
 Under the proposal, described by the committee as a ''household friendly'' approach, Californians would receive 75 percent of the proceeds from emissions auctions, either in tax decreases or checks sent directly to residents. 
 The proposal was one of several released on Monday in a final report from the 16-member Economic and Allocation Advisory Committee, which is charged with advising the state's Air Resources Board on a cap-and-trade system. Such a system has become a central element of enacting the landmark California law enacted in 2006 to limit emissions of greenhouse gases in the state.
 The report was met with a measured response from state officials, including Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who has championed his environmental record as a bright spot in a second term marred by continual budget crises and cutbacks. 
 ''I continue to believe the best program will be one that returns value to the people through tax cuts, rebates or dividends,'' the governor said in a statement. ''And I applaud the committee for recognizing those options.''
 In cap-and-trade systems, individual polluters are given allowances to pollute to a certain level, with the total number of permissible emissions slowly reduced year by year. In California, the emissions law, AB 32, requires that emissions of heat-trapping gases statewide be reduced to 1990 levels by 2020. 
 In some cases, the allowances have been offered to polluters without charge to soften the economic impact or to win the confidence of businesses, which will bear higher costs to reduce emissions and which can sell unused allowances. The cap-and-trade legislation passed by the United States House last summer had some free allowances, as does much of the legislation being considered in the Senate.
 Under the California committee's recommendation, however, allowances would be auctioned, and the bulk of the proceeds returned to the state's residents. It says auctions ''would be more transparent and provide additional advantages including price discovery and market liquidity.'' 
 Cap-and-trade policies, which have been used to fight acid rain and other types of pollution, can be controversial, and their fate in the Senate is uncertain. 
 Robert Stavins, the director of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program, said the California proposal faced uncertain political prospects and that such a plan could eventually put California at odds with a national cap-and-trade program. 
 ''The political question,'' Mr. Stavins said, ''is whether the approach of compensating sectors and geographic areas through free allocation'' -- the approach in the House bill -- ''turns out to be more politically effective than the populist approach of trying to win the support of the population directly with checks in the mail.''
 The California Chamber of Commerce responded warily to the proposal, saying in a letter to Mary Nichols, chairwoman of the resources board, that ''auctioning of allowances must be kept at de minimus levels'' to avoid higher costs to businesses, and in turn, consumers.
 A board spokesman, Stanley Young, said members would consider all the committee's recommendations and issue draft regulations for the cap-and-trade program this spring. The board has until next January to adopt such a program, which is required to be in place by 2012.

HEADLINE: Mixed Signals Complicate European Bank's Task

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
With signals about European growth mixed and some weaker members of the European Union still in debt crisis, the European Central Bank is in a tough position as it seeks to pull back on measures that helped the euro zone through the recession.
 The bank's governing council will hold a regular meeting on Thursday in Frankfurt, its first of the year. Analysts do not expect it to announce any policy changes, but they will listen closely for any shift in how the central bankers seem to assess the economy and when they may raise interest rates. 
 Recent indicators and corporate financial reports show that Europe is recovering slowly and unevenly. The British retailer Tesco said on Tuesday that sales during the six-week holiday period through Jan. 9 were up 6.9 percent from a year ago, without adjusting for currency fluctuations. The German retailer Metro said its sales dipped 3.6 percent in 2009. Over all, retail sales in the euro zone fell 1.2 percent in November from October, according to European Commission figures released last week. 
 ''Some indicators have disappointed, others have been above expectations,'' said Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. ''The E.C.B. will continue to describe the situation as uncertain.'' 
 While Germany, France and other big economies are expanding again, Greece and other smaller members, including Latvia and Hungary, are still struggling. A team from the International Monetary Fund arrived in Greece on Tuesday to advise the government on how to tame its runaway budget deficit, which reached 12.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2009, Bloomberg News reported.
 To make matters trickier for European Central Bank policy makers, the European banking system is still not functioning normally even as other sectors, like manufacturing, show signs of life. 
 ''We are going to have a struggle between these two factors -- the recovery and the banking system, which is still in very bad shape,'' said Eric Chaney, chief economist for the AXA Group in Paris.
 The patchy economic outlook complicates the task of the European Central Bank as it tries to ease monetary conditions back to normal and prevent inflation. 
 In December, the central bank's governing council, which sets monetary policy for the 16 countries that use the euro, said it would begin scaling back its huge lending program to euro-zone banks, which has helped avert a collapse in lending to business. Still, the amount of cash available to banks will remain well above normal levels for much of the year. While the easy money raises the risk of inflation, the central bank cannot withdraw it before banks are on solid footing. 
 ''The exit will take place in baby steps,'' Mr. Kramer said. 
 The euro has fallen 4 percent against the dollar since November as investors perceive that the American economy is recovering more quickly. A continued decline in the currency would give the central bank slightly more room to increase interest rates without encouraging the euro to rise, which would hurt exports. 
 Last month the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, quoted staff forecasts for euro-zone growth of 0.1 percent to 1.5 percent in 2010. An upward revision of those conservative forecasts would surprise analysts and bolster those who predict an earlier rate increase.
 The governing council ''will emphasize that there's a recovery under way but there are still a lot of risks,'' said Rolf Schneider, an economist at Allianz in Frankfurt. Mr. Trichet may also express concern as to ''whether expansive monetary policy is promoting bubbles'' in stock or commodity markets, Mr. Schneider said. 
 Mr. Trichet has recently led the call for measures to avert financial crises. Analysts said that Mr. Trichet probably would avoid saying anything on Thursday that would alarm debt markets, while maintaining pressure on Greek leaders to cut public spending. While a financial bailout of any member state would have to be decided by the European Union as a whole, the central bank plays an important role in reassuring investors that Greece will not default on its debt.

HEADLINE: Nobel Winner to Step Down as Chief at Sloan-Kettering

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
Dr. Harold E. Varmus, the Nobel Prize-winning president and chief executive of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said Tuesday that he would be stepping down after 10 years as the head of the renowned Upper East Side medical institution. 
 Dr. Varmus, 70, made the announcement in his annual New Year's e-mail message to the staff, in which he also outlined expansion plans, possibly to clinical facilities on East 19th Street.
 He said he had asked the center's boards to begin looking for a successor but would remain in charge until they found one.
 ''It's more about the institution than it is about me,'' he said in an interview Tuesday. ''I'm very happy doing this job. I do think when people do jobs like this for years they get into ruts.''
 Colleagues described him as someone who easily traveled between the rumpled world of science -- he shared a Nobel Prize in 1989 for studies of genes that can cause cancer -- and the suit-clad world of fund-raising and philanthropy. He still rides a mountain bike to work on most days, appeared on ''The Daily Show'' last year to talk about government funding for disease research and has written about science-related books and movies for The New York Times.
 In his e-mail letter, Dr. Varmus said the center had exceeded its capital goal of $2 billion and was in ''calmer waters'' after losing 20 percent of its endowment to the recession.
 Dr. Varmus, a Freeport, Long Island, native, holds a master's degree in English from Harvard and a medical degree from Columbia. He arrived at the cancer center in 2000 after serving as director of the National Institutes of Health, having been appointed by President Clinton in 1993. He is a co-chairman of President Obama's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology.
 In the interview Tuesday, he repeatedly took umbrage at the idea that he was ''leaving'' his post, where he earned $2.76 million in compensation in 2008, according to tax filings. He said he planned to continue running his cancer research laboratory at the center and to stay in New York, where he can indulge his interests in the arts. He enthusiastically described giving science lectures during ''genes and jazz'' shows at various museums, accompanied by his older son, Jacob, a trumpet player.
 Richard I. Beattie, vice chairman of the cancer center's board, said Dr. Varmus had made strides in translating research to the bedside and in recruiting both clinicians and scientists.
 Of his next career move, Dr. Varmus said, ''I'm certainly open to possibility.''

HEADLINE: The Vagaries Of Bank Bonuses

BYLINE: By ROB COX and HUGO DIXON

 BODY:
This bonus season, would you rather be a banker at Goldman Sachs or Citigroup? Goldman has famously set aside more money to reward employees for their efforts last year. But the biggest bonuses will come mostly in stock, and Goldman's shares have surged from the lows of the crisis. Give other banks' shares a chance to catch up and bankers paid in the laggards' equity could wind up richer on 2009's spoils. 
 Consider Goldman's recovery. Last year's equity compensation was set when the stock traded at $78.78 a share. Since then, the market price has more than doubled. So an employee who received, say, half of a $500,000 bonus in stock wound up 12 months later with $250,000 in cash and shares worth $543,000. Not bad. 
 Given Goldman's stunning 2009 performance, that same employee may be on track for a $1 million payout this time -- though the equity component will most likely be higher, perhaps 80 percent. Indeed, Goldman's top 30 executives will receive nothing but restricted shares, a policy being mimicked across the industry. 
 A Citi banker who received the same $500,000 bonus a year ago, split 50-50, would be nursing a 50 percent loss on the equity part since then. Suppose that banker grabs a bonus this year that is 30 percent smaller than his Goldman peer, or $700,000, also with four-fifths of it in stock. He'd receive around 155,000 Citi shares. 
 The good news is, at $3.63, those shares are cheap compared with Citi's third-quarter book value, or assets minus liabilities, of $6.15 a share. Contrast that with Goldman, whose stock already trades at 1.6 times book value, a big premium to rivals. 
 Suppose Citi recovered to book value -- a goal that's not far-fetched -- and Goldman's shares stayed flat. The Citi banker's shares would then be worth around $950,000, for a total package of about $1.1 million, trumping the Goldman payout, at least in the short run. 
 Of course, this assumes the rally in Goldman shares is over, and that Citi can regain the full confidence of investors. Those are big ifs. But for employees of the biggest laggard in finance, there's always hope.
 On a Bank Levy
 A levy on bank liabilities would get the industry squealing, especially if it approached $120 billion. But the Obama administration isn't crazy to float the idea. A well-crafted tax could help recoup bailout costs while also giving banks an incentive to behave more sensibly. It doesn't have to apply just to the United States, either.
 Populism aside, the main rationale for a levy is that the size of a bank's liabilities is a reasonable proxy for the risk it poses to the financial system and for the benefit it received from the cheap money central banks doled out to offset the credit squeeze. It's reasonable that banks should pay for help from their lenders of last resort.
 There is one big proviso. Deposits should be taken out of the liability bucket. In the United States and elsewhere banks already pay insurance fees on deposits, so including them would amount to double taxation. Any new liability tax should focus just on wholesale finance, a riskier ''easy come, easy go'' form of funding. With such a charge in place, banks would have an incentive to build up their deposits, something that regulators across the world are urging them to do anyway.
 There is also one big question. Should such a tariff be an ongoing part of the fiscal framework or a one-time charge? The argument for permanence derives from its being viewed as an insurance premium paid in return for a continuing safety net.
 But there is a case for a special one-time levy in addition to an ongoing tax, to take account of the extraordinary assistance banks have received over the last two years. Walter Bagehot, the 19th-century British economist, said that in a crisis, central banks should lend freely but at penalty rates. During the recent crisis, the authorities thought banks were too fragile to pay through the nose for help. Now that the industry is again making bumper profits, there is an opportunity to call in that favor.

HEADLINE: Black Candidate's Decision Transforms New Orleans Race

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
Less than a month before the primary, the race for mayor here is a struggle over who will bring down the soaring murder rate, who will attract badly needed new businesses and who will guide the city in its still dauntingly long road to recovery. But it is also about something else. 
 ''It's always about race,'' said Lambert C. Boissiere Jr., a former state senator and currently the city constable. ''I don't know why we dance around it.''
 The balance of power between blacks and whites in New Orleans has been an issue for decades, a back-and-forth that has only intensified since Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, now that every election is a referendum on the future of the city. But a recent decision by a black candidate to drop out of the 2010 mayor's race has made the possibility of a white man in the city's most powerful office startlingly real. 
 For most of 2009, the mayor's race was a lackluster affair that attracted far less interest than Saints' football.
 The relatively low wattage of the candidates left an opening for Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu, who, despite months of denials, announced his entry at the last minute in early December. Mr. Landrieu has run unsuccessfully for mayor twice before, in 1994 and 2006. Since losing to the current mayor, C. Ray Nagin, four years ago, Mr. Landrieu has kept a moderate profile, using his position to promote Louisiana's tourism industry and cultural economy. (Mr. Nagin cannot run again because of term limits.)
 But many of those who preferred Mr. Nagin to Mr. Landrieu in 2006 have had a case of buyer's remorse, expressing disappointment at the current mayor's halting leadership in the years since Hurricane Katrina and an unending series of scandals at City Hall. And Mr. Landrieu has nearly universal name recognition: his sister Mary is a United States senator, and his father, Moon Landrieu, was mayor in the 1970s, the last white man to hold the job.
 In the weeks after Mr. Landrieu's announcement, the wisdom among political experts around town had generally been that the Feb. 6 primary would result in two candidates who would go on to compete in the March runoff: a white candidate, most likely Mr. Landrieu, and a black one. The black candidate was widely expected to be Edwin R. Murray, a state senator who is well respected if a little reserved for the rough and tumble of New Orleans politics.
 Mr. Murray was among the most successful fund-raisers and was better known than the other black candidates: Nadine Ramsey, a former Civil District Court judge; James Perry, director of a fair housing group; and Troy Henry, owner of a consulting firm. While few thought it was possible to beat Mr. Landrieu in the primary, the idea was that minds would concentrate in the runoff, and that black voters might rally to Mr. Murray's side.
 All of this arithmetic became irrelevant on Jan. 2, when Mr. Murray announced, to the shock of even some of his closest aides, that he was leaving the race. 
 ''Ed was going to be the guy to beat,'' said Robert Berning, Mr. Murray's media adviser.
 Mr. Murray's decision, several campaign aides said, was based on recent polls showing Mr. Landrieu with a huge lead, buttressed by considerable support among black voters, many of whom remember the racial barriers torn down by Mr. Landrieu's father. That lead was not insurmountable, but overcoming it would have required a large outlay of campaign money that just was not there. 
 Mr. Murray also said in a statement that he had dropped out to avoid a racially divisive campaign. But the fact that his announcement left Mr. Landrieu and John Georges, a white businessman and former candidate for governor, as two of the front-runners, may have fueled just that.
 The New Orleans Tribune, an African-American newsmagazine, called Mr. Murray's decision ''a betrayal of the black community.'' At a news conference, Mr. Henry castigated the news media for having ''prematurely crowned the next mayor as a white mayor.'' 
 Even though Mr. Georges has some prominent black supporters and Mr. Landrieu's own father helped bring African-Americans into City Hall, influential blacks around the city are already anxious about the possible effects of electing the first white mayor in 32 years.
 ''The mayor has always been the citadel of strength for the black community in this town,'' said Bernard L. Charbonnet Jr., a lawyer who is active in black political circles. ''It has always been the prize.'' 
 Black professionals refer to the office as ''the franchise,'' the counterweight to the economic power of New Orleans's white elite. For the past three decades, the black private sector -- the lawyers, businessmen and architects -- has relied on the franchise: they may not always be able to become board members at the city's white-owned firms, but black professionals turned to the city government for contracts and jobs.
 But after Hurricane Katrina, Mr. Charbonnet said, the importance of keeping the franchise often paled next to immediate crises, like the city's shortage of health care facilities, the slow recovery of the black middle-class neighborhoods of Gentilly and New Orleans East, and the widespread scattering of the city's population. Some members of the city's black middle class found Atlanta, St. Louis or Chicago to be more welcoming; though blacks are still in the majority here, their numbers have shrunk.
 ''We're not attuned to politics as we once were,'' Mr. Charbonnet said. But that is unfortunate, he added. The prospect of a white mayor, he said, is ''an earth-shaking event.''
 For this reason, black voters have been urged to rally around one of the remaining black candidates, and Mr. Henry seems to be gaining ground quickly. After all, Mr. Landrieu seemed poised to beat Mr. Nagin around this time in 2006, but Mr. Nagin won, 52 percent to 48 percent. (Mr. Landrieu's defeat may have owed more to his unpopularity among conservative whites, some of whom vow never to vote for a Landrieu.) 
 Still, some black power players are making calculations that they never thought they would. 
 Bill Rouselle, owner of a public relations and consulting firm, helped engineer Mr. Nagin's re-election in 2006 and had been working for Mr. Murray's campaign. Now he has agreed to join the Landrieu campaign. 
 ''The critical thing for the African-American community is to be much more focused on a clear agenda,'' he said.
 In recent years, Mr. Rouselle said, ''the agenda being followed became a secondary concern to getting a black person elected.''
 Mr. Rouselle said his daughter was even thinking of voting for Mr. Landrieu.
 ''For her to even consider voting for a white candidate is something totally different,'' he said. ''It's almost as big a deal as the prospect two years ago that we would have an African-American president of the United States.''

HEADLINE: Baseball To Monitor Marlins' Spending

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
The Florida Marlins on Tuesday committed to spend any proceeds from Major League Baseball's revenue-sharing plan on player development and salaries.
 The announcement, made in conjunction with Major League Baseball and its players union, was designed to allay concerns that the Marlins and other clubs were not spending the money on players, as required, and instead were using it to pay off debts and other noncore operations.
 The Marlins agreed to allow the league and union to monitor their finances for the next three years. 
 ''In response to our concerns that revenue-sharing proceeds have not been used as required, the Marlins have assured the union and the commissioner's office that they plan to use such proceeds to increase player payroll annually as they move toward the opening of their new ballpark,'' Michael Weiner, the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, said in a statement.
 The agreement, which forestalls a potential union grievance, allows for adjustments in the Marlins' spending plans to meet ''unforeseen developments'' and for arbitration ''if disagreements arise.'' The Marlins are building a new stadium and parking lots in Miami that are projected to cost $645 million.
 The announcement comes as the owners prepare to meet this week in Arizona, where baseball's revenue-sharing plan is likely to be a topic of debate. The union has been concerned that some small-market clubs like the Marlins have had the lowest payrolls for several years running.
 Commissioner Bud Selig is ''trying to get in front of the issue,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College who has written often about revenue sharing. ''It's a very positive sign that they were able to compromise instead of litigate. You don't want to go through all the acrimony and expense of a law suit.''
 Under the revenue-sharing plan, wealthier clubs transfer hundreds of millions of dollars each year to teams with weaker finances. 
 The goal is to create parity by offsetting the imbalance between big-market clubs that have access to more ticket, sponsorship and broadcast dollars and teams in smaller cities that have fewer opportunities.
 Since the system was set up in the late 1990s, wealthier clubs like the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox have complained that small-market teams that remained mired in last place have not been using their revenue-sharing money as designed. John Henry, the managing principal owner of the Red Sox, told The Boston Globelate last year in an e-mail message that ''over a billion dollars has been paid to seven chronically uncompetitive teams, five of whom have had baseball's highest operating profits. Who, except these teams, can think this is a good idea?''
 The player agent Scott Boras, eager to get clubs to pay top dollar for his clients, has echoed those concerns as well.
 This has forced some small-market teams to defend how they spend the money they receive under the revenue-sharing plan. Last month, Frank Coonelly, the president of the Pittsburgh Pirates, said that though his club has not increased its major league payroll, it has increased spending on international free agents and in the player draft, has overhauled its minor league system and added scouts.
 Criticism of the way small-market teams spend their revenue-sharing dollars is ''typically started by agents who want to get fans to pressure their clubs to sign free agents,'' Coonelly said. ''It's to get the Marlins, Rays, Pirates, etc., to overpay.'' 
 The Marlins, though, have been criticized more than most clubs because they have consistently spent far less than other clubs on salaries for their major league players. The Marlins have been last in total team payroll in three of the last four seasons. In 2006, the Marlins had a payroll of $15 million, less than one-third of the next highest club, the Tampa Bay Rays, and half the amount it received in revenue-sharing income, according to some estimates.
 David Samson, the president of the Marlins, said his club has never violated the league's Basic Agreement, which governs revenue sharing, and produced winning baseball teams.

HEADLINE: Super Bowl Sales as Economic Indicator

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE Federal Reserve Board may want to scrutinize another statistic to gauge the health of the economy: demand for ads during Super Bowls.
 As Super Bowl XLIV nears on Feb. 7, CBS is already ''very close to a sellout,'' a spokesman for the network, Dana McClintock, said on Tuesday. He declined to specify how much of the estimated 30 to 35 minutes of paid commercial time in the game was still available. 
 By contrast, at this point in 2009, when NBC was selling spots to be shown during the broadcast of Super Bowl XLIII on Feb. 1, considerably more time remained unsold. 
 ''Last year, time was being sold entering into a recession,'' Mr. McClintock said. ''This year, it's being sold apparently coming out of one.''
 Another difference is that a year ago, many marketers that bought Super Bowl spots were playing down their participation, fearing that the sour national mood made the usual hoopla seem inappropriate. Now, though, the hyperbole machine is being cranked up by many sponsors as they seek attention for their ad plans.
 Although Super Bowl ad mainstays like FedEx, General Motors and Pepsi-Cola have said they will skip this year's game, several newcomers have signed on, along with advertisers that buy Super Bowl spots irregularly. 
 They include Boost Mobile; the Census Bureau; Dockers, sold by Levi Strauss; a line of men's skin care products from Dove, part of Unilever; Electronic Arts; HomeAway, a vacation-rental listing service; Knowledge Generation Bureau, which offers a text-message information service under the KGB brand; Motorola; Pop-Secret popcorn, to be advertised with a sibling Emerald Nuts in a spot being bought by Diamond Foods; the truTV cable channel, owned by Time Warner; and Volkswagen. 
 ''There comes a time to step out of your comfort zone,'' said one first-timer, Chris Moss, creative chairman at KGB in New York. ''We're confident we can give viewers something entertaining to watch with a little more standout than the rest.''
 The company is deciding which of three commercials it will run in the 30-second slot it has bought during the third quarter, Mr. Moss said. The spots, created by the Brooklyn Brothers in New York, include one featuring two Baldwin brothers, Stephen and William.
 Papa John's International, which has in the past advertised before or after the game, is considering running spots in Super Bowl XLIV as part of an agreement the company has just signed with the National Football League to become its official pizza sponsor.
 ''We're still working out details of what we're going to be doing,'' said Andrew Varga, chief marketing officer at Papa John's in Louisville, Ky. The goal would be to complement the company's upbeat campaign, carrying the theme ''Papa's in the house,'' by Zimmerman Advertising in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., part of the Omnicom Group.
 ''It's a big-reward, big-risk situation,'' Mr. Varga said of the Super Bowl, ''but we feel that by participating we have an opportunity.''
 Whatever the decision, Mr. Varga said, Papa John's would proceed with the introduction on Friday of a tie-in product called the Super XL IV Pizza -- ''XL'' for extra large, ''IV'' for four toppings -- priced at $11.99.
 Volkswagen is back in the Super Bowl for the first time in nine years, said Tim Ellis, vice president for marketing at Volkswagen of America in Herndon, Va., because such an ''important media platform'' could generate attention for a new campaign from the brand's new agency, the Los Angeles office of Deutsch, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
 ''It's part of a strategy to broaden our appeal and open ourselves up to more of mainstream America,'' Mr. Ellis said. The Super Bowl is typically the most mainstream, and most watched, television show each year.
 ''The Super Bowl is an entertainment event where 100 million people gather around the television,'' said Scott Keogh, chief marketing officer at Audi of America, which, like Volkswagen of America, is based in Herndon and owned by the German automaker Volkswagen.
 Audi is returning to the game for a third consecutive year, Mr. Keogh said, because ''for us the Super Bowl is working'' in stimulating awareness and consideration for the Audi brand. The spot for Audi, by Venables Bell & Partners in San Francisco, will use the rock band Cheap Trick to promote the A3 TDI diesel.
 Audi and Volkswagen are among the auto and auto-related brands that will try to fill the vacuum left by the departure of G.M. Others include American Honda Motor, Bridgestone, Cars.com, Hyundai and Kia.
 Among the other advertisers that have bought commercials in the game are Anheuser-Busch InBev, CareerBuilder, Coca-Cola, Denny's, Walt Disney Pictures, Frito-Lay, E*Trade, GoDaddy, Mars, Monster, Paramount Pictures, Teleflora and Universal Pictures.
 CBS is charging an estimated $2.5 million to $2.8 million for each 30 seconds of commercial time in the game, meaning that some slots cost more and some less. When NBC began selling Super Bowl XLIII, some 30-second slots went for as much as $3 million; the rates fell as the economy dampened demand for such expensive air time.

HEADLINE: How to Stop America's Scientific Brain Drain

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Fighting Trend, China Is Luring Scientists Home'' (front page, Jan. 7):
 As a professor of biology at the California Institute of Technology, where a large fraction of our students are Asian, I found that your article rang true to me. Recently, one of my star Chinese graduate students announced to my surprise and consternation that he would return to China after completing his training. 
 Every move requires not only a pull, but also a push. By focusing on a scientist, Shi Yigong, who was a well-funded Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, the article did not mention a major force driving Asian and other foreign-born life scientists out of the United States: the difficulty in obtaining research funding from the National Institutes of Health.
 For example, the N.I.H. currently prohibits its funds from being used to support the graduate or the postdoctoral training of foreign-born science students, who make up the majority of our talent pool in many fields.
 In addition, the N.I.H.'s conservative review panels make it very difficult for young scientists to secure funding for creative, risky basic research, once they establish their own labs. This affects senior scientists as well.
 Recently, for example, two of my colleagues, both tenured full professors, left Caltech to take positions with Germany's well-funded Max Planck Institute. I myself came close to accepting such an offer.
 Our government research funding policies are driving some of our best scientists out of the country. The brain gain that we achieved after World War II is gradually being turned into a brain drain.
 David J. Anderson Pasadena, Calif., Jan. 7, 2010
 To the Editor: 
 The increase in foreign-born scientists who leave the United States to return home is the 21st-century equivalent of a Sputnik wake-up call and should galvanize American determination to maintain scientific leadership. Nothing less than our economy is at stake. 
 Some benefits of research quickly transcend borders, but economic impacts like new jobs and the resulting higher living standards mainly benefit the country of origin. 
 While United States spending on science was flat for years, others seized an opportunity. Japan, long the second-largest research and development spender, now trails China and India. How long until America's lead is overtaken, too?
 Will we put America back on track to stay the world's leader in science and innovation, or let other nations reap the gains in jobs, growth and quality of life that once gave us such a source of pride and economic strength?

HEADLINE: Talks to Begin on Creating a Bipartisan Budget Panel

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will begin talks this week with leading lawmakers about creating a bipartisan budget commission, an idea that has long languished in Congress but could become central to the Obama administration's promise to reduce annual deficits.
 The aim is to reach an agreement that could be a fallback if, as many expect, the Senate next Wednesday rejects a commission proposal from Senators Kent Conrad of North Dakota and Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the Democratic chairman and the senior Republican, respectively, on the Budget Committee. They want a panel to recommend budget cuts in time for Congress to vote after the November elections. 
 Yet the same partisan divisions that keep elected officials from cutting spending and raising taxes enough to rein in deficits are also at play in the debate over a panel to make those decisions and force action.
 The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has said tax increases should not be an option, while some Democrats see a budget panel as a threat to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
 ''A claim that any of those items should be off the table is a claim that you really don't want to do anything about the problem,'' Mr. Gregg said. ''You can't resolve the out-year financial problems of this country, which are massive, unless you have everything on the table.''
 Mr. Conrad and Mr. Gregg said in interviews that they did not yet have the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster threat. The White House, meanwhile, is considering whether to create a panel by executive order.
 The efforts to form a panel are moving ahead even as many liberals warn against too aggressive an effort to rein in deficits while the economy struggles to recover from the worst recession in generations. While large deficits and a mounting national debt could imperil the economy in the long run, raising taxes and cutting spending while the economy is operating at far below its capacity could further reduce demand for goods and services and dampen or endanger the recovery.
 Mr. Biden is taking the lead in trying to broker a compromise because of his relationships in the Senate, where he served for 36 years. The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, and Peter R. Orszag, the budget director, also are participating in the talks with Mr. Conrad and with Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the House Democratic leader.
 The administration, once cool to a commission, has been forced to become more supportive because the Senate must vote next week on raising the nation's debt limit so the government can keep borrowing to pay for its operations, and the White House lacks the 60 votes needed. Mr. Conrad and others have indicated they will not endorse an increase without action on an amendment to create a deficit-reduction panel.
 Mr. Orszag has emerged behind the scenes as a proponent of a panel, Democrats say, because of his sense that substantial steps to cut budget deficits will not occur otherwise given the polarization between the parties.
 But others, including Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff and a former Democratic House leader, have warned that Republican Congressional leaders would choose for a commission's Republican members only opponents of all tax increases, effectively sabotaging its work. 
 The makeup of a commission is a major issue, along with whether Congress would have to vote quickly and without amendments on its report. 
 Mr. Conrad and Mr. Gregg oppose an executive order, saying it would not force Congress to vote as a law could. They call for a law establishing a commission with members of Congress from each party and two administration officials. If 14 of the 18 members agree to a package of proposals, Congress would have to vote on it after the midterm elections. 
 Administration officials generally favor a panel made up of former lawmakers and budget experts, given the partisanship in Congress. 
 Leading House Democrats formerly opposed a commission altogether. They recently agreed to go along, if all sides can reach a package deal that also writes into law a ''pay as you go'' requirement that any new spending or tax cuts must be offset by spending cuts or tax increases.

HEADLINE: For All Its Success, Will 'Avatar' Change the Industry?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Just five months after Warner Brothers released its talking-picture sensation ''The Jazz Singer'' in October 1927, the studio was back in theaters with another talkie, the crime drama ''Tenderloin.''
 In today's Hollywood, things take a little longer.
 Even as James Cameron's science-fiction epic ''Avatar'' continues to dazzle the audience with its visual wizardry, filmmakers and studios are struggling to figure out when, if ever, viewers can expect an equally striking on-screen experience. With its combination of immersive 3-D images and a sophisticated performance-capture technology, the movie has, as of Sunday, taken in $1.3 billion in worldwide ticket sales, much of it from 3-D screens. 
 Asked last week if any similarly ambitious film were in the works, Alec Shapiro, senior vice-president for sales and marketing of Sony Corporation's content creation group, whose digital cameras were used on ''Avatar,'' was stumped. ''Not to my knowledge,'' he said. ''I can't, offhand, see another half-billion-dollar production.'' 
 Mr. Cameron and his producing partner, Jon Landau, have talked of possible sequels to ''Avatar.'' But 20th Century Fox, which distributed the movie and helped underwrite production and marketing costs of about $460 million, has yet to announce plans for any successor to a film that was at least 15 years in the making.
 In a research report published by Barclays Capital on Wednesday, Anthony J. DiClemente and George L. Hawkey called ''Avatar'' an ''outlier'': a unique event that leaves the business environment around it largely intact.
 ''While 'Avatar' is likely a watershed for digital and 3-D technology,'' they wrote, ''it does not tell us that the underlying economics of the film business have changed.'' 
 Mr. DiClemente and Mr. Hawkey predicted that ''Avatar'' would be a moneymaker, though they do not expect imitators anytime soon. In a detailed financial model of the film, they estimated that Fox and its partners would see slightly more than $1 billion in pretax profit from their investment in ''Avatar.''
 As for cinematic technology, the achievement of ''Avatar'' was not so much a single leap -- like the one from silent film to sound -- as an integration of complex filmmaking systems that allowed Mr. Cameron to combine live actors and computer animation in a relatively seamless, and believable, blend of fantasy and the real world. Critics and audiences noted a qualitative difference between what they saw on the screen in ''Avatar'' and what they saw in other recent films that used 3-D or motion-capture technology.
 At its core was a 3-D ''virtual'' camera, developed by Mr. Cameron in partnership with the effects expert Vince Pace. The camera and its rigging systems allow a director to view actors within a computer-generated virtual environment, even as they are working on a ''performance-capture'' set that may have little apparent relationship to what appears on the screen.
 Among the next films to use the same system will be ''Tron: Legacy,'' a cyberspace adventure due from the director Joseph Kosinski and Walt Disney this December. Another is ''The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn,'' directed by Steven Spielberg and set for release by Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures in late 2011. 
 But it is not clear, for instance, that Mr. Spielberg's use of the technology -- and reliance on Weta Digital, the company made famous by Peter Jackson and that produced the effects for ''Avatar'' -- will strike viewers in the same way as Mr. Cameron's fantasy moon and blue aliens.
 ''We can't talk about what it's going to look like, because that process goes on for another two years, practically,'' said Marvin Levy, Mr. Spielberg's longtime spokesman.
 (''A Christmas Carol'' from the filmmaker Robert Zemeckis used motion capture and 3-D technology, but looked wholly different from ''Avatar'' and took in just $137 million in domestic theaters after Walt Disney released it in early November.)
 So far, Guillermo del Toro, who is expected to direct the first of a two-part fantasy series based on ''The Hobbit'' for release in 2012, has stuck with a plan to film that movie with more conventional, 2-D techniques, even though Mr. Jackson -- a powerful force behind both ''Avatar'' and ''Tintin'' -- is among his producers.
 Executives of Warner's New Line Cinema unit, one of the studios behind the project, have in the past said that they believed that 2-D would be well suited to the sense of intimacy they anticipated from ''The Hobbit'' and its fantasy universe -- and nothing about ''Avatar'' appears to have changed that plan.
 Still, some filmmakers were sufficiently inspired, or jolted, by ''Avatar'' to shift gears. Shortly after seeing ''Avatar'' last month, for instance, Bryan Singer, who in the past directed summer blockbusters like ''X-Men'' and ''Superman Returns,'' asked New Line to consider using 3-D in filming his planned fantasy ''Jack the Giant Killer.'' The debate continues, according to people who have been briefed on the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity because of studio policy.
 Katie Martin Kelley, a spokeswoman for Paramount, said that studio had made no decision about whether its planned ''Transformers'' and ''Star Trek'' sequels would make the leap to 3-D, possibly giving the audience another sampling of the kind of immersive world devised by Mr. Cameron.
 Michael Bay, whose third ''Transformers'' film is set for release in July of next year, declined to be interviewed about his plans. 
 J. J. Abrams, who is developing another ''Star Trek'' film to be shot in the next couple of years, also declined to be interviewed about his plans for that franchise. But Paramount executives have already begun debating whether to shoot the next film in 3-D, even if that increases the cost and production difficulty, according to one person who was briefed on the talks but spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. 
 Asked whether he would consider making a movie on the scale of ''Avatar,'' Brad Grey, the chairman of Paramount, said in an interview in early December, ''With a lot of sleepless nights, I guess I would.''
 But the ''Transformers'' and ''Star Trek'' sequels are at least a year and a half away. And a new ''Spider-Man'' episode is not due until 2012, now that Sony Pictures has canceled a planned fourth installment from the director Sam Raimi and the star Tobey Maguire, choosing instead to focus on a reinvention of the series, with a new director and cast.
 That leaves a long stretch during which moviegoers, tantalized by ''Avatar,'' will be watching fantasy films like ''Iron Man 2'' from Marvel Entertainment and Paramount or ''Jonah Hex'' from Warner and Legendary Pictures, neither of which is as technologically ambitious as Mr. Cameron's recent film.
 Speaking by telephone last week, Mr. Landau said the ''Avatar'' innovations were perfectly suited to prospective projects like ''Battle Angel,'' a film that is based on a Japanese comic and that has been in development for Mr. Cameron to direct at Fox.
 While he and Mr. Cameron have not settled on their next project, Mr. Landau said he believed a new, ''Avatar''-like film could now be made in no more than the two years or so it takes to produce many effects-driven films, and for no more expense. 
 Asked how quickly the next such movie might arrive, Mr. Landau said, ''I hope sooner, rather than later, and not just from us.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 14, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the effect some of the technologies used to make the film ''Avatar'' might have on future movies, including ''The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn,'' erroneously included a studio among those releasing that film. It will be released by Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures, but not in conjunction with DreamWorks. (Steven Spielberg of DreamWorks is the director.)

HEADLINE: Arbitron's Chief Resigns After a False Statement

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
A single imprecise sentence uttered during hours of Congressional testimony prompted the resignation of the chief executive of Arbitron, Michael Skarzynski, on Monday.
 The misleading statement came during testimony that Mr. Skarzynski gave on Dec. 2. He was defending the company's Portable People Meter radio-ratings system, which uses electronic meters that measure radio-listening habits. It had come under fire -- and received Congressional attention -- because several minority broadcasters contended that the system undercounted minority listeners and hurt Hispanic and urban broadcasters.
 The faulty piece of the testimony came during an extended question-and-answer period. 
 ''As a matter of fact, two Saturdays ago, I spent the afternoon with one of our local market coaches in Prince Georges County here in Maryland and worked with the panelists, this particular household, to help them through the process,'' Mr. Skarzynski told officials, in response to a question about how he was making changes. 
 But, in fact, he had not been present, Arbitron executives said on a conference call and in a securities filing on Tuesday. 
 On Monday, Mr. Skarzynski resigned, and was replaced as chief executive by William T. Kerr, a member of the board. The news came as Arbitron announced it had failed to achieve accreditation for the Portable People Meter system in several markets. 
 A spokesman for Representative Darrell Issa of California, the ranking Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which ran the hearing, said his office had not been aware of the problematic testimony until Monday, when Arbitron contacted the committee about it. 
 Mr. Skarzynski had violated a company policy, Alton L. Adams, an Arbitron executive, wrote in a letter to Mr. Issa and Edolphus Towns, Democratic of New York, the committee chairman. ''Mr. Skarzynski has accepted responsibility for his actions and resigned,'' the letter read. ''Mr. Skarzynski's actions were inconsistent with our corporate values.''
 Mr. Adams also requested an amendment to the hearing record. 
 ''Anytime anyone gives inaccurate statements to Congress, we expect the highest degree of accountability and action to address it,'' Kurt Bardella, Mr. Issa's spokesman, said in an e-mail message. ''To their credit, Arbitron has taken immediate and substantial action to address Mr. Skarzynski's inaccurate statement.''
 The Portable People Meter is a device the size of a pager that picks up signals from radio stations, and transmits listening habits of panelists back to Arbitron. Arbitron is replacing a paper-based system with the meter in most major markets this year.
 Arbitron switched several major markets to the meter in 2008, and several Hispanic and black broadcasting and advertising groups filed complaints with and asked for investigations by Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and some state attorneys general, complaining about perceived flaws in the system. 
 ''It disproportionately hurt minority broadcasters because minorities are the hardest segment of the population to recruit and maintain in a sample,'' Ceril Shagrin, the executive vice president of corporate research for Univision Communications, a Spanish-language broadcaster that has objected to the system, said in an interview.
 On Monday night, Arbitron said it had failed to reach accreditation for the meter system in several major markets. The Media Rating Council, which audits and sets standards for audience ratings in media, had denied accreditation to Arbitron in Los Angeles, New York and other major cities. The council did give accreditation in Minneapolis-St. Paul.
 Arbitron said in a statement that it would continue to work with the council to win accreditation in those markets.

HEADLINE: Contractor Jailed in Cuba Was Aiding Religious Groups, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON and MARC LACEY; Ginger Thompson reported from Washington, and Marc Lacey from Mexico City.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The United States contractor detained in Cuba last month and accused of being a spy is a 60-year-old social worker from the Washington suburbs who had gone to Cuba to provide communications equipment to Jewish nonprofit organizations, according to American officials.
 In postings on the Internet, the contractor, Alan P. Gross -- whose identify had not previously been made public -- said he had more than 20 years' experience in development work around the world. One of his Internet networking sites said he had been a volunteer field organizer for Barack Obama's presidential campaign. 
 American officials say that Mr. Gross had gone to Cuba as part of a United States government program and was providing encouragement and financial assistance to religious nonprofit groups. The officials acknowledge that Mr. Gross entered Cuba without the proper visa, though they contend that he was not involved in any activities that posed a violent threat to the Cuban government. And they flatly dispute any allegations that he is a spy.
 The Cuban government, however, has characterized his work as a threat to national security.
 In the United States, where Cuba continues to fire political passions, Mr. Gross's detention has become the source of new tensions between Washington and Havana, and it threatens to ignite more debate on Capitol Hill about how the Obama administration ought to proceed in its Cuba policy.
 Specifically, the case has raised questions about whether the administration should continue a Bush administration practice of sending development workers to conduct the kind of semicovert operations that landed Mr. Gross in jail.
 Mr. Gross has visited Cuba several times, delivering computer and satellite equipment to three Jewish community groups, according to people with knowledge of his work.
 In December, they said, he was on a follow-up trip for Development Alternatives Inc., a contractor working with the United States Agency for International Development. The people who know about his work, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on the matter, said Mr. Gross was sent to research how the groups were making use of the equipment he had previously distributed to them.
 ''His work in Cuba was focused on facilitating communications among people in a nonviolent, nondissident religious organization,'' DAI said in a statement.
 Details about Mr. Gross and his work in Cuba slowly began to emerge this week. Mr. Gross studied social work at the University of Maryland and the Virginia Commonwealth University, and he had a long career as an international development worker that took him to at least 50 countries. 
 In 2001, he started a company called Joint Business Development Center, whose Web site says it has ''supported Internet connectivity in locations where there was little or no access,'' including Iraq, Afghanistan, Armenia and Kuwait. Records show his company earned less than $70,000 last year. 
 One friend, Howard Feinberg, said, ''The Alan I know is someone who is concerned only about helping improve the human condition, not meddling in people's politics.''
 President Obama came to office promising a new era of engagement with Cuba. But after lifting some restrictions on travel and remittances, he has been reluctant to take further steps, citing continuing reports of human rights abuses in Cuba. Some Cuba experts have said that Mr. Gross's arrest may harden Mr. Obama's stance.
 Cuba, meanwhile, said the episode signaled that Mr. Obama was just as committed to overthrowing the government as his predecessor was. 
 Havana has used Mr. Gross's arrest as an opportunity to raise an old grievance: America's long prison terms for five Cuban agents convicted of spying on Cuban exile organizations. Havana maintains that the agents were in the United States to prevent terrorist acts against Cuba and has called on the Obama administration to release them.
 As for Mr. Gross, Cuba has said little. The government has not formally charged him with a crime. Cuban authorities have provided the United States almost no information, nor have they made any demands. 
 As a result, Washington and many American experts on Cuba have been left speculating about Havana's intentions. 
 ''The Cuban regime is obviously looking for some kind of U.S. concession, callously using the contractor as a bargaining chip,'' said Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
 Some American officials said they suspected that Cuba aimed to shine light on A.I.D.'s undercover Cuba programs, whose financing has grown in the past decade from about $5 million to over $45 million a year and have a history of mismanagement.
 Senator John Kerry, chairman of the powerful Foreign Relations Committee, has called for a comprehensive review of the A.I.D. programs. 
 Representative Bill Delahunt, Democrat of Massachusetts, meanwhile, asked whether there might be other ways to provide information to nongovernmental groups. ''If we want to have influence on the island, what makes sense?'' he said.
 Others say that sometimes covert actions are necessary. 
 ''This is the kind of thing we do all over the world when we are trying to reach people their governments don't want us to reach,'' said an aide to a Democratic senator. ''It's naive to think that if we asked Cuba for permission, we'd get it.''

HEADLINE: Corzine, in Farewell, Admits Failure to Relieve Tax Burden

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
In a farewell address tinged with more wistfulness than Wall Street bravado, Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey acknowledged on Tuesday his inability to solve the state's mounting fiscal problems and said he hoped that he would be remembered for his commitment to the state's children. 
 Mr. Corzine, a former chief executive at Goldman Sachs who has referred to himself as an old banker, expressed regret that he had been unable to provide enough government streamlining and economic growth to ease New Jersey's persistent budget deficits and onerous tax burden as the state struggles through the recession. 
 Before a joint session of the Legislature for his fourth and final State of the State address, Mr. Corzine bluntly admitted that he was leaving behind the same problem he had inherited: ''Let's face it: Everyone's property taxes are too damn high.''
 But Mr. Corzine said he was proud to have made enduring improvements to the lives of millions of the state's most vulnerable residents by dedicating billions to rebuild schools and to pay for preschool education for 50,000 children and health care for 100,000 children.
 ''As a father and a grandfather,'' he said, his voice wavering, ''I believe that the first priority of government after providing for domestic safety must be to protect the health and welfare of our children. That means all of our children. Not just those who were fortunate enough to be born into strong and loving families. Not just those whose parents have wherewithal.''
 Mr. Corzine, who was never warmly embraced by the state's Democrat establishment, which he helped bankroll, was greeted by sustained applause when he entered the chamber and a polite, though hardly rousing, standing ovation. While his voice appeared to break at several points during the 30-minute address, there were few other signs of emotion outside the rows where Mr. Corzine's family and closest friends were seated. 
 The governor did not hesitate to thank the elected officials gathered there for their bipartisanship and teamwork. 
 He praised lawmakers for helping to pay for a new tunnel for commuter trains to Manhattan, approving a ban on so-called pay-to-play and instituting other ethics reforms, making the state a leader in wind and solar energy and financing programs to help former convicts adjust to society. 
 Mr. Corzine offered congratulations to Governor-elect Christopher J. Christie, who defeated him in November, and urged the state's residents to unite behind him. But he also challenged Mr. Christie not to close the state's $8 billion budget gap on the backs of its neediest residents.
 ''For example, we can all understand that scaling back FamilyCare could bring budget savings in the here and now, but that might well come at a steep cost in the not-too-distant future in children's lives,'' he said. ''Under-resourcing our new education funding formula might help balance the books today, but it will limit our children tomorrow while running the risk of a return to court-mandated educational policies.''
 Mr. Corzine, who left the chamber for a ski vacation in Switzerland, has not disclosed his plans for the next chapter of his life beyond promising to continue advocating for the social and economic policies he believes in.
 Republicans, who fought bitterly with Mr. Corzine over his failed plan to sell the New Jersey Turnpike and increase tolls, said that whatever his shortcomings, the governor deserved credit for avoiding the unethical conduct that had felled so many New Jersey Democrats. 
 ''I think he's a decent man with good intentions,'' said State Senator Tom Kean Jr., the minority leader. ''But he didn't achieve the expectations he set out for himself and that people elected him to accomplish -- which was to make the state more affordable.''
 Jim Florio, the last New Jersey governor to be ousted after a single term, said that despite Mr. Corzine's current unpopularity, he expected him to be viewed more favorably as the years passed. 
 ''It's always harder to be a governor going into a recession rather than coming out of one,'' Mr. Florio said. ''I think he did the best he could with the economic situation and personality tools he had to work with.''

HEADLINE: Seeking a Way to Pay For Green Makeovers

BYLINE: By ALEC APPELBAUM

 BODY:
Last year, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed four laws and two programs that would have required the owners of New York's largest buildings to pay for improvements to make their properties more energy-efficient. 
 The City Council passed a modified version of the proposal in December that required landlords to audit their buildings' energy use once a decade and publish the results, but made investments to reduce energy waste optional. 
 Building owners had questioned the feasibility of mandated improvements, arguing that they often bear the burden of paying for investments without any codified way to share costs with tenants. 
 Sean Neill, a 37-year-old economist who started a consulting company a year ago to address the murky question of how landlords might pay for retrofits, says change will be very difficult to achieve if it does not address the way leases are written. 
 In most cases, leases put responsibility for capital costs like boilers and air-conditioners on owners and responsibility for operating costs like oil and electric bills on tenants. A list of ''recoverable expenses'' in a lease often excludes changes to heating, lighting and insulation that can make a building more energy-efficient and pleasant for tenants. 
 David Cheikin, vice president for leasing at Brookfield Properties, a publicly traded company that owns 20.6 million square feet of New York area office space, including the World Financial Center, said the current lease structure gave owners little incentive to invest in their properties, even as their buildings became the equivalent of gas guzzlers. 
 ''As the stock of office buildings in New York continues to age,'' he said, ''there's standard language in a New York City class A office lease that says you can't throw money into the building and expect tenants to repay it.'' 
 Mr. Neill wants to change that roadblock, which landlords call the ''split incentive.'' Last fall, the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental advocacy organization, hired him to hold a forum that brought together major landlords, brokers and tenants to discuss how a ''green lease'' might work.
 Working with the N.R.D.C. and another advocacy group, the Environmental Defense Fund, Mr. Neill's firm, called Cycle-7, is preparing to discuss with large commercial tenants ways to revise the standard leases used in commercial real estate, developing a way to share the costs and benefits of energy upgrades. 
 The idea has traction. 
 ''The way existing documents work, you probably would not in many cases have savings going to the guy who owns the more efficient equipment,'' said Jonathan Mechanic, head of the real estate practice at the law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. 
 Mr. Neill's task is complex because landlords hesitate in a weak economy to ask tenants to accept anything that might be an extra expense. ''We're very much in favor of setting up leases like this,'' said Mr. Cheikin. ''But we've had the luxury of being a stable landlord with a large balance sheet.'' If he had to scramble for every new tenant to stay solvent, Mr. Cheikin said, the idea of pushing a new kind of lease would be intimidating. 
 Many landlords and environmentalists expect retrofits will become basic to commercial leasing as the city's new law takes effect and as more information becomes publicly available about the energy waste in buildings. 
 ''If you publish your data,'' Mr. Neill said, ''potential tenants will see it and move to a building that works better, or potential investors will press you to improve your building.''
 There are many possible approaches to figuring out how to finance improvements. One that Mr. Neill has suggested would involve the city's forgiving tenants some of their commercial occupancy tax if they agree to help pay for better systems. 
 ''Cycle-7 has a creative concept,'' said Mr. Mechanic, the lawyer. ''The problem is absent some kind of legislative solution, you're doing something with a potential for litigation.''
 While nobody can force tenants to share costs, Mr. Neill said, companies with global brands will want the halo effect of occupying green buildings, and the skill to discern useful retrofits that might be required under future regulations.

HEADLINE: Illinois Tries United Front Against Fish and Lawsuit

BYLINE: By EMMA GRAVES FITZSIMMONS

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Federal and state officials from Illinois on Tuesday defended their efforts to ward off Asian carp, a voracious, nonnative fish that could threaten the ecosystem of the Great Lakes, even as they reported new evidence that the fish may be near Lake Michigan. 
 Facing a legal challenge over the issue from Michigan, which is demanding the closing of Chicago-area waterways that lead to the lakes, the leaders from Illinois met at an aquarium beside Lake Michigan and sought to present a united front. 
 Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said that closing the waterways, where signs of the carp have been found, could cause economic problems for the shipping industry as well as flood thousands of homes. 
 ''We are not in denial about the threat of this invasive species,'' Mr. Durbin said. ''The purpose of this meeting is to make it clear that we are doing things proactively, and we will continue to.''
 Still, during the meeting on Tuesday, officials from the Army Corps of Engineers acknowledged that genetic material from the Asian carp had been found in a channel beyond an elaborate barrier system that was designed to stop their journey north through the Mississippi River system and into the Great Lakes. Traces of the fish were found in samples gathered in October at a pumping station in Wilmette, Ill., a suburb north of Chicago that is not far from Lake Michigan, officials said.
 That marked the second time genetic material from the carp was discovered beyond the barrier. The first finding, in a canal south of Chicago, was announced in November. Live fish have yet to be discovered past the barrier. The barrier system, which acts like a powerful electric fence, has been a major part of efforts since 2002 to prevent the spread of the carp, a big, hungry fish that, scientists say, can take over an ecosystem by eating the plankton needed by native species. 
 ''This has been an urgent situation for a number of years that has evolved into an imminent crisis,'' said Henry Henderson, the director of the Midwest program for the Natural Resources Defense Council. He called the response at Tuesday's meeting ''surprisingly lackadaisical.'' 
 In December, the State of Michigan filed a lawsuit against the State of Illinois. Other Great Lakes states, including Minnesota, New York, Ohio and Wisconsin, and the Canadian province of Ontario have supported Michigan's effort. Among other things, Michigan has called for an injunction to close the locks along the Chicago-area waterways. The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider the issue during a private conference on Friday. 
 Michigan's attorney general, Mike Cox, a Republican who is running for governor, said he was disappointed that Illinois officials appeared more concerned with local interests than the health of the Great Lakes.
 ''It is distressing that inaction on the part of a state with only a few miles of shoreline is threatening the economy and ecology of Michigan and every other state in the Great Lakes basin,'' Mr. Cox said in a statement. 
 Senator Durbin said the lawsuit was unhelpful. ''Let's not meet in the courtroom,'' he said. ''Let's meet in the halls of Congress to find a way to come up with a solution.''

HEADLINE: Obama to Propose Bank Tax To Recoup Bailout Losses

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama has decided to seek a tax on big banks to recoup up to $120 billion that the government expects to lose from bailing out the financial system, automakers and some troubled homeowners. 
 Mr. Obama will announce the bank fee on Thursday, and it is intended to be temporary but would probably last for several years, a senior administration official said late Tuesday. 
 Advisers earlier in the week had said that a number of options, including the tax on banks, were under consideration. 
 ''As the banking industry recovered the president and the economic team felt it was important to discuss ways to recoup every dime for the American people more quickly than the law required,'' the official said.
 The law that created the $700 billion financial rescue effort in 2008 mandated that the White House try to recover any losses by 2013. 
 The proposal will be part of the budget that Mr. Obama sends to Congress in February. By promoting the idea now, the administration is trying to respond to rising resentment of Wall Street, which is poised to award big bonuses to top employees, even as unemployment remains high.
 Thursday will be the second day of the opening hearings of a Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, which Congress has charged with reporting on the roots of the banking system's near-collapse. Executives of the nation's four largest banks are testifying on Wednesday.
 The administration is capping the total revenue it wants to generate from the tax at $120 billion because it expects to lose no more than that.

HEADLINE: Is China The Next Enron?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: Taipei, Taiwan 

 BODY:
 Reading The Herald Tribune over breakfast in Hong Kong harbor last week, my eye went to the front-page story about how James Chanos -- reportedly one of America's most successful short-sellers, the man who bet that Enron was a fraud and made a fortune when that proved true and its stock collapsed -- is now warning that China is ''Dubai times 1,000 -- or worse'' and looking for ways to short that country's economy before its bubbles burst.
 China's markets may be full of bubbles ripe for a short-seller, and if Mr. Chanos can find a way to make money shorting them, God bless him. But after visiting Hong Kong and Taiwan this past week and talking to many people who work and invest their own money in China, I'd offer Mr. Chanos two notes of caution. 
 First, a simple rule of investing that has always served me well: Never short a country with $2 trillion in foreign currency reserves.
 Second, it is easy to look at China today and see its enormous problems and things that it is not getting right. For instance, low interest rates, easy credit, an undervalued currency and hot money flowing in from abroad have led to what the Chinese government Sunday called ''excessively rising house prices'' in major cities, or what some might call a speculative bubble ripe for the shorting. In the last few days, though, China's central bank has started edging up interest rates and raising the proportion of deposits that banks must set aside as reserves -- precisely to head off inflation and take some air out of any asset bubbles.
 And that's the point. I am reluctant to sell China short, not because I think it has no problems or corruption or bubbles, but because I think it has all those problems in spades -- and some will blow up along the way (the most dangerous being pollution). But it also has a political class focused on addressing its real problems, as well as a mountain of savings with which to do so (unlike us). 
 And here is the other thing to keep in mind. Think about all the hype, all the words, that have been written about China's economic development since 1979. It's a lot, right? What if I told you this: ''It may be that we haven't seen anything yet.''
 Why do I say that? All the long-term investments that China has made over the last two decades are just blossoming and could really propel the Chinese economy into the 21st-century knowledge age, starting with its massive investment in infrastructure. Ten years ago, China had a lot bridges and roads to nowhere. Well, many of them are now connected. It is also on a crash program of building subways in major cities and high-speed trains to interconnect them. China also now has 400 million Internet users, and 200 million of them have broadband. Check into a motel in any major city and you'll have broadband access. America has about 80 million broadband users.
 Now take all this infrastructure and mix it together with 27 million students in technical colleges and universities -- the most in the world. With just the normal distribution of brains, that's going to bring a lot of brainpower to the market, or, as Bill Gates once said to me: ''In China, when you're one-in-a-million, there are 1,300 other people just like you.'' 
 Equally important, more and more Chinese students educated abroad are returning home to work and start new businesses. I had lunch with a group of professors at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, or HKUST, who told me that this year they will be offering some 50 full scholarships for graduate students in science and technology. Major U.S. universities are sharply cutting back. 
 Tony Chan, a Hong Kong-born mathematician, recently returned from America after 20 years to become the new president of HKUST. What was his last job in America? Assistant director of the U.S. National Science Foundation in charge of the mathematical and physical sciences. He's one of many coming home. 
 One of the biggest problems for China's manufacturing and financial sectors has been finding capable middle managers. The reverse-brain drain is eliminating that problem as well.
 Finally, as Liu Chao-shiuan, Taiwan's former prime minister, pointed out to me: when Taiwan moved up the value chain from low-end, labor-intensive manufacturing to higher, value-added work, its factories moved to China or Vietnam. It lost them. In China, low-end manufacturing moves from coastal China to the less developed Western part of the country and becomes an engine for development there. In Taiwan, factories go up and out. In China, they go East to West. 
 ''China knows it has problems,'' said Liu. ''But this is the first time it has a chance to actually solve them.'' Taiwanese entrepreneurs now have more than 70,000 factories in China. They know the place. So I asked several Taiwanese businessmen whether they would ''short'' China. They vigorously shook their heads no as if I'd asked if they'd go one on one with LeBron James.
 But, hey, some people said the same about Enron. Still, I'd rather bet against the euro. Shorting China today? Well, good luck with that, Mr. Chanos. Let us know how it works out for you.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Widen Trade Deficit As Exports Grow Marginally

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The trade deficit in the United States widened more than expected in November, offering positive signs that American businesses and consumers were growing more confident about spending as the economy slowly improved. 
 The deficit totaled $36.4 billion in November, up 9.7 percent from October. The chief cause of the bigger trade gap was rising prices on oil imports.
 Still, there were indications that spending on other foreign goods was growing: imports of items like computers and software rose 3.8 percent, and industrial supplies rose 5.1 percent.
 As the economy recovers, companies appear to be expanding by buying equipment like telephones and electronics. At the same time, Americans are spending more on foreign-made goods like toys and cosmetics.
 ''We're not back yet to what I would call a fully functioning economy, but we are heading in the right direction,'' said Robert A. Dye, senior economist PNC Financial Services Group. ''There are positive signs of healing for both the United States and global economies.'' 
 Demand for American products overseas, however, was tepid in November, with exports increasing a modest 0.9 percent from October to $138.2 billion. While that was the highest level in a year, the pace slowed from increases of nearly 3 percent in the two months before. Exports of food, cars and semiconductors increased, while aircraft and consumer goods declined.
 Imports rose 2.6 percent in November, largely because crude imports rose to $17.8 billion, from $17.4 billion in October. 
 Some analysts consider a surge in exports a crucial part of the rebound, and many say they believe export growth accelerated in the last three months of 2009. A weak dollar, which makes American products like tractors and soybeans cheaper overseas, could increase the appetite for American products and help spur growth domestically. 
 ''Exports should continue to rise, but it will likely be countered by a bigger increase in imports,'' said Michelle Meyer, United States economist at Barclays Capital.
 The deficit with China, which is the United States' largest with any country and is the most politically charged, narrowed by 10.8 percent in November.

HEADLINE: Football and Antitrust

 BODY:
On the surface, American Needle Inc. v. National Football League seems to be about hats, shirts and other items with team logos on them. But if the United States Supreme Court issues a broad ruling in favor of the N.F.L., it could help define how far joint ventures can go in stifling competition. 
 American Needle used to manufacture apparel with team logos, but the N.F.L. entered into an exclusive deal with Reebok nine years ago. American Needle sued, charging that the arrangement illegally restrained trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. 
 The trial court ruled that the law did not apply and that the case could not go forward. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, agreed in a poorly reasoned decision, ruling that the N.F.L. was not covered by Section 1 because it is a ''single entity,'' and, therefore, not capable of restraining trade. This ruling is wrong on the law and disagrees with many other federal courts.
 Although it won before the appeals court, the N.F.L. urged the Supreme Court to take the case, perhaps hoping for a broad ruling that would cement its monopoly power. The court, which is scheduled to hear the case on Wednesday, should reverse the appeals court decision and allow the case to proceed.
 To fall under the ''single entity'' exception that the courts have recognized, the N.F.L. would have to be a single economic entity. But the league is actually a cooperative effort of 32 separately owned, profit-making teams. They compete in everything from hiring to ticket sales. They should have to comply with Section 1.
 If the N.F.L.'s exemption is upheld, it would allow the teams to artificially inflate the prices of their insignia items. It could also clear the way for the teams to eliminate competition in other areas. In a friend-of-the-court brief, the National Football League Players Association argued that the league's position in this case is a ''Trojan horse'' designed to free them from the requirements of Section 1 when it comes to paying and assigning players.
 If the N.F.L. wins, the Consumer Federation of America warned, other joint ventures -- including health care networks and credit card networks -- could try to use the ruling to block the government's efforts to promote competition in their industries.
 The Sherman Act was designed to promote robust economic competition. Treating 32 separate professional teams as a single actor, and freeing them from the requirements of the act, undermines that important goal.

HEADLINE: GOOGLE MAY END VENTURE IN CHINA OVER CENSORSHIP

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS and MIGUEL HELFT; Andrew Jacobs reported from Beijing, and Miguel Helft and John Markoff from San Francisco. David Barboza contributed reporting from Shanghai, and Jonathan Ansfield from Beijing.

 BODY:
This article was reported by Andrew Jacobs, Miguel Helft and John Markoff and written by Mr. Jacobs.
 BEIJING -- Google said Tuesday that it would stop cooperating with Chinese Internet censorship and consider shutting down its operations in the country altogether, citing assaults from hackers on its computer systems and China's attempts to ''limit free speech on the Web.''
 The move, if followed through, would be a highly unusual rebuke of China by one of the largest and most admired technology companies, which had for years coveted China's 300 million Web users. 
 Since arriving here in 2006 under an arrangement with the government that purged its Chinese search results of banned topics, Google has come under fire for abetting a system that increasingly restricts what citizens can read online. 
 Google linked its decision to sophisticated cyberattacks on its computer systems that it suspected originated in China and that were aimed, at least in part, at the Gmail user accounts of Chinese human rights activists. 
 Those attacks, which Google said took place last week, were directed at some 34 companies or entities, most of them in Silicon Valley, California, according to people with knowledge of Google's investigation into the matter. The attackers may have succeeded in penetrating elaborate computer security systems and obtaining crucial corporate data and software source codes, though Google said it did not itself suffer losses of that kind.
 While the scope of the hacking and the motivations and identities of the hackers remained uncertain, Google's response amounted to an unambiguous repudiation of its own five-year courtship of the vast China market, which most major multinational companies consider crucial to their growth prospects. It is also likely to enrage the Chinese authorities, who deny that they censor the Internet and are accustomed to having major foreign companies adapt their practices to Chinese norms.
 The company said it would try to negotiate a new arrangement to provide uncensored results on its search site, google.cn. But that is a highly unlikely prospect in a country that has the most sweeping Web filtering system in the world. Google said it would otherwise cease to run google.cn and would consider shutting its offices in China, where it employs some 700 people, many of them highly compensated software engineers, and has an estimated $300 million in annual revenue.
 Google executives declined to discuss in detail their reasons for overturning their China strategy. But despite a costly investment, the company has a much smaller share of the search market here than it does in other major markets, commanding only about one in three searches by Chinese. The leader in searches, Baidu, is a Chinese-run company that enjoys a close relationship with the government.
 Google executives have privately fretted for years that the company's decision to censor the search results on google.cn, to filter out topics banned by Chinese censors, was out of sync with the company's official motto, ''Don't be evil.''
 ''We have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all,'' David Drummond, senior vice president for corporate development and the chief legal officer, said in a statement. 
 Wenqi Gao, a spokesman for the Chinese Consulate in New York, said he did not see any problems with google.cn. ''I want to reaffirm that China is committed to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign companies in our country,'' he said in a phone interview.
 In China, search requests that include words like ''Tiananmen Square massacre'' or ''Dalai Lama'' come up blank. In recent months, the government has also blocked YouTube, Google's video-sharing service. 
 While Google's business in China is now small, analysts say that the country could soon become one of the most lucrative Internet and mobile markets, and a withdrawal would significantly reduce Google's long-term growth.
 ''The consequences of not playing the China market could be very big for any company, but particularly for an Internet company that makes its money from advertising,'' said David B. Yoffie, a Harvard Business School professor. Mr. Yoffie said advertising played an even bigger role in the Internet in China than it did in the United States. At the time of its arrival, the company said that it believed that the benefits of its presence in China outweighed the downside of being forced to censor some search results here, as it would provide more information and openness to Chinese citizens. The company, however, has repeatedly said that it would monitor restrictions in China.
 Google's announcement Tuesday drew praise from free speech and human rights advocates, many of whom had criticized the company in the past over its decision to enter the Chinese market despite censorship requirements.
 ''I think it's both the right move and a brilliant one,'' said Jonathan Zittrain, a legal scholar at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. 
 Rebecca MacKinnon, a fellow at the Open Space Institute and an expert on the Chinese Internet, said that Google had endured repeated harassment in recent months and that by having operations in China it potentially risked the security of its users in China. She said many Chinese dissidents used Gmail because its servers are hosted overseas and that it offered extra encryption.
 ''Unless they turn themselves into a Chinese company, Google could not win,'' she said. ''The company has clearly put its foot down and said enough is enough.''
 In the past year, Google has been increasingly constricted by the Chinese government. In June, after briefly blocking access nationwide to its main search engine and other services like Gmail, the government forced the company to disable a function that lets the search engine suggest terms. At the time, the government said it was simply seeking to remove pornographic material from the company's search engine results. 
 Some company executives suggested then that the campaign was a concerted effort to stain Google's image. Since its entry into China, the company has steadily lost market share to Baidu. 
 Google called the attacks highly sophisticated. In the past, such electronic intrusions have either exploited the practice of ''phishing,'' to persuade unsuspecting users to allow their computers to be compromised, or exploited vulnerabilities in software programs permitting the attacks to gain control of systems remotely. Once they have taken over a target computer, it is possible to search for specific documents. 
 People familiar with the investigation into the attacks said they were aimed at source code repositories at high-tech companies. Source code is the original programmer's instructions used to develop software programs and can provide both economic advantages as well as insight into potential security vulnerabilities.
 In its public statement Google pointed to a United States government report prepared by the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission in October and an investigation by Canadian researchers that revealed a vast electronic spying operation last March.
 The Canadian researchers discovered that digital documents had been stolen via the Internet from hundreds of government and private organizations around the world from computer systems based in China.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about Google's threat to leave China because of what the company called hacker assaults and efforts to limit free speech on the Web misidentified, in some copies, the organizational affiliation of Rebecca MacKinnon, an expert on the Chinese Internet. She is a fellow at the Open Society Institute, a New York-based democracy advocacy group; she is not with the Open Space Institute, a New York-based environmental group.

HEADLINE: Interview With Harold Ford Jr.

 BODY:
Following are edited excerpts from Monday's interview with Harold E. Ford Jr., conducted by Michael Barbaro, a political reporter for The New York Times, at New York University's campus in Manhattan:
 Q. Why are you thinking about jumping into this race? What is your rationale for possibly being a candidate for United States Senate from New York?
 A. I ran for office 14 years ago in Tennessee, for Congress. And my appetite for public policy and changing it, and not only being a part of the conversation, but affecting it in a positive way, never diminished after 10 years in Congress. I've stayed active and engaged in the national conversation, in a far more limited way than I was when I was in elected office, through my role as chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, and even my role as a pundit, initially at Fox News -- I was there for a year and then switched to MSNBC about a year after. I stayed engaged and involved in the conversation. So that never diminished in any way. 
 The race for office in New York is not something that was first mentioned last week. Upon really moving here, and spending time here, I have had a number of people inquire whether New York would be a place that I would consider pursuing a political career. Some of the names that we have talked about, across the board, up and down the board, to cabdrivers I have seen, who ask if I have given some thought to running for office in New York. It's been a cross-section of people. 
 In the last year, as I have watched the health-care debate, as I have watched the last 6 to 12 months, the reaction to the jobs numbers, and most recently the increased attention around national security issues, which don't come and go, but just become more apparent and urgent, combined with President Obama's election, my appetite to be part of the process in a more meaningful and tangible way increased, combined with the talk from many from across the city, for that matter. Most of it has been concentrated in the New York City area. People have been encouraging, asking me if I would consider a run from here. 
 And, candidly, as you know, I have maintained my Tennessee residence for the first year I was here. I taught in Vanderbilt University. I spent my time at Merrill Lynch here. I had an office in Nashville. One of the articles noted, I continued to vote in Tennessee. I even gave some thought to pursuing the governor's race in Tennessee. The race was I think this year. I decided against that in '08, that I would not do that. 
 Q: Why? 
 A: I was living here with my wife -- we were not married yet. But shortly after the race in November, I moved here. This is the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. We had got engaged. We dated. I wanted to be with her. And so I moved here. And moved is such a legal term. I was not a resident here yet until just last year, because I did not spend the requisite number of days here -- being that the majority of time I still spent commuting between here and Nashville, and spending time in Tennessee. 
 This race has become even more interesting, because as I learn and become more integrated into the city, and appreciate the kind of elected representation that New York and New York State has enjoyed, the kind of independent-minded senators and, for that matter, mayor, and governor and other positions over the years that you have had here -- I should say the kinds of people who have held office here. 
 So I thought more and more about the issues and become more and more integrated into the city, into philanthropic life -- not in a big way, but some of the organizations I have contributed to and are now a part of -- be it the Prep for Prep program, the Council on Foreign Relations.
 My wife -- she lived here for five years. New York has, in many ways, become home. 
 And, again, you combine the central issues confronting the country, which confront New York in a more meaningful and tangible way, arguably, than other cities and locals around the country.
 I often have said to people that there are really two cities in the country where the outlook is always forward-looking -- there is never really a backward-looking tendency. My banking work has taken me out to Palo Alto, what is commonly called Silicon Valley. And you sense out there is always a forward-looking outlook. And New York City. There is a desire to allow people to become a part of something that is so great and so big. 
 Q. You spoke about independence. You are running against somebody. It's not an open seat -- 
 A. The seat was -- the person who held it was appointed. As a matter of fact, I contributed to her shortly after she was appointed. 
 Q. Why did you do that?
 A. Well, I was asked by a good friend of mine. I have known Kirsten.
 Q. Who was the friend?
 A. A donor, a friend of hers. I don't want to introduce him into it.... I was asked by a friend to make a contribution. Kirsten was a Blue Dog member of the House. We never served together. And I like Kirsten. I have nothing personally against her, even as this process unfolds. I have no personal ill will toward the senator or her family.
 Q. But a donation suggests you approve of the way she's led, no?
 A. She had only been a senator for two days, when I made my contribution.
 Q. That's precise.
 A. One of the things you will find as we talk is that I have a decent-size memory for dates and people. One of the reasons I remember this. It was at the St. Regis Hotel. I had been on ''Morning Joe'' that morning. And our mutual friend asked if I would attend the fund-raiser. I said, absolutely. 
 Q. What are her challenges?
 A. There are some differences that I have with the senator on a few fronts -- as it relates to the city and as it relates to the state, and to national issues. One, I am a firm believer on the economy and national security. 
 As it relates to the economy, you have to be far more aggressive than the senator, or the Congress, has been, around job creation. I think tax cuts for employers, particularly small businesses, is critically important right now. 
 As it relates to big issues: I think there ought to be a huge-tax cut bill for business people, not only in New York but across the country.
 Health care: I don't know how you add the kind of burdens you add in the Medicaid program to cities like this, to states like this, who send far more money to Washington than they sent back. That conversation has been lost. And the leadership in Washington from some representing New York has been lacking. This is not a personal affront at Kirsten; it's just the reality. 
 The other reality is that Kirsten was appointed to the seat. She is not the incumbent. New Yorkers have never had a chance to vote for her. She has never stood on the ballot before. 
 So if we look at some of these questions, it's important to acknowledge that fact. Second, as it relates to health care, I am for the bill, as I stated. But I wouldn't support the bill with the Stupak amendment if it came to the House floor. I wouldn't vote for a bill that would add additional debt and burden to my home state, which would be New York. 
 If I were the senator of the state, there is no way I could support a bill that would add the kind of burdens that have been projected to add what it does to New York City and New York State. We should not do it to any state. 
 Q. You would oppose the health-care overhaul as it now stands?
 A. I couldn't support a health-care bill that places the kind of burdens on New York State that this one does. I am for health-care reform, and I think there is a way to correct this, and understand, Michael, I have a relationship with MSNBC, and I have talked about the increased taxes on business and increased burdens placed on states. At a time when projections show states like New York face the kinds of projected deficits, it does not seem smart to place that kind of extra burden on them at this moment.
 Q. You raised the issue of independence. It sounds like you are saying Kirsten Gillibrand is not independent enough from leaders in Washington and Albany. Can you explain what you mean?
 A. One thing is clear: If I am elected senator from New York, Harry Reid will not instruct me how to vote. He may try, and would be my leader and I would work with him. But I would be beholden to voters in New York. And you can count, for certain, that I was sure of what I voted for before I voted for it. I think I read some comments where at least exchanges between some elected officials in the city and Kirsten Gillibrand, she didn't quite understand what was in the health-care bill. And if you are going to cast a vote in favor of a massive reform bill, you ought to know what is in it. 
 I want health-care reform to pass. The president has invested a great amount of political energy and political capital. Democrats and some Republicans, a few, have invested as well. It would be very hard to vote for the bill that had the kind of anti-abortion language that came out of the House.
 Q. Has Kirsten been a good senator? Can you grade her for me?
 A. Obviously, I am thinking of running against her. It would certainly be hard to give a grade that would be a glowing one. If the grade were a glowing one, I would not be having this conversation with you. 
 Q. Can you grad her?
 A: I am giving thought to running. You can interpret what the grade would be. 
 Q. If you had to rank -- and sorry for these academic exercises -- but if you had to rank your seriousness about running for Senate, on a 1-to-10 scale?
 A. Again, I wouldn't be having the conversation with you if there were not a level of seriousness about this. This all happened -- the seriousness and the rapidity and, for that matter, the speed in which this happened -- I mean, we are talking one week. This was eight days ago that this really picked up momentum and a kind of seriousness. 
 I laid out a timetable in your first article of 45 days.
 After the article appeared in your newspaper, that you wrote, the response I have gotten is overwhelming, from different categories, the spectrum of political leaders, people involved in politics, people representing different social and income classes in the city, be it the cabdriver on the way down here, who had positive things to say, and wanted to take a picture with me before I got out of the taxi, to people who are business leaders and leaders in the entertainment industry and media industry based here. 
 I am very seriously considering this. I haven't made a decision. But I wouldn't be sitting here unless I were. You all have reported some of the people I have met with, the conversations. 
 Q. Has Harry Reid called you?
 A. No. 
 Q. Can you tell me about your conversation with Senator Schumer?
 A. I am not going to get into that. I think that the characterizations in the press have been what they are and I have not objected to them.
 Q. I am not here to quiz you or try to embarrass you, but I do want to ask you about your life and travels in New York. So here goes. Have you traveled all five boroughs?
 A. I will tell you what I did. I was able to do it. Kelly had a -- Chief Kelly, Commissioner Kelly -- invited, I guess, business people in the city, including Sir. Harold Evans, in my group. We spent the afternoon with the special operations force, and so I had the chance to helicopter to various areas in the boroughs. The only place I have not spent considerable time is Staten Island.
 Q. Have you been to Staten Island?
 A. I landed there in the helicopter, so I can say yes. 
 Q. I asked you about your travel within New York State. What is the most northern place you have been in the state?
 A. I will tell you where I have been. To Buffalo. I have been to Syracuse. I am scheduled to go to Rochester at the end of the month, to speak at the University of Rochester. It's on the schedule now. Things may change over the next few weeks. I am scheduled to be in Albany to be at the Coalition of Black and Latino Elected Officials. 
 Q. So I have heard. 
 A. That is also -- one is Feb. 7, one is Feb. 14. 
 Q. What subways do you use in the city?
 A. Near my house, I take the 6, if I am uptown -- I come down -- I take the 6, 5 or the 4. 
 Q. Do you commute by subway or car?
 A. Normally I commute, it's easier, in the morning, because I spend time at MSNBC, generally -- I don't really take the subway very often unless it's wintertime and I can't get a taxi on Fifth, because I stumble out. I normally take a take a taxi now on Fifth. My office is at 42nd and Fifth. I walk a lot. In the morning, I am going to the office, it takes me four or five minutes. I am on at 6 a.m. NBC will sometimes, if not all the time, send a car, and I shoot right up Sixth Avenue. The two corridors are easy to get back and forth to. 
 Q. Jets or Giants?
 A. I had breakfast about every morning when I am in town, or I should say, several mornings, at the Regency. I see my friends the Tisches. Steve Tisch is my close personal friend. I have been to more Giants games. I spent the holidays, I had lunch over the holidays with Woody Johnson. We met for the first time. I am happy for his team.
 Q. Baseball?
 A. I am a Yankees fan. I should say -- have been to more Yankees games than Mets games. I have not been to the new Citi Field yet. I was at the old stadium for the Mets. I made several playoff games for the Yankees. This coming season, with classmates from Penn, who already have a group I am buying into.
 Q. You have a car in the city?
 A. Yes, I do. I have a driving license from my old state. I have a Ford Escape. It's an '08. 
 Q. I want to talk about executive compensation. You've spent the last few years in finance in New York. Should executive compensation be capped?
 A. Should it be capped? I am not a believer that it should be capped. What I do believe is that shareholders should have greater say. I am not in opposition to some of the measures that have come before Congress -- and there ought to be some nonbinding votes that ought to take place. I think there ought to be more transparency around a lot of these issues for shareholders to understand what people are being paid. You can look back -- I have been on ''Morning Joe'' talking about this, so there is a record here and I am not running away from it. 
 Q. In 2008 and 2009, a lot of the large Wall Street firms, including Merrill Lynch and Bank of America, got federal TARP money and a lot of them lost money that year. But most of the major banks still gave their employers bonuses. Should they have? 
 A. Well, let's make a distinction. There was a lot of talk about A.I.G. TARP was not a bailout. It was essentially a loan. The bank I worked for paid their money back, along with some of the others, recently, B of A paid theirs back. There are a bunch of factors that got these companies into the situation they were in. Candidly, I joined the firm in '07, but my role in terms of helping develop those kinds of products was not that extensive. I want to make sure we are clear on that front.
 I am for TARP. I think TARP worked. That is another distinction between Kirsten and myself. I mean, No. 1, if you are going to represent New York state, in New York City, one of your largest industries, how it is that financial services -- how can you be against insuring that the lifeblood of your city and of your state survive, not just the bonuses that may have gone to the largest executives, the people who clean the building, sell food in the building, the companies that provide transportation to those who work in the industry, not to mention the restaurants in the city, and not to mention, the schools, the libraries the firehouses -- I live next door to a firehouse, the police stations. 
 TARP has worked -- it is working. We are going to get our money back as taxpayers. 
 Q. Understood, but my question was about bonuses. Should they have been given out in these two years?
 A. The pay czar worked out a reasonable arrangement. And where those arrangements are now worked out, you have other actions that took place, including by the attorney general of this great state. There are some institutions where the government took an ownership stake. Should the government be allowed to dictate to private institutions, you shouldn't be allowed to pay this person X, this person Y, this person Z? I actually don't like that. I actually think I am not too far from where the president is. I don't think the government should dictate what they pay. That said, shareholders ought to be able to see what financial institution, or any public institution, is paying their top executives. It ought to be in line with performance. These institutions were able to show that the work these people did measured up to the amount they were getting -- absolutely. But ultimately, they have to answer to shareholders. 
 Q. Did you do any lobbying for the bank?
 A. No.
 Q. During the financial crisis, did you work with people on the Hill to help Merrill or Bank of America navigate the situation?
 A: No, that would be lobbying. See, as a former member of Congress, what trips up lobbying is different than what you or David were to do. [He is referring to David Goldin, a spokesman for Mr. Ford.] I cannot interface with lawmakers. There are certain things that would trip it up right away. I was not a registered lobbyist and never lobbied. 
 Q. Let's talk about gay marriage. You know your record very well, but to quickly remind you, you voted to ban same sex marriage, with the Federal Marriage Amendment, twice. 
 A. I can say up until 2003, most organizations and national organization that had an office in Washington dedicated to fighting for equality for Americans, I enjoyed broad support and big support from them. The marriage votes drove my ratings down considerably, and arguably rightly so. I have been a supporter of civil unions. My opponent raised the issue on the campaign trail in Tennessee. 
 As the presidential race unfolded, one of the things I recognized during the campaign: My position on same-sex marriage resembles President Obama's over the years. Frankly, up until maybe a year ago, that of the senior senator in the state, Senator Schumer, who was opposed to same-sex marriage. 
 Q. Where are you now?
 A. I am for gay marriage. Or same-sex marriage. I don't want to say it the wrong way. I think people are sensitive to it. I have been painted as being this right-wing zealot on choice. Nothing could be further from the truth. I think there are legitimate questions around my support for -- 
 Q. Let's focus on your two votes to ban same-sex marriage. Can you explain that? Walk me through that.
 A. The last three years, think about what has transpired. How many states have either courts and or legislatures that have declared same-sex marriage is acceptable in their states? There has been a robust debate.
 I don't think it's a great leap to go from civil unions to gay marriage -- I may be in the minority in believing that. But I don't think there is. Long before I arrived in New York, my commitment to issues of fairness and equality are clear and obvious and unmistakable. And in light of that, and consistent with that, according the same rights that a couple were married, versus the rights provided by civil unions, I don't believe the difference is that great. I understand that in certain communities it's not viewed on equal footing. But my change, or my maturation to that point....
 Q. What changed for you?
 A. Understand, I did not start at zero and get to 10. I started at 8. This is my point: I think some of the press accounts of my record have been distorted or just been wrong. People make it sound as if -- let's go back to the votes in the Congress.
 Q. Do you regret those votes, then?
 A: I have been in politics for 14 years. I was elected back in 1996 ... over the 14 years, have I learned and have I listened? Absolutely. Understand, Michael, I did not go from zero to 10. I was for civil unions and believed strongly that the flow of benefits and protections that would be provided in a civil union for same-sex couples, the decisions that have to be made, when health hardships are faced, when economic hardships are faced, I wanted all of those protections. I never strayed from them. It was just the issue of marriage, that particularly over the last three years, I have come to understand differently. 
 Q. Let's talk about abortion. 
 A. I want more jobs in New York.....
 Q. And we are going to get to that. But first, we know you describe yourself as ''pro-life.''
 A. No, no. Let's be clear. 
 Q. O.K., walk me through this. 
 A. I was not going to cede the language of life to the National Right to Life Committee. When asked questions when I was on the ballot, I have often opened answers, especially in areas outside of urban areas, outside of Memphis, outside of Nashville, Chattanooga and Knoxville, making clear, that if the Republicans are so pro-life, which I am, why is it we are denying benefits to veterans? Why is it we are denying equal pay treatment to National Guardsmen. Why is it we are denying special tax treatments to employees who take 9- and 12-month absences to serve their country but they can't count on their paychecks? ... If we are so pro-life, why aren't we doing these things? So it was put in that frame. No. 2, the National Right to Life Committee -- I may be off by one or two points, I don't think I ever received higher than a 25 percent voting record. No. 3, they never gave me a penny. No. 4, my voting record in the 10 years in the Congress, was three or four years, was 100 percent. [He refers to his record from NARAL Pro-Choice America.]
 I know somebody somewhat cynically suggested that perhaps there were not votes on abortion those years. But if that were true, the entire Congress would have gotten 100 percent. That did not happen. You can go and check. 
 My recollection: Every time I was on the ballot in Tennessee, I received a contribution from organizations that would certainly be in line with being pro-choice or supporting a woman's right to choice. 
 I accept the criticism coming from some in the city who are supporters of Senator Gillibrand who are aligned with NARAL. They have every right not to support me, and I hope to have an audience with them, to introduce myself. 
 To say that I am pro life is just wrong. I am personally pro-choice and legislatively pro-choice. 
 Q. O.K. Let's discuss a few votes. You voted to ban partial-birth abortion and require consent for minors who want an abortion. Do you stand by those votes?
 A. I do. I hope the Lord blesses my wife and I with a daughter some day. And if my daughter -- if a situation befalls her where she has to make that choice, I would love to know and I stand by that vote. 
 Q. You would love to know what?
 A. If my daughter, my 15-year-old daughter, is taken to the hospital, to get an abortion, I would hope as a minor, I would know it. If she can't get into a movie to see an R or NC-17 movie, at 15, I would hope that I would know if she was going to the doctor to have this kind of procedure performed. Not to give you my answer. But if I said yea or nay. I support my family. But I would want to know that. So that is why I voted in favor of parental consent. 
 Q. Partial-birth abortion. You have objections to it? 
 A. I do. 
 A. And I still want more jobs for New York City. 
 Q. O.K., let's talk about jobs. How do you create jobs in New York State?
 A. A couple of things. One, you have to be mindful of not undermining the opportunity for growth and initiatives you have in the city and the state. The financial services industry is an important part of the economic engine for the state. I think some of the reforms that have been proposed in Washington, especially the ones committed to transparency and calling for capital reserves on the part of some of the financial institutes, will provide some of protection we are looking for as well as increased say-so on the part of shareholders. 
 Two, I think immediately, we need to lower the corporate tax rate from 35 to 25 percent. We need to make clear that dividends and capital-gains taxes not go up -- we do not want to see decisions made that are rash. We should have a broad payroll-tax cut. A three month payroll-tax holiday for businesses and workers. Finally, I am for the extension of unemployment benefits. And I am for the increased infrastructure spending that some of my colleagues in Washington want to engage in. I believe we have to set up an official way to it, through a national infrastructure bank, so money flows to projects that make the most sense and produce the most jobs. 
 Q. What else should I know about your vision for the state economy?
 A. The clash for clunkers program that worked. I am a huge supporter for cash for caulkers -- which allows people to make improvement for energy efficient in their homes. We should do the same for Americans purchasing appliances and computers and for that matter, new air-conditioner and heating units. I would provide an even greater break for those who buy U.S.-made products. Look at China -- there was a greater tilt toward home-grown products, which helps their economy. 
 Q. Has Senator Gillibrand proposed economic stimulus plans that you oppose?
 A. I haven't heard her talk about it at all. Maybe you have evidence of it; I don't. If I were the U.S. Senator, I would talk about it. 
 Q. Can I briefly talk about immigration? I want to talk about illegal immigrants, a topic of enormous importance to Mayor Bloomberg. You voted for legislation that would allow local enforcement agencies to investigate and arrest illegal immigrants. I am sure you are familiar with the debate around that bill, how it changes the relationship between cops and the people they are supposed to protect. People fear they will be reported as illegal, and get deported. The secure fence act of 2006, which sealed the border. Can you explain these positions, and do you stand by them?
 A. No. 1, put this in perspective: In the campaign in '06, I argued for what was then, the McCain-Kennedy legislation, which really worked to provide a path to citizenship, which you could probably go back and find the language. I supported that, and was criticized for it.
 No. 2, I know that Mayor Bloomberg and I differed back then. We don't differ now. I have come to better understand the issue. At the time, empowering local enforcement to do what federal law enforcement was not doing seemed to make sense in my state. Mayors and sheriffs and police chiefs across the state complained bitterly about it and there was no effort at the federal effort, or very little, to address the problem. It had been in some ways negligent to not think about this. In the long term, Michael, the answer is a broad immigration reform. If I am elected to the Senate, we will work towards that. Before 2003-2004, my votes in the Congress, at least the grading by anti-immigrant advocacy groups, they gave me -- one of them, the group FAIR -- gave me a zero percent rating. In 2003-2004, Americans for Better Immigration, which is a great name for a group that wants to restrict immigration, rated me at 8 percent. So in '05 and '06, as this issue became more urgent, and the concerns expressed across the jurisdiction I was running to represent, it was obvious that we needed some other measures in place. Those votes were never meant, in my mind, to be the long-term answer to this challenge. The long-term answer is to deal with, to rally around a broad immigration reform bill that provides a safe understandable and legal way to citizenship.
 Q. Where you talk about an evolution, closer to mayor Bloomberg's position, that is on the law enforcement issue. 
 A. Yeah, the law enforcement issue. 
 Q. What about the secure fence on the border?
 A: Even if we had a fence now, we are not going to stop it. In a lot of ways, it's a stopgap, to say, we have to do more. I don't depart from what I said at the start. We need a broad comprehensive immigration reform bill.
 Q. Guns. Let's talk about this issue. 
 A: I never got an A rating, like my opponent -- would-be opponent -- has enjoyed. I don't own them. I do shoot them, and I shoot them at things that can't shoot back. And will continue to do that. And by that, I want to be clear, I don't mean children. I have done a little bird hunting in my day.
 Q. Are you a frequent hunter?
 A. I would say, occasional, recreational hunter. 
 Q. Where do you hunt?
 A. I have done it in Arkansas, and in Florida. 
 Q. D.C. and New York have done a lot to restrict gun laws, and they are among the toughest in the country. You opposed D.C.'s effort to put restrictions on guns -- one of the measures you opposed would require a gun at home to be unloaded and disassembled. Why do that?
 A. I don't think I did oppose that part. That was part of a broader bill... well, I take your word for it. I am a supporter of the Second Amendment and think that people ought to have the right to own weapons, guns and firearms, with certain responsibilities attached to them. 
 One of the reasons I never scored above a B with the N.R.A. -- my intent was never to -- it speaks to my independent-minded approach -- I am a member of the N.R.A. But I don't send money or contribute to those efforts that I think are bad, and when I disagree with them, I push back. 
 Q. Should a city like New York have the right to restrict guns? 
 A. The answer is yes. All of Mayor Bloomberg and Mayor Booker's efforts in the region, I support wholeheartedly. [He is referring to Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark.] 
 Q: So what about D.C., where that was put to the test?
 A. It ... My understanding of that, I don't recall it, we vote for 1,000 pieces of legislation -- read me the bill again.
 Q. It was a restriction on guns, that would require federal approval, because D.C. is a ward of Congress, that made firearms at homes be unloaded, disassembled and so on.
 A. People have the right to own a gun, and you meet all of the qualifications, why would I then require that the gun be disassembled? I didn't support that. That's different from what, I believe, Mayor Bloomberg and Booker are doing. The number of handguns on the street here and back where I represented in Congress, the proliferation of gun violence in the 90s and the early 2000s, it certainly precipitated action on the part of the Congress. ... my opponent in this race, has been endorsed by the N.R.A. and enjoyed A ratings. That is not the reason I am giving consideration to running. Her A rating from the N.R.A. I supported background checks, waiting 72 hours. 
 We have fundamental difference on independence. We have a difference on the level, the kind and the stature of advocacy New Yorkers deserve. And we have some honest differences on some issues.
 Q. Is Senator Gillibrand's fund-raising a concern to you, the $5 million or so she has on hand, and $7 million raised?
 A. It's a number I don't have. But it doesn't make me flinch.
 Q. You ran for Senate in '06. You talked about running in '99 for Senate against Frist. You flirted with running for governor of Tennessee. You ran against Pelosi for minority leader in the House. Now are you thinking of running for Senate from New York. My question is, and it's provocative, I admit: Are you a little impetuous when it comes to politics, and running for office? Is that fair?
 A. It's totally unfair. I don't know of anyone in any state in the country, who's been elected to any office, that at some point, when offices open up that are higher than the one they hold, that people don't speculate whether that person will run or not. In 1999, in Tennessee, when Bill Frist -- remember, he won in '94 -- the party was looking for the most formidable opponent. I was approached by leaders of my party, members of Congress, to think about it and ultimately, I decided not to. I don't think that is any different from Chuck Schumer, who gave thought to running for governor here, maybe once or twice or before. I don't think it's any different than any member of Congress in this district. Carolyn Maloney has given thought to running for Senate. ... I don't think it's a label that impetuous seems a little bizarre. Do I have an appetite for public policy? Yes. Do I have an appetite for having my record distorted? No. I don't know who welcomes that kind of scrutiny.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Chinese regulators ordered state-owned banks on Tuesday to set aside a larger share of their deposits as a reserve against failed loans, another in a string of indicators that Beijing is concerned about speculation in the nation's fast-growing economy. 
 In a posting on its Web site, the central bank raised the reserve requirement for major banks to 16 percent of assets as of Jan. 18, a half-percent increase from the current rate. Smaller banks would jump to 14 percent, from 13.5 percent. 
 The requirement, which forces banks to keep more assets internally instead of lending them out, is apparently aimed at curbing a yearlong lending spree by major Chinese banks that has shown few signs of abating. 
 China's government news service, Xinhua, reported on Tuesday that banks had made loans totaling almost 600 billion renminbi, or $87.7 billion, in the first week of January. At that rate, Chinese banks would lend almost 50 percent more this January than in the month a year ago, when the Beijing government increased spending to bolster an economy staggered by the global financial crisis. 
 Moreover, Chinese bank lending in the first 11 months of 2009 -- 9.2 trillion renminbi, or about $1.38 trillion -- was twice as much as had been lent the previous year. 
 ''China's banking regulators have been attempting since later last year to prevent another lending glut in 2010, and this policy change reflects that effort,'' Nicholas Consonery, a China economics specialist at Eurasia Group, a New York-based political risk research firm, said in an e-mail message. 
 Mr. Consonery said regulators were probably unnerved by the burst of lending early this year, which most likely included many loans that were held up when the government put quotas on some lending at the end of last year. 
 Even so, he said, it was unclear whether the latest move represented a serious effort to dampen expansion. Though inflation forecasts are rising -- recent private estimates are edging over a 3 percent annual rate -- government officials remain fearful that tightening credit too much will raise the cost of manufacturing, slow China's export-based economy and raise unemployment. 
 Regulators hope for a twofold effect: to reduce inflation, by taking excess liquidity out of the economy, and to curb the flow of easy cash into China's securities and property markets, where some economist are warning of bubbles. 
 The new reserve requirements follow other government moves to cool the economy, which appears to have grown by 8 to 9 percent last year and could expand even faster this year. Regulators raised the interest rate on a key interbank loan last week, signaling further increases intended to rein in spending. The government also took steps to cool speculation in housing, announcing that it would pay special attention to loans given to buyers of second homes. 
 Because the government so far has refused to wield one effective monetary tool -- loosening its control of currency exchange rates -- regulators have been forced to rely on bank reserve limits, changes in interest rates and other indirect measures to save the economy from inflation and overexpansion. 
 Chinese banks have generally been exceptionally profitable, in part because the rate they pay on consumer deposits is far below the rate they charge for loans. Because they are government-controlled, they have little incentive to compete for consumers' deposits. 
 The banks' reserve requirements also are considerably more conservative than those of United States financial institutions. As China's growth has picked up this decade, regulators have steadily raised the reserve requirement, including nine times in 2007 alone. 
 The United States Federal Reserve requires big American banks to withhold about 10 percent of their deposits from the lending market as a safeguard against bad loans -- more than a third less than the reserves held by big Chinese banks.

HEADLINE: China's Missile Test Is Said to Signal Displeasure With U.S.

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS and JONATHAN ANSFIELD; Li Bibo contributed research.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
China said late Monday that it had successfully tested the nation's first land-based missile defense system, announcing the news in a brief dispatch by Xinhua, the official news agency. ''The test is defensive in nature and is not targeted at any country,'' the item said. 
 Even if news accounts on Tuesday did not provide details about the test -- and whether it destroyed its intended target -- Chinese and Western analysts say there is no mistaking that the timing of the test, coming amid Beijing's fury over American arms sales to Taiwan, was largely aimed at the White House. 
 In recent days, state media have been producing a torrent of articles condemning the sale of Patriot air defense equipment to Taiwan. China views the self-ruled island as a breakaway province, separated since the civil war of the 1940s, and sees arms sales as interference in an internal matter. 
 The Defense and Foreign Ministries have released a half-dozen warnings over the weapons deal, saying it would have grave consequences for United States-China relations. A columnist in Global Times, a populist tabloid, urged readers come up with ways to retaliate against the United States. 
 Writing in the newspaper Study Times, Maj. Gen. Jun Yinan said China had the power to strike back. ''We must take countermeasures to make the other side pay a corresponding price and suffering corresponding punishment,'' wrote General Jun, a professor at China's National Defense University. 
 Most analysts doubt the Chinese will seek to punish the United States in a significant way. 
 ''For the Chinese, selling arms to Taiwan feels like a slap in the face,'' said Shi Yinhong, a professor of United States-Chinese relations at People's University in Beijing. ''I think the government expected something different from Obama, especially so soon after his visit to China.'' 
 The White House said it was simply fulfilling a deal that was negotiated during the Bush administration. It also pointed out that the sale, approved by the Pentagon last week, omits F-16 fighter jets and Black Hawk helicopters, a concession to Beijing. 
 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, speaking in California on Monday, said she thought the strain in relations would be brief and mild. ''It doesn't go off the rails when we have differences of opinions,'' she said. 
 Relations may get bumpier in the coming weeks when President Obama meets with the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader whom China accuses of being a separatist, and President Ma Ying-jeou of Taiwan makes a brief visit to the United States. Overseas visits by Taiwanese officials invariably irk Beijing.
 Arthur Ding, a research fellow at the Institute of International Relations in Taipei, the Taiwanese capital, said China might have thought its growing economic power and the improving cross-strait relations fostered by Mr. Ma during his 20 months in office might have persuaded the United States to put off any weapons deal. 
 ''Perhaps Beijing has unrealistic expectations,'' he said. ''I think they imagined their influence is greater than it is.'' 
 For all the saber-rattling over the arms sale, some analysts say the official invective and anti-missile demonstration may have been largely directed at domestic audiences. 
 Zhu Feng, deputy director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Peking University, described China's missile defense system as experimental and ''not really meaningful'' and said the test's real purpose was less a show of deterrence than an opportunity for its army to strut. 
 Despite China's newfound confidence, he said, the government was increasingly frustrated by its inability to influence the United States on an issue that had bedeviled Beijing for decades. 
 ''China still lacks the leverage to force the White House to stop these sales,'' he said. ''So they feel like they must make a lot of noise.''

HEADLINE: Poverty in New York City

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 It is disappointing that in editorializing on priorities for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's third term (editorial, Jan. 1), you didn't mention the urgent need to stem New York City's soaring poverty, hunger, homelessness and inequality of wealth. 
 In 2008, even before the economic downturn had its worst impact, 1.5 million city residents lived in poverty, 104,000 more than in 2000. More than 1.3 million New Yorkers are now forced to use food pantries and soup kitchens.
 According to the Coalition for the Homeless, there are 45 percent more people staying in city homeless shelters nightly than when Mayor Bloomberg took office, with levels at an all-time high. On Jan. 7, there were 36,961 people, including 15,727 children, sleeping in city shelters, enough to fill Madison Square Garden two times over. 
 While the number of billionaires in the city dipped slightly in the last year (from 64 to 56), their combined net worth still equaled more than 27 times the yearly income of all 1.5 million New Yorkers in poverty. Given that these billionaires benefited disproportionately not only from the Wall Street bailout but also from decades of federal, state and city tax cuts, it is unpersuasive to continue to argue that their successes -- and the poor's misfortune -- are due solely to free-market forces.
 For the mayor's third term to be truly successful, he should work with all levels of government -- as well as with the private sector -- to restore New York City's historic role as the nation's leading springboard of upward mobility.

HEADLINE: Deals to Restrain Generic Drugs Face a Ban in Health Care Bill

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
A group of House lawmakers and the head of the Federal Trade Commission want Congress to include a provision in the health care legislation that they say could save American consumers several billion dollars a year on prescription drugs.
 The group plans to ask Congress on Wednesday to block business deals in which they say makers of name-brand drugs directly or indirectly pay generic makers to delay competition from cheaper generic alternatives. 
 The House bill already includes such a ban. The Congressional Budget Office, considering only federal drug spending, has estimated that the House provision could save the government $1.8 billion in health costs over the next 10 years.
 The Senate version does not include such a prohibition. But a group of nine Democrats, led by Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, signed a letter late last month to the majority leader, Harry Reid, urging that a ban be included in the final legislation. 
 An aide to Mr. Reid declined to comment. The Senate does not return from its holiday break until next week. 
 In recent years, critics say, deals between name-brand makers and generic makers have delayed the introduction of a range of generics including cancer drugs, antidepressants and prescription-strength antacids. The F.T.C. has estimated that such deals currently cost American consumers $3.5 billion a year. 
 ''These are collusive, price-fixing deals,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, who is one of those urging Congress to ban the arrangements. ''It means the consumer pays a lot more for their pharmaceuticals.''
 Opponents of the generic agreements -- maligned as ''pay for delay'' deals -- say they are standard industry practice and help prop up monopoly pricing. 
 Generics account for only about 22 percent of prescription drug spending in this country, although they represent nearly three-quarters of the prescriptions written, according to the research firm IMS Health. That means 78 percent of the nation's drug bill goes toward the 25 percent of prescriptions written for name-brand medicines. 
 But representatives of branded drug and generic makers said that settlements were a legitimate and expedient way to resolve expensive and time-consuming patent litigation.
 Moreover, Kathleen Jaeger, the president of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, an industry trade group, contested the term ''pay for delay.'' 
 Settlements, she said, typically award the generic challenger the right to enter the market before a brand's patent is due to expire, giving consumers earlier access to affordable drugs. And compensation, she said, is often for legitimate side deals, like the generic company's supplying ingredients to the name-brand maker.
 ''You can't sweep all the good, the pro-competitive, pro-consumer settlements out with the bad,'' Ms. Jaeger said in an interview on Monday.
 Nevertheless Jon Leibowitz, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, argues that many settlement deals violate antitrust laws when they restrict generic entry and also involve compensation from the name-brand company to the generic maker. 
 ''These sweetheart deals are being done on the backs of consumers,'' Mr. Leibowitz said in an interview. ''From the perspective of the Federal Trade Commission, these deals are one of the worst abuses across the board in health care and should be stopped.''
 But, since 2005, several appellate courts have upheld some of the agreements, ruling that such settlements do not violate antitrust laws when they let the generic drug enter the market before the name-brand maker's patent is due to expire.
 As a result, the F.T.C. is appealing to Congress to ban the compensated settlements altogether. 
 The settlement deals are an outgrowth of the Hatch-Waxman Act, a 1984 law intended to promote drug price competition by encouraging generic companies to challenge the patents on name-brand drugs.
 Some name-brand drug patents, like those on the active pharmaceutical ingredient in a medication, may be strong and not vulnerable to challenge. But other patents, like those on the ingredient formula, may be weaker and more inviting to a generic challenger.
 Under Hatch-Waxman, the first generic to challenge a name-brand drug's patent gains the exclusive right to sell its generic version for six months before other generic makers can enter the market. But Hatch-Waxman also gives drug makers who sue generic infringers an automatic 30-month stay of generic market entry so that litigation can proceed.
 Rather than litigate cases to the end, though, many drug makers choose to settle with generic challengers. Sometimes, the parties negotiate an earlier market entry date for the generic, without the generic maker's receiving additional compensation. 
 But other agreements, the F.T.C. says, have restricted generic market entry and have involved compensation from drug makers to generic companies, either in the form of direct payments or in side deals in which drug makers agreed to pay generics to provide goods or services. The agency has sued some companies for such deals.
 Even now, the F.T.C. is suing the drug company Cephalon, claiming that it illegally induced generic challengers to delay marketing generic versions of the stay-awake drug Provigil to protect the product, which had sales in the United States of about $925 million in 2008. 
 According to the F.T.C., in late 2005 and early 2006 the company reached settlements with four generic makers that had challenged a Provigil patent. 
 The generic companies agreed not to market a generic form of the drug until 2012, and Cephalon agreed to pay the challengers at least $238 million for 13 side deals involving services like ingredient supply, the F.T.C. said. 
 Gerald J. Pappert, Cephalon's general counsel, said on Tuesday that the company strongly disagreed with the F.T.C.'s characterizations of its agreements with generic makers. He said Cephalon had structured the settlements to be in full compliance with the law. Moreover, the agreements allowed generics to enter the market in 2012, three years earlier than the Provigil patent was due to expire, he said. 
 Drug companies entered into 19 settlement agreements in fiscal year 2009 that involved both delaying generic entry and compensation from the brand to the generic compared to no such agreements in fiscal year 2004, according to an F.T.C. report to be published on Wednesday. Settlement deals in which generic makers received compensation typically kept generics off the market for 17 months longer than deals without payments, the report says. 
 Not everyone outside the drug industry agrees that restricting the compensated generic settlements would necessarily benefit consumers.
 Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who was an author of the Hatch-Waxman law, has raised the possibility that, without the option of negotiated patent settlements, generic companies might be less likely to challenge drug patents, thus delaying generic availability.
 In a letter last September to Senator Kohl, who had sponsored a stand-alone bill last year prohibiting the deals, Mr. Hatch wrote: ''Any generic entry prior to patent expiration gives consumers the choice of using generic drugs earlier than can be anticipated and provides savings to the health care system -- whether by agreement or final court decision.''

HEADLINE: A Piece Missing In the Reform

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Almost a year after taking office, President Obama has not yet nominated anybody to run Medicare. 
 The White House will offer plenty of reasons for the delay: the derailment of Tom Daschle's candidacy as White House health adviser, the nitpicky nature of the Senate confirmation process, the likelihood that Republicans would use any nomination to slow health reform. 
 But consider what the next head of Medicare -- officially, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services -- will be facing whenever he or she is finally named. First will come that confirmation process. Then the person will have to learn the workings of an agency that oversees a budget $200 billion larger than the Pentagon's. And finally there will be the small matter of helping to oversee big chunks of the most ambitious domestic policy legislation in decades. 
 Health reform is not merely a matter of passing a bill, hard as that has been (and may still be); its success will also depend on how that bill is put into action. As Jon Kingsdale, who oversees the universal coverage plan in Massachusetts, says: ''Implementing health reform in Massachusetts was not easy. The federal legislation is far, far more challenging and ambitious.'' 
 And the lack of a Medicare nomination suggests that the White House is not giving enough attention to what will happen once Mr. Obama signs a bill. Within months, Medicare will need to begin creating pilot programs meant to reduce wasteful care and reward good care. Medicaid will have to plan a huge expansion. The independent Medicare oversight board will have to be formed. The federal government, or perhaps every single state, will need to start creating an insurance exchange.
 ''There's a tremendous amount of work to do just in 2010,'' says John Podesta, a former White House chief of staff who was a co-chairman of the Obama transition. ''You could fill up a number of whiteboards with the tasks that have to be done from a standing start to the speed of a bullet train.''
 Does all this mean that reform isn't worth doing? Absolutely not. The health system is badly in need of an overhaul. Medical costs are taking a huge bite out of workers' paychecks. Those costs are growing at a rate that will overwhelm the federal budget. Yet the quality of treatment is spotty, and the United States is the only wealthy country in the world with large numbers of uninsured.
 The cleanest solution would have been a radical overhaul -- including the elimination of the employer-based insurance system, with its inefficiencies and perverse incentives. But the politics of such an overhaul never worked. Big business, labor unions and especially the medical industry benefit from the current system, and they weren't willing to take a chance on most major changes. 
 So we're left with bills in the House and the Senate that try to reform the system using hundreds of technocratic tweaks. The only real alternative appears to be the status quo.
 The technocratic approach, however, comes with risks. The first is simply that the bureaucracy won't be up to the job.
 Mark McClellan, who ran Medicare from 2004 to 2006 and now works at the Brookings Institution, likes to tell the story of a Medicare demonstration project that Congress approved in 2003. Once the bill passed, officials had to devise the project's details, decide how to measure the results and choose the locations. All of that took until 2009. The first round of projects -- coordinating care across medical specialties, in Indiana and North Carolina -- has only recently started. Years more will pass before the results are in.
 The health bills don't do enough to solve these bottlenecks. Soon, of course, there may be many more projects to be bottlenecked. But the bills can still be changed, and not just for the sake of soothing various interest groups. 
 Dr. McClellan argues for adding in a few billion dollars to give Medicare the resources to act more quickly. Another sensible step may be to go with the House's national insurance exchange, rather than two different exchanges for each state, as the Senate bill calls for. 
 Even if the final bill includes such measures, they won't be enough. The effort will also depend on execution.
 Remember that this bill won't insert the federal government into the business of health care. The government is already in that business, to an enormous extent. Government agencies spend about $4,500 a person on health care -- roughly as much as the public and private sectors spend, combined, in many other rich countries. (Our private sector spends $3,000 or so on top of that.) 
 The agencies that will be managing health reform are often the same ones that have helped build the current system. Many talented people work in these agencies, and unlike the Medicare administrator, they are already in place. But there are all sorts of reasons to be skeptical of how easily a sprawling, existing organization can innovate.
 People at old-line organizations tend to rationalize the usual ways of doing business and to worry about the downsides of change. I.B.M. didn't invent Windows or the Mac. Newspapers didn't invent Craigslist. Medicare and Medicaid will, to a significant degree, have to reinvent government-provided medical care and, in the process, help create a template for private insurers.
 The brand new parts of the health system, like the independent Medicare board and a tax on high-cost insurance plans (if it survives), will certainly help. Still, an overhaul will also depend on leadership. 
 That will probably mean having someone in the White House whose job is to make sure that the disparate parts of health reform are working, and working together. It will also mean naming someone with a rare set of skills to run Medicare. This person will, incredibly, be the first Senate-confirmed head of the program since Dr. McClellan stepped down more than three years ago.
 In the late stages of the 2008 presidential campaign, Mr. Obama and his aides began planning their transition even before he had been elected. Senator John McCain mocked them for measuring the drapes. But Obama advisers were willing to risk the criticism in exchange for being ahead of schedule. 
 When it comes to carrying out health reform, they are already behind schedule.

HEADLINE: Senate Hopeful in New State Airs Evolving Views

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In his first extensive interview since he began weighing a run for United States Senate from New York, Harold E. Ford Jr. distanced himself from his previous opposition to same-sex marriage, his description of himself as ''pro-life'' and his push to permit local police officers to enforce federal immigration law, and said he would be a fiercer advocate for New York than Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand. 
 In a wide-ranging discussion, Mr. Ford said that he had missed politics since leaving Congress four years ago and believes New Yorkers would be open to his candidacy, despite his Tennessee roots and intermittent Southern accent.
 In a clear swipe at Ms. Gillibrand, he said he would not be a lap dog for Democratic leaders in Washington, who have rushed to her defense since Mr. Ford expressed interest in the seat. 
 ''If I am elected senator from New York, Harry Reid will not instruct me how to vote,'' he said, referring to Mr. Reid's efforts to keep him out of the campaign.
 Mr. Ford agreed to the interview with The New York Times as he tests the response to his possible candidacy. His interest in the race, reported a week ago, has set off intense reaction and furious strategizing among Senate Democratic leaders and White House officials, as they try to discourage his campaign and avoid an ugly and expensive primary in September that could risk losing a crucial Senate seat.
 A Ford campaign could become a delicate subject for the Obama administration, however, which is more reluctant to assert itself in New York politics after failing last year in its effort to elbow Gov. David A. Paterson out of his election bid.
 Mr. Ford said he had been emboldened by the response he had received from the public in recent days. Everyone -- from the cabdrivers who shuttle him around the city to the executives with whom he rubs elbows on Wall Street -- has urged him to run, he said.
 During a trip from New York to Palm Beach on Thursday, flight attendants and passengers stopped in the aisle to cheer him on, he said. ''I didn't hear anyone say, you better not run against that Kirsten Gillibrand,'' he said.
 Again and again, during the interview, he returned to the subject of the economy, saying Ms. Gillibrand, an upstate lawmaker who was appointed by Mr. Paterson to fill the seat vacated by Hillary Rodham Clinton, has failed to aggressively focus on creating jobs. He called for a major reduction in the corporate tax rate and a payroll tax holiday to encourage hiring.
 Zeroing in on a perception that Ms. Gillibrand too readily defers to Senate leaders, especially Senator Charles E. Schumer, he added: ''We have a fundamental difference on independence. We have a difference on the level, the kind and the stature of advocacy New Yorkers deserve. And we have some honest differences on issues.'' 
 He blasted her support for the proposed health care overhaul, which is expected to cost New York an extra $1 billion a year, and for opposing the taxpayer bailout of the financial industry.
 ''It was a mistake,'' he said, noting that most Wall Street firms had already paid back the money. ''How can you be against ensuring that the lifeblood of your city and of your state survives?'' 
 Asked to grade her performance in the Senate, he said: ''It would certainly be hard to give a grade that would be a glowing one.''
 Mr. Ford, however, acknowledged that he gave Ms. Gillibrand a $1,000 campaign contribution shortly after her appointment, saying he had done so at the request of a friend. ''She had only been a senator for two days,'' he added. 
 After Mr. Ford, a five-term Tennessee congressman, arrived in New York, he took a job as a vice chairman at Merrill Lynch (now Bank of America). But he kept a toe in politics, becoming a commentator on Fox and then NBC, which features him several days a week on programs like MSNBC's ''Morning Joe.'' 
 Speaking from a conference room at New York University, where he is a teacher, Mr. Ford, 39, expressed enthusiasm about his new hometown, though he described a life quite different than most New Yorkers. On many days, he is driven to an NBC television studio in a chauffeured car. He and his wife, Emily, a 29-year-old fashion executive, live a few blocks from the Lexington Avenue subway line in the Flatiron district. But Mr. Ford said he takes the subway only occasionally in the winter, to avoid the cold when he cannot hail a cab. 
 Asked whether he had visited all five boroughs, he mentioned taking a helicopter ride across the city with fellow executives, at the invitation of Raymond W. Kelly, New York City's police commissioner. ''The only place I have not spent considerable time is Staten Island,'' he said, adding that ''I landed there in the helicopter, so I can say yes.''
 Asked about his baseball loyalties, he responded: ''I am a Yankees fan,'' and added that he had yet to visit Citi Field, the home of the Mets.
 He has breakfast most mornings at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue, and he receives regular pedicures. (He described them as treatment for a foot condition.) 
 Mr. Ford declined to discuss what he is paid by the bank, but publicly available data suggests that he earns at least $1 million a year. Asked what role outsize pay packages played in fueling the financial crisis, Mr. Ford said he objected to capping executive compensation on Wall Street. ''I am a capitalist,'' he said. ''I believe that people take risk, and there are rewards if they do well; they should lose if they don't.''
 But what is likely to gain the most immediate attention is his record on issues, which Ms. Gillibrand's defenders say is too conservative for New York. 
 Mr. Ford twice voted for legislation in the House that would make same-sex marriage illegal. In 2006, when Tennessee voters considered a ballot initiative to outlaw the practice, he vowed to support it. ''I oppose gay marriage,'' he said at the time. 
 But in the interview, he said he had changed his mind. He said that he had endorsed civil unions since entering Congress, and that, after watching the debate about marriage unfold in state legislatures and courtrooms, his position had evolved.
 ''I don't think it's a great leap to go from civil unions to gay marriage,'' he said. ''I may be in the minority in believing that. But I don't think there is.''
 When pressed, he said he would seek to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibits the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriage, and said he would ''revisit'' the military's ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy. 
 Mr. Ford has repeatedly described himself as ''pro-life,'' and has voted to ban a procedure opponents call partial-birth abortions and to require that minors receive parental consent before receiving an abortion. 
 In the interview, however, he said: ''To describe me as pro-life is just wrong. I am personally pro-choice and legislatively pro-choice.'' 
 Explaining the previous remarks, he said he refused to cede ''the language of life'' to the political right. Mr. Ford said that he had always supported abortion rights, but that when he campaigned in Tennessee, he used the phrase ''pro-life'' more broadly to highlight what he saw as the hypocrisy of Republican policies that denied benefits to returning war veterans, or equal pay to National Guardsmen. 
 He said he would not abandon his opposition to partial-birth abortion and support for parental consent, saying that if a 15-year-old girl cannot see an R-rated movie without an adult, she should not receive an abortion without a parent's permission.
 He supported Congressional legislation in 2006 to allow local police officers to investigate and arrest illegal immigrants, despite the objections of many advocates and lawmakers, like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who said it would discourage people from cooperating with the police. He says his views on the subject have changed.
 ''I have come to better understand the issue,'' he said. ''Empowering local enforcement to do what federal law enforcement was not doing seemed to make sense in my state,'' he said, referring to Tennessee. Mr. Ford, a member of the National Rifle Association, also voted for legislation to limit lawsuits against gun makers, and he cast one of the few Democratic votes for a bill to repeal the District of Columbia's restrictions on guns.
 When asked about the tough restrictions that mayors in New York and Newark have put in place, however, he said, ''All of Mayor Bloomberg and Mayor Booker's efforts in the region, I support.'' 
 Asked about his own experience with guns, he said he was an occasional bird hunter. ''I shoot at things that can't shoot back,'' he said with a smile, ''and will continue to do that.'' 
 Offering a glimpse into a possible campaign strategy, Mr. Ford and his aides said he would run as an insurgent who is uncontrolled by the entrenched political class that he says has rallied around Ms. Gillibrand. His tentative slogan: ''Harold Ford: nobody's man but ours.'' 
 Advisers said the strategy would appeal to a restive electorate battered by the recession, and help blunt the impact of future endorsements of Ms. Gillibrand. 
 Mr. Ford has officially been a resident of the state only since 2009, and did not vote in November's mayoral election. He still has a Tennessee driver's license. But he has tied into the city's charity circuit, through Prep for Prep, which helps low-income students attend private schools. 
 He has traveled to Buffalo and Syracuse, and this month will begin an upstate tour. 
 He is studying up on his New York history and readily mentioned names of New York lawmakers, like Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, with whom he played in a charity basketball game, and Representative Joseph Crowley of Queens, who he said threw elbows at him throughout the game.
 ''New York has, in many ways, become home,'' he said.

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C. Seeks Comment on Bank Fee Plan

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Federal banking regulators moved on Tuesday to seek public input on a plan to link the insurance premiums levied on banks to the degree of risk-taking encouraged by their executive pay policies. 
 A divided board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation voted to make public a preliminary proposal for using executive compensation as a factor in assessing the fees that banks must pay for the deposit insurance fund. The plan could involve both rewards and penalties for banks.
 ''This is something we cannot ignore,'' the F.D.I.C. chairwoman, Sheila C. Bair, said. But two heads of Treasury Department agencies, who also sit on the five-member board, voted against floating the proposal.
 John C. Dugan, director of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and John E. Bowman, acting director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, said it would be premature because Congress and the Federal Reserve were addressing the bank compensation issue.
 The F.D.I.C. is seeking public comment for 30 days. If there is a final rule, it is not expected to be adopted until late in the year.
 Company policies that encouraged excessive risk-taking and rewarded executives for delivering short-term profits were blamed for fueling the financial crisis, and big banks especially were considered to have engaged in the practice.
 ''We're really just asking questions at this point,'' Ms. Bair said. She stressed that the regulators were not seeking to dictate compensation levels for banks but were exploring whether certain pay practices encouraged banks to take excessive risk.
 The F.D.I.C. proposal seeks input on a possible model for banks' compensation policies that would include payment in restricted company stock for a large portion of pay for employees whose work is deemed potentially risky. In addition, significant awards of company stock would become vested only over a multiyear period.
 The plan could involve both rewards and penalties for banks. A possible reward is that banks that are able to ''claw back'' compensation from executives under pay contracts could get reductions in their insurance premiums. Penalties would call for increased fees for banks with pay deals that involve more risk.
 If the plan were adopted, banks' compensation structures would be added to the other risk factors now taken into account by the F.D.I.C. in assessing fees, including diminished reserves against risk and reliance on higher-risk so-called brokered deposits. The idea is for institutions deemed to be higher risk to pay bigger insurance fees.

HEADLINE: Washington Turns Focus To Bank Pay

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Everyone in Washington is taking a swing at Wall Street pay.
 The Obama administration wants to tax it. The Federal Reserve wants to tweak it. And the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation wants to shape it. 
 Even the compensation adviser to the Obama administration, who is nearly powerless now that big banks have returned their bailout funds, is getting a say on pay packages. 
 Across the capital, federal officials are waging pointed, if calculated, assaults on the billions of dollars in bonuses that banks are preparing to mete out -- and, in many cases, hoping to turn the politics of pay to their advantage. 
 The volley of proposals, particularly word this week that President Obama is considering a tax on big banks to recoup billions of dollars in federal aid, has blindsided many banks. Industry experts, and even some government officials, say some of the plans being floated are at odds with one another or with policy goals like encouraging banks to make more loans. 
 But tilting at Wall Street is a big game in Washington, one that will grow bigger as federal hearings into the causes of the financial crisis begin on Wednesday. Whether all the hullabaloo will change much on Wall Street is uncertain. 
 The latest salvo came from Sheila C. Bair, the head of the F.D.I.C., which is moving to impose increased fees on banks with pay practices that the agency considers risky. The F.D.I.C., which safeguards bank deposits, is not seeking to cap pay. 
 ''We're not talking about levels, notwithstanding my dismay,'' Ms. Bair said at a news conference. ''This is about structures.''
 The F.D.I.C. board, in a 3-2 vote, approved a preliminary plan to tie the fees that the F.D.I.C. charges banks to fill its insurance fund to the banks' compensation practices. Under the plan, banks that use long-term stock to reward employees and adopt provisions to claw back compensation would pay lower fees. Many of the details are still being worked out, including what constitutes risky compensation. 
 Some regulators suggested that Ms. Bair, in her haste to put pay on the F.D.I.C. agenda, is raising potential conflicts with the Federal Reserve Board and others moving to scrutinize pay. F.D.I.C. officials said their proposal complemented other government initiatives. 
 ''I think we should wait until we have the results of the board's efforts before heading down a path that could be both unnecessary and inconsistent,'' said John C. Dugan, the comptroller of the currency and one of the two banking regulators on the F.D.I.C.'s five-member board who voted against Ms. Bair's proposal. 
 Federal regulators have been trying to sort out the various pay proposals in recent meetings. Administration officials said the F.D.I.C. plan squared with other pay initiatives, although regulators might still need to iron out some inconsistencies. 
 ''Proposals linking comp design to risk should be mutually reinforcing, and we're pleased that regulators are racing each other to the top by holding banks to tougher standards,'' said Neal S. Wolin, the deputy Treasury secretary. 
 Public anger is growing again over the coming round of Wall Street bonuses. Few government officials want to cede ground now, especially as the running debate over financial reform redraws traditional battle lines. 
 ''It's a political circus,'' said Bert Ely, a banking consultant and longtime Washington hand. 
 Several banks, among them Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, have even sought advice from Kenneth R. Feinberg, the special master for compensation, said people briefed on the discussions, even though the banks no longer fall under his purview. 
 ''The real driver is that the public thinks the banks blew up the world; they don't understand why bankers would be paid any bonus -- and they don't understand why they were so overpaid in the first place,'' said Douglas Elliott, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former investment banker. The Fed, meanwhile, plans to formally approve a final set of best practices for bank compensation within the next few months. It is also charging ahead with a comprehensive review of Wall Street pay, with the goal of blessing compensation policies for about two dozen of the largest banks by the middle of the year.
 Separately, Congress is zeroing in on a bonus tax similar to one recently imposed on bankers in Britain, although an effort last year to tax bonuses at 90 percent was quickly killed.
 On Tuesday, Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, proposed a 50 percent bonus tax at firms that received more than $50,000 of bailout aid. The proceeds would finance small-business lending programs.
 Representative Dennis Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio, proposed a 75 percent bonus tax to curb what he saw as windfall profits. 
 ''The atmosphere has become very chaotic,'' said Edward L. Yingling, the president of the American Bankers Association. ''The industry does not know what is going to come next -- or from where.''

HEADLINE: Investors Sell as Japan Airlines Nears a Bankruptcy Filing

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
 Investors rushed to sell their shares in Japan Airlines on Tuesday and Wednesday ahead of a bankruptcy filing that could come as early as next week. At the same time, two rival airlines, American and Delta, battled for a stake in JAL, which could still be a strong regional player once restructuring takes place.
 American Airlines said Tuesday that it had raised its joint offer of an investment in JAL, together with the private equity firm TPG, by $300 million, to $1.4 billion. The United States carrier also pledged a $100 million annual sales increase for JAL if it stayed with the American-led Oneworld airline alliance. 
 Other members of the Oneworld alliance have weighed in to support American's bid. British Airways offered an additional $200 million in revenue to JAL over three years through an expanded code-sharing agreement, while Qantas said it would advise JAL on setting up a low-cost carrier business.
 Delta Air Lines has offered $500 million in equity, as well as a substantial increase in passengers and revenue from its SkyTeam alliance.
 Still, shares in JAL, which has $16 billion in liabilities, fell 45 percent on Tuesday and then 80 percent more on Wednesday, to 7 yen, as a bankruptcy filing appeared inevitable.
 Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has suggested that shareholders of JAL -- the recipient of a string of government bailouts -- would not be protected in a restructuring, which would be orchestrated by a state-backed corporate turnaround agency.
 The transport minister, Seiji Maehara, confirmed Tuesday that shareholders were at risk, adding that JAL's main creditor banks supported the government's plans for a court-led reorganization.
 ''I think shareholders should also bear responsibility,'' Mr. Hatoyama told reporters.
 Despite the expected bankruptcy, American and Delta are competing fiercely in hopes of tapping a restructured JAL's routes to the fast-growing Asian market. A recent ''open skies'' agreement between the United States and Japan is spurring tie-ups between airlines of the two countries.
 A state-backed body tasked with JAL's reorganization could reject the investment offers of both airlines, however, and rely instead on a public injection of funds, Japanese news agencies have said. The agency is said to believe that an outside investment will only complicate the restructuring process, according to news reports.
 Meanwhile, the Japanese airline appeared to clear a major hurdle to receiving more public money after it said Tuesday that it had persuaded retirees to accept a 30 percent cut in their pensions. The government had demanded that JAL slash its pension payouts in return for an additional 300 billion yen.
 The finance minister, Naoto Kan, told reporters that the government would consider increasing its assistance to JAL.
 ''The government has already expressed support to JAL, but I wonder whether that's enough,'' Mr. Kan said. ''If we need to express further support, we will take action as needed.'' 
 The extent of JAL's woes have come as a shock to many Japanese.
 Initially state-owned, the airline had rapid growth in the 1960s and '70s that mirrored that of the Japanese economy. The airline was privatized in 1987.
 But intense price competition and ill-timed investments, along with soaring personnel and pension costs, have weighed heavily on JAL. The airline has also suffered from a drop in travel amid the global economic crisis and swine flu epidemic. It lost about $1.5 billion in the six months through September.

HEADLINE: For Bankers, Saying 'Sorry' Has Its Perils

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN and MICHELINE MAYNARD; Eric Dash and Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As America recovers from the worst financial crisis since the Depression, some of the nation's chief executives are offering that rarest of statements -- an apology.
 But often, their words are so carefully parsed, scrubbed by lawyers or picked over by public relations professionals that it is unclear just how much mea is in their culpa. 
 The former Time Warner chief, Gerald M. Levin, dropped jaws last week by taking the blame for ''the worst deal of the century,'' the decade-old merger of America Online and Time Warner. Yet few other chief executives, including the handful of Wall Street chieftains who acknowledge missteps, have embraced his plea to accept personal responsibility for decisions that have caused pain, loss and suffering for many ordinary Americans. 
 ''American culture does not put a premium on apology,'' said Michael Useem, professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ''The level of anger in this public in general is extremely high against those who led Wall Street into the abyss, in part because they never stepped forward to apologize for the mess they made.'' 
 The art of the nuanced regret -- admitting mistakes without accepting blame -- will be on display Wednesday at a hearing of the new Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in Washington, where Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, John J. Mack of Morgan Stanley and Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of America are to testify about their roles in the financial crisis. 
 Mr. Moynihan, who recently took over Bank of America after Kenneth D. Lewis steered it into a troubled merger with Merrill Lynch, plans to say that the banking industry caused a lot of damage and acknowledge that mistakes made by financial companies can affect Main Street, said a person briefed on his testimony. But he will stop short of the statement that Mr. Blankfein offered several months ago.
 Mr. Blankfein, whose firm is on track to report blowout 2009 profits, uttered the word ''apologize'' in November although he is not expected to repeat it in his testimony Wednesday. His remarks came a week after he drew fire for saying the firm was doing ''God's work,'' but it was never clear what the subject of his atonement was. ''We participated in things that were clearly wrong and have reason to regret and apologize for,'' he said, without elaborating on what ''things'' the firm did wrong. 
 Since then, Mr. Blankfein has continued to defend the millions in bonuses he is paying to keep Goldman's bankers happy, although the firm has since changed its compensation practices to emphasize stock over cash payments to discourage short-term risk taking.
 Others see no reason for censure. Mr. Dimon has maintained that JPMorgan also did not need a bailout despite billions of dollars of bad loans, and in fact helped support the government's rescue effort with its emergency takeover of Bear Stearns. In a recent letter to investors, he said mistakes were made in the bank's mortgage business, but cited ''regulatory lapses'' and errors by the ratings agencies as triggers of the mortgage debacle. Still, he has acknowledged that the industry has benefited from extraordinary federal aid programs. A spokesman declined to discuss his Wednesday testimony. 
 Mr. Mack apologized to Congress last February for his firm's role in the financial crisis, and is not expected to do so again Wednesday, according to a person briefed on his testimony. Last month, he said he would forgo his bonus for the third consecutive year, after receiving more than $60 million in stock bonuses in 2005 and 2006. Mr. Mack will tell lawmakers that many firms took on too much risk and will call for more authority for regulators, including the ability to dismantle firms that mismanage their risk, the person said.
 Of course, corporate chieftains worry that apologies may be red meat for shareholder lawsuits. Shareholders have sued Bank of America, for example, for failing to disclose billions in losses and bonuses paid out at Merrill Lynch before the merger. Last week, an Illinois pension fund sued Goldman Sachs to recover billions in bonuses and other compensation for 2009, saying the payouts harm shareholders.
 Sydney Finkelstein, a management professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, said his research for a recent book showed that heads of Fortune 500 companies almost never apologize for poor performance. 
 ''Out of the 100 or so companies we looked at, only one acknowledged managerial culpability -- Andy Grove at Intel for the company's handling of the Pentium,'' he said.
 ''We specifically looked at many other companies,'' he added, ''and found none who admitted managerial error, let alone apologized for it.''
 Another reason it is so hard for chief executives to apologize is that they simply tend to have big egos that are not used to admitting mistakes, said Robert F. Bruner, dean of the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia. 
 ''You don't get to the top of a large and highly competitive organization by debasement and humility,'' he said. The politics of humble is seen in stark contrast in Japan, where executives often make wrenching public apologies for their missteps. Akio Toyoda, the head of Toyota, recently agonized about the car company's woes, and acknowledged it was a step away from ''capitulation to irrelevance or death.'' The company, he warned, ''is grasping for salvation.'' 
 Would an American chief executive ever be so blunt?
 Rick Wagoner, who ran General Motors as it fell into bankruptcy, has remained quiet since he was fired by the government shortly before his company filed for bankruptcy. Mr. Wagoner also was involved in a frequently mentioned bad deal: G.M.'s 2000 decision to invest in Fiat. The venture cost G.M. nearly $5 billion, including money it had to spend to get out of it in 2005. Even so, Mr. Wagoner defended it.
 Since then, G.M. executives have expressed no regrets. ''It was kind of water over the dam,'' said Tom Wilkinson, a G.M. spokesman. Today, Mr. Wagoner gives guest lectures at Duke University Business School, but otherwise has avoided public forums. 
 Other lightning rods of the crisis have stayed out of the limelight, aside from appearances at Congressional hearings. Richard S. Fuld Jr., who bolstered the Lehman Brothers empire before presiding over its collapse; Angelo R. Mozilo, whose Countrywide Financial thrived by peddling dubious mortgages; and E. Stanley O'Neal, who pushed Merrill Lynch into ultimately disastrous bets, have rarely discussed their roles in the crisis. None of the men could be reached for comment. 
 Some other major financial figures have offered tepid apologies. Sanford I. Weill, who built a financial empire at Citigroup, told The Times recently that he was ''sad'' about the state of Citi and had made some mistakes. But he defended the colossus that he built and said one of his major blunders was picking Charles O. Prince III as his successor. He blames Mr. Prince for taking on a mountain of risky debt that later proved toxic.
 As for Mr. Levin, while his abject apology was years after the fact, experts said it was nonetheless stunning in an environment that generally frowns upon apologies as a sign of weakness.
 ''Certainly the accepting of public responsibility is a virtue that companies and business schools should cultivate,'' said Mr. Bruner. ''In that sense, I think Jerry Levin's apology will be studied for years to come.''

HEADLINE: Making Bankers Give Back

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Tax Them Both'' (editorial, Jan. 13), which calls for a tax on the huge bonuses that bankers are expected to pay themselves: 
 I agree that the bank profits are the result of a deliberate federal government policy to restore banking capital and ultimately investment in American prosperity. Bank bonuses have nothing to do with these objectives. The payouts to bankers are a form of appropriation of public wealth.
 That is why I have introduced the Responsible Bankers Act, which would impose a 75 percent tax on the outsized bonuses bankers are paying themselves from windfall profits earned from government support of their industry. 
 Shareholders and corporate governance have proved to be feeble means for reining in corporate pay. A tax that applies to all banking institutions is required to restore discipline, and to force bankers to apply the profits they are making from trading and speculating with zero interest money to activities that contribute to fixing the economic mess they created. 
 This bill can help accelerate America's still-deferred economic recovery.

The West Park Presbyterian Church at Amsterdam Avenue and 86th Street is well known in the city for two reasons: its place as one of New York's finest examples of Romanesque Revival religious architecture, and its long-term role as a haven for homeless people who camp in the building's doorways at night. 
 Now, two major changes have come to the 116-year-old church. On Tuesday, it achieved landmark status, bringing an end to a tumultuous quest for its preservation first undertaken by community advocates more than 20 years ago. But the church recently experienced another, less noticed watershed: Last month, church officials installed heavy black metal gates in front of its doorways, effectively halting its tradition as a homeless refuge. 
 City Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer, who represents the Upper West Side, said a chorus of neighbors complaining about the church's homeless encampment had grown louder in recent years, especially after West Park ceased offering religious and outreach services on-site in early 2008. 
 The combination of the homeless living there and a bus stop that is within tripping distance of their scattered belongings made for an untenable situation, Ms. Brewer said: ''With the church now closed, there is nobody there to monitor the homeless there on a regular basis. It has gotten to be a far more serious situation than it ever was before.''
 Park West sits next door to Barney Greengrass, a landmark of the culinary kind. Gary Greengrass, the owner, said his customers resented encountering the homeless dwellings on their way to bagels and lox. 
 ''To have people living on the church steps is not sanitary or safe,'' he said. ''I have compassion for them, but I also have a business that is on their doorstep.'' 
 During his 15-year tenure as pastor of West Park, the Rev. Dr. Robert L. Brashear, who is also chairman of the Interfaith Assembly on Homelessness and Housing, a coalition of religious organizations, has fiercely defended the right of the homeless to camp on his church's steps, providing showers and bathroom access to the people who made their home there. In 2003, Dr. Brashear led an emotional memorial service for a man who froze to death one cold night after living outside the church for three years. 
 Yet last month, after Community Board 7 enlisted the help of the mayor's office to start discussions about ending the homeless bivouac with Dr. Brashear, Ms. Brewer, the Goddard Riverside Community Center, the city's Department of Homeless Services and others, the church decided to erect the barriers. 
 ''Sadly, we are no longer in a position to develop real relationships with our homeless community,'' Dr. Brashear said on Monday. ''Once you welcome people to your steps, you have a responsibility to them. With the church closed and the landmarking in limbo, we have felt trapped between a rock and a hard place. But ultimately, I agree with the city that it is in the best interests of people not to be living on steps and we do not want to overburden our neighbors.''
 Ms. Brewer, who fought in favor of designating the church a landmark, said that the gates represent a move in the right direction, but that she hopes the church will soon install a fence that blocks all the steps in front of the church, not just the doorways, and she has agreed to find financing. It is unclear whether the addition of the gates last month would have been permitted if the church had already been designated a landmark. 
 For years, preservationists have battled with West Park parishioners who feared that landmark status would impose a financial burden on the congregation and restrict the church's religious and outreach programs. 
 In 2007, led by Dr. Brashear, the church sought to develop its air rights into a 21-story apartment tower that would bolster its endowment and pay for extensive renovations to its rapidly deteriorating exterior structure and damaged interior. Dr. Brashear's plan eventually collapsed under fierce community opposition and the recent economic downturn.
 West Park's membership has decreased to just several dozen worshipers since it closed. They attend services at the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew nearby. Most local residents think of the church less for its robust stonework or dramatic bell tower than for the ubiquitous scaffolding protecting passers-by from chunks of sandstone crumbling off its facade -- and for the homeless people. 
 On Tuesday night, Dr. Brashear was pondering his church's landmark status and expressing concern about its future and its immediate need for repairs. 
 ''We have had many verbal offers of funding for West Park,'' he said, ''but there is a difference between verbal support and real, concrete financial support. We have plans for the future to work with the homeless in our church in a more comprehensive and meaningful way. I hope we will still be able to do that as a landmark.''

HEADLINE: To Lead Schools, Christie Picks Vouchers Advocate

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
The man once described by teachers' union leaders as ''the antithesis of everything we hold sacred about public education'' was chosen to serve as state education commissioner by Governor-elect Christopher J. Christie on Wednesday.
 The nomination of Bret D. Schundler to the post underscored the governor's determination to press ahead with his push for school vouchers, more charter schools and merit pay for teachers. 
 It was the first selection by Mr. Christie to suggest even the possibility of a confirmation battle with Democrats, who control both houses of the Legislature. Thus far, the governor-elect has chosen nominees heavy on managerial experience, if lacking in drama or outsized personalities, and drawn bipartisan praise for his selections.
 Mr. Schundler, 50, was a favorite of the conservative wing of the Republican Party and a leading voice for school-choice advocates during his nine years as mayor of Jersey City, but he failed in two runs for governor, in 2001 and 2005. 
 ''We agree on the type of significant reform that needs to happen in our educational system here in New Jersey,'' Mr. Christie said in making the announcement at the State House. ''I want a strong, reasonable, bold leader who's going to help me implement those policies.''
 Still, some of the ideas that made him a polarizing figure to unions and Democratic leaders have become more mainstream, with even President Obama signaling interest in merit pay and promoting the expansion of charter schools. On Wednesday, the teachers' union issued a statement that refrained from criticizing the choice.
 His nomination -- made as the Rev. Reginald Jackson, director of the Black Ministers Council, looked on approvingly -- captivated New Jersey's political class on Wednesday.
 ''Wow! Are you serious?'' Senator Raymond J. Lesniak of Elizabeth said when told of Mr. Schundler's selection. Mr. Lesniak said he was thrilled. 
 Mr. Lesniak, a Democrat who has broken with the powerful New Jersey Education Association in sponsoring a bill to create a pilot school-voucher program, said Mr. Schundler's fate would depend largely on the three Democratic senators from Hudson County. The nominee's name is submitted to those senators, as a formal courtesy, but they could break with custom and block it if they choose.
 One of them, Senator Nicholas J. Sacco of North Bergen, is a school administrator and a past president of an affiliate of the teachers' union. In an interview, he vowed to keep an ''open mind.''
 ''I do believe that the governor has a right to make his choices,'' he said, ''but I do have somewhat of a concern about this particular choice.''
 What had been a slow rollout of appointments since the election is becoming a flurry this week, as Mr. Christie, who will take office on Tuesday, also unveiled his choices for commissioners of transportation and the environment and for new director of New Jersey Transit.
 His pick for treasurer, to be announced Thursday, is Andrew S. Eristoff, a former New York City councilman who served as city finance commissioner under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and state commissioner of tax and finance under Gov. George E. Pataki.
 Mr. Eristoff ran for State Senate in 2002 but was defeated. In 2007, he unsuccessfully sought appointment to the vacant state comptroller's job after Alan G. Hevesi's resignation. 
 The governor-elect's first choice for treasurer, Robert E. Grady, a former White House budget officer under President George H. W. Bush and, earlier, an aide to Gov. Thomas H. Kean, declined to join the Christie administration, but will be named as chairman of a new council of economic advisers, according to officials told of the governor-elect's plans. Mr. Grady and his wife recently built a home in Jackson, Wyo., where they are raising two young children, and Mr. Grady, 52, has told people he hopes to run for the Senate there someday.
 The new administration will also be heavily populated with former federal prosecutors. 
 Nine appointees so far are veterans of the United States attorney's office in Newark, which Mr. Christie led for seven years. They include the state's first lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, whom Mr. Christie has also named secretary of state and asked to oversee economic-development efforts; the attorney general, Paula Dow, and her top three aides; the head of homeland security, Charles B. McKenna; the governor's chief counsel, Jeff Chiesa, who is an old friend and protege of Mr. Christie's; and the incoming press secretary, Michael Drewniak, who held that role in the federal prosecutor's office.
 Mr. Christie has also streamlined the governor's office, with just two chiefs -- Mr. Chiesa, the chief counsel, and Richard H. Bagger, his chief of staff -- dividing up oversight of executive responsibilities. 
 Mr. Bagger will manage policy and oversee the budget process, among other functions. 
 ''A governor's office with fewer chiefs is also a stronger governor's office, because there's clearer accountability,'' he said in an interview. ''The governor can look directly to the two of us for what he needs done.''
 Mr. Christie's top appointments have been somewhat short on racial and ethnic diversity; aside from Ms. Dow, who is black, and Ms. Guadagno, his cabinet so far is all white and male.
 The influence of Mr. Giuliani, who was a political ally of Mr. Christie's, can be seen in the hiring of Mr. Eristoff, as well as in James Simpson's hiring at transportation and Gary M. Lanigan's at corrections. Mr. Giuliani recommended Mr. Simpson and Mr. Lanigan.
 Mr. Lanigan was a top deputy to the Bernard B. Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner, when Mr. Kerik was the city's correction commissioner. Mr. Lanigan oversaw the agency's finances and dealt extensively with the powerful correction officers' union. Mr. Simpson, who was an Metropolitan Transportation Authority commissioner under Mr. Pataki, also headed the Federal Transit Administration under President George W. Bush.
 Interestingly, he gave high praise in 2008 to Mr. Corzine's ill-fated plan to raise turnpike and parkway tolls 800 percent to pay for transportation improvements, calling it courageous and giving it the Bush administration's endorsement. But Mr. Christie, as a candidate, ridiculed the plan and has ruled out both toll and tax increases. Mr. Simpson, at a news conference on Monday, showed he had trimmed his sails: he said taxes were off the table and spoke instead about cost-cutting and public-private partnerships.

HEADLINE: U.S. Regions Show Gains And Softness, Fed Reports

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Little by little, regional economies in the United States are gaining strength, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday, though several pillars -- housing, real estate and the jobs market -- remain weak. 
 The central bank's report on economic growth across the country, known as the beige book, described ''modest'' improvement in 10 of the 12 regions in the nation, noting growth in consumer spending and home sales. But the Fed's cautious tone suggested that a recovery would be slow and hesitant.
 ''Through the ups and downs, this is still a moderate recovery,'' said James F. O'Sullivan, chief economist for MF Global. ''But we're at the point where strength is feeding on itself, and you'll see more strength in six months' time than you'll see now.'' 
 The report, based on interviews in December and early January, offered mixed signals on consumer spending, a crucial driver of the economy. While the holiday season brought a rush in sales, retailers in places like San Francisco and Philadelphia said the gains were so small compared with precrisis levels that they were not confident spending had resumed, the report said. The Fed characterized consumers as ''cautious, price sensitive, and focused on necessities.''
 Still, car sales were flat in most regions and increased in some areas, even in the absence of incentives like the government's cash-for-clunkers program.
 Home sales also increased in most areas, the report said, in part because of the lure of a government tax credit for first-time buyers. Much of the growth was in lower-priced homes. Over all, home prices remained about the same and residential construction was weak.
 Manufacturing, considered a bellwether sector, showed gains in production and employment in many parts of the country. A surge in exports in the last several months helped increase orders for carmakers and semiconductor companies.
 Michael E. Feroli, a senior economist for JPMorgan Chase, said a slowdown in inventory liquidation and strong demand for items including cars and soybeans from Asian countries helped rekindle the manufacturing sector. 
 Mr. Feroli characterized the outlook for manufacturing as ''not enthusiastic,'' but he added, ''on balance, it's a little more upbeat.''
 As the Fed prepares to meet this month to set monetary policy, there seemed to be little in the report to give policy makers reason to raise interest rates from record lows. Economists expect high unemployment and large amounts of excess capacity in the economy to keep inflation in check. 
 Unemployment remained a central obstacle in many regions. Last month, the jobless rate nationwide held steady at 10 percent as an additional 85,000 positions were lost. Only New York reported a significant increase in hiring, the report said.
 Another challenge is persuading consumers and businesses to borrow again. Since the onset of the crisis, Americans have been reluctant to spend freely and are hoarding more of their earnings. The report said demand for loans remained low and weakened in some regions, while loan delinquencies and defaults continued to rise in many areas. 
 Real estate agents also face dreary conditions. The commercial real estate market, hit hard by a tide of business failures, remains soft, the report said, leaving agents with a large excess supply. 
 As vacancy rates climbed, real estate companies in New York and Kansas City reported worsening conditions. Analysts say the market will be slow to recover, and they do not predict a rebound this year.
 ''It's a drag,'' Mr. O'Sullivan said, ''but it doesn't mean the overall economy won't grow.''
 In the third quarter of 2009, the economy grew at a rate of 2.2 percent. Analysts expect increased spending will help raise that rate closer to 4 or 5 percent for the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: Prolonged, Deep Cold Takes a Heavy Toll Across Florida

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
Deep Freeze 2010? Ice Week? No one in Florida knows quite what to call the lengthy cold snap that finally eased on Wednesday, but there is little doubt that its economic and social impact will be memorable and significant. 
 This was not the standard winter chill. For nearly two weeks, the Sunshine State felt like a meat locker with record lows north and south. Economists said the total cost to agriculture alone could reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars, adding another bruise to a beaten-down economy. 
 ''First, we had the credit freeze that caused the housing market to wither,'' said Sean Snaith, director of the Institute for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Central Florida. ''Now, while we're down, we get another kick from Mother Nature.'' 
 A complete assessment of the damage will take weeks, and Florida still appears to have avoided the historical worst -- like the trees that seemed to explode from frozen sap in the freeze of 1895. But this year's arctic blast was the state's longest cold stretch in decades, and by all accounts, its toll has been harsh and unpredictable up and down the food chain. 
 Vegetables were among the hardest hit. At least one major tomato grower, Ag-Mart Produce, has already declared that most of its Florida crop is ''useless due to the freeze.'' Other vegetable farms were expected to lose their entire crop, and wholesale prices have already increased. 
 ''Tomatoes were down around $14 for a 25-pound box; now they are up over $20,'' said Gene McAvoy, an agriculture expert with the University Florida, who predicted $100 million in vegetable losses. ''Peppers -- just after New Year's they were $8 a box; now they're up around $18.''
 Translation: get ready to pay up to an extra dollar a pound at supermarkets in New York and Chicago.
 Citrus will take longer to play out. Agriculture experts say the amount of loss will depend in part on how many trees show signs of damage, hurting future production, and how much fruit farmers harvest for juice before it falls to ground. 
 As temperatures crept into the 60s in much of the state Wednesday, the damage was not expected to be as crushing as the freezes of 1983 and 1984, which led to citrus losses of more than $1 billion. 
 Strawberries also seem to have made it through. Ted Campbell, executive director of the Florida Strawberry Growers Association, said that while ripe fruit would be lost, most of the plants after the freeze looked ready to produce their second and third rounds of berries. Mr. Campbell added that he hoped they would hurry up. 
 ''It's a natural response when a plant comes close to death,'' he said. ''It wants to reproduce itself.'' 
 Animals, it seems, are responding to the cold with less vigor. Tropical fish farmed for hobbyists and wild fish often caught for fun have been turning up dead all over the state. There were so many cold-stunned sea turtles needing heat in the Florida Keys that they overwhelmed a shelter and had to be put in hotel rooms. 
 Then there are the cold-blooded invasive visitors from warmer climes -- iguanas and pythons. Both started out as pets before reproducing into the thousands once set free by reckless owners and hurricanes. Now, scientists hope, many will have been killed off by the cold. 
 ''A lot of these invasive exotics come from southern climates, and they won't be able to withstand a cold spell for this long,'' said Linda Friar, a spokeswoman for Everglades National Park. ''And as they die off, the native species, the alligators and birds, are happily consuming them.'' 
 As for humans, that class of Floridian has been just as stunned as the reptiles. 
 Energy use during the freeze increased like never before. Florida Power and Light, the state's largest utility, said that on Monday morning, customers drew down 24,354 megawatts of power, breaking the record of 22,300 megawatt hours set in August 2005. 
 Entrepreneurs also emerged like umbrella salesmen in a Manhattan downpour -- pickup trucks holding wood for sale popped up in Pensacola over the weekend -- but not every warming idea proved successful. A family in North Miami and another in St. Petersburg were hospitalized for carbon monoxide poisoning after using their charcoal grills as indoor heaters. 
 The more common response was to stay in. In an area defined by the outdoors, hibernation became the standard. Boats stayed docked. Suntans faded, parking opened up in South Beach, while the sands and seas of Florida's coast were handed back to nature, at least temporarily. 
 Those who ventured out did not seem to mind. 
 ''I like it the way it is,'' said David Schwartz, 41, sitting on the sand with his wife and only a few seagulls Tuesday, having recently arrived from upstate New York. ''My vacation is to get disconnected from the normal life, not to swim, so the fact that it's empty, it's good.''

HEADLINE: Markets Improve After Bankers Testify

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market closed higher on Wednesday, following the lead of financial shares as the heads of several big banks testified in Washington about the financial crisis.
 Stocks fluctuated early Wednesday but strengthened as the questioning of bank executives proceeded with little confrontation. 
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 53.51 points, or 0.50 percent, to 10,680.77. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 9.46 points, or 0.83 percent, to 1.145.68, and the Nasdaq rose 25.59 points, or 1.12 percent, to 2,307.90.
 Executives including Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, John J. Mack of Morgan Stanley and Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of Americaappeared before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. It was the first meeting of the panel, a bipartisan 10-member group investigating the near-collapse of the financial system in the fall of 2008.
 While the executives agreed that the banks had contributed to the crisis that paralyzed the credit markets and worsened the recession, investors did not hear anything that would encourage them to flee financial stocks.
 The questions about banks underscored how many concerns investors were juggling. In much of 2009, companies increased earnings by laying off workers and cutting expenses. But the benefits of cost-cutting can go only so far, and investors are looking for signs that increases in revenue will lift earnings. 
 Stocks pulled higher in afternoon trading after the Federal Reserve said the economy was rebounding in more parts of the country. It added that economic activity remained at a ''low level.'' The report, which provides readings on the American economy by region,lifted hopes for a rebound.
 Stephen Wood, chief market strategist at Russell Investments, said he expected that improvements in economic and corporate news in 2010 would be incremental and that big gains seen in the market in the last 10 months would taper off.
 ''This might be like running on the beach with your shoes on. It's going to be a real slog,'' Mr. Wood said.
 Investors sold shares of Google after the Internet search company threatened to withdraw from China after computer hackers had led human-rights activists to reveal their e-mail accounts to outsiders. Google fell $3.39, or 0.6 percent, to $587.09. Shares of China's largest search engine, Baidu, rose $52.99, or 13.7 percent, to $439.48 in New York trading.
 The chip maker Intel is expected to post results Thursday, and the banking giant JPMorgan Chase reports Friday.
 Crude oil fell $1.14 to settle at $79.65 a barrel in New York trading. The drop in oil hurt the shares of energy companies.
 The dollar fell against most other major currencies, while gold rose.
 Bond prices fell after jumping Tuesday, pushing yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.79 percent from 3.71 percent late Tuesday.
 Following are the results of Wednesday's Treasury auction of 10-year notes:

HEADLINE: Growth In Germany Neared Zero At End of '09

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
Growth in Germany was near zero at the end of 2009, the government said Wednesday, as the nation struggled to climb out of its worst recession since World War II. 
 The economics minister, Rainer Bruderle, told reporters in Berlin that the economy was nearly stagnant in the fourth quarter after growing by 0.7 percent in the third. Mr. Bruderle spoke just after the Federal Statistics Office reported that German output declined 5 percent in all of 2009, led by a 14.7 percent drop in exports. The statistics agency did not give an official figure for fourth-quarter growth.
 Economists said that the slower growth at the end of the year was partly the result of the expiration of cash-for-clunkers incentive programs in Germany and in other countries, which had been driving sales of Volkswagens and other cars. In addition, companies probably invested less in restocking inventories that had been depleted early in 2009. 
 ''Everything that we have seen so far has been affected by special effects, such as restocking and the clunker schemes,'' said Stefan Schneider, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. 
 But Mr. Schneider said that he still expected Germany to grow about 2 percent in 2010 as exports recovered. ''The one thing that makes us more optimistic is that we are seeing a stabilization of world trade,'' he said.
 Germany is the largest economy in Europe, and its performance plays a significant role in decision making by the European Central Bank, whose governing council meets on Thursday. Analysts are not expecting the central bank to change its monetary policy, but the most recent numbers could bolster the view that the bank will wait until late 2010 or even 2011 to begin raising interest rates. 
 The news on fourth-quarter output, while unexpected, did not change overall forecasts that Germany had returned to growth, even if the recovery was choppy. The government is expected to raise its forecast for 2010 to 1.5 percent from 1.2 percent, Reuters reported. The government declined to comment ahead of the Jan. 27 release of its forecast.
 Germany's auto and machinery industries depend heavily on foreign customers, so the fate of the economy will largely depend on demand from China and other emerging markets as well as the United States, which is still the largest market for the automaker BMW and other German companies.
 Consumption held up remarkably well in 2009, rising 0.4 percent, as companies took advantage of government-subsidized ''short work'' programs to retain to employees. One worry is that consumer spending could falter as unemployment creeps higher. However, businesses probably still have enough confidence in recovery that they will avoid layoffs of skilled workers, Mr. Schneider of Deutsche Bank said. ''Their patience has been confirmed,'' he said.
 Consumer spending in 2009 was driven by a rise in outlays for transportation, the statistical office said, supporting the thesis that car-buying incentives played a major role. Most such programs in Europe had run their course by the fourth quarter.
 In a bit of good news, the German government's budget deficit for 2009 was 3.2 percent of gross domestic product, despite spending on stimulus programs and bank rescues. Though the deficit was the highest in four years, it was closer than expected to the 3 percent cap that European Union rules normally require.

HEADLINE: Like a College Visit, Minus Kegs

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY

 BODY:
JACKIE McMAKIN and her husband, David, are not the least bit apprehensive about moving next month from their home of 33 years in McLean, Va., to a retirement community in Shelburne, Vt. ''We can't wait,'' said Ms. McMakin, who is 75 and a retired vocational counselor. ''It suits our style perfectly -- casual and sporty -- the L. L. Bean of retirement communities.'' 
 They know, because they stayed several days at the community, Wake Robin, to get a feel for the place. ''We stayed overnight at about a half-dozen different communities before we made our decision,'' said Mr. McMakin, also 75 and a former director of management operations for the United States Agency for International Development. The cool climate and nearby bike paths were selling points, but most of all, he said, ''We liked the people and they all seemed to love being there, which is always a good sign.'' 
 Homes at Wake Robin range from $138,685 for a 557-square-foot one-bedroom apartment to $562,200 for a 2,448-square-foot two-bedroom cottage, with monthly fees from $2,407 to $6,160, depending on square footage. The price and fees cover lifetime use of the home, one meal a day, housekeeping, general home maintenance, utilities, wireless Internet, transportation, use of the fitness facility, classes and social events, as well as unlimited assisted or nursing care if needed.
 In a bid to attract residents in a tight economy, more retirement communities are offering overnight stays similar to what colleges offer prospective students.
 But instead of being matched with an upperclassman and staying in a dorm, retirees are squired around by community residents and stay in a model home or apartment. They eat in the dining room, use the fitness equipment, attend social gatherings, go to any scheduled classes and generally experience life there.
 ''It's pretty much the same as a college campus visit, just without the keg parties,'' said Maggie Stark, marketing director at the Kendal Retirement Community in Oberlin, Ohio, which has at least four potential residents a month taking advantage of its Try-It program -- eight a month in peak times during the spring and fall.
 With those over 55 now almost a quarter of the population, more age-restricted communities have sprung up to meet their needs. They range from sprawling active-adult communities with the amenities and carnival atmosphere of cruise ships to small, intimate communities where karaoke night would be anathema. The housing ranges from small apartments to large private homes with styles that span Southwest adobe to Swiss chalet. 
 ''These communities are all so different that it's smart to spend a significant amount of time at the places you are considering and not make a decision sight unseen,'' said Elinor Ginzler, the senior vice president for livable communities at the AARP.
 While the idea of offering no-obligation overnight stays dates back to the development of the Sun City, Ariz., retirement community in the 1960s, it is only recently that such extended trial visits have been widely offered and actively promoted. Ms. Ginzler said the poor economy has led to more-aggressive marketing, and the large and growing population of older adults has created more interest. ''We're talking 78 million Americans,'' she said. ''They have to live somewhere.'' 
 Many choose continuing-care retirement communities, which offer independent living as well as on-site assisted care and nursing care. The security of having help and support if needed is what motivated the artist Lois Manookian to move to such a facility. ''I lived alone on 10 acres on the rural edge of Appalachia, and when I turned 75, I decided it was time to move while I could still make my own decisions,'' said Ms. Manookian, now a vigorous 81. 
 She took advantage of trial-stay programs at three communities before moving in 2006 to a high-rise continuing care community in Portland, Ore., called Holladay Park Plaza, known by residents as the Plaza. ''There's a lot of pressure to make the right decision when you know that this is going to be your last stop,'' said Ms. Manookian, who teaches art classes to fellow residents at the Plaza. ''Staying a couple of days at a place is the only way to get a sense of what it would be like to live there.'' 
 She had thought she wanted to live in a community in Minneapolis but decided against it after spending several days there. ''I liked it, but it was started by Lutherans and although it wasn't still affiliated, it retained a faint flavor,'' she said. ''I went into the library and the periodicals and books indicated a worldview that was different from mine. I realized I would not be happy there.'' Besides, in Portland, she loved the vibrant local arts community, the Plaza's views of Mount Hood and the convenient public transportation. It's also closer to her daughter, who lives in Olympia, Wash.
 Trying out a retirement community for a few days usually requires a nominal fee. Robson Communities Inc. charges $30 to $40 to stay three days and four nights at one of its seven resort-style adult communities in Texas and Arizona. The fee covers one dinner and one round of golf. At Foulkeways, a Quaker retirement community in Gwynedd, Pa., the charge is $99 for individuals and $149 for couples to stay three days and two nights. Dinner and breakfast are included as well as access to the pool and fitness facilities. And Pulte Homes' Del Webb subsidiary, which has 50 active adult communities in 20 states, offers $50 a night Vacation Getaways at some locations. Guests stay in a model home with a golf cart in the garage for roaming around. They also get a round of golf, a meal at one of the on-site restaurants and access to the fitness facilities. 
 The catch is that guests taking advantage of these offers must meet with a salesperson at some point during their stay. ''It's just an hour info session at the sales office -- no pressure and no toaster ovens given out afterwards,'' said Steve Soriano, chief accounting officer at Robson. And while some people come for the inexpensive vacation with no intention of moving to the community, he said it is nonetheless the company's most effective marketing tool: ''One percent sign up if they just come for a tour and 18 percent decide it's for them if they come on the guest program.''
 Dorothy Lehmkuhl, a 72-year-old retired professional home and office organizer from Estes Park, Colo., decided she wanted to move to a Del Webb active adult community called Bridgewater in Brownstown, Mich., after she took advantage of its trial-stay program. She spent three days in one of the community's model homes last year while her husband, Bruce, 69, a retired IBM marketing manager, was on a fishing trip in the area.
 ''He told me, 'Don't you dare like it,' '' she said. But after a laughter-filled evening with a group of residents who took her to a local Hungarian restaurant, a morning spent playing bridge in the clubhouse and a luncheon with several women who live in the community; Ms. Lehmkuhl was sold. ''I loved the people and the high energy level,'' she said. Moreover, two of their three sons live in Michigan. 
 She went back a few months later and stayed again, this time with her husband. He was so impressed that they bought one of the remaining lots on a small lake in the center of the community. After they selected an exterior style and floor plan from the developer's catalog, their new house was built in 81 days, in time for the holiday season. 
 ''It's perfect for us,'' Ms. Lehmkuhl said in a cellphone conversation last month as she and her husband drove from Colorado to Michigan hauling a fishing boat packed full of Christmas decorations. ''We're ready for our next adventure.''

HEADLINE: Direct Approach Works for Avon

BYLINE: By CAMILLE SWEENEY

 BODY:
IN the 1880s, David McConnell, a door-to-door book salesman in upstate New York, thought that he might have better luck if he presented potential customers with a gift of perfume. By 1886, McConnell had formed the California Perfume Company, and within 20 years, 10,000 representatives were selling 117 products in 600 styles. In 1939, the company changed its name to Avon Products. 
 Today, direct sales make up 1 percent, or $29.6 billion, of consumer sales in the United States, according to Amy Robinson, a spokeswoman for the Direct Selling Association. In the cosmetics and personal care market, Avon dominates with more than 5.8 million representatives worldwide.
 Even in a sluggish economy, Avon is calling. Its sales last year were estimated to be $10.4 billion, nearly double what they were in 2000.
 Although Avon is recognized for its mass-market products -- in the United States, a basic face cream sells for $3.49 -- the company also offers a more premium brand, Anew, with prices as high as $68 for an anti-aging serum.
 And because high-end beauty sales have been outperforming low-end products, Avon will likely continue to focus on developing more premium products, said Mark Astrachan, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, an investment bank.
 Face-to-face sales still account for over 76 percent of all direct sales. ''The personal connection of this kind of sale cannot be underestimated,'' Ms. Robinson said. Just because someone's on a tight budget, she said, ''doesn't mean she's stopped buying her foundation.''

HEADLINE: Reaching Out to a Devastated Haiti

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 With thousands feared dead and millions reported homeless in the earthquake in Haiti on Tuesday (The New York Times on the Web, Jan. 13), America must act. This sad and tragic event requires a nonpartisan moment on the part of all Americans. 
 I applaud President Obama for coordinating the nation's various agencies to immediately help and bring comfort to millions. 
 Major buildings were damaged, roads were wiped out and infrastructure was destroyed in the poorest nation of the Western Hemisphere. The United States can make a major difference in alleviating Haiti's suffering.
 It's time to suspend for the moment the strong partisanship on issues that dominate our airways. This is the moment to renew the American spirit of helping those in tragic need. I ask, as an American, that we all pull together and demonstrate what American compassion can accomplish.
 Alan Phillips Bloomington, Ill., Jan. 13, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Last week I was in Haiti's Central Plateau with a group of doctors and medical students providing health care for the impoverished under the guidance of Project Medishare, a Miami-based nonprofit. 
 The cases we saw reinforce what we read about Haiti: it is a country deeply mired in poverty and with a long and unfortunate history. We saw a child who was on the edge of death due to malnutrition, a woman who was blind because of a disease that could have been cured by a single dose of antibiotics and many others suffering from diseases that are simple to treat and virtually unheard of in the United States. 
 The side of Haiti you don't hear about is that this is a nation richer than most in love, spirit and resilience. It is the warm nature of the people that draws anyone who visits Haiti back time and again. 
 After visiting one old woman at her small wooden hut, she insisted that we take a few grapefruits as a gift. As we left to hugs and thanks, I thought about how selfless this woman was as her grandson handed us her only things of value.
 Despite the economic downturn, few of us in the United States are in as desperate a position as the Haitians. Let us all follow their example of love and charity and help with whatever we can, even if it's only enough for them to buy a few pieces of fruit. 
 Christopher Cory Gibson Salt Lake City, Jan. 13, 2010
 To the Editor:
 I write to express my sympathy for the people of neighboring Haiti. Catastrophes like this one remind us of the fragility of all life on a still geologically active planet and of the need to work together and help one another in times of need. 
 We must also support more research aimed at predicting earthquakes and improving construction and retrofitting methods to make old and new buildings better able to withstand the incredible forces experienced during an earthquake.
 Though earthquakes are a fact of nature, we can do much to reduce the tremendous suffering and loss of life that are typically associated with these events.
 Michael Pravica Henderson, Nev., Jan. 13, 2010
 The writer is an associate professor of physics at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
 To the Editor:
 Even before this calamity, Haiti was already coping with an incredible rate of unemployment, hunger and child slavery (known as restaveks, more than 200,000 children in Haiti survive as unpaid domestic servants) and a dilapidated natural, social and economic infrastructure.
 Plagued by successive natural disasters, Haiti is also afflicted with one of the highest fertility rates in the hemisphere. The average Haitian mother has five children; half of Haitian children never attend school.
 The Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank and other aid agencies must coordinate their efforts and act urgently to help Haiti.
 Getulio P. Carvalho Alexandria, Va., Jan. 13, 2010
 An earlier version of this letter appeared as a comment on nytimes.com.
 To the Editor:
 It's time to expedite the move of the detainees from Guantanamo Bay in Cuba to prisons in the United States. With the current crisis in Haiti, we could use the prison instead as a staging base for aid.

HEADLINE: A $2.3 Trillion Bill

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
The federal government released its latest estimates of health spending last week, and they allow for some telling comparisons. In 2008, the United States spent $2.3 trillion on medical care, or 16.2 percent of gross domestic product and $7,681 per person. 
 Of this $2.3 trillion, the federal government spent $817 billion, while state and local governments spent $290 billion. The tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance amounted to about $250 billion in lost federal revenue -- which is, effectively, a government subsidy for health care. Add up all of these sources, and you get about $1.35 trillion of health spending done by the public sector and slightly less than $1 trillion done by the private sector.
 In per-person terms, government agencies spent roughly $4,500 on medical care, while the private sector spent roughly $3,100.
 Here is what is notable about that $4,500 figure: It is more than what a lot of other rich countries spend on health care -- including both the public and the private sectors. All told, Belgium, Canada and Germany each spend about $4,000 per person on health care. Australia and Britain spend about $3,500 each. Japan spends a little less than that.
 These calculations were done with help from the Commonwealth Fund and the Kaiser Family Foundation.

HEADLINE: Where's the Opera Chief? Look Onstage, or in the Pit

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
Placido Domingo, conductor, steps into the pit of the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday evening for a performance of Verdi's ''Stiffelio.'' Four days later Placido Domingo, singer, steps onto the Met stage to open a run of Verdi's ''Simon Boccanegra.''
 And so it goes. After several weeks of grueling rehearsals, Mr. Domingo alternates conducting and singing in a month of performances. Hurricane Placido is blowing through town, a display of energy that is astonishing, yet by now routine, for a man who turns 69 on Jan. 21. 
 But while Mr. Domingo performs at the Met, staffs at two other important American opera companies are working away on their own, without the presence of their general director, Placido Domingo. 
 Mr. Domingo has held that job at the Washington National Opera and the Los Angeles Opera since 2003, after several years as artistic director of both companies. They have long functioned without his complete attention, even as they have grown in prominence and quality under his leadership. But both companies have recently taken urgent economic measures that have downsized his ambitions. The Los Angeles Opera borrowed heavily from its donors and had to take an emergency loan from Los Angeles County, while Washington recently announced a round of layoffs. Those difficulties have stirred talk among many in the opera world that Mr. Domingo may be spread too thin. 
 The critics -- who include leading figures in the classical music world and current and former officials at the companies who declined to be named for fear of offending such a beloved and powerful player -- say it is sometimes hard to get a decision from Mr. Domingo, that his artistic ambitions have outstripped economic realities, and that both companies are struggling from the lack of a firm local hand. Under Mr. Domingo both have suffered vacuums in the key managerial position, variously termed chief executive officer or executive director. 
 ''Domingo is perhaps the greatest living singer today,'' said one official of a performing arts institution who deals with him. But as a manager and as a general director, he added, his performance is ''kind of suspect.'' The unhappiness among staff members has extended to board members, officials said.
 The reasons so many officials declined to make critical comments on the record are understandable. Mr. Domingo is a superstar who transcends the boundaries of opera. He is also an immensely powerful force in a relatively small world. He can make and break careers, engage singers and conductors, make deals with other companies. And his performances fill houses. He is not a man impresarios want to alienate.
 Eleni Kallas, a union official in Washington who spoke warmly of Mr. Domingo and supports him, said that problems with productions sometimes worsen because he is not on hand to nip them in the bud, and that he arrives at the end of rehearsals and asks for costly last-minute changes. In one instance the chorus had to be paid overtime for an acoustical check because Mr. Domingo had only one day free to fly in.
 But Ms. Kallas stressed that Mr. Domingo had helped greatly to improve labor relations at the Washington opera (which went through four strikes in the early 1990s), had brought in star singers and raised money as only a superstar can. ''He values his artists, from the choristers all the way up to the Maria Guleghinas and the Renee Flemings,'' Ms. Kallas said.
 Marc A. Scorca, the president and chief executive of Opera America, the major service organization in the field, gave Mr. Domingo credit for having helped both of his companies grow to prominence. ''Perhaps the institutional growth hasn't been paced in lock step with the artistic growth,'' he said. ''I have confidence both will succeed in that.''
 In an interview at the Met last week between rehearsals, Mr. Domingo said, ''I am not overstretched.'' During his years at the houses, he added, ''I've been working in the same way.''
 ''The problems we have now,'' he said, ''is simply the crisis.''
 Mr. Domingo and his associates say they communicate just fine via e-mail, telephone and snatched conversations in mid-travel. They added that since he often performs at his houses, they have plenty of face time then.
 In Los Angeles ''no decision is made without Placido,'' said Deborah Borda, the president and chief executive of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and a major player in the Los Angeles classical music world. 
 ''The direction of the company,'' she added, ''emanates directly from him.''
 Mr. Domingo said he took the general director jobs with the thought of pursuing a second career after retiring from the stage. But his remarkably healthy and still-lustrous voice kept him in the performing game. ''I cannot betray the singer,'' he said. ''I won't sing one day more than I should, but also I won't sing one day less than I can.''
 That of course comes as good news to opera companies and audiences. Mr. Domingo is in demand around the world and keeps a perpetual-motion schedule. He is packing his days at the Met, where he celebrated his 40th anniversary last season, rehearsing from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., bouncing from pit to stage, then emerging at 8 p.m. for a performance. Matters will calm down after the ''Boccanegra'' dress rehearsal on Friday.
 One afternoon last week, dressed in a black button-down shirt and black slacks, Mr. Domingo -- a man of prodigious charm and graciousness -- excused himself at the interview's outset to give notes over the phone to the soprano Sondra Radvanovsky, who is singing the role of Lina in ''Stiffelio.'' ''If we subdivide everything, it gets too busy,'' he said of one passage. 
 To conserve strength for the greater physical demands of singing, Mr. Domingo has arranged his schedule so that ''Boccanegra'' appearances always precede conducting ''Stiffelio.'' In ''Boccanegra'' Mr. Domingo the tenor is accomplishing another feat: taking on the baritone title role.
 Running opera houses and performing at them is a lucrative combination for Mr. Domingo. According to the most recent tax forms available, Mr. Domingo earned in Washington a salary of $500,000, and $270,000 for conducting and singing for the 2007-8 season. His Los Angeles salary was $700,000; no fee information was available there for the year. Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Met, which has many more productions and a vastly larger budget than Los Angeles or Washington, made $1.2 million for the 2008-9 year, according to the company. 
 Mr. Domingo's numbers do not include numerous other engagements, particularly in Europe, where fees are generally higher. 
 To be sure, many opera companies are hurting in the recession. Endowments, and the earnings they produce, are down. The donors, corporations and foundations who support opera have less wealth to bestow. So even if Los Angeles and Washington had general directors in the office every day, it is not clear that they would be any better off financially.
 But the Los Angeles Opera has been in trouble for a while. It began borrowing from donors three seasons ago, and that debt stands at about $25 million, said Stephen D. Rountree, the company's chief operating officer and the president of the Los Angeles Music Center, where it performs. The board sought a special round of gift pledges last spring, Mr. Rountree said, and by October $30 million had been pledged. But the company had to go to Los Angeles County last month for an emergency $14 million loan in bond money to pay past-due bills and keep itself afloat. 
 ''The county was our only hope,'' Mr. Rountree said. The cost is $2.1 million in interest, and Mr. Rountree acknowledged that all the special appeals could hurt normal fund-raising.
 Mr. Rountree blamed unexpected up-front costs of the opera's $32-million Wagner ''Ring'' cycle, being performed this season. He put most of the onus on former financial management and said Mr. Domingo should not be held to account. ''It's not his job description,'' Mr. Rountree said. In the interview Mr. Domingo said the company had brought ''Ring'' costs down from $40 million.
 The Washington National Opera several years ago postponed plans for a unified ''Ring'' cycle indefinitely and presented only an unstaged version of the final installment, ''Gotterdammerung,'' this season.
 Kenneth R. Feinberg, the chairman of the Washington National Opera, also deflected fault from Mr. Domingo. ''It is unfair to blame any individual for the financial problems existing in an opera company in the United States,'' he said. 
 Washington has its problems too. The Kennedy Center, where it performs, forgave $1 million of debt for rent last season, Mr. Domingo said, and officials with knowledge of the relationship said more than that was still owed. 
 The Washington company is sitting on a debt of $12 million, borrowed against its endowment from 2002 to 2004, but has recorded four consecutive balanced budgets. And it recently announced layoffs. Both companies are shrinking the number of productions next year: in Washington, from an average of seven to five, all fairly cautious choices; and in Los Angeles, from seven or eight to six or seven.
 The loss of Mr. Domingo's longtime agent and close adviser, Edgar Vincent, who died 18 months ago at 90, has taken a toll. By many accounts the maestro frequently consulted Mr. Vincent on many matters, including running the companies. 
 ''Personally I have lost a good friend,'' he said of Mr. Vincent. ''I wish that he was around. I know that probably some of the difficulties we would be able to discuss together.''
 Mr. Domingo's contracts in Washington and Los Angeles run through the end of next season. He said he had no immediate plans to retire. ''I want to see how I feel, in which stage of my career, how I feel health-wise,'' he said. 
 As for his critics, he said, ''If they are worried because I am too spread, let them tell me, and I will leave.''

HEADLINE: Small by Choice, Whether Clients Like It or Not

BYLINE: By KERMIT PATTISON

 BODY:
Nick Lessins and Lydia Esparza pride themselves on meeting high standards for quality, but not necessarily for catering to the demands of their customers. They are co-owners of Great Lake, a small Chicago pizza shop that has seen the mixed blessing of great reviews.
 The couple wanted to start a business that reflected their values: a neighborhood shop that purchases top-quality ingredients directly from farmers, makes every pizza by hand and serves great food at affordable prices. They also wanted to make sure their business did not take over their lives. The 14-seat shop is open only four days a week and does not take reservations. Deliveries? Yeah, right.
 Mr. Lessins makes every pizza by hand. ''No man is slower,'' wrote GQ's food critic, Alan Richman. ''He makes each as though it is his first, manipulating the dough until it appears flawless, putting on toppings one small bit after another. In the time he takes to create a pie, civilizations could rise and fall, not just crusts.'' Mr. Richman declared the Great Lake Mortadella pie one of the best pizzas in America -- and that is when the trouble started. The shop was mobbed, with lines stretching down the block and long waits. A condensed version of a conversation with Mr. Lessins and Ms. Esparza follows: 
 Q.You got a great review from GQ and your business went crazy. Are you glad you got this attention?
 Mr. Lessins: Yes and no. It's nice that we got recognized for doing something we feel is good. The problem is GQ deals on a whole other scale than what our business is capable of handling. Everyone forgot we were this small operation and couldn't serve everyone. We never intended to serve mass quantities and have our product available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We wanted to start a business so we could get some control in our lives. 
 Q. Do people get frustrated by the waits?
 Mr. Lessins: We've had a few people get pretty flustered -- ''What do you mean we can't be seated? We have to wait a couple of hours?'' Like somehow we've violated their human rights. Why is it a crime that we're not open seven days and we're not seating 100 people? 
 Q.Many business owners would look at your sudden success with envy and say, ''Seize the day, expand, add new locations, franchise.'' Why not you?
 Ms. Esparza: It would change our values. That is the American way -- to expand without really thinking.
 Mr. Lessins: We really enjoy the work that we're doing and we don't want to cheapen it. Consciously or unconsciously -- probably both -- we're trying to create a manageable way to earn a living and still maintain our sanity. We value time as much, if not more so, than money.
 Q.Are you making the kind of money you had hoped to?
 Ms. Esparza: We just met with our accountant and we're very happy, given the hours we have. 
 Q.People have compared you to the Soup Nazi on ''Seinfeld.'' Where do you think that comes from?
 Ms. Esparza: That comes from American culture. The customer really isn't always right. We believe we have the expertise to bring the best product. We don't randomly put these ingredients together. We spend the time to test these and try them. 
 Q.So no substitutions? No extra anchovies?
 Ms. Esparza: Substitutions are specifically for people who might have a dairy issue. Our goal is to have a very edited menu, and therefore there really are no extras. We don't offer crushed pepper. When we put options together, they're put together for a reason. We have such an edited menu, and it's shocking how much people still want to manipulate it.
 Q.In online reviews, some customers have complained about rudeness or arrogance. Where do you think that perception comes from?
 Mr. Lessins: I think that perception of arrogance has to do with the sense of entitlement and a lack of respect for someone wanting to do their job. We're just trying to do the job the best we can. We're trying to provide a quality experience for everyone who comes in. In the food service business, it's assumed that the customers have a set of God-given birthrights when they come into an establishment. It's like they've been wronged in a lot of parts of their lives, and this is their chance to even the score.
 Q. What does customer service mean to you?
 Ms. Esparza: Great service for us is the quality of food we bring to the table. 
 Q. One of our ''You're the Boss'' bloggers suggested that if you raised prices, you would make more money and have fewer but happier customers.
 Ms. Esparza: That goes to an elite crowd and we're not after that. 
 Mr. Lessins: That's kind of using an economic tool to force an end result. We would just never do that. We want to offer things at a price we think is fair. Ultimately, we want to have it accessible to a broad range of people.
 Q.Why not hire more help? Does Nick really have to make every single pizza? 
 Mr. Lessins: At this time, I'm the only one making the pizzas -- I make the dough. I make my own mozzarella. I grind my own sausage. I order most of the products from farmers and our local suppliers, assemble it and all that. It took several years for me to come up with what I have now. It's something that could definitely be communicated and delegated in a careful way. I haven't yet thought seriously about doing that because I enjoy doing pretty much every step of the process myself. It's not an ego thing -- I just enjoy working with my hands and putting this whole puzzle together and creating something. 
 Q.What do you think of review sites like Yelp?
 Mr. Lessins: Unfortunately, those sites are just being used for people to anonymously vent their own frustrations. They're not accountable to anything or anyone. I wonder what they're getting out of that to make the effort to sit down and write a paragraph or two trashing someone. Maybe they get some sadistic joy out of it. Our sense is that most of the people who do come into our place are fairly satisfied.
 Q.Is this what you expected business ownership to be?
 Mr. Lessins: I knew this was sort of a wild card -- the public service component. We focused on the logistics and details of production, quality, execution and all the boring details of renting space, utilities, construction, permits and all this kind of stuff. But public service was definitely an unknown thing. We know we can't make everyone happy. 
 Ms. Esparza: From my experience being a designer, once you know in your gut what you're doing is really good, you just have to go with it. You can't hold back because there's going to be one person saying, ''I don't like that purple or that pink.'' People are going to be people.

HEADLINE: Calorie Law Is No Match For Gluttony Of Holidays

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
When a study on New Yorkers' eating habits was released last week, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, city health officials and the report's authors focused on what appeared to be a triumph of government policy: After the city began requiring restaurant chains to post calories, customers ordered lighter food.
 But the study also revealed a stronger trend, one that speaks to the weight of human nature: around Thanksgiving and Christmas, New Yorkers seemed to lose all control. Statistically speaking, they pigged out. 
 The gluttony response detected by the study, which looked only at what New Yorkers were buying from Starbucks, may not surprise people who have eaten their way through Thanksgiving dinners and multiple office parties.
 Then there was the New Year's effect: While the average customer did buy lighter food from Starbucks after the calorie posting law took effect on April 1, 2008, the calorie drop was even greater right after Jan. 1, 2009.
 To those with a more psychological than statistical bent, like weight-loss specialists, food industry analysts and, yes, the Starbucks customers who are the guinea pigs in all this, the study sums up the resilience of the human spirit in the face of good government, the persistent urge to eat, drink and be merry, to make New Year's resolutions and then break them with impunity, and to go on yo-yo diets, despite the best-laid plans of the nanny state.
 ''I've always known that seasonability is more important than anything else,'' said Harry Balzer, vice president of the NPD Group, a consumer marketing research company, who has been watching the way people eat for 30 years. ''If we did what we say we do, we'd be a thin nation. We like food, and food has a place in our lives at different times in our lives.''
 As reliable as, well, winter, spring, summer and fall, the eating season begins at Halloween (soup consumption soars in the fall) and peaks around New Year's, Mr. Balzer said. The dieting season, he said, begins ''sometime after the Super Bowl, and they keep making the Super Bowl later and later,'' but people still indulge in chocolate for Valentine's Day and begin seriously cutting calories only in March, as they contemplate stripping down for summer and beachwear. (The study, conducted by Stanford University researchers, showed the calorie drop occurring before the Super Bowl, suggesting that Starbucks customers do not set their body clocks by the football calendar.)
 Starbucks gave the researchers access to millions of receipts encompassing every transaction in New York, Boston and Philadelphia from Jan. 1, 2008, to Feb. 28, 2009.
 Before the law took effect, customers buying sandwiches, muffins or other snacks from one of New York City's 222 Starbucks shops ordered items with roughly the same number of calories as did Starbucks customers in Boston and Philadelphia. 
 After the law took effect, New York customers ordered 14 percent fewer calories from food than before -- either by buying less food or lower-calorie food -- and came in below Boston and Philadelphia, where there was no calorie posting. (There was no appreciable reduction in calories from lattes, caramel macchiatos and other drinks, the core of Starbucks's business. Over all, the average New York customer walked away from the counter with 6 percent fewer calories than before.) 
 As the year went on, New Yorkers gradually began ordering higher-calorie foods but remained below the other two cities, peaking around Thanksgiving and Christmas. Around Christmas and New Year's, New Yorkers were once again buying Starbucks food with as many calories as were Philadelphians or Bostonians. 
 ''One interpretation is that it's the holidays, so you cut yourself some slack and you don't really worry about it,'' said Alan Sorensen, an associate professor of economics and strategic management at Stanford who was a co-author of the study. ''Another, given our study design, could be that you just get a different type of customer during the holidays, but I don't think that's the explanation. It's more likely something about consumer psychology.''
 To show how ingrained eating habits were, one of his Stanford co-authors, Phillip Leslie, suggested putting the word ''calories'' into Google Trends, which tracks the words people enter in Google's search field. Up popped year after year of graphs that looked a lot like the one in the Starbucks study.
 ''I think it's hilarious,'' Dr. Leslie said. Mr. Balzer, the marketing analyst, noted that similar graphs result from search terms like crockpot, soup and especially recipes.
 That pattern can have a long-term impact, said Dr. Marina Kurian, medical director of the New York University program for surgical weight loss. Over the course of a year, she said, people typically gain a pound, despite dieting, and over a decade, that adds up to 10 unwanted pounds.
 ''We think, maybe wrongly, that we're going to lose that weight gain by dieting in the new year,'' she said.
 Starbucks, too, is aware of seasonal imperatives, and so it offers the Pumpkin Spice Latte in the fall, Cranberry Bliss Bar in December and 90-calorie beverages in January, ''because customers are thinking about getting the new year off to a good start,'' said Sanja Gould, a spokeswoman.
 Some customers interviewed at the Starbucks at Broadway and West 95th Street in Manhattan this week said that the calorie postings had changed their buying habits. Others were unmoved.
 ''Aren't the holidays like a good way to celebrate gluttony?'' asked Erich Fuchs, a consultant to nonprofit groups, sipping a coffee, black, insouciantly. He said he bought Starbucks scones for his partner, but preferred home cooking for himself, and never worried about calorie counts, only portion size.
 A friend sitting across from him, Patrick Stucky, nursed a tea and said he never made New Year's resolutions, explaining, ''I think I'm perfect the way I am.''

HEADLINE: Obama and Lawmakers Seek Accord on Overhaul

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With a growing sense of urgency, President Obama and top Congressional Democrats held a marathon negotiating session on Wednesday in an effort to thrash out agreements on sweeping health care legislation that could provide insurance coverage to more than 30 million Americans.
 Senior House Democrats said the talks were making progress, but had not produced firm agreements. 
 The discussions, which ran from 10:30 a.m. to 6:40 p.m., were, in effect, a substitute for a Congressional conference committee, the customary means of resolving differences between the House and the Senate on major legislation.
 Mr. Obama stepped out of the meeting to telephone foreign leaders, including the prime minister of Canada and the president of Mexico, about the devastating earthquake in Haiti. But in their talks, Congressional leaders said, Mr. Obama focused on the health bill, expressed his preferences on several issues and tried to guide them toward compromises.
 The White House has been eager to show substantial progress on the legislation before Mr. Obama delivers his State of the Union address in late January or early February. And the apparent tightening of the Senate race in Massachusetts -- a special election to replace the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy is Tuesday -- has left some Democrats nervous about the risk of losing the crucial 60th vote they need to pass the bill in the Senate.
 Those who attended included Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, of Nevada, as well as committee chairmen who have worked on the legislation.
 In a joint statement Wednesday night, Mr. Obama, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid said they had made ''significant progress in bridging the remaining gaps'' between the House and Senate bills. Having worked through all aspects of the legislation, they said, ''We're encouraged and energized.''
 Representative Robert E. Andrews, Democrat of New Jersey, a subcommittee chairman who was briefed on the negotiations, said: ''President Obama has his sleeves rolled up and is in the middle of the discussions. He is choosing the right moment to be engaged. His effectiveness will be higher because he waited until the last moment.''
 The long talks at the White House were unusual and suggested that Mr. Obama, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid wanted to close a deal as soon as possible. Lawmakers often meet with the president, but usually for no more than an hour or two. 
 Among the issues discussed was how to pay for the legislation -- specifically, whether to impose a new excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health plans; whether to increase the payroll tax used to finance Medicare; and whether to apply the tax to investment income, like interest, dividends and capital gains.
 Lawmakers said they and Mr. Obama also tried to come up with a compromise on whether to establish a single national health insurance exchange, as proposed by the House, or dozens of state exchanges, as proposed by the Senate. Democrats see the exchange as a competitive marketplace where consumers could compare and buy insurance policies with federal subsidies.
 Mr. Obama has endorsed the excise tax, included in the Senate bill, as a way to slow the growth of health spending. But labor union leaders and House Democrats said emphatically on Wednesday that they still opposed the tax because it would hit many middle-income workers and retirees who had sacrificed pay raises for health benefits.
 ''Health care reform should be financed by tax surcharges on the wealthy and not by taxes on health insurance plans offered to middle-class workers, older persons and union members,'' said Representative Lynn Woolsey, Democrat of California and co-chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
 The chairmen of Verizon and AT&T weighed in with their concerns. In a letter to Congress joined by two union presidents, the executives, Ivan G. Seidenberg of Verizon and Randall L. Stephenson of AT&T, said the excise tax would ''impact health plans covering tens of millions of workers'' in various industries.
 To avoid the tax, they predicted, many employers would cut back on dental and vision coverage. Mr. Obama began the negotiations with a short meeting with Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid at the White House in the Oval Office. They moved to the Cabinet Room, where they were joined by other Democratic leaders and committee chairmen. Congressional aides sat around a long table in the Roosevelt Room and were called into the talks when their expertise was needed.
 House Republicans, staunchly opposed to the health care bill, said the secrecy of the negotiations violated Mr. Obama's frequent promises of greater openness and undermined the legitimacy of any agreements that might be reached.
 ''Where is the transparency?'' asked Representative Phil Gingrey, Republican of Georgia. ''The American people need to know. We need openness and sunshine. With health care, we are talking about one-sixth of the economy.'' 
 Democrats cited several reasons for the urgency of the health care talks. More people, they said, are losing health insurance every day. 
 ''If we do nothing, if, God forbid, this bill crashes and burns, we could have 60 or 80 or 100 million people without insurance,'' said Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York.
 Some public opinion polls show sagging support for the legislation, and Democrats said that any further delay would give Republicans more time to mobilize opposition to the bill. Moreover, several Democrats expressed concern about the impact of an upset victory by the Republican candidate for Senate in the special election in Massachusetts next week. Democratic leaders are eager to finish the health bill so they can turn their attention to jobs and the economy.
 Lawmakers apparently spent little time discussing abortion at the White House. The House bill would impose more stringent restrictions than the Senate on insurance coverage of abortion.
 Congressional leaders said they had talked to White House officials about differences on the expansion of Medicaid and subsidies to help low-income people buy private insurance.
 Representative Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, said House leaders were insisting that Medicaid be made available to people with incomes less that 150 percent of the poverty level ($33,075 for family of four), rather than 133 percent as provided in the Senate bill.

HEADLINE: Justice Dept. Opens Front Against Bias In Lending

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Justice Department is beginning a major campaign against banks and mortgage brokers suspected of discriminating against minority applicants in lending, opening a new front in the Obama administration's response to the foreclosure crisis.
 Tom Perez, the assistant attorney general for the department's Civil Rights Division, is expected to announce Thursday in New York that the administration is creating a new unit that will focus exclusively on unfair lending practices. 
 ''We are looking at any and every practice in the industry,'' Mr. Perez said in a recent interview. 
 As part of an expansion of the Civil Rights Division approved by Congress last year, the Justice Department is hiring at least four lawyers and an economist for the new unit, while about half a dozen current staff members will transfer into it.
 Mr. Perez plans to formally announce the new unit at the ''Wall Street Project'' conference organized by the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. He characterized the effort as a major turnaround, and criticized the previous administration as failing to scrutinize lending practices amid the subprime mortgage boom.
 While past lending discrimination cases primarily focused on ''redlining'' -- a bank's refusal to lend to qualified borrowers in minority areas -- the new push will instead center on a more recent phenomenon critics have called ''reverse redlining.''
 In reverse redlining, a mortgage brokerage or bank systematically singles out minority neighborhoods for loans with inferior terms like high up-front fees, high interest rates and lax underwriting practices. Because the original lender would typically resell such a loan after collecting its fees, it did not care about the risk of foreclosure.
 It is a rarely used theory, and it carries political risks. Some critics have contended that government rules pushing banks to lend to minority and low-income borrowers contributed to the financial meltdown. The campaign could rekindle that debate.
 ''They encourage lenders to make risky loans for reasons such as diversity, and then when lenders have a problem because they made too many risky loans, they condemn them for that,'' said Ernest Istook, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation and a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma. 
 Still, Mr. Istook emphasized that he was ''not defending anybody who engages in wrongful redlining practices.''
 A representative of the Mortgage Bankers Association, the lobbying arm of the real estate finance industry, did not respond to a request for comment.
 Under federal civil rights laws, a lending practice is illegal if it has a disparate impact on minority borrowers, and the Obama administration is signaling that it intends to make the enforcing of fair lending laws a signature policy push in 2010.
 The division has already opened 38 investigations into accusations of lending discrimination. Under federal lending laws, it can seek compensation for borrowers who were victimized by any illegal conduct, as well as changes in a lender's practices.
 John Relman, a housing lawyer, said there was plenty of evidence that some banks violated fair housing laws during the subprime boom. 
 Mr. Relman has helped the Cities of Baltimore and Memphis sue Wells Fargo over the costs taxpayers incurred because of foreclosures. As part of those lawsuits, he obtained affidavits from former Wells Fargo loan officers who said the bank had systematically singled out minority borrowers for high-interest, high-fee mortgages, bypassing its own underwriting rules. The State of Illinois has also sued the bank.
 Wells Fargo has denied any wrongdoing. Last week, a judge dismissed Baltimore's lawsuit, saying there were too many other causes of the damage to inner-city neighborhoods to blame the bank. Mr. Relman said the city intended to file a new complaint that focused more narrowly on recouping costs associated with specific properties.
 But it is much easier for the federal government to sue banks like Wells Fargo. Mr. Relman said he hoped the Justice Department decided to join the cases. 
 ''Not only would we welcome them; we encourage them to get involved,'' Mr. Relman said. ''It's long overdue.''
 Mr. Perez has hired Eric Halperin as a special counsel for fair lending. Mr. Halperin, a career lawyer in the division from 1998 to 2004, is currently the Washington director and head litigator for the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit group that focuses on financial products it deems predatory. 
 The division has also gained access to data the Treasury Department is collecting from banks about loan modifications for people seeking to avoid foreclosure. It intends to search for signs of any disparate impact on minorities.
 The Justice Department is also working with several state attorneys general who have taken an interest in bringing potential lawsuits over banks' subprime lending practices.
 Richard Cordray, the attorney general of Ohio, said federal and state officials were sharing information and helping one other develop potential legal theories about how to go after reverse redlining.
 ''We are looking at a common problem and a common pattern to determine what can be done about it,'' Mr. Cordray said.

HEADLINE: Administration Loosens Purse Strings for Transit Projects

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration will make it easier for cities and states to spend federal money on public transit projects, and particularly on the light-rail systems that have become popular in recent years, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said Wednesday. 
 Administration officials said they were reversing guidelines put in place by the Bush administration that called for evaluating new transit projects largely by how much they cost and how much travel time they would save.
 Transit advocates have long complained that such cost-effectiveness tests have kept many projects from being built -- especially light-rail projects, since streetcars are not fast -- and made it much harder for transit projects to win federal financing than highway projects.
 Mr. LaHood said the administration would establish new guidelines that take what he called ''livability'' into account -- evaluating projects not only by how much they shorten commutes but also by their environmental, community and economic benefits.
 ''We'll finally be able to make the case for investing in popular streetcar projects and other transit systems that people want -- and that our old ways of doing business didn't value enough,'' Mr. LaHood said to thousands of engineers, academics and transportation officials attending the annual convention of the Transportation Research Board, a division of the National Research Council. 
 Proponents of streetcars credit them with reviving cities as new housing, stores and businesses are built near the lines. They see streetcars as a step toward reversing suburban sprawl and reducing dependence on foreign oil. But opponents say that light-rail systems are simply too expensive to build and operate, given that comparatively few people ride them, and that the vast majority of Americans continue to commute by car -- often between homes and jobs that are in the suburbs. 
 Mr. LaHood spoke as Congress considers a second stimulus bill to try to create jobs and give more aid to states and the unemployed. In his remarks, the secretary said he hoped the Senate would soon take up a version of a stimulus bill that contained ''a robust investment'' in all aspects of transportation.

Summoned to Capitol Hill to explain their companies' roles in the worst economic downturn since the Depression, leaders of four big Wall Street banks offered a largely clinical take on the financial crisis on Wednesday, pointing to lapses in risk management and government regulation but offering little sense of the turmoil's human toll.
 Testifying to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, the body established by Congress to determine the causes of the Wall Street debacle, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, drew most of the fire. 
 Mr. Blankfein parried repeated questions over his bank's extraordinary profits and salaries. At one point, when he likened aspects of the financial crisis to a ''hurricane'' and similar acts of God, the commission's chairman, Phil Angelides, a Democrat and former California state treasurer, cut in to say, ''Acts of God, we'll exempt. These were acts of men and women.''
 Mr. Angelides and the other commission members challenged the bankers on executive pay and reckless underwriting and trading, often in withering terms.
 Like Mr. Blankfein, the other bankers -- Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, John J. Mack of Morgan Stanley and Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of America -- offered measured support for tougher financial regulations that would include raising banks' capital reserve requirements and reducing the danger of systemwide risk. 
 The House last month adopted a broad overhaul that would give the government new powers to break up huge companies, create a new consumer financial protection agency and tighten oversight of derivates trading. The Senate has yet to vote on the measure. 
 With scores of cameras trained on them, the four bank chiefs were sworn in under oath, and then spoke in details so technical that they were numbing at times. None apologized, though some expressed sentiments close to contrition.
 Mr. Blankfein, who in the past has said that Goldman should apologize, on Wednesday only hinted at regret. Goldman ''got caught up in and participated and therefore contributed to elements of froth in the market,'' he said.
 Regulators are investigating whether Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms deliberately packaged troubled mortgages and passed the bonds off as sound investments even while Goldman and the other banks bet against those bonds, a point on which Mr. Angelides pressed Mr. Blankfein.
 ''I do think that the behavior is improper,'' Mr. Blankfein said, adding, ''We regret the consequence that people lost money in it.'' 
 And when Mr. Blankfein said that buyers of mortgage-backed securities were primarily professional investors, Mr. Angelides interrupted to point out that those investors were ''representing pension funds who have the life savings of police officers, teachers.''
 Mr. Dimon said there had been regulatory deficiencies, but added, ''I blame the management teams 100 percent, and fault no one else.''
 Reflecting on the volatility that has rocked the markets, he recalled, ''My daughter called me from school one day and said, 'Dad, what's a financial crisis?' And, without trying to be funny, I said, 'This type of thing happens every five to seven years.' And she said, 'Why is everyone so surprised?' ''
 One commission member, Byron S. Georgiou, a lawyer, said that no one involved in underwriting exotic securities -- investment bankers, lawyers, accountants and rating agencies -- was accountable for the risk. The outcome might have been different, he said, if the participants had been made to ''eat their own cooking.'' 
 Mr. Mack embraced the analogy. ''We did eat our own cooking -- and we choked on it,'' he said. 
 The four banks represented at Wednesday's hearing have mostly returned money they received through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the 2008 effort that pumped capital into banks in an effort to spur lending. Officials from two of the biggest beneficiaries of that bailout, Citigroup and the American International Group, are expected to face the commission soon.
 While Mr. Blankfein acknowledged that ''government action was critical'' in limiting the problems, Mr. Angelides told him: ''I'm troubled by your inability to accept the probability or certainty that your firm would not have made it through the storm but for the vast array of federal assistance.'' 
 Mr. Angelides, deploring the lack of accountability for the crisis, said: ''Maybe this is like the 'Murder on the Orient Express': everyone did it.''
 The commission, which has to deliver a report to President Obama and Congress by Dec. 15, is to hear on Thursday from Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general; Sheila C. Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and Mary L. Schapiro, chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

HEADLINE: In Google's Rebuke of China, Focus Falls on Cybersecurity

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT and JOHN MARKOFF; Ashlee Vance contributed reporting from Mountain View, Calif., and Thom Shanker from Washington.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Even before Google threatened to pull out of China in response to an attack on its computer systems, the company was notifying activists whose e-mail accounts might have been compromised by hackers. 
 In a world where vast amounts of personal information stored online can quickly reveal a network of friends and associates, Google's move to protect individuals from government surveillance required quick action. In early January, Tenzin Seldon, a 20-year-old Stanford student and Tibetan activist, was told by university officials to contact Google because her Gmail account had been hacked.
 Ms. Seldon, the Indian-born daughter of Tibetan refugees, said she immediately contacted David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer.
 ''David informed me that my account was hacked by someone in China,'' Ms. Seldon said in a telephone interview. ''They were concerned and asked whether they could see my laptop.'' 
 Ms. Seldon immediately changed her password and became more careful of what she wrote. She also allowed Google to examine her personal computer at the company's request. Google returned it this week, saying that while no viruses or malware had been detected, her account had indeed been entered surreptitiously. 
 Google confirmed Ms. Seldon's account of events, but declined to say whether it had notified other activists who might have been victims of hacking.
 Mr. Drummond said that an attack originating in China was aimed at its corporate infrastructure. 
 While the full scope of the attacks on Google and several dozen other companies remains unclear, the events set off immediate alarms in Washington, where the Obama administration has previously expressed concern about international computer security and attacks on Western companies. 
 Neither the sequence of events leading to Google's decision nor the company's ultimate goal in rebuking China is fully understood. But this was not the first time that the company had considered withdrawing from China, according to a former company executive. It had clashed repeatedly with Chinese officials over censorship demands, the executive said. 
 Google said on Tuesday that that in its investigation of the attacks on corporations, it found that the Gmail accounts of Chinese and Tibetan activists, like Ms. Seldon, had been compromised in separate attacks involving phishing and spyware. 
 Independent security researchers said that at least 34 corporations had been targets of the attacks originating in China. 
 Adobe, a software maker, said it had been the victim of an attack, but said that it did not know if it was linked to the hacking of Google. Some reports suggested that Yahoo had been a victim, but a person with knowledge said that Yahoo did not think that it been subject to the same attack as Google. 
 The decision by Google to draw a line and threaten to end its business operations in China brought attention to reports of Chinese high-technology espionage stretching back at least a decade. But despite Google's suggestion that the hacking came from within China, it remained unclear who was responsible. Nevertheless, it presented the Obama administration with a problem of how to respond. 
 Google's description of the attacks closely matches a vast surveillance system called Ghostnet that was reported in March by a group of Canadian researchers based at the Munk Center for International Studies at the University of Toronto. They found that an automated espionage system based in China was using targeted e-mail messages to compromise thousands of computers in hundreds of governmental organizations. In each case, after the computers were controlled by the attackers, they were able to scan for documents that were then stolen and transferred to a digital storage facility in China.
 The researchers stopped short of directly accusing the Chinese government of masterminding the attacks. However, for years there have been reports of attacks planned by so-called patriotic hackers in China, and many American security specialists argue that these are simply irregular elements of the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, hackers frequently use so-called false flag espionage or denial of service attacks to route their activities through the computers of a third country and hide their identity.
 One of the Canadian researchers said that fellow computer security researchers suspected that the attack on Google and other recent intrusions relied on hackers sending booby-trapped documents that were stored in Adobe's Acrobat Reader format, which then infect victims' computers. This method was seen in a recent wave of attacks on the Dalai Lama's computers. ''We've seen a huge upsurge in attacks using Adobe Acrobat,'' said Greg Walton, an editor at Information Warfare Monitor, a publication of the Canadian research group.
 A spokeswoman for Adobe said the company was investigating the reports, but could not confirm that the Adobe software was linked to the most recent attacks.
 For Google, the attacks appeared to have been the final straw in a series of confrontations with Chinese authorities. 
 Top Google executives, including the chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, and the co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, were ambivalent about the decision to go into China in 2006, which involved agreeing to censor some search results on the company's local search engine, according to a former executive with knowledge of the discussions. The resistance was strong from Mr. Brin, who had grown up in the Soviet Union. 
 But after discussions and internal lobbying from Chinese and Chinese-American employees inside Google, as well as some of the company's sales executives, Google's top executives came around. They were particularly swayed by the argument that even a censored version of Google's search engine would provide Chinese people more access to information and help promote free expression in that country. 
 Once the decision was made, however, Google began expanding its operation in China, which it expected would grow to be one of the largest Internet markets. During Mr. Schmidt's 2006 visit to China, shortly after Google introduced the company's China-based search engine, Google.cn, he told reporters that it would be ''arrogant'' to try to change China's censorship laws. 
 But repeated clashes with Chinese authorities caused Google to reconsider its decision on many occasions, the former executives said. Things almost collapsed in 2008, when Chinese government officials asked Google to censor results not only on Google.cn but also on Google.com. the company's English-language search engine. Google refused, and after the 2008 Olympics, Chinese officials dropped the issue. 
 Google now says it thinks that its attempt to help bring openness to China has failed. 
 ''We were looking at an environment that is more difficult than it was when we started,'' Mr. Drummond said in an interview on Tuesday. ''Far from our presence helping to open things up, it seems that things are getting tighter for open expression and freedom.''
 Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said Wednesday that the White House had been briefed by Google on the company's decision. However, he declined to describe what actions the government might take in response to the claims of Chinese-directed Internet attacks.
 ''The recent cyberintrusion that Google attributes to China is troubling, and the federal government is looking into it,'' said a White House spokesman, Nicholas Shapiro. He said that the president had stated that Internet freedom was a central human rights issue on a recent China trip. He also said that the president had made Internet security a national priority.
 Gabriel Stricker, a Google spokesman, said Google's decision to publicize the attacks was motivated in part by its desire to alert activists that their accounts could have been compromised. 
 The attacks present a challenge for the Obama administration, which last year debated the role of a federal Internet security adviser. The administration is grappling on how to balance stricter security controls and the freedom of technology companies to innovate. 
 Several Internet security specialists were quick to point out that a group within the White House led by Lawrence H. Summers, the national economic adviser, had pointed to Google in debates on the appointment as an example of an innovative Silicon Valley company that might be hamstrung by strict new Internet security restrictions.
 ''It's ironic that the new economy folks at the White House were pushing back against faster movement on cybersecurity to protect companies like Google from stricter regulations,'' said James Lewis, an Internet security specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Last year, Mr. Lewis led a bipartisan study calling for the creation of a strong Internet czar reporting directly to the president to combat a rash of new security threats.
 The White House said on Tuesday that Robert A. Schmidt, a compromise candidate who was chosen last month to be the Internet security adviser, would not start in the position until later in the month. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 15, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about Google's threat to withdraw from China misstated the given name of the White House's choice for Internet security adviser. He is Howard A. Schmidt, not Robert. The article also misspelled, in some editions, the name of the spiritual leader of the Gelug sect of Tibetan Buddhism, whose computers are suspected of having been attacked by the Chinese government. He is the Dalai Lama, not the Dali Lama.

HEADLINE: Fewer Tourists in New York? The Vendors Knew

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''From Airports to Broadway, Crowds Were Thinner in '09'' (front page, Jan. 1): 
 There were other, knowledge-based indicators of thinner tourist spending in 2009. But no one asked for their input. Who were these ground-level economic wizards? They were and are the street vendor and/or peddler -- organized and licensed as well as the unorganized and unlicensed.
 I am a registered vendor at the year-round Sunday tourist attraction, the Green Flea Market on Columbus Avenue. As vendors there, we saw a sharp drop in tourist visits and spending by Thanksgiving 2008 to that year's end. By spring 2009, we knew it was to be a difficult year of fewer and smaller sales than previous tourist years. 
 As seasoned vendors along with newly unemployed folks taking up vending to survive, we are glad to say goodbye to 2009 economically. We eagerly look forward to a robust return of tourists in 2010. But the next time economists need concrete (with doses of realism) early indicators of tourist visits or spending data beyond airports and hotels, simply interview the vendors and peddlers of New York City. We know. We see it first.

HEADLINE: Flawed Building Likely a Big Element

BYLINE: By HENRY FOUNTAIN

 BODY:
Engineers and architects who have worked in or visited Haiti say that substandard design, inadequate materials and shoddy construction practices likely contributed to the collapse of many buildings in the earthquake that struck Tuesday. 
 Cameron Sinclair, executive director of Architecture for Humanity, a nonprofit design group based in San Francisco, said he was ''horrified'' when he visited Port-au-Prince and Gonaives last October to assess the quality of construction there.
 Mr. Sinclair said that design and construction were far worse than in other developing countries he had visited. ''In Haiti, most if not all of the buildings have major engineering flaws,'' he said.
 Most houses and other structures are built of poured concrete or block, there being very little lumber available due to mass deforestation, said Alan Dooley, a Nashville architect who designed a medical clinic, built of reinforced concrete, in Petite Riviere de Nippes, a fishing village 50 miles west of Port-au-Prince.
 Concrete is very expensive -- much of the cement for it comes from the United States, Mr. Dooley said -- so some contractors cut corners by adding more sand to the mix. The result is a structurally weaker material that deteriorates rapidly, he said. Steel reinforcing bar is also expensive, he said, so there is a tendency to use less of it with the concrete.
 Building codes are limited or nonexistent, so columns and other elements made from concrete are often relatively thin, designed without proper margins of safety. ''We would double the design strength, just to give it a factor of safety,'' Mr. Dooley said, referring to practices in the United States. ''There they'd design it to what it would hold.''
 Concrete blocks are often substandard too, said Peter Haas, executive director of Appropriate Infrastructure Development Group, a nonprofit organization that is working on several projects in Haiti. Many of them are made in small batches at people's homes, and the quality can vary. ''When you're buying blocks at the store you really have no idea of where they're from,'' Mr. Haas said. ''And all it takes is for the block that was made at home to collapse.''
 When builders in Haiti do take disasters into account in their designs, their most recent experience has been with hurricanes, the last major earthquake having occurred two centuries ago. ''Newer construction has been developed to withstand hurricanes, not earthquakes,'' said John McAslan, a London architect who has studied Haitian buildings, working with the Clinton Global Initiative. ''If you engineer for one you're not necessarily covering the other.''
 Mr. Dooley said that his original design for the medical clinic called for a steel roof, but that was changed to a reinforced concrete one to better withstand hurricane-force winds. The building survived the earthquake with apparently little damage, he said.
 But many other concrete roofs presumably collapsed, adding to the loss of life. Mr. Sinclair said he had seen houses where builders put concrete roofs on top of low-grade blocks. ''Then it just pancakes,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The 10 Percent Rules

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
If Massachusetts was the Department of Homeland Security, the special election to fill Ted Kennedy's senate seat would have the Democrats about four-fifths of the way up the terror alert code.
 Green: Everything is fine, and who cares if we spelled ''Massachusetts'' wrong in one of the ads.
 Blue: Don't forget to vote. It's next Tuesday. You'll remember to vote, right? 
 Yellow: Bill Clinton is coming for a rally. John Kerry has got to show up, too. I don't care if he just had hip-replacement surgery. 
 Orange: You know, it really doesn't matter whether you win by a million votes or one vote, just so long as you win.
 The campaign has not hit red yet, although, for the Democrats, the whole world has begun to look orange with dark tints. Like a decaying pumpkin. It cannot be a good sign when the Massachusetts secretary of state has to deny rumors that he plans to stall certification of the election results until after the health care bill is passed.
 Of course, it's all about the health care bill. ''As the 41st senator, I can stop it,'' Scott Brown, the Republican nominee, says frequently.
 We will return to our discussion of the Massachusetts special election shortly, after the following special rant about the concept of the 41st senator.
 * * * * *
 SPECIAL RANT
 There are 100 members of the Senate. But as Brown is currently reminding us, because of the filibuster rule, it takes only 41 to stop any bill from passing. 
 U.S. population: 307,006,550.
 Population for the 20 least-populated states: 31,434,822.
 That means that in the Senate, all it takes to stop legislation is one guy plus 40 senators representing 10.2 percent of the country.
 People, think about what we went through to elect a new president -- a year and a half of campaigning, three dozen debates, $1.6 billion in donations. Then the voters sent a clear, unmistakable message. Which can be totally ignored because of a parliamentary rule that allows the representatives of slightly more than 10 percent of the population to call the shots.
 Why isn't 90 percent of the country marching on the Capitol with teapots and funny hats, waving signs about the filibuster?
 * * * * *
 O.K., done now.
 Martha Coakley, the Democratic Senate nominee, is the kind of candidate who reminds you that the state that gave birth to John Kennedy also produced Michael Dukakis. She is the attorney general, and her speaking style has been compared to that of a prosecutor delivering a summation to the jury. In civil court. In a trial that involved, say, a dispute over widget tariffs.
 She is so tone deaf that she made fun of her opponent for standing outside Fenway Park shaking hands ''in the cold.'' A week before the election, Coakley was off the campaign trail entirely in Washington for a fund-raiser that was packed with the usual suspects. But undoubtedly it was well heated. 
 Brown, her opponent, is a conservative state senator who believes in waterboarding but not necessarily global warming. When he was 22, he won an ''America's Sexiest Man'' contest, the prize for which was $1,000 and a chance to pose naked in a Cosmopolitan magazine centerfold. One of his daughters -- this is perhaps the best-known factoid in the campaign -- came in somewhere between 13th and 16th on ''American Idol.'' 
 ''For our family, especially me being on 'Idol' but my dad being in politics, there are always so many people who have something negative to say,'' Ayla Brown told The Boston Herald this week. Her talent was singing, not sentence construction.
 (This week Coakley unleashed a hard-hitting ad that charged Brown with being, um, a Republican. Brown's hard-hitting response charged Coakley with running a negative ad. He is generally thought to have gotten the best of that round, especially given that little mishap with the spelling of the name of the state.)
 Some polls show Coakley with a 15 percent lead. However, others show the race narrowing toward a tie. (''Dead heat,'' announced a fund-raising e-mail message from John Kerry that seemed intended to induce panic attacks on the part of recipients.) 
 The surveys that show the race being too close to call do not seem as reliable as the ones that show Coakley winning handily, but the Democrats who watch these things say the absentee ballot requests are way up in traditionally Republican areas and down in the places that went hard for Obama in 2008.
 The tea-party types are euphoric, pouring money in Brown's direction. The people who voted for Barack Obama, meanwhile, are sullen and dispirited. This is, of course, partly because of the economy, but also partly because of the sense that the president is not getting anything done. 
 Which brings us back to the 10 percent rule. Don't get me started again.

HEADLINE: Administration Says Stimulus Has Worked

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration, in its latest progress report on the $787 billion stimulus program, said both the overall economy and employment continued to be in better shape at the end of 2009 than they would have been without the government's help.
 But as expected, the program's impact on economic growth in the fourth quarter was less than in two previous quarters, according to President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. 
 The council's report, the second of the quarterly assessments mandated by Congress, said that in the fourth quarter the stimulus plan's tax cuts and spending added about 2 percentage points to the gross domestic product, which is the size of the economy as measured by the total goods and services produced. 
 Though unemployment reached 10 percent at year's end--two percentage points higher than the peak that the council forecast when the administration proposed the stimulus package to Congress nearly a year ago--the number of jobs was between 1.5 million to 2 million greater in the fourth quarter than it would have been without the recovery plan, the council said.
 ''Of course, with the unemployment rate still at 10 percent, the American economy is far from healthy,'' the report said. ''But there is little question that the economy is on the road to recovery.''
 The council estimated that the stimulus provisions boosted economic growth in the fourth quarter by less than in the second and third quarters. But the council chairman, Christina Romer, has said that such a leveling off is typical of stimulus measures, which have their biggest economic bang at the outset.
 Mr. Obama signed the recovery plan into law late in the first quarter of 2009, when the economy shrank by 6.4 percent. It shrank by a much smaller 0.7 percent in the second quarter before growing 2.2 percent in the third.
 Private forecasters project that the economy grew about 4 percent in the year's final quarter. If so, the council said, that would be the first time that the economy grew by an amount greater than the boost attributed to the stimulus plan. ''Even so,'' the council added, ''growth would have been considerably more anemic without the fiscal stimulus.'' 
 The report acknowledged the difficulty of accurately gauging the stimulus program's economic impact when it is impossible to know what would have happened without such action. But to buttress its own conclusions, the council included in its report comparable estimates from five private-sector analysts at economic forecasting firms and big banks.
 The administration figures, however, consistently are on the more optimistic side. Even so, the public and private estimates together suggest ''that the Recovery Act has played a key role in the turnaround of the economy that has been occurring over the past three quarters,'' the report said.
 As of the end of 2009, about one-third of the $787 billion economic recovery act -- $263 billion -- has gone out the door, according to the report. That share rises to more than half counting nearly $150 billion more that has been obligated to projects such as public works construction, but which has not yet been spent. 
 Spending and tax cuts have averaged roughly $85 billion a quarter, according to the report. That includes tax cuts for individuals and businesses, aid to states to maintain education and health spending, and extended benefits for the unemployed.
 By the fourth quarter, the report said, federal spending on investments to help create jobs -- including for public works, energy programs and information technology at hospitals and medical offices -- accounted for $41 million of the total spent to date, compared to just $6 billion in the second quarter for such purposes.
 That largely reflects the time lag for projects that take more time to plan and contract for, compared to tax cuts and state aid that could go out quickly. Administration officials have said that the stimulus program is likely to have greater impact on saving or creating jobs this year than it did in 2009. 
 The council separately analyzed spending and tax cuts intended to add jobs by encouraging clean energy production and use. Those measures, which account for under 12 percent of the $787 billion, so far have helped save or create about 63,000 jobs, the report said.

HEADLINE: Few Burns for Four Bankers on the Hot Seat

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The four bankers of the apocalypse strode into the Congressional hearing room and formed a crooked line. They raised their hands haltingly, looking at one another as if to see whether the other guys were going to do it, too. It was one of the more indecisive swearings-in you will ever see on Capitol Hill. 
 As cameras clacked Wednesday, four of the nation's highest financial fliers took their places before the 10-member Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission charged with determining the causes of the nation's financial debacle. 
 The bankers -- Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, John J. Mack of Morgan Stanley and Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of America -- joined a gallery of titans who have suffered through this ritual: tobacco executives, automakers and baseball's steroid users, among others. Few Americans remember what they said, but the images endure as cultural mug shots.
 Mr. Dimon (the silver-haired one) arrived first Wednesday morning, standing with his arms folded behind his witness chair, smiling for the cameras. He accepted a small packet of peanut butter cookies from a woman in the audience who rushed up to him. He was joined in chit-chat by Mr. Blankfein (the bald one), then Mr. Moynihan (the baby-faced one).
 Mr. Mack (the bushy-eyebrowed one) stood apart from the others in the back of the hearing room. ''I'm not going up there,'' he said to no one in particular, resisting the photographic firing squad until the last possible second.
 Then the gang that couldn't oath straight mumbled its ''I do's.'' 
 For those anticipating a cathartic ceremony of dressing-downs, apologies or verbal brawling, there was little of it during the three-and-a-half-hour hearing. Nor did the circular House hearing room resemble anyone's idea of a circus tent; it was packed but quiet, scattered with a few innocuous protesters. The 10 commissioners pressed the bankers on executive compensation, on managing risks and on lending practices, keeping up a brisk pace while the witnesses fidgeted like busy people who all had planes or trains to catch. 
 The initial round of questions and responses provoked disapproval, a few pointed fingers and sporadic shows of humility from the witnesses. ''If you do everything right in business, you're going to make mistakes,'' said Mr. Dimon.
 Labored metaphors abounded. Phil Angelides, the former state treasurer of California who is the commission's chairman, told Mr. Blankfein that he sounded like he was selling cars with faulty brakes and then buying insurance on the driver. 
 Bill Thomas, the panel's vice chairman and a cantankerous former congressman from California, compared the work of the commission to an iceberg that was only one-eighth visible over the water.
 Commissioner Byron S. Georgiou noted that the banks had ''eaten their own cooking'' (sort of a gastronomic version of the ''made their own bed'' cliche). Mr. Mack heartily agreed.
 ''We did eat our own cooking,'' he said. ''And we choked on it.''
 After Mr. Angelides called for a quick break, the chief executives bolted -- except for Mr. Mack, who stayed behind at the witness table. ''What are people supposed to think when they see these bankers taking big bonuses?'' one reporter asked Mr. Mack, who began his answer by noting that he did not get a bonus. Behind him, a woman wearing a Washington Nationals baseball cap was scurrying around, trying to get people to take her homemade fliers denouncing the Bank of America. She wore a ''Fire Kenneth Lewis'' T-shirt (Mr. Lewis was until recently the bank's chief executive).
 ''I'm here because I want to put these guys in jail,'' said the woman, Judy Koenick, of Chevy Chase, Md.
 No stranger to muscular but diminished adversaries, Mr. Angelides, who lost the governor's race in California to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006, pointedly compared some Wall Street chief executives to blackjack players who could win huge amounts of cash but not lose anything. Mr. Dimon responded, ''You can lose your job, and your reputation.''
 Finally, before lunchtime, Mr. Angelides dismissed the executives.
 A reporter asked Mr. Mack if the experience had been fun. ''Well,'' he said, making his way to the exit, ''it's just something that we had to do.'' 
 Following a few feet behind, Mr. Dimon made the mistake of stopping to chat with someone and found himself gridlocked in a solo press conference. 
 Why were the chief executives not more apologetic? a reporter asked. 
 People ''have to be very specific'' when asking for apologies, Mr. Dimon cautioned.
 He squared his shoulders and headed for the back door, only to meet an insistent question from Jonathan Karl of ABC.
 ''Mr. Dimon, does Wall Street get it?'' Mr. Karl asked the banker, who kept walking and had nothing more to say.

HEADLINE: Google Takes A Stand

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
It has been dispiriting to see America's banks apparently stand for nothing more lofty than plunder. It has been demoralizing to see President Obama hiding from the Dalai Lama rather than offend China's rulers.
 So all that makes Google's decision to stand up to Chinese cyberoppression positively breathtaking. By announcing that it no longer plans to censor search results in China, even if that means it must withdraw from the country, Google is showing spine -- a kind that few other companies or governments have shown toward Beijing.
 One result was immediate: Young Chinese have been visiting Google's headquarters in Beijing to deposit flowers and pay their respects. 
 China promptly tried to censor the ensuing debate about its censorship, but many Chinese Twitter users went out of their way to praise Google. One from Guangdong declared: ''It's not Google that's withdrawing from China, it's China that's withdrawing from the world.''
 Cynics say that Google tried to turn a business setback (it lags in the Chinese market behind a local search engine, Baidu) into a bid to burnish its brand. Whatever the motivations, it marks a refreshing contrast to Yahoo assisting the Chinese government in sending four dissidents -- Shi Tao, Li Zhi, Jiang Lijun and Wang Xiaoning -- to prison for terms of up to 10 years.
 ''In the 20 years I've been doing this work, I can't think of anything comparable,'' said John Kamm, the founder of the Dui Hua Foundation, which has enjoyed remarkable success in encouraging China to release dissidents. Mr. Kamm, a former business leader himself, argues that Western companies could do far more to project their values.
 Google announced its decision after a sophisticated Chinese attempt to penetrate the Gmail addresses of dissidents. The episode and the resulting flap highlight two important points about China. 
 The first is that Beijing is increasingly devoting itself to cyberwarfare. This is a cheap way to counter American dominance in traditional military fields. If the U.S. and China ever jostle with force, Beijing may hit us not with missiles but with cyberinfiltrations that shut down the electrical grid, disrupt communications and tinker with the floodgates of dams.
 Moreover, China's leaders aren't keeping their cyberarsenal in reserve. They seem to be using it aggressively already.
 A major coordinated assault on computers of the Dalai Lama, foreign embassies and even foreign ministries was uncovered last year and traced to Chinese hackers. The operation targeted computers in more than 100 countries and was so widespread that Western intelligence experts believe it was organized by the Chinese government, although there is no definitive proof of that.
 (If this column is replaced on nytimes.com with one under my byline praising the glorious courage of the Chinese Communist Party in standing up to the bourgeois imperialists of Google -- well, that would make my case.)
 A second point is that China is redrawing the balance between openness and economic efficiency. The architect of China's astonishingly successful economic reforms, Deng Xiaoping, clenched his teeth and accepted photocopiers, fax machines, cellphones, computers and lawyers because they were part of modernization. 
 Yet in the last few years, President Hu Jintao has cracked down on Internet freedoms and independent lawyers and journalists. President Hu is intellectually brilliant but seems to have no vision for China 20 years from now. He seems to be the weakest Chinese leader since Hua Guofeng was stripped of power in 1978.
 Instead, vision and leadership in China have come from its Netizens, who show none of the lame sycophancy that so many foreigners do. In their Twitter photos, many display yellow ribbons to show solidarity with Liu Xiaobo, a Chinese writer recently sentenced to 10 years in prison. That's guts!
 China's Netizens scale the Great Firewall of China with virtual private networks and American-based proxy servers like Freegate. (The United States should support these efforts with additional server capacity as a way of promoting free information and undermining censorship by China and Iran).
 Young Chinese also are infinitely creative. When the government blocks references to ''June 4,'' the date of the Tiananmen Square massacre, Netizens evade the restriction by typing in ''May 35.''
 When I lived China in the 1990s, an early computer virus would pop up on the screen and ask: Do you like Li Peng? (He was then the widely disliked hard-line prime minister.) If you said you didn't like Li Peng, the virus disappeared and did no harm. If you expressed support for him, it tried to wipe out your hard drive.
 Eventually, I think, a combination of technology, education and information will end the present stasis in China. In a conflict between the Communist Party and Google, the party will win in the short run. But in the long run, I'd put my money on Google.

HEADLINE: If California Owes You, It Would Like To Pay You. Really. But Hurry.

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Somewhere high in the snowy, mountainous wilds of Alpine County, Calif., there is a Californian with a piece of paper worth $1,305.
 This person is not alone. Across the state, 89,000 residents and businesses -- including 2,315 here in San Francisco alone -- are sitting on some $50 million in uncashed i.o.u.'s from the state, a souvenir of California's most recent, but by no means its last, budget crisis.
 John Chiang, the state controller, promised Thursday to contact every one of the nonredeemers in an effort to ''close an ugly chapter in California fiscal history.'' Mr. Chiang practically begged them to drain the treasury. 
 ''We have your money,'' he said. ''Ask for it. We want to give it back to you.'' 
 Such sudden largess was greeted happily by money-crunched officials like Pamela Knorr, the administrative officer in Alpine County, who volunteered to hunt down her county's one mysterious resident.
 ''We're so small, I probably know who it is,'' Ms. Knorr said. ''I'd love to the bearer of good news for once.''
 All told, the state issued about 450,000 i.o.u.'s valued at more than $2.6 billion to taxpayers, vendors and contractors in July after it failed to close a budget gap on time and started to run out of money. 
 The state started redeeming the i.o.u.'s, with interest, in September after a budget was passed, but some people apparently did not get the message.
 Mr. Chiang speculated that some residents might have been confused by the i.o.u.'s, which were labeled as registered warrants, the bureaucratic parlance for the notes. Or, he said, ''they might have other things on their mind.''
 Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Los Angeles County, where there are some 23,000 i.o.u.'s lying around, worth almost $10 million.
 The announcement about the neglected i.o.u.'s came as the state continued to weather grim economic times. A report on Thursday found that some 630,000 homes went into foreclosure in California in 2009, more than in any other state in the nation, according to RealtyTrac, an online real estate company that specializes in foreclosures.
 Unemployment also continues to run high in California. It was more than 12 percent in November. 
 And the state, despite wanting to make good on its markers, is also facing more trouble down the line, including projections showing a $19 billion to $21 billion deficit in the next year and a half. 
 ''We're going to have plenty of cash challenges,'' Mr. Chiang said. 
 Residents have until September to cash the i.o.u.'s. After that, the state will not honor them and the money will remain in the treasury.
 The slow-poke redeemers come from up and down California, including Modoc County -- on the Oregon border where six rural residents are owed $182 -- and sun-dappled San Diego, where some 6,000 people could claim more than $2.6 million. 
 In Alpine County, south of Lake Tahoe, there is one outstanding i.o.u. in the county of 1,180 full-time residents. Like many counties, Alpine has been hit hard by cutbacks from the state, Ms. Knorr said, including major reductions in financing for social programs and road maintenance, a vital service in an area where heavy snow can fall from October to May. 
 Ms. Knorr thought perhaps the Alpine i.o.u. might have been thrown away by one of the county's many retirees or just a citizen skeptical that anything good could have been coming from the government.
 ''Maybe they thought,'' Ms. Knorr said, ''the state was going to sock it to them again.''
