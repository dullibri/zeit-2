HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rallies After the Swiss Say Their Franc Is Overvalued

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied yesterday, bolstered by a selloff in the Swiss franc, which tumbled after Swiss officials said the currency was overvalued.
The dollar was also helped by selling of pounds by traders to lock in profits and by renewed optimism on the prospects for Europe's planned single currency, a development that weakened the German mark. 
 In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.5178 marks from 1.5109 on Wednesday and to 114.05 yen from 113.94. The pound, which surged on Wednesday after a rise in British interest rates, fell yesterday to $1.6280 from $1.6337.
The Swiss franc is one of the most stable currencies. But it began to weaken after finance officials reiterated their view that the franc was overvalued despite a reduction of interest rates last month to the lowest levels in nearly 20 years.
The high cost of the Swiss franc is hurting Switzerland's economy by making its exports more expensive. But low interest rates in Switzerland have failed to reduce the currency's attraction for global investors seeking a haven for their money.
Switzerland's Finance Minister, Kaspar Villiger, said after a conference in Zurich that the franc was likely to fall. The Swiss central bank's chief economist, Georg Rich, in an interview in the weekly Swiss newspaper Handels Zeitung, said the franc's strength was contributing to Switzerland's economic weakness. Traders bought marks and dollars in response, bolstering them relative to the Swiss franc. In New York, the dollar surged to 1.2680 Swiss francs, up from 1.2541 on Thursday.
"We just rocketed higher," said Ben Strauss, a trader at the New York branch of Bank Julius Baer & Company. "We had a continuation of the jawboning from central bank ministers in Switzerland that the Swiss franc is overvalued."
Andrew Hodge, a currency strategist at Bank Brussels Lambert in New York, said the Swiss franc was also undermined by rumors that the Swiss would ease their tight bank secrecy. Recent revelations about Swiss bank collaboration with the Nazis in World War II have focused attention on Switzerland's confidential banking practices.
In other trading, a strengthening Mexican peso closed at a level of 7.93 to the dollar yesterday, a day after passing the eight-to-the-dollar level for the first time since the Mexican economic crisis began in late 1994.

What Reagan Left Behind: More Than Some Jokes

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
The Reagan Presidency, still able to provoke arguments among politicians and historians, comes under scrutiny in "The Reagan Legacy" on "Discovery Journal." Sunday's opening hour focuses on what has come to be known as Reaganomics; Monday brings back the Strategic Defense Initiative, a k a Star Wars. Both have figured in the Presidential campaign now reaching its climax or anticlimax, and both, by this incisive account, sprang full-blown from Mr. Reagan's philosophy and personality.
Relying largely on eminences in the Reagan White House, "Balancing Act" on Sunday tells of how candidate Reagan's promise of a balanced budget gave way to President Reagan's determination to cut taxes and build up the nation's military. 
 Particularly sharp attention is given to the deals with which the Administration bought the votes of conservative Democrats for a big tax cut. Donald Regan, then Secretary of the Treasury, says: "You would accuse these Congressmen of being too narrow in their prejudices and say, 'Look, we're looking at the common good,' and they would say, 'Yes, but we weren't elected by the common good, we were elected by our constituencies.' " The result was billions of dollars in sweeteners for oil and natural-gas producers, sugar and peanut growers, real-estate interests and like groups.
Former Treasury Department officials tell of trying, to little avail, to protect the budget. Supply-side economics and heavy military spending ("Whatever Cappy wants Cappy gets," says one of them, referring to Caspar W. Weinberger, the Reagan Secretary of Defense) brought short-term prosperity and an enormous deficit that continues to weigh on the nation.
"Star Wars," on Monday, is an equally sharp account of how Mr. Reagan's abhorrence of nuclear weapons led to the Pentagon's spending billions on a scientifically dubious search for a weapon that could destroy space missiles in flight. Russian officials' recollections of the impact of the idea on the Kremlin, where it was seen as a destabilizing threat, are fascinating.
This report leaves us with the possibility that a notion that many even in the Pentagon considered wacky helped bring about Soviet-American detente. Speaking of Mr. Reagan's Moscow visit to Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1988, Anatoly F. Dobrynin, then the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, says: "He began as a No. 1 enemy and he ended, if I may put it this way, as No. 1 friend from the capitalist world."
Produced by the team that gave us the exemplary "Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation," and narrated by Garrick Utley, "The Reagan Legacy" attests that Ronald Reagan was not just a practiced television communicator and remarkably popular figure. For better and for worse, his simple but big ideas changed the course of American politics and world history.

If it's more obscure figures than Mr. Reagan you're after and more improbable causes than Star Wars, here they are: the environmentalist who wants to ban computers on the ground that they cause cancer; the evangelist who would assign the National Guard to shut down abortion clinics; an anti-plaque campaigner; a fellow who is alerting the rest of us to the danger that U.F.O.'s pose to shopping malls; the former nun who wants marijuana legalized, and others. Better catch them; this may be their first and last appearance in prime time.

HEADLINE: Japan Premier Did Too Well in Election to Form Solid Coalition

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 31

 BODY:
Despite a resounding victory for his party in national elections, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto is having difficulty forming a new governing coalition, raising the likelihood that Japan's next government will be fragile and indecisive.
Political experts say it now looks likely that Mr. Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party will not be able to put together a coalition that will give it a comfortable majority in the lower house of Parliament. 
 Instead, the Liberal Democrats might run a minority government, controlling the Cabinet but being forced to cooperate with other parties on a case-by-case basis to enact legislation. That could slow passage of laws to deregulate the economy or streamline Japan's bureaucracy.
"You're looking at the prospect of gridlock," said John Neuffer, a political analyst here. But he said the new government would not be in danger.
The Liberal Democratic Party took a step toward a minority government today when it agreed with its two partners in the current ruling coalition to cooperate on some policy issues, such as proposing a bill to reduce the number of ministries and agencies over five years.
The two parties, the Social Democrats and the New Party Sakigake, made it clear that they would not remain in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats and would not cooperate on all issues. The Social Democrats, for instance, are calling for a reduction in the number of United States marines stationed in Okinawa while the Liberal Democrats want to maintain current troop levels.
Mr. Hashimoto may attract enough independents and defectors from other parties to scrape together a majority by next Thursday, when the lower house of Parliament will meet in a special session to elect the new Prime Minister. It is certain to be him, even if his party does not have an absolute majority by then.
It was not supposed to turn out this way. The Oct. 20 election was seen as a resounding victory for the Liberal Democrats, who ruled Japan for most of the period since World War II until falling from power after voter disgust over corruption in 1993.
The Liberal Democrats won 239 seats in the 500-seat lower house, up from the 211 seats it held before. It would be relatively easy, it was thought, for the party to cobble together a majority and continue its conservative policies.
The problem, however, was that the L.D.P. won so many seats that it has scared away potential partners, which fear being dominated in a coalition. "Ironically, because the L.D.P. won a few seats too many, this government is turning out to be a weaker government," said Shigenori Okazaki, a political analyst for SBC Warburg Japan, a securities firm.
The Socialists were decimated in the last election, winning only 15 seats, down from the 30 they held before. Party officials say its longtime supporters deserted the party at the polls because it had abandoned its principles by entering into the coalition with the Liberal Democrats. The new Socialist leader, Takako Doi, has thus vowed to stay out of the coalition this time.
Mr. Hashimoto was also snubbed by the new Democratic Party, which won 52 seats.
Mr. Hashimoto will be able to count on the cooperation of a handful of independents. There have also been some defectors from the New Frontier Party, the largest opposition party, who could eventually join the Liberal Democrats.
Many members of the New Frontier Party are dissatisfied with the heavy-handed leadership of its chief, Ichiro Ozawa. The party seems to be in danger of disintegrating but Mr. Ozawa, a wily politician, has so far managed to hold it together.

HEADLINE: Stocks Climb as Investors See Low Inflation

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The stock market rose yesterday, paced by consumer-product makers like Procter & Gamble and Clorox, after falling commodity prices and a series of economic reports reinforced investors' perception of a slow-growth, low-inflation economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 36.15 points, to 6,029.38, its biggest jump in two weeks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 4.37 points, to 705.27, while the Nasdaq composite index jumped 15.28 points, to 1,221.51. A total of 1,485 issues advanced on the Big Board, while 974 declined. Trading was heavier than usual, with 488.5 million shares changing hands. 
 Investors turned to consumer issues because those companies typically offer the most dependable earnings in a slowing economy.
The Government said 23,000 Americans filed first-time claims for unemployment benefits last week, more than the 15,000 expected. A separate Government report showed that consumer spending rose an unexpectedly small one-tenth of 1 percent.
Today, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its monthly report on the unemployment rate and the change in nonfarm payrolls for October. Reports that showed surprisingly strong job growth rattled the stock and bond markets earlier this year.
"People believe that this economy is slowing in a way that has the market thrilled," said John Hammerschmidt, a fund manager at Turner Investment Partners, which has $2.5 billion in assets. "Between rates and the economic numbers, it paints a great picture for the consumer stocks."
Among household-goods stocks, Procter & Gamble jumped 1 1/4, to 99; Clorox rose 2 1/4, to 108 7/8, and Colgate-Palmolive gained 1 1/2, to 92 1/8.
"With slow growth and no perceptible inflation, there is some fear corporate profits could slow, which helps the consumer stocks," said James Miller, a fund manager at Bartlett Capital with $2.4 billion in assets.
Among bank stocks, BankAmerica rose 1 to 91 1/2, Citicorp gained 1, to 99, and First Chicago NBD jumped 1 3/8, to 51.
Makers of computers and semiconductors gained after the Semiconductor Industry Association, an industry group, predicted fourth-quarter sales would rise, ending a nine-month slide.
I.B.M. rose 2 5/8, to 129; Intel climbed 3 1/8, to 109 7/8, and Novellus Systems gained 2 1/4, to 41 1/4.
Oil companies slumped as the price of oil fell. Texaco slipped 1 3/8, to 101 5/8; Chevron fell 1/2, to 65 3/4, and Mobil dropped 1 1/4, to 116 3/4.
Campbell Soup shares fell 3, to 80, after John T. Dorrance 3d, a relative of the founder, sold nine million shares in a single trade for $720 million. Campbell said it was the biggest trade of its shares ever.
Netscape Communications lost 1 7/8, to 44 1/4, after the company said it would sell five million shares in an additional stock sale.
Pharmacia & Upjohn dropped 1 3/4, to 36, after the company reported third-quarter net income before charges was unchanged from last year, in line with reduced profit forecasts.
Odwalla shares tumbled 6 1/4, to 12 1/8, after the company recalled its apple juice products following an outbreak of E. coli infections in Washington State linked to the company's juices.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Lowest Rate Since April On Long Bond

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond fell yesterday to its lowest level since April 1 after fresh data suggested that the economy was continuing to slow, with no sign of inflation.
The new numbers included a report that showed surprisingly high unemployment claims, easing market fears of wage pressures from a tight labor market. Traders said the broad-based buying ahead of today's more significant report on payrolls for October was also aided by a big drop in commodity prices. 
 The price of the 30-year bond increased 26/32 of a point, to 10114/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.64 percent from 6.70 percent. The 30-year bond is the benchmark by which many interest rates are set.
Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said that the market was heading into the employment report close to the high end of the most recent trading range. But even if the report shows strong job growth in October, which normally would alarm the bond market, buyers eventually will surface, he said.
"Traders think that Friday could help define the next couple of months for the bond market," he said. "However, when you consider that investors still have cash to put to work and that inflation has made no signs of emerging from its long hibernation, even a bearish employment report could eventually take the market down to levels where these willing buyers reside."
Some of the early price gains were pared after a report showed strong manufacturing conditions in the Chicago region, because investors viewed that report as a signal that growth could rebound, causing inflation to accelerate. Economists had expected a drop.
Bonds initially gained on the Labor Department's weekly report of initial jobless claims for the period that ended on Oct. 26, as first-time claims rose by a larger-than-expected figure, 23,000, to a seasonally adjusted 342,000. Some traders had been expecting the figure to rise by 15,000.
The market extended gains on a weaker-than-expected rise in September consumer spending of one-tenth of 1 percent, down from a gain of half of 1 percent the previous month. Personal income rose six-tenths of 1 percent, largely a result of higher wages, as it had in August.
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a research analysis firm, said: "Although the increase in spending has trailed income through much of the past year, this does not mean that spending will accelerate. There have been many periods in the past when income growth has been healthy while spending has lagged. We expect spending growth to remain sluggish in the next several months as consumers strive to reduce debt burdens." He predicted that this would keep total economic growth moderate for the next six to nine months and would keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates.
The last time the central bank adjusted the Federal funds rate, the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans, was on Jan. 31, when the rate was lowered a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.25 percent.
The Chicago purchasing managers' index of factory activity rose to an unexpectedly high 56.9 points in October from 56.3 in September. Market participants had expected the overall number to drop to 53.0, and the rise led to a small decline in bond prices. However, the prices-paid component fell to 50.7 from 59.3 in September, and the employment component eased slightly, to 48.8 from 50.8 in September. Those drops, indicating that inflation remains in check, left the bullish tone to the bond market largely intact.
Also released yesterday was the Conference Board's help-wanted index, a gauge of the amount of employment advertising in newspapers, which rose to 84 points for September from 81 for August.
Taken together, the reports did little to alter the perception that economic growth is decelerating.
Market participants are waiting to see whether today's employment report will give them more indications of slowing growth. Economists expect it to show that the economy gained 203,000 jobs last month, slightly below the 205,000 average monthly gain so far this year.
In when-issued trading yesterday, investors paid a premium price, as the three-year Treasury note was being offered at a price to yield 5.90 percent, a drop of 6 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, from the previous day. The reopened 10-year note was priced to yield 6.40 percent, down 7 basis points. And the 30-year bond had a drop of 6 basis points, to 6.65 percent.

HEADLINE: How Conrail Became A Hot Ticket;
Global Trade, High Tech Lift Railroad 'Basket Case'

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: ELIZABETH, N.J.

 BODY:
Derided as "a basket of basket cases" when the Government created it from the ruins of six bankrupt railroads two decades ago, today Conrail Inc. is a corporate jewel at the heart of the biggest railroad merger battle ever. Conrail has worked hard to modernize, but a visit to Port Elizabeth underscores that the railroad itself is only part of this Cinderella story.
Day after day, Conrail freight trains bring hundreds of truck-size containers filled with products for export to a mammoth dock on Newark Bay here. Unloading is so rapid that some containers are on ships on their way out to the Atlantic within hours. And each day, a similar mountain of containers recently plucked by cranes from ships arriving from Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America, ride Conrail trains back into the American heartland, filled with clothing, beer, electronics, toys and other goods. 
 Express Rail, as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey calls the transfer service, handles only a small part of the cargo here at the East Coast's busiest port. It also is just a sliver of Conrail's multi-billion-dollar operations.
But Express Rail did not exist at all six years ago. Its rapid growth is a product of railroad deregulation, new technology and shifting patterns of world trade -- the same factors that have made Conrail an increasingly valuable piece of the nation's freight transportation system.
The dollar value of Conrail's near monopoly on freight transport over tracks that run as far west as Chicago and as far south as Maryland is not settled. Conrail's preferred merger partner is CSX, the giant rail and shipping company based in Richmond that recently offered more than $8 billion in cash and stock. Norfolk Southern, which is both wooing and suing to win Conrail away from CSX, has offered $9 billion.
Conrail, formally known as the Consolidated Rail Corporation, was created by the Government in a multibillion-dollar bailout of the bankrupt Penn Central and other Northeastern railroads two decades ago. The Chessie System merged with the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad to form CSX.
The contest for Conrail comes on the heels of the Union Pacific Railroad's $5.4 billion marriage to the Southern Pacific, itself a response to the merger of the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe railroads in 1995. The deals are defended as necessary to increase efficiency and profits, but, as Express Rail shows, railroads have not relied on consolidation alone.
"The railroads have snuck up on people," said J. Ganson Evans, a Conrail marketing executive who courts customers for Express Rail and other Conrail terminals near the port that also handle container traffic. "People are surprised at what we are doing today."
What Conrail and other lines are doing is slowing, and in some cases reversing, a decades-long loss of business to the trucking industry. While the public perception is that railroads are crumbling because passenger service is notoriously bad compared with other countries, freight shippers say the American rail network is the best and most efficient in the world.
Railroads' share of freight traffic, measured by tonnage and distance carried, rose to 40.6 percent last year, from 36.4 percent in 1985, according to Mercer Management, a transportation consulting firm based in Lexington, Mass.
The recovery has its roots in deregulation of the industry in 1980, four years after the Government began pouring billions into the dying Penn Central and five other lines to replace dilapidated track and rolling stock. Deregulation allowed railroads to drop costly branch lines that generated little traffic, and to quickly add new services to make better use of main lines like those Conrail uses to move goods from here to Chicago, Detroit and other inland hubs. It also freed them to rapidly change prices to meet competition from the far more flexible and reliable truckers.
"The key is, unlike anywhere else in the world, you have the opportunity to have truly commercial railroads," said William Rennicke, a rail specialist at Mercer Management. "Our productivity is 2 or 3 times greater than in Western Europe and 10 or 20 times that in other parts of the world."
Express Rail is just one of many new services contributing to the freight railroads' slow but unmistakable renaissance. In the West, 110-car trains ferry a single valuable product, low-sulfur coal, from the Powder River basin of Wyoming to distant power plants.
On the East Coast, CSX transports a million gallons of Tropicana orange juice from Bradenton, Fla., to Philadelphia three times a week on 65-car trains that it turns over to Conrail for a last leg to Kearny, N.J.
Many services like Express Rail -- called intermodal because they use two or more modes of transportation -- exploit the huge cost advantage that railroads have over long distance trucking by carrying truck trailers that can be attached to cabs near their final destination and containers that can go on either ships or trucks.
"Intermodal has been growing because railroads continue to bring their costs down and improve the reliability of their service," said Donald Schneider, president of Schneider National Inc. The Green Bay, Wis., trucking giant has seen its intermodal business with railroads grow 30 percent a year.
Huge productivity gains have come from relatively straightforward improvements like raising road overpasses and enlarging tunnels enough to stack containers two high. As the improvements were completed, it became cheaper and faster to land goods pouring out of booming factories in Japan and Korea at West Coast ports and ship them across the country by rail than to ship them to the East Coast via the Panama Canal.
Conrail spent $64 million on such improvements in Pennsylvania alone to create an eastbound container route south of its main line across New York. West Coast container services then could reach terminals around Harrisburg, the Port of Philadelphia, and, with a handoff to the Norfolk Southern in Hagerstown, Md., cities further south.
The rail bridge from California grew at the expense of East Coast ports like the Port of New York and New Jersey. But now, with manufacturing moving to Southeast Asia, the same improvements to the rail network are making it attractive to ship containerized goods from there to New York via the Suez Canal and then into the Midwest by rail.
The benefits of increased global trade have been enhanced by investments in a variety of new technologies. Conrail and others are buying a new generation of locomotives powerful enough to do the work of two of their predecessors. Computerized dispatch centers control traffic more efficiently; satellites are used to pinpoint and repair breakdowns more quickly.
The railroads' economic revival cost 270,000 railroad employees their jobs from 1980 to 1995, about 60 percent of the total. Conrail's work force was cut to 23,500 from 96,000.
On the other hand, the railroads' comeback has revived locomotive and rail car manufacturing, saved shippers billions of dollars a year, stimulated world trade and influenced many domestic activities in ways the average citizen might not realize, like allowing utilities to meet clean air regulations by switching to low-sulfur Western coal instead of installing expensive scrubbers. Rail revenue, meanwhile, rose to $32.28 billion last year, from $28.26 billion in 1980. Operating profits doubled to $2.86 billion.
"The railroads, which were laid out a century ago to serve passengers, have finally found their niche serving commerce," said Robert Voltman, director of policy for the National Industrial Transportation League, a Washington-based trade group of manufacturers and other major shippers. "They are now in a battle to expand that niche."
The battle is tough because many customers are moving targets that are easier for truckers to hit. Railroads typically figure they are on schedule if they pick up and deliver within 24 hours of when they are expected, a big improvement from the days when the window was several days at least. But truckers generally show up within 15 minutes of the time they promise. That is a huge advantage in the just-in-time era, when manufacturers do not want materials until they are ready to process them, and retailers do not want products delivered before they are needed on the shelves.
"We use rail shipping from plants to our own warehouses, but our customers are now specifying what time of day we have to deliver," said Thomas Weikart, director of global logistics for Owens Corning, which spends about $380 million a year shipping Fiberglas insulation and other goods. "Intermodal is getting very reliable, but if I have to go 500 miles and it has to be there tomorrow, I still use trucks. I'll pay a 5 percent to 10 percent premium to get them."
The biggest problem for the railroads may be overcoming their reputation for indifference, even arrogance, in dealing with many customers. Until deregulation, they paid little attention to selling themselves.
Conrail, by virtue of its monopoly position, has generally received lower marks than most lines on that score, but those working with it say the situation has improved. Port Authority executives, for instance, say they had to lobby hard to convince Conrail that Express Rail would bring new business to both of them. But once Conrail made the commitment, it became a responsive partner, they say.
Big customers with a choice of carriers naturally see the biggest improvements. Transportation executives at the Ford Motor Company say Norfolk Southern participated in designing a new vehicle distribution system that is expected to cut inventory costs.
The railroad is setting up new yards where Ford will send vehicles from several factories, allowing trains to be filled and dispatched to dealers more quickly. And both Norfolk Southern and CSX have asked to be included in planning new methods for handling incoming components to Ford plants.
"They recognize they have to be more than just movers of goods," said Wade Deal, director of supply chain management for Ford. "Their share of our business could grow substantially."
But many more customers say railroads are still run by people who care more about convenient operations than customers. And retailing experts agree.
"I still haven't seen the rail industry come up with clever service ideas," said Robert Sabath, a retailing expert in Mercer Management's Chicago office. "It's been their customers pushing them. They used to be one on a one-to-10 scale of customer service. Now they are a 3."
Wall Street, although nervous about whether Norfolk Southern or CSX will end up overpaying for Conrail, has generally been pleased. Rising profits and the prospect of still more mergers as Conrail and its rivals jockey for leverage with customers have lifted rail stocks more than 12 percent in the last year.
But with just four railroads controlling 95 percent of interstate rail traffic once Conrail is married off, customers and other participants in the transportation system are increasingly anxious. Many fear price increases or service cuts. Even those anticipating improvements, like the Port of New York and New Jersey, worry that the railroads' efforts to be more competitive could shift business away from them, just as new shipping routes shifted cargo away from it before.
"What seems to be a modest improvement in the price or service a railroad offers to a particular destination can have a huge impact on where cargo goes," said Joseph Curnyn, the facility supervisor at the Port Authority's New Jersey marine terminal.

HEADLINE: With Insurers' Payment, Exxon Says Valdez Case Is Ended

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Seven years after the Exxon Valdez supertanker ran aground off Alaska, spilling oil in one of the worst environmental disasters ever, the Exxon Corporation said yesterday that it was closing the books on attempts to recover its costs from scores of insurance companies, with a final settlement installment of $480 million.
The agreement, reached yesterday in discussions in the United States and Britain, brought Exxon's total recovery to $780 million. Company officials said the disaster had cost Exxon $2.5 billion before the insurance recovery. 
 Lee R. Raymond, the company's chairman, said it was "pleased that these claims have been resolved."
William Pitt, a spokesman in the United States for Lloyd's of London, which had provided the largest share of insurance on the supertanker, said his company was "glad a settlement has been reached."
Eugene Anderson, a New York lawyer whose firm is a leader in representing big corporations and individuals against insurance companies, said the settlement reflected a growing trend in the insurance industry.
"The insurance companies initially deny virtually all large claims," Mr. Anderson said, "because in the end there is usually a compromise and they end up paying much less than the amount of the claim."
In addition, he said, by delaying payment, the insurers are able to continue investing the disputed money, earning profit on the funds at risk. "They pay lawyers much less each year in these cases than they earn in interest," he said.
Mr. Anderson estimated that the $780 million paid by Equitas, a company recently established to pay previous claims against Lloyd's, and by more than 250 other insurers, was half what Exxon had initially requested. Neither Exxon nor Lloyd's would disclose the size of the original claim.
Mr. Pitt said that "claims on this scale do sometimes lead to differences of opinion over the coverage that was available."
But he said "it is a very small fraction of total claims in which you have litigation of this kind."
One contention of the insurance companies has been that they should not have been held liable because the ship's captain, Joseph J. Hazelwood, had a history of alcohol abuse. Mr. Hazelwood has been acquitted of charges of operating the tanker while drunk.
Mr. Pitt said the claim in the Exxon Valdez disaster had been one of the largest on the books of Lloyd's as it struggled through several years of heavy losses in the late 1980's and early 90's.
Lloyd's officials said the venerable international insurance organization had been near financial collapse in September, when investors, regulators and a series of courts agreed that it could form a new company, Equitas, to take responsibility for Lloyd's liabilities for 1992 and earlier.
The disputed claims began moving toward conclusion in January with a partial settlement of $300 million.
In June, a jury in a state court in Texas, where Exxon has its headquarters, awarded the oil company $250 million, and a judge increased the amount to $410 million to cover Exxon's legal expenses and what he calculated to have been the interest that would have accumulated since the start of the case.
The agreement reached yesterday encompassed the Texas judgment, and, with an increase in the amount due from the insurers of $70 million, brought an end to two cases pending in New York and headed off yet another suit that Exxon had said it was considering bringing against the insurance companies in Texas.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE THIRD PARTY;
Perot, on the Stump, Goes on the Attack

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 31

 BODY:
As the 1996 campaign draws to a close, the nation is seeing another side of Ross Perot.
Four years ago, his enemy was George Bush, and his weapons were charts, graphs and homespun lectures on the economy that were broadcast from television studios. 
 At first this year, he tried the same tactics, but could not dig himself out of single digits in the polls. So now, he has switched strategies.
In the last week, the Reform Party candidate has embraced an old-fashioned kind of politicking by barnstorming across the country and trying to energize students and other young voters.
He has also more broadly attacked President Clinton, attacking his character. And with recent disclosures about questionable foreign contributions to the Democratic Party, Mr. Perot has been able to freshen his speeches with talk about campaign finance, his signature cause.
The new approach may be working. For the first time in this campaign, he has climbed out of the single digits in some polls and has shown an upward movement in the major, daily tracking polls.
Although the numbers by no means put him in a position to overtake the other candidates, they suggest that he may be connecting with more voters.
Here at the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Perot attacked Mr. Clinton and the Democrats on the issue of campaign finance.
"If you will give a $100,000 to the Democrats, you can spend the night in the Lincoln Bedroom," Mr. Perot said. "That offends me to my soul because working people -- plumbers, electricians, people working the third shift -- pay the full cost of the White House with their taxes. And if I am your President, you will have my word, we will put a sign all across Washington -- 'Not for sale at any price.' "
Saying that Mr. Clinton sent an aircraft carrier group to protect Taiwan after that country's ruling party offered the Democrats $15 million, Mr. Perot said here: "Do you want a President who puts the lives of the armed forces at risk and manipulates foreign policy in exchange for $15 million in political contributions? If you do, don't vote for me on Nov. 5 because hell will freeze over before I do that."
 Mr. Perot has also found a new voice with attacks on Mr. Clinton's character, a standard campaign technique that Mr. Perot, a critic of partisan-politics-as-usual, has long criticized.
For example, in his speeches here and in Blacksburg, Va., at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University on Monday, he posed sarcastic, rhetorical questions about Mr. Clinton's lack of a military record.
"If you were wounded on the battlefield, you're lying out there in no man's land, you only got three survivors in your platoon and they are the three candidates for President, who do you think is going to come out there and drag you back to safety?" Mr. Perot, who served in the Navy, asked his audience here.
Applauding and laughing, the students roared, "Ross!"
Trying to remind his audience of Mr. Clinton's past marital problems and accusations that he was a womanizer, Mr. Perot continued: "Here's one for all of the dads in the audience. Which of the three candidates would you be very comfortable having your daughter work for?" The crowd responded with more applause and laughter.
Mr. Perot then brandished a copy of an editorial in The New York Times last Sunday that endorsed Mr. Clinton but urged him to pledge not to pardon anyone convicted in prosecutions arising from Whitewater matters or fund raising for the 1996 campaign, among other things, and to cooperate with any investigations into these matters.
"Read this editorial," he said. "They are basically asking this man to have a character and integrity change in midlife."
The 1996 Perot campaign not only sounds different than it did four years ago; it also looks different.
Barred from the televised Presidential debates last month and unable to buy as much prime television time as he has wanted for 30-minute infomericals, Mr. Perot is campaigning more in public this time, making two personal appearances on many days since mid-October. He plans to continue that pace until Friday.
Four years ago, he largely ran his campaign from television studios, relying on his appearances in the Presidential debates and on his 12 infomercials between Oct. 17 and Election Day to reach voters. During the same time span, he made only seven public appearances.
"Keep in mind, in '92 we were doing more studio time," said Sharon Holman, press secretary for Mr. Perot and the Reform Party.
In a speech at the National Press Club in Washington last week, Mr. Perot acknowledged he had been forced to abandon the television studio he prefers for the traditional stump. "We've been pretty well frozen out this time around," he said, "but every now and then a blind hog finds an acre."
Most of Mr. Perot's rallies and speeches in recent weeks have been before college groups that have invited him to speak. These audiences have mostly been friendly and curious.
Mr. Perot's advisers say he is getting more support because of the perception that a vote for Mr. Dole could be a wasted vote in the event of a Clinton landslide.
They say this perception could lead some voters to give Mr. Perot and the Reform Party another look.

ROSS PEROT
 
Speaking at the University of Pennsylvania on Wednesday night:
"John Huang. He is an Indonesian businessman. He works for the Riadys. Mr. Riady and his wife gave nearly $200,000 to the Democrats and Bill Clinton's Presidential campaign. His father is the head of the Lippo Group. This is a multibillion-dollar Asian conglomerate. 
 "Last year The New York Times ran a chart showing the most corrupt nations in the world and guess who was ranked number one -- Indonesia. . . . The Riadys flew 15 people from Indonesia to the Presidential inauguration. I thought that was for the American people, didn't you? Then Mr. Riady was one of a handful of foreigners to attend an exclusive inaugural party. He was the only foreign businessman given a prime seat at an economic conference hosted by the newly elected President in 1992 in Little Rock.
"Mr. John Huang was given a position in the Clinton Administration overseeing international trade and was give a top-secret security clearance. Can you believe that? And finally when Mr. Huang left the Riady family to take this top-secret job, the Riadys gave him $780,000 severance, a going away present. A few months ago he left Government to raise money full time for the Democratic Party. He's done it with great success. He raised $250,000 from a Korean business. The Los Angeles Times caught him and they had to give the money back. . . .
"Wouldn't you like to have someone out there named O'Reilly? Out there hard at work. You know, so far we haven't found an American name."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Munich in Washington

BYLINE: By A.M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
America at election time: two Chamberlains and not a Churchill in sight.
On Sept. 29, 1938, in Munich, Neville Chamberlain abandoned the 14 million people of Czechoslovakia to the German Nazis. It took the lives of tens of millions of Europeans and Americans to pay for that appeasement -- and the leadership of Winston Churchill, alone at first, then with Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
 More than a half-century later, in Washington on May 28, 1993, President Clinton abandoned the people of China and Tibet, 1.2 billion souls, to Communist mercy, in direct betrayal of his own official promise to do America's peaceful best to ease the bitterness of their oppression.
Bob Dole does not attempt Churchill's role. It probably never crossed his mind. Mr. Dole, as Senate majority leader and still, has supported Mr. Clinton's major appeasement step of surrendering any economic pressure for human rights in China. They had the same motivation: to please the U.S. lobby doing business with China.
From that day in May when Mr. Clinton publicly and without apparent shame canceled his own promise to use tariff pressure for human liberties, there was no doubt what would happen.
The incarceration and torture meted out to dissidents in China increased. So did China's military strength and influence abroad.
In the past couple of weeks certain things were reported by the press that give a hint of the depth and width of the iceberg that has formed beneath the appeasement policy, and of the costs yet to be paid by the victims, and Americans.
Jeff Gerth and David Sanger of the Washington bureau of The New York Times reported that the Chinese had illegally used part of an airplane order from McDonnell Douglas to build a factory producing missiles. Bill Gertz of The Washington Times reported that China was selling nuclear technology to the Pakistanis -- again. China was discovered selling more missiles to Iran. Robert S. Greenberger of The Wall Street Journal found Chinese agents roving the U.S. snapping up defense-related equipment at bargain prices.
Shock, shock: China uses profits from American trade to build up its armed forces. Why not? Most foreign trade with China is with companies owned by the armed forces, and the gentlemen running for President know it. The U.S. has become not so much the Communists' trading partner as their quartermaster.
Then on Wednesday, Beijing showed its contempt for the U.S. by sentencing the dissident Wang Dan to 11 more years in prison -- its answer to a request by Mr. Clinton that it free this man, innocent of any crime but expressing his opinion.
At least the Communists are true to their own principles and system. Repression is the Government's bloodstream. Tens of millions have sweated their lives away in slave-labor camps. Thousands of political prisoners are still incarcerated.
It is difficult to grasp what the Communists mean by prison, but important to try: years of fiendish torture, living in excrement, shackled to boards, beatings, starvation, slave labor and slow death. Is that China-made sweater still cozy? (Please put up with the pain of reading "Anthems of Defeat" (Asia Watch, 485 Fifth Avenue, New York 10017).
Now the U.S. is sending Secretary of State Christopher to Beijing. Ho boy, that should frighten them. But I have a suggestion for him.
Harry Wu, that great man who suffered 19 years in Chinese prisons, keeps risking his life sneaking back to them -- to help the world remember. He writes of one slave factory in "Troublemaker," a fine, quietly terrifying new book, written with George Vecsey. It is a pipe plant. Its 2,000 workers sit at machinery with heads shaven and in prison uniforms.
Mr. Christopher can easily take a side trip there. It is at 1551 Beidi Road, right in the middle of Shanghai. It will be the most useful thing he can do in China; the prisoners may get a little extra rice that day.
At least Chamberlain could say Britain had no chance against Nazi power. All our two can say is that it is more profitable to appease Communist China with trade and security-risk deals than to stand up, without risking an American life, for decency for its captives -- maybe less time on the shackle boards.

HEADLINE: More Growth, a Recession, Or a 'Growth Recession'?

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
On Wednesday it was the Government tally showing that the nation's growth rate fell by more than half over the summer. Today, figures showed that consumer spending barely budged in September, rising less than inflation. And the General Motors strike swelled first-time claims for jobless benefits, while the United States Chamber of Commerce said its index of business confidence skidded to the lowest level since February.
The question posed by the economic data is no longer whether the economy is slowing from last spring's breakneck pace. Now it is, "How slow will it get?" 
 While many analysts say that the economy is likely to pick up momentum again, a growing minority of analysts contend that growth may slow so much that unemployment will rise significantly. Some worry that the economy next year could even slip into a recession. Others speak of what they call a "growth recession," a sustained period in which the economy keeps expanding but at a slow pace.
Today's data showed that consumer spending rose just one-tenth of 1 percent in September, the weakest since a drop of five-tenths of 1 percent in June. The Commerce Department also reported that personal income rose a modest six-tenths of 1 percent.
The degree of slowdown seen in such reports is of immediate political consequence. Bob Dole, the Republican Presidential nominee, disparaged Wednesday's report of a 2.2 percent third-quarter growth rate by saying, "If this is a recovery, I can hardly wait for the recession."
In fact, the economy has been expanding without interruption for more than five and a half years. How long that continues will not become clear until well after next week's election, and the pace of next year's economy will depend on decisions by millions of consumers and businesses.
The mainstream view is that prospects are good, with the latest quarter reflecting merely a consumer "breather." The buildup of unsold goods reported on Wednesday, most analysts say, is nothing to worry about. They say the economy will perk up again because the job market appears strong and consumers are enjoying a modest rise in spendable income that is likely to show up at retailers this Christmas.
Still, excessive inventories have traditionally been one of the three chief causes of business downturns -- the others being higher interest rates and such external shocks as disrupted oil supplies. So the minority predicting paltry growth or recession should not be lightly dismissed.
Geoffrey H. Moore, the respected business-cycle researcher, last week announced that his newly refined forecasting system had produced its first signal of a "growth recession." By the turn of the year, he expects the economic expansion to be below its long-term trend of 2.5 percent.
Dr. Moore, director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute in New York, cautioned that he was making only a preliminary warning, though an aide asserted that Dr. Moore correctly predicted in February 1990 that subpar growth then would deteriorate into the full-blown, though brief, recession that began that July.
A recent Dun & Bradstreet survey of 3,000 business executives found a general "wait and see" stance, with those in small business least sanguine. "Small businesses can be very sensitive to early changes in the economy," noted Joseph W. Duncan, the company's chief economic adviser. "Their new pessimism may be an early sign that conditions will soften in the first half of 1997."
In the same vein, economists at UBS Securities are telling clients that consumer spending "continues to sputter" and that both housing and exports will contribute only slightly, if at all, to growth in coming months.
"Expansions do not necessarily die of old age, but they become feeble," the bank's analysts say, predicting that the Fed will have to cut short-term interest rates next year because of "below trend growth."
History also shows that recessions have a way of popping up in the years after Presidential elections. Half the 10 postwar downturns, occurred at such times -- in 1953, 1957, 1969, 1973 and 1981, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.
And history also shows that despite the intense scrutiny that every indicator now gets, recessions can still arrive with little notice. In the summer of 1990, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said he saw no sign of a downturn even though the National Bureau later determined that it had already started. Because it takes time to evaluate economic data thoroughly, the researchers did not declare the recession under way until the spring of 1991, about the time it ended.
Indeed, in raising the specter of recession this week, Mr. Dole seemed to reflect Republican chagrin about a small but seemingly fiendish lack of congruence in the business and electoral cycles.
President George Bush, most analysts believe, lost his 1992 re-election bid in large part because most people thought the economy was doing poorly. But it was actually growing at a brisk 3 percent pace in the third quarter of that year and boomed at a robust 4.3 percent rate in the three-month period that included Election Day. President Clinton, by contrast, is getting credit for a strong economy when growth in the pre-election quarter was not only below that under President Bush but weakening.

HEADLINE: William Rosenwald Dies; Benefactor to Many Was 93

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
William Rosenwald, who gave and raised millions of dollars in a life dominated by philanthropy that saved tens of thousands of lives and bettered countless others through education and the arts, died yesterday at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 93.
Mr. Rosenwald carried on a commitment to charity established by his father, Julius, a chairman and builder of Sears, Roebuck & Company, and was one of the three signatories to the agreement that founded a nationwide United Jewish Appeal in 1939. 
 A private investor, Mr. Rosenwald had business interests at various times in enterprises that included the American Securities Corporation, an investment bank; Western Union International, and Ametek, a maker of precision instruments and small electric motors, like those used in vacuum cleaners. He was nevertheless best known for his tireless philanthropic dedication.
"I spend half my time in philanthropic work, half at business, half with my family and half at personal affairs," he said once with his characteristic good humor.
Besides his longtime work with the United Jewish Appeal, Mr. Rosenwald served for four decades on the board of the Tuskegee Institute and for many years on the board of the New York Philharmonic.
Long before many others realized the threat posed to European Jews by the Nazis, Mr. Rosenwald was busy working to save as many people as he could from the impending Holocaust.
In the mid-1930's, he led a family effort to rescue relatives in Europe, and by 1948, the endeavor had succeeded in bringing 300 of them to the United States and had assumed responsibility for another 300 still in Europe. Not only did the Rosenwalds bring their kin to America; they also provided them with homes and found them jobs.
But Mr. Rosenwald's experiences in Europe gave him first-hand exposure to the plight of Jews in Nazi Germany and in other countries where anti-Semitism was flourishing.
In a 1935 interview, Mr. Rosenwald said: "There is the thought in my mind -- and that I would like to get across to the Jews of America -- that to the extent that the Jews as a whole help their suffering brethren, we will fortify the Jews of all countries against anti-Semitic onslaughts."
As a result, he was unremitting in his efforts to raise money to address the needs of Jews in distress.
In 1939, when he became the organizer and first president of the National Refugee Service, later a part of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, he had already been working for three years to resettle refugees in communities outside New York City.
And when the state of Israel was founded in 1948, Mr. Rosenwald was in the forefront of efforts to support the immigration of thousands of European refugees to the Jewish homeland.
"The time has come for rededication on a scale that will measure up to the historic moment that our generation has been privileged to witness," he said.
Mr. Rosenwald served the United Jewish Appeal as one of its three national chairmen from 1942 to 1946, when he began the first campaign that raised more than $100 million; and he headed the organization's campaigns in 1955, 1956 and 1957.
He encouraged the combined campaign of the U.J.A.-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York and served as the campaign organization's first president for three years beginning in 1974.
For 50 years he was a member of the executive committee of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and he held various posts with organizations like the Council of Jewish Federations and the American Jewish Committee.
Mr. Rosenwald, one of the five children of Julius Rosenwald and the former Augusta Nusbaum, was born in Chicago in 1903. He earned a bachelor of science degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1924, studied liberal arts at Harvard University for a year, then attended the London School of Economics.
Beginning in 1928, he went to work for Sears, Roebuck in various posts, including as a director from 1934 to 1938.
In 1935, he began his career as a private investor.
His many awards and honors included doctorates from Hebrew University and Tuskegee Institute.
Mr. Rosenwald was married three times. His first marriage, to Renee Scharf in 1928, ended in divorce in 1935. In 1938, he married Mary Kurtz, who died in 1985, and last year, he married Ruth G. Israels, who survives him.
Mr. Rosenwald is also survived by three daughters, Nina Rosenwald, Elizabeth R. Varet and Alice R. Sigelman, all of Manhattan; a stepson, Michael J. Israel of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and two step-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: POLITICAL MEMO;
For Dole, Plenty of Movement but Momentum Remains Elusive

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 31

 BODY:
As with families, so, it seems, with campaigns.
Certainly, Bob Dole's campaign is unhappy in its own distinctive way. It is unhappy in a way that somehow combines weary resignation with caustic defiance and then adds a certain antic spontaneity. It is unhappy in a way that is sad and funny at the same time. 
 Since last weekend, the Dole campaign has been in an odd state of leisurely frenzy, bouncing from one jury-rigged appearance to the next, changing its plans almost on an hourly basis and keeping bankers' hours. Remarkably, for a down-and-out campaign in the countdown week, it has not been staging more than a handful of events each day, and on Tuesday it traveled 3,000 miles to touch down only once -- for a rally in a poorly lit ballroom in the Denver convention center.
On Wednesday, Mr. Dole's campaign schedule did not begin until early afternoon and consisted of just two events. At the first stop, in Clarksville, Tenn., Mr. Dole stepped on his one prepared sound-bite of the day, a warning about the upcoming "Clinton recession." At the second stop, here in New Orleans, he remembered to issue the warning, but then got sidetracked again.
"It's not a great economy," he told a rally at the Pontchartrain Center here. "Everyone who understands Economics 101 -- I didn't do too well, come to think of it, but I understand it better now."
By nature a stoic, Mr. Dole remains at least publicly upbeat, even as his aides have forsaken the immense effort it would take to spin all this as a strategy.
At the start of each day, Mr. Dole sounds the theme that every day is a new day. Yet by the end of the day it seems that each day has actually been a lot like the last day.
There has been a hastily put together speech. There has been a hastily put together rally. There have been aspersions on the Democratic Party's fund-raising techniques: "I wouldn't be surprised to see them holding fund raisers in homeless shelters." There have been exhortations to ignore the polls: "You are the polls!" And there have been attacks on the press: "A lot of people in the media who don't understand the economy very well report on it," Mr. Dole told the audience in Clarksville.
But there has not been, as Mr. Dole's erstwhile rival and current ally, George Bush, so memorably put it, the "big mo."
Momentum is a quality that has always eluded Mr. Dole in his national campaigns, and now, in his fourth and quite probably final national race, the former Senator from Kansas seems genuinely perplexed by the race's dynamic. Despite the many allegations of impropriety that have been leveled against President Clinton, Mr. Dole seems unable to make much headway against him. In an interview the other day on CNN, Mr. Dole was asked why he thought this was the case.
"I'm baffled," he replied in a tone of real bewilderment. "I'm really baffled. It seems to me -- and I'm not trying to be judgmental -- but if the American people really care and they're really concerned about who's in charge, something ought to get their attention sooner or later."
As he waits for something to catch voters' attention -- "sooner or later" -- Mr. Dole seems disinclined to alter or even examine his own campaign style, which remains as dependably changeless as the polls.
With an occasional exception, like the speech he gave in San Diego on Monday on affirmative action, Mr. Dole is still, for example, blithely ignoring the remarks his campaign has prepared for his delivery.
Although he calls himself "a plain-spoken man," Mr. Dole is also still issuing many of his denunciations of Mr. Clinton in the kind of shorthand that only political insiders could be expected to understand. For example, he mentions a Democratic campaign donor, Yogesh Gandhi, who gave more than $300,000 to the party while reportedly owing back taxes, but never exactly articulates the principle involved in his criticism.
"He gave the President an award," Mr. Dole said on Tuesday in Irvine, Calif., referring to Mr. Gandhi. "It turned out to be a phony."
"Those are the details," he went on. "Fact is, he had the $300,000."
Mr. Dole can be similarly cryptic when explaining the centerpiece of his own campaign: his 15 percent tax cut plan. "Revenues are going to grow by about 20 percent over the next six years and the President wants to spend all that," Mr. Dole said, also in Irvine. "We want to spend about 14 percent of it and give the other 6 percent back to the American people."
How this 6 percent would translate into 15 percent, Mr. Dole left unexplained. Still, he concluded his defense of his plan by noting, "It's not rocket science."
There comes a time in every lagging campaign when the candidate realizes that, barring some act of Providence, he is not going to win. For former President Bush, that time occurred on a train trip through Wisconsin the Saturday before the 1992 election when, after surveying the latest polls, he seemed to visibly deflate.
Just what Mr. Dole is thinking in the curtained-off area at the front of his campaign plane, Citizen's Ship, is, of course, something that only he and perhaps a few close advisers know. Sometimes he seems almost liberated by his situation, as he did here on Wednesday evening, offering up wisecracks with an enthusiasm bordering on abandon.
"Don't let Halloween scare you," he said. "Let four more years of Clinton -- think about that. That'll keep you awake. That'll curdle your milk, as we used to say in Kansas."
Yet just the night before, when he had insisted on traveling across the country to sleep in his own bed, it seemed to signal some kind of emotional exhaustion, a need for solace from a man who has spent much of his adult life running for national office, but has never seemed fully to embrace the color and the chaos of the passing American scene. And on occasion the loneliness of the enterprise that has absorbed him for so long comes through.
"I have been around long enough to know it is going to be the candidate's fault," he told Candy Crowley of CNN when she asked the other day about his staff. "If I lose, the rest of them are going to be home free, but it will be the candidate's fault. And I am prepared to accept that."

Discussing the Medicare Trust Fund and President Clinton's television advertisements yesterday in Tampa:
"I call it irresponsible. The White House should not be in the business of distorting the truth and scaring senior citizens. I listen to some of these horror stories, sometimes I think Dick Morris has been replaced by Stephen King. These Medicare or Medi-scare tactics are intended to attack my campaign. They are winding up hurting every senior in America, because when you're alone and you see something on television, or you hear it on the radio, or you read it in the newspaper, you're inclined to believe it. Nobody to talk to. 
 "The President is ignoring the problems. He has ignored the problems. His political games are not just misleading. They are dangerous. Because they divert us from the real job -- and that is getting the economy back on track. . . .
"Every day we have another reason to wonder how low will this White House go. How low will this White House go? Is there any trust it will not violate?
"Let me say one thing: I will never play politics with Medicare, because too much is at stake. Seniors don't want scare tactics. They want straight talk. Straight talk."

HEADLINE: Compromise In G.M. Strike Still Elusive

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 31

 BODY:
Negotiators from the United Automobile Workers union and the General Motors Corporation held marathon talks today aimed at settling the third big strike this year against the company, but a compromise remained elusive.
The latest round of talks began on Wednesday at 10 A.M. and continued without interruption through Wednesday night and today. The auto industry has a tradition of settling strikes after negotiating sessions lasting as long as 60 hours, a sign that a deal could come in the next several days. 
 "The negotiators are focusing on resolving the remaining issues and have been talking through the night and day," said Gerald E. Holmes, a G.M. spokesman.
Most of the G.M. and U.A.W. officials went home to rest at about 6 P.M. today, after 32 hours of talks, said Charles Licari, a G.M. spokesman. Talks continued on a few subjects, with full negotiations scheduled to resume on Friday morning.
As officials here tried to work out an arrangement addressing the U.A.W.'s demand for greater job security and G.M.'s insistence on lower labor costs, the effects of the latest strike continued to widen. G.M. notified 4,000 workers today at an assembly plant in Moraine, Ohio, that they would be temporarily laid off as of Friday. The latest strike had deprived the factory of the parts needed to continue assembling the GMC Jimmy, Chevrolet Blazer and Oldsmobile Bravada sport utility vehicles.
The ripple of local strikes is part of a strategy by the U.A.W. to put more pressure on the auto maker. G.M.'s labor contract with the union expired on Sunday night, leaving the workers free to stage strikes without notice.
On Tuesday evening, U.A.W. workers walked out at G.M.'s most profitable assembly plant and one of its most important truck parts factories. The 4,800-employee assembly plant, located in Janesville, Wis., makes Chevrolet and GMC Suburban full-size sport utility vehicles. Auto analysts estimate that G.M. makes up to $12,000 in profit on each of these vehicles.
The walkout at the 2,600-employee truck parts factory, which is in Indianapolis, has crippled G.M.'s ability to manufacture roofs and hoods for all of its pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, including the Moraine factory. G.M. also closed a 2,250-employee pickup truck factory in Fort Wayne, Ind., on Wednesday night for lack of parts.
U.A.W. officials said that a 2,500-employee assembly plant in Linden, N.J., could close by Monday if the strike was not resolved soon. Five other G.M. truck assembly plants rely on parts from Indianapolis. They are in Pontiac, Mich.; Flint, Mich.; Shreveport, La.; Silao, Mexico, and Oshawa, Ontario.
Senior officials from both sides were participating in the negotiations here. Richard Shoemaker, the U.A.W.'s vice president for G.M. issues, and Gerald A. Knechtel, G.M.'s vice president of personnel, stayed at the table through the night and were still here this evening. Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W.'s president, has been in and out of the talks while being host of a quarterly meeting of the U.A.W.'s board.
A union local at a crucial parts factory in Kokomo, Ind., also threatened to go on strike today, which could force G.M. to shut its car factories as well as its truck factories if the strike lasts long. But while G.M.'s truck models are highly profitable, most of its car models lose money. A strike that closes car factories could cost the U.A.W. heavily, particularly if states denied unemployment benefits to any laid-off workers and the union wound up paying them strike benefits instead.
Auto analysts have estimated that if all of G.M.'s truck factories close because of the strike, G.M. would lose $50 million a day in after-tax profits.

HEADLINE: BOOM IN PROFITS FOR CORPORATIONS NOW APPEARS OVER

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The great boom in corporate earnings, which helped propel the market and buoyed the economy for more than four years, seems to be over. What analysts are arguing over now is how much more slowly earnings will grow.
While not all companies have reported yet, enough have released results to indicate that the third quarter should have the weakest gains in operating earnings in about four and a half years, according to several Wall Street estimates. That would mean that for the year, earnings growth is likely to be the smallest since profits actually fell in 1991. 
 Weaker earnings are certainly not good news for the stock market in general. But slower growth does not necessarily mean that stocks are going to perform poorly. That is because simply exceeding what investors had expected, as apparently happened this quarter, can support stocks even if the pace of growth slackens. This year's gains in the stock market make that abundantly clear: the Dow Jones industrial average has risen 17.8 percent through yesterday and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index is up 14.5 percent.
But with the broader market indexes near record levels and the value of stocks already relatively high, weak earnings growth next year could worry investors and undermine the stock market's performance. And with earnings forecasts for 1997 all over the lot -- from flat to up 10 percent -- the debate continues on whether the stock market can continue to move higher for yet another year.
The reasons for the earnings slowdown from the 15 to 18 percent average rate from 1992 through 1995 run the gamut. They range from an inability to raise prices and the slowing productivity of workers to the moderating pace of growth in the economy and the fact that a lot of the corporate cost-cutting and downsizing that helped earnings in recent years has now been done.
In the third quarter, the decline in earnings for technology stocks like Motorola, and a drop at basic industries, including International Paper, Phelps Dodge and Temple-Inland, all served as anchors that put a drag on earnings growth.
The positive push came from energy companies, including Exxon, Chevron and Texaco, which were helped by the spurt in oil prices, and from consumer companies, like the auto makers, that prosper when the economy is growing. Mobil bucked the energy tide, reporting a 10 percent drop in earnings.
Banks, investment firms and insurance companies also contributed to the growth but gave much less of a boost than in recent quarters.
Microsoft and Intel, whose earnings jumped, went against the grain in the technology sector.
There are also indications that average companies are no longer the profit generators they had been, leaving it up to the largest, best- known concerns to keep the growth going.
Thomas McManus, an investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company, noted that over all there was a rise in the total earnings per share of the companies in the S.& P. 500 that have already reported when their results are weighted in favor of the bigger companies. But looking at the simple average of all the companies, earnings per share are down a bit.
"What we are seeing," he argued, "is the transition of the market to an environment where it is tougher and tougher for the average company to increase its earnings. I think a bull market is a market which enables the average company to gain in price."
Richard B. Hoey, chief economist and the manager of portfolios worth $2.3 billion at the Dreyfus Corporation, said the shift to "a narrower pattern of earnings gains" had already made him move toward "higher quality stocks" that have "strong revenue growth."
Wall Street analysts agree that the huge gains in earnings that helped propel the longest bull market in history are over for this economic cycle.
"We had been expecting this notable inflection point in earnings," said Abby Joseph Cohen, market strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. But that is all that they agree on.
The exact growth figures for the quarter are still being debated on Wall Street, in part because many retailers work on a third quarter ending with October, and have yet to report.
In addition, the measures of the same earnings season can vary because analysts differ in how they treat the special write-offs that companies take for everything from accounting changes to employee layoffs. That is why they come up with such different readings for what they call operating earnings.
Because of these differences, the estimates for growth in the third quarter compared with the third quarter of 1995 range from 8 percent at Goldman, Sachs to a barely perceptible one-tenth of one percent at Paine Webber.
For the year, the estimates run from 3 percent at Paine Webber to just under 10 percent at Goldman.
So the answer to whether or not this was a good quarter and what is in store for 1997 depends on whom you talk to.
"If you see that the profit decline is in large part due to technology profits being down that is a concern because people see technology leading the market," said Melissa R. Brown, director of quantitative research at Prudential Securities.
Bruce Steinberg, the manager of macroeconomic analysis at Merrill Lynch, said that the third quarter was showing the "weakest earnings performance in four years."
Don't tell that to Ms. Cohen at Goldman, though. Third-quarter earnings are "good, not great," she countered. More importantly, she added, "the quality of earnings is good because there is no inflation behind them."
Eric Miller, the chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said that one reason why slowing growth had not pulled the market lower was that third-quarter earnings "came in a little better than expected."
And Thomas Doerflinger, an investment strategist at Paine Webber, is forecasting a rebound in earnings next year despite his belief that earnings last quarter were flat. "Earnings are re-accelerating again," he said.
Mr. Doerflinger forecasts a rise of 8.6 percent in earnings next year; Ms. Cohen sees about 10 percent growth and says confidently that the year-to-year gain in earnings "is not going to end soon." But Mr. Steinberg is forecasting only 2.5 percent, while Mr. Miller is expecting earnings to be unchanged.
There are several factors that could make the positive forecasts for 1997 slower and the slow ones worse. One is the strength of the dollar. If it rose significantly, profits that American companies make abroad would suffer when recorded in dollars.
And then there is the assumption that economies outside the United States, especially in Europe and Asia, will rebound, letting consumers there buy more goods from the United States. "The international economy is important because we are running out of domestic steam," Mr. Miller said.
The other important factor is interest rates. A rise in rates might crimp earnings of companies. But more important, higher interest rates, by giving investors a more attractive alternative to stocks, would make the stock market less appealing.
"Given the outlook of modest growth and low inflation, we expect bond yields to move lower during the next three to six months," Mr. Steinberg wrote recently. "That could buoy the equity market despite diminished earnings momentum. But bond-market setbacks would likely take a significant toll."

HEADLINE: Undertow for the G.O.P.

BYLINE: By Matthew Miller; Matthew Miller, a senior editor at The New Republic, writes often about politics and economic policy.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Just as California's Proposition 13 in 1978 ushered in the anti-tax wave Republicans have ridden to this day, the state's backlash against immigration and affirmative action was supposed to energize enough "angry white men" to bury Democrats for a decade. But these so-called wedge issues are not helping Republican Congressional candidates here. In fact, they're laying the groundwork for erosion of the Republican base in the nation's pivotal electoral state.
Blame Pete Wilson and Newt Gingrich. Republican strategists misread the meaning of Mr. Wilson's come-from-behind romp over Kathleen Brown in the 1994 race for Governor. Yes, Mr. Wilson's disciplined campaign, tied to Proposition 187's call for ending government benefits to illegal immigrants, was effective. But lost amid the excitement was the fact that Ms. Brown's own weaknesses were more decisive. 
 Nonetheless, Republicans apparently thought all they needed in 1996 was another wedge issue like Proposition 187 to help their candidates. Thus their use of the California Civil Rights Initiative, which would bar state and local governments from using quotas or preferences based on race, ethnicity and sex.
But the Republicans have been outflanked. President Clinton's moves to address legitimate concerns about immigration have inoculated Democrats down the ballot. Mr. Clinton's campaign ads here boast of border patrols and surveillance beefed up on his watch. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has just announced record numbers of deportations from the state.
On affirmative action, Mr. Clinton's "mend it, don't end it" straddle has helped out Democratic candidates on the stump. And though polls suggest that the initiative, Proposition 209, will pass, for Republican candidates there's no percentage in being tied to it. A new Field Poll here shows that opposition to the civil rights initiative has risen by nine percentage points since Bob Dole and the G.O.P. embraced it.
It turns out that affirmative action doesn't resonate with voters the way immigration does. Since 1990, a third of Californians have routinely told pollsters that immigration is a big problem, especially in the southern part of the state. "People see immigration as an issue every day in their lives as they drive around," said Representative Henry Waxman, a Los Angeles Democrat. "It's an issue that's brought out emotion in people."
Affirmative action, involving state procurement and agency jobs, has a narrower impact. Bill Carrick, senior adviser to the Clinton campaign here, says that of 25 statewide surveys he's seen, not one has turned up a significant percentage of voters who are seriously concerned about quotas or set-asides. A G.O.P. analyst, Tony Quinn, acknowledged that state Republican candidates aren't using Proposition 209 as an issue because "nobody is interested in it."
The Republicans' wedge strategy has another problem: It drives away educated female swing voters. Women have benefited from affirmative action, and the proposal also evokes the "meanness" they may already associate with Newt Gingrich's party. So while Republican candidates support the measure, few say much about it. Last week, Mr. Waxman's Republican challenger, Paul Stepanek, even endorsed Mr. Clinton.
Despite efforts by individual candidates to soft-pedal the initiative, last-minute advertising in favor of it will aim at shoring up support among the "angry white men." But for Mr. Dole and the Republicans, hopes of a bailout by these voters looks a lot like California dreamin'.

HEADLINE: For $8.6 Million, Christie's Sells a Rare Korean Dragon

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

 BODY:
A rare Korean dragon jar from the 17th century, cracked down one side, was sold on Thursday night for $8.6 million at Christie's in New York. The price was the highest ever paid at auction for an Asian art object. The names of the seller and the buyer, who bid by telephone, were not disclosed.
The jar is boldly emblazoned with a fierce, three-clawed dragon, a brown-black iron oxide monster depicted as chasing the pearl of wisdom around the baluster-shaped jar. At nearly 19 inches, it is the tallest known of this type of ceramic vessel.
TXT>
 "Forget about it being cracked," said Leighton Longhi, a New York dealer in Asian art. "That piece has everything going for it. It has enormous size, beautiful proportions and great painting. The dragon is a boldly drawn image in iron oxide, not the more usual blue and white. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."
The previous record price for Asian art was $6.1 million, for a Tang horse sold in 1989 at Sotheby's in London.
Sebastian Izzard, the head of Christie's department of Korean and Japanese art, said he had not known that the dragon jar existed until it was shown to him in 1995. "It had been in storage probably for 50 years," he said. "It is the largest version known of a type produced in the Choson Dynasty in the early 17th century. The four or five others are all in museums."
Even so, he made a conservative estimate, at $400,000 to $600,000, because the jar had a crack running down the side and a firing crack in the base.
Similar but much smaller pieces are in the National Museum of Korea in Seoul as well as in two other museums in South Korea, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Ataka Collection in Osaka, Japan.
"Korean industrialists and museums have bought virtually all the important pieces of Korean art sold recently," Mr. Longhi said. "This one most likely is also going back to Korea."
Prices for Korean art began to increase rapidly in the late 1980's, as the economy in South Korea improved. The pace quickened in 1992 when Korean ceramics from the Ataka Collection in Japan were exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. And prices have continued to rise since the Metropolitan announced a year ago that its Arts of Korea Galleries would open in late 1997.

HEADLINE: A Robust Pace Of Job Growth, With Inflation Under Control

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1

 BODY:
In the latest of a string of pre-election reports showing the economy on a slow but steady track, Government figures indicated today that the number of American jobs once again grew at a robust pace in October while wages posed no threat of faster inflation.
Unemployment remained at the low rate of 5.2 percent for the second consecutive month, and employers added 210,000 new jobs last month after payrolls had shrunk by 35,000 in September, the Labor Department said. 
 The Clinton Administration exulted over an economy in which the jobless rate has now descended basically to the lowest levels since 1974 and which has grown every quarter without interruption since the spring of 1991.
"No other sitting President since Lyndon Johnson has had a better economy to run on," Robert B. Reich, the Secretary of Labor, contended. Responding to the suggestion by Mr. Clinton's Republican rival that a recession looms just over the horizon, he added, "This is most certainly not a doleful economy."
President Clinton, campaigning in Santa Barbara, Calif., said the figures rebutted Bob Dole's attacks on the Administration's economic record.
"It is time for my opponent and those on the other side to stop all this doom-and-gloom talk about America," Mr. Clinton said. "In spite of what he wants you to think, when it comes to the economy, the sky is not falling."
Christina Martin, a spokeswoman for Mr. Dole, responded by noting that a relatively high number of people had been out of work more than six months and that hourly earnings did not grow last month. "Most importantly," she added, economic anxiety "is most evident in the number of individuals who have to work at more than one job to make ends meet."
On Wall Street, where the bond market rallied sharply this week on expectation of continued low inflation, the jobs report came across as old news. Bond prices fell slightly and the stock market dipped as well, with the Dow Jones industrial average down 7.45 points, to 6,021.93.
Private analysts generally agree that the economy has held up remarkably well, particularly for the sixth year of an expansion, a time when inflation normally would have begun to heat up. But they tended to minimize the credit that could be properly claimed by the Administration.
"This is about as good as it gets," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities in New York. He pointed to the economy's slowing from a rapid pace in the spring and said it was now running "within the tolerable speed limits" that imply little upward drift in inflation.
The gain of 210,000 in employer payrolls, considered the best single barometer of the labor market, was a rebound from the surprising September decline of 35,000 that prompted some thoughts that the economy might be slowing too much.
While the October increase was in line with those prevailing so far this year, the deceleration dragged the gain for the latest three months down to a monthly average of 152,000 from an average of 283,000 for May, June and July.
Business services showed almost no job growth for the second consecutive month but retail trade added 62,000 jobs. That reflected a strong start in seasonal hiring by department stores, said Katharine G. Abraham, Commissioner of Labor Statistics.
Factory jobs edged up a negligible 6,000 after a September skid of 59,000 while a drop of 40,000 in government jobs was mainly a statistical aberration caused by a trend to earlier school reopenings.
Economists who scrutinized today's report for any impact from the 50-cent rise in the minimum wage that took effect Oct. 1 found little sign of change other than a 1.1 percent jump, to $8.11 from $8.02, in the average earnings of those working in retail trade.
The effect on overall earnings -- unchanged at $11.91 an hour after two hefty increases -- was "not more than a cent or two," Commissioner Abraham said.
Officials said that one factor in the 24-minute decline in the length of the private-sector workweek was the Canadian auto workers strike against General Motors, which shut down some production in the United States.
The department's survey of households, on which the unemployment rate is based, showed 259,000 more people with jobs, just enough, given a 234,000 expansion of the labor force, to keep the unemployment rate from rising.
But there were the usual geographical disparities, with the jobless rate inching up two-tenths in the Northeast and South, to 5.4 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively, while it eased that amount, to 4.3 percent, in the Midwest. The West's rate was 6.3 percent for the third consecutive month.
The 5.2 percent national jobless rate compares with 7.3 percent four years ago on the eve of the last Presidential election. But the Dole campaign focused today on different comparisons.
Ms. Martin, the campaign spokeswoman, cited the fact that 17.4 percent of those who were jobless in October had been out of work more than six months, a higher rate than in previous expansions. The average length of unemployment was 40 percent higher, she said, than in the 1980's.
The number of people holding two or more jobs last month was 8,369,000, or 5 percent more than in October 1995. Of those employed, 6.5 percent held multiple jobs last month, compared with 6.3 percent a year ago.
Some lesser economic gauges published today tended to point in the same direction as the employment report -- slackened but continued growth with little inflation.
The nation's purchasing managers put their monthly index covering industrial activity at 50.2, down from 51.7 in September, as the new-orders and commodity-price components sagged while production and supplier deliveries edged up and export orders kept up a robust pace.
The Index of Leading Indicators, a forecasting tool now compiled by the Conference Board, edged up one-tenth of 1 percent in September, the skimpiest of eight consecutive advances.
Coincident indicators, those that move at the same time as the overall economy, rose two-tenths of 1 percent for the third month after three increases that averaged twice that much.
And factory orders jumped 2.7 percent in September, the biggest advance in two years.
"This is another set of numbers that is an incumbent politician's dream," Robert Dederick, chief economic consultant for the Northern Trust Company of Chicago, told The Associated Press. "We have comfortable growth but not so rapid as to trigger inflation concerns."

J. R. Jayewardene, a former President of Sri Lanka who modernized and reshaped the country politically and was later criticized for his handling of ethnic tensions at its most critical moments, died yesterday in Colombo. He was 90.
Junius Richard Jayewardene -- who was always known as J. R. -- was the last of a generation of leaders who came of age politically before his island nation, then known as Ceylon, achieved independence in 1948.
When he became Prime Minister in 1977 and President the next year as a result of a rewriting of the Constitution, Mr. Jayewardene began to dismantle the socialist economic system. "The early years of his administration were wonderful years," said Howard Wriggins, who was American Ambassador in Colombo, the capital, from 1977 to 1980. "The whole economy turned around."
"He did remarkable things for Sri Lanka," said Mr. Wriggins, who is now retired and the co-author with a Sri Lankan historian, Kingsley de Silva, of a book on the former President, titled "J. R. Jayewardene of Sri Lanka: A Political Biography."
"On economic policy, he was one of the early ones to move toward the free market in a country that had been locked into the socialist myth," Mr. Wriggins said. "If they had moved 10 years earlier, Sri Lanka might have been one of the export successes."
But Sri Lanka, known for its high rates of literacy and education and strong democratic and judicial institutions, fell prey to ethnic divisions. In 1983 a group of Sinhalese Sri Lankan soldiers were killed in an ambush, and tensions rose to an explosive level. In the crucial early moments when the country's Sinhalese-speaking, largely Buddhist majority took revenge on the ethnic Tamil, largely Hindu minority, Mr. Jayewardene, a Sinhalese Buddhist, inexplicably withdrew from sight and did nothing to stop the violence.
Gangs of thugs who, witnesses said, were led by members of the President's United National Party, went on a rampage against Tamils in Colombo, killing many and destroying their homes and businesses. In the civil war that still continues, more than 47,000 people have died -- Buddhists, Hindus, Christians and Muslims.
To compound the country's problems, in 1987 Mr. Jayewardene invited India to send troops to disarm the Tamil rebels. That action set off an extremely violent reaction among radical Sinhalese nationalists in the south of the country, who -- like the President himself -- blamed India for having earlier armed and trained the Tamils.
A Sinhalese nationalist in a presidential honor guard tried to club India's Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, with a rifle, when he came to Colombo to sign the agreement. In towns and villages, thousands died in the terrorism that followed, at least some of it Government-inspired or officially condoned, especially during the administration of Mr. Jayewardene's successor, President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who was also Sinhalese.
After stepping down from the presidency in 1988, Mr. Jayewardene withdrew from public life. In an interview then, he defended his record by comparing it with previous administrations led by Solomon W. R. D. Bandaranaike and then by his widow, Sirimavo Bandaranaike. He seemed oblivious to the violence and instability around him.
"We have a free press; the previous Government nationalized the press," declared Mr. Jayewardene, who said he had modeled his otherwise authoritarian presidency in part on Charles de Gaulle's France. "Political parties can operate freely. This is the essence of democracy: Freedom to vote and freedom to elect a president."
Mr. Jayewardene grew up in a privileged, English-speaking family in Colombo, and was looked after by a British nanny during an age when Sri Lanka's hallmarks were an old-fashioned civility and a formality that are all but gone.
He was a bookish intellectual and Buddhist who was able to detach himself from the world around him -- too much so, his critics say. All his life, even when he was traveling abroad, he wore the traditional Sri Lankan simple white sarong and long white shirt.
When he retired, Mr. Jayewardene said he had great faith in the country's power to survive -- even while bombs were killing hundreds of innocent people and bodies were being strewn across the verdant landscape of the island the ancient Arab traders called Serendip. A burgeoning tourist industry was shattered, and the freed economy was collapsing as reports of terrorism, curfews and rights violations circled the globe.
"Sri Lanka withstood several coups and assassinations and attempts to overthrow democracy," he said serenely. "In the midst of all that, it seems to be quite strong."
Mr. Jayewardene is survived by his wife, Elina, and a son, Ravi.

HEADLINE: Germany's Retailers Beckon Warily to Customers

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: HOFHEIM, Germany, Nov. 1

 BODY:
The shopkeepers in this 500-year-old village tried hard to look happy today, as they marked the first day in German history that stores will be allowed to stay open on weekdays past 6:30 P.M.
Promptly at 6:30 P.M., they handed out chocolate coins in gold foil, each one stamped with a clock face with the hand pointing to 7:30. To rebut the common complaint that German stores treat customers as nuisances, the merchants here came up with 1,200 bright yellow umbrellas to lend to customers as they walked between stores in a drizzle. 
 But below the surface, few store owners tried to conceal their angst and misgivings.
"This will add to our labor costs, but people won't have any more money than they did before," grumbled Wolfgang Waller, a local optician. "So why should they start spending more at our stores?"
After years of heated political debate, a new German law took effect today that, ever so slightly, tries to warm up one of the most consumer-unfriendly countries in the West.
But change comes slowly in Germany. Even now, stores will not be able to stay open later than 8 P.M. on weekdays and 4 P.M. on Saturdays. And Sundays remain entirely off-limits.
Beyond that, many retailers say that even this modest change is too much. While big department stores and shopping malls eagerly began extending their hours today, small shopkeepers who still make up the backbone of German retailing tended to balk.
In Hofheim, as in almost every town and village, local merchants have banded together and carefully tried to judge how late they needed to stay open to avoid losing customers. In Hofheim, shopkeepers decided that stores should close no later than 7:30 P.M. on weekdays and 2 P.M. on Saturdays. The "mittagspause," or lunch break, was left to each store's judgment.
For shopkeepers and store clerks, longer hours mean nothing more than higher costs without new revenues. It means getting home later for dinner and perhaps even having to give up the hallowed midday rest that stretches between 12:30 and 2.
Many owners of small stores are also convinced that the longer store hours will only hasten the rise of American-style shopping malls and big-city retail districts in cities like Frankfurt and Munich. At risk, they fear, are the picturesque village shopping districts where stores are nestled in gingerbread buildings on pedestrian-only cobblestone streets.
Recent surveys here indicate that about 70 percent of stores plan to extend their hours at least somewhat. In big cities and shopping malls, stores are generally staying open as long as permissible and are hoping for an increase in sales.
"This is very important for us," said Werner Heger, the manager of Peek & Cloppenburg, a big department store at the Main Taunus Zentrum shopping mall outside Frankfurt. "We are salespeople, so we want the opportunity to be able to sell things."
German consumers are more than ready for a change. The restrictive shopping hours were manageable for traditional families in which the wife stayed home and did her shopping on weekday mornings.
But for single people who work and for families in which both parents work, ordinary shopping has become stressful.
"I don't understand why Germany is so rigid," said Sabine Ruby, a human resources executive at a technology company who lives in the town of Walluf, about an hour's drive from Frankfurt. "The only time I can shop is on Saturday mornings. I have to get up early and leave by 8:30 because if I get to the store at 10 A.M. I may not be able to find a parking place."
Indeed, supermarkets on Saturdays can be so crowded and pressured that many people consider it the height of bad form to bring children along, for fear they will get in the path of other frenzied customers.
That pressure is only getting worse. The number of families with two working parents has climbed by one-third since the mid-1980's, and accounts for 46 percent of all households with children, according to the German Ministry of Economics.
Many traditional German store owners feel trapped in a quandary. In Hofheim, not far from Frankfurt, merchants say they are already losing business to the Main Taunus Zentrum mall as well as to the downtown retail district in Frankfurt.
The problem, they say, is that keeping stores open later may do nothing at all to keep customers and could simply lead to higher costs.
Despite widespread grumbling about rigid shopping laws, many people enjoy the fringe benefit of short store hours: guaranteed free time in the evenings, on Saturday afternoons and on Sundays.
"I think the longer hours are a good thing, but I personally don't think I will use them," Petra Schwarm, a housewife, said as she waited for the stores to open today at Main Taunus Zentrum. "I don't have to go to a job and I can go shopping while the children are in school."
The shopkeepers in towns like Hofheim are edgily waiting to see what happens. If the customers don't start showing up in the evenings, they say, they won't keep the stores open late.
"For this to work, the consumers have to come," Mr. Waller said. "They must."

Speaking to students at Kittatinny Regional High School in Hampton Township, Sussex County, he addressed the risks of overdevelopment:
"Where I lived in Bergen County as a small boy, there were communities of open pasture land, forests, streams and lakes. During my life I have seen much of that land consumed by suburban sprawl, and with it went the deterioration in the quality of the water and the air. We lost the quality of life that brought us to those communities to begin with. That's not to say that we don't want economic development. But there is a difference between economic growth and endless suburban sprawl."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE VOTERS;
In Nobody's Whistlestop, N.J., if Anyone Cares, a Few Votes for Bruce Willis

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: PENNS GROVE, N.J., Oct. 30

 BODY:
Once again, the politicians looking for votes were close by, just not close enough.
President Clinton was spending the afternoon in Philadelphia, just a half-hour's drive to the northeast. A few days before, Hillary Rodham Clinton was in Cherry Hill, which is even closer. On Friday, the Senate candidate Robert G. Torricelli was stumping in Vineland, which is right next door, in Cumberland County. Yet none of the politicos had bothered to put Salem County on their itineraries. 
 Donna Stout and Fred Fitch did not mind. Standing on empty, forlorn Main Street in the middle of a beautiful day, they were busy wondering: when is Bruce Willis coming back?
"I think he was here three weeks ago," said Ms. Stout, who publishes a local shopper.
"No, I heard he was around a few days ago," said Mr. Fitch, who runs Dollar Daze Inc., a new discount store on Main and Broad Streets. "In fact," he said hopefully, "I heard he's still around."
More than any politician, the star of the "Die Hard" movies, a hometown boy made good, is the talk of Penns Grove, what with his plans to invest $50 million into redeveloping the Delaware River waterfront. The excitement of what everyone calls the Bruce Willis Project has even captured the rest of Salem County, always hungry for good economic news. As for the biggest political campaign in the country, it seems far away, almost an abstraction.
In Salem County, residents have no campaign promises to sort through, no stump speeches to compare with negative ads. Which has probably made the election easier. Of two dozen county residents interviewed in Penns Grove and the City of Salem, all said they had decided whom to vote for, even if they remain skeptical about the ability of government to make a real difference in their lives.
Not once have the contenders for Senate or the Presidency come courting in these parts. But that is typical. Salem County, where baseball fans tend to root for the Phillies and just about everyone makes the trip over the Delaware Memorial Bridge to shop in Wilmington, has long been overlooked by politicians courting the New Jersey Vote.
Three things have worked against it: it is poor, underpopulated, remote. Its urban centers, Penns Grove and the City of Salem, are on the list of the state's "most distressed municipalities." And it is the least densely populated county in New Jersey, with 65,000 residents spread over 350 square miles, mostly farmland. It has not received a visit from a sitting President since Richard M. Nixon stopped by once on the way to somewhere else.
At 23, Dorothy Wright is one of the optimists. A cashier at a liquor store in downtown Salem, she is hopeful that times will get better here for her 7-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter. "I registered to vote for the first time just recently," she said, as her children helped her fold their clothes in the Laundromat. "I want to keep Clinton in office. I'd rather stay with what I know already."
Salem, she said, needs help. But she is not relying on the politicians. She thinks the residents should help themselves. "This is a community that needs people to care about it," she said. "I hear people say their children aren't learning. I tell them if their kids aren't learning, they need to go to their schools and find out why, things like that."
The City of Salem (population 6,800) is deceiving. With its broad, handsome streets and quaint national historic district, it looks like the quintessential middle-class American village. It is easy to overlook the empty stores, the shabbier houses, the men of working age sitting on stoops or standing in front of a bar. The city (like Penns Grove) has a 14.3 percent unemployment rate. More than 33 percent of its residents live below the poverty line. The future of its largest employer, Anchor Glass factory, with 350 jobs, is uncertain. It may be sold and closed.
In the middle of the day, in the middle of the week, Coranna Pierce was having a yard sale at her downtown apartment. She was selling her living room, her magazines, her tiny porcelain animals, which she arranged in a row on her window sill. "There are no jobs here," she said. "I'm moving to Norwich, Conn., to stay with my sister." Her children, who go to school in Penns Grove, are not happy. "Times have been better," she said.
She plans to skip the Senate election ("too negative") and vote for Ross Perot for President. "I voted for him last time," she said. "He wants to run the country like a business, the way it should be run. We need to put people here to work."
Many people here said the same thing, though most everyone in the City of Salem also said they planned to vote for Mr. Clinton. (George Bush beat Mr. Clinton in Salem County in 1992, but barely: by 301 votes.) Charlotte Morrison, of Carneys Point, which is next to Penns Grove, said she planned to vote for Mr. Clinton even though she will vote for Republicans in the local and statewide races, as she always does.
"I'm voting for Clinton because he's more for the poor and I'm right near poverty myself," she said, almost cheerfully. She was having her hair permed at the Penns Grove Foodrite Plaza, after a long day of work at a shoe factory: "I've been up since 4 this morning, started work at 6. I put in a lot of hours to stay in place, to make the bills."
Such is the way of life in Salem County. The largest employers are the Dupont Chamber Works plant, with 2,200 jobs, and Public Service Electric and Gas, which owns the Salem nuclear plants, with 2,300 jobs. Except for those who work on one of the 752 farms, a plant job is the only way to make decent money.
For most residents, the answer to better times is the same answer that worked once before: private business. Marlene and George Morris, who run Morris's Takeout in Penns Grove, remember how things were when the DuPont factory opened years ago. "People moved here to work at Dupont and made their living," Mrs. Morris said. "And now we have Bruce Willis, another rich person coming here to spend a lot of money to resurrect Penns Grove."
They will vote Republican on Tuesday. "I always vote Republican,' Mrs. Morris said, "even though the city votes Democratic. I'm a die-hard. Get it? Bruce Willis? 'Die Hard?' "
Rob Bowen of Penns Grove gets it, though he is voting for Mr. Perot. "I think Dole is too old to be even thinking about running and I think Ross has some good ideas," said Mr. Bowen, who supports two children with a job at a Texaco station. He blames politicians for the county's sad state.
"Anything that North Jersey wants, it gets," Mr. Bowen said. "Anything that South Jersey wants, we have to wait for." Yet Mr. Bowen seems firmly convinced, like so many others here, that times in Salem County are going to get better, much better, in the near future.
How so? The answer came quickly. "Bruce," he said with a wide smile. "Bruce."

HEADLINE: Bonds Drop Despite Reports Of Slower Economic Growth

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities slipped yesterday, as economic reports showed the pace of growth in jobs and manufacturing slowing but not enough to ease investors' concern that inflation could rebound later this year.
The 30-year bond fell 16/32 to a price of 10030/32 to yield 6.68 percent, up from 6.64 percent on Thursday. 
 Initially the market gained after the Government said the economy added 210,000 jobs last month, after losing 35,000 in September. Yesterday's gain was in line with expectations. Traders noted, however, that the jobs gain left concern that the economy would bounce back if consumers went deeper into their wallets and purses in the holiday season.
Trading was heavy, with talk of foreign central banks taking profits after Thursday's advance. And with interest rates down as much as they have been over the last week, there was also talk of investors in mortgage-backed securities shifting into Treasury securities because of the potential that the mortgages backing these securities could be paid down in advance.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation, Columbus, Ohio, said the jobs number along with the other string of reports released this week initially made bond traders the most "bullish individuals in America." However, as the day progressed, he got the impression that many investors were beginning to wonder if economic news could get even better next week, especially as the quarterly refunding issues go on the auction block, increasing the supply of securities available. Investors may also have realized yesterday that with very little data on tap next week, pushing yields lower would prove difficult.
In when-issued trading, the three-year note that will be auctioned on Tuesday was offered at a price to yield 5.93 percent; the 10-year note on Wednesday was offered at a price to yield 6.38 percent, and the 30-year bond on Thursday at a price to yield 6.64 percent.
Mr. Chan said yesterday's report of a 2.7 percent rise in factory orders for September after a decline of 2.1 percent in August was no surprise. The overall gains in orders were largely a result of the surge in aircraft orders that was reported last week in durable-goods orders.
The National Association of Purchasing Management also released a report; it was similar to the previous day's Chicago purchasing management report, which showed a rise in the production component but no corresponding improvement in the orders components. "Let's face it," Mr. Chan said, "increasing production without a corresponding rise in new orders does not imply sustainability." The association's October index fell to 50.2 from 51.7.
Gerald A. Guild, senior vice president of the taxable fixed-income department at Advest Inc., said yesterday's data told him that the economy was doing fine, that employment was not too robust, and that leading indicators met expectations except for the disappointing national purchasing management report. Therefore, he said, it was a mystery to him that the bond market did not react more favorably. "There may be something subliminal here, and that is that the market could be already focusing on Tuesday's" election, he said.
"Growth is slow and inflation benign," Mr. Guild said, "and it is increasingly likely that on Nov. 13 the Fed will do nothing." He said the Consumer Price Index was "a mixed bag because it is overstated by as much as five-tenths to 2 percent."
Mr. Guild said energy costs would be a key and that in August and September the energy components were grossly understated. Energy in August declined six-tenths of 1 percent, and it was unchanged in September, "very much in severe conflict with the price of oil," he said. "If you believe those data, I have three bridges I'd like to sell you. But if by chance the Federal Open Market Committee perceives that inflation is climbing because of energy costs and other things, they'd have to make a preemptive strike with at least a quarter-point rate increase. They won't do half, although that would be marvelous."

HEADLINE: Mexico City Journal;
The Day of the Ghouls vs. the Day of the Dead

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 1

 BODY:
As dusk fell and shadows began to creep, the streets were suddenly filled with unearthly creatures, running in packs.
There were ghouls, skeletons, devils, vampire princesses and corpses returned from the dead. Even Death himself appeared, dressed in a gray hooded cassock and carrying not exactly a scythe but a cardboard machete. 
 It was Halloween, but not in any American town. On Thursday night children in droves in the capital and Mexico's other big cities donned spooky costumes and went house to house asking for candy. A distinctly American version of Halloween, with jack-o'-lanterns, candy corn, Batman and Morticia, is rapidly catching on in Mexico, a country with its own powerful traditions for celebrating the Day of the Dead.
The American Halloween and the colorful rituals taking place in cemeteries throughout Mexico today, All Saints' Day, and on Saturday, All Souls' Day, have the same roots, at least in part. In the ninth century the Christian church declared All Saints' Day, in effect recognizing the pagan festivals celebrating the harvest and honoring the dead. Just as European settlers brought the tradition to the United States, the Spanish spread it in Mexico.
But in this country the European practice melded with the beliefs of the Aztecs and other indigenous peoples for whom Death was an intimate and enthralling spiritual being. Modern Mexicans observe the Day of the Dead by decorating graves and communing with deceased loved ones in rites that mourn the survivors' loss but also celebrate the continuing closeness of the living and the dead.
By contrast, Halloween, on the eve of All Saints' Day of All Hallows, is the night of Death's dark side, when monsters and bloodsuckers and the souls that found no rest run free.
In Mexico, the custom is catching on mainly because it's fun.
"It's pure candy!" said Erica Jasmin Sanchez, a 6-year-old scarlet devil with horns and a pointed tail who was carrying a skull full of cookies and caramels.
Children in big groups flock through the capital's well-to-do neighborhoods, lining up in crowds to receive treats from whoever will open their front door. In Mexico City, since everyone is disguised in a costume, Halloween is a once-a-year opportunity for poor children to go begging for treats at the homes of the rich without being chased away by security guards.
"Give me my Halloween!" they cry, using the English term. Sometimes the "trick" part of the routine is maintained as well, with children carrying markers or paint to write vengeful graffiti on the houses where no goodies are given.
The horticultural ancestors of the big orange pumpkin that Americans carve with scary faces were Mexican. Nowadays Mexico grows squashes in hundreds of colors and shapes, but not many pumpkins, so to meet Halloween demand they must be imported from the United States. Many Mexicans choose plastic pumpkins instead.
Mexico's turn to Halloween began two decades ago and boomed as the country's economic and political opening produced an explosion of trade and travel across the border with the United States. Like many United States cultural exports, Halloween in Mexico is a major marketing event.
A Wal-Mart superstore in a northern suburb of Mexico City set aside floor space for a mock graveyard where costumes and candies are displayed above half-open coffins inhabited by blood-spattered mummies.
"Let me explain this as a Mexican," said Alvaro Alonso, the deputy store manager. "This is really new for us. It is not one of our fiestas. But Halloween is a concept that is definitely growing."
Wal-Mart's Halloween sales have increased for the last three years despite a deep recession in Mexico.
But Mr. Alonso said the trend was controversial among Mexican consumers. Wal-Mart's suggestion box was filled today with comments from customers demanding to know why the salespeople were dressed up like witches in a store in the center of Mexico.
"Halloween is costumes and candy," said Mariana Villareal, a top buyer at the store. "The Day of the Dead is more a matter of the heart."
Some intellectuals agree that Halloween is an offense against Mexican nationalism.
"This is cultural pollution," the Mexican novelist Homero Aridjis said. "In these hard times I call upon Mexicans to leave aside all those Anglo-Saxon witches and ghosts and keep their money to buy bread and flowers to honor their dead."
But the gleeful children in the streets on Thursday night were not concerned about the national origins of the game.
"This comes from the United States, but we can take culture from wherever we want," said Guillermo Morales, a 15-year-old phantom.
Some Mexican children had decided that Halloween was already theirs.
"I like it because it is a tradition of the Mexicans," said the white-eyed, black-lipped Adriana Alicia Garcia, 12. "We go out every year and ask for candies to fill up our skulls."
To judge from the crowds thronging cemeteries here today, Mexicans are adding a Halloween tradition without abandoning the older one. Many parents who accompanied their children on Thursday night said they would be out today making altars and adorning graves.
At the Dolores cemetery, there were reminders of the deep emotions engaged by the Day of the Dead. A young mother, Lucia Mena de Acevedo, wove a blanket of red roses to lay on the tomb of her daughter Mireya, who died of liver disease last year when she was 7. Siblings and cousins sat by quietly.
"We want her to know that we will always keep the flowers fresh for her," Mrs. Acevedo said, fighting tears. She let her two other children go out on Thursday night to ask for candy, to let them feel that life is moving on after their sister's death.
"But we are in Mexico," Mrs. Acevedo said. "We don't call it Halloween."

HEADLINE: Mergers Continue Record Pace, but One Alliance Falters;
MCI Deal Would Speed Pace of Current Mergers

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Every day seems to bring yet another announcement of a multibillion-dollar merger and acquisition deal, and with almost two months left in the year, British Telecommunications' pending $22 billion acquisition of the MCI Communications Corporation would propel 1996 well beyond last year's record.
A deal for MCI, once it has been formally announced, would bring the total volume of merger deals to $537 billion, up from $518 billion in all of 1995 and well ahead of $341.9 billion in deals during 1994, according to the Securities Data Company. More than a trillion dollars worth of deals were struck in 1995 and 1996. 
 Those numbers dwarf the high-water mark of the previous decade, $353 billion in 1988. In the recession, merger activity declined precipitously, falling to $137.2 billion in 1991. But a resurgent stock market and a looser regulatory environment revived merger activity in recent years.
"In the last three years, the velocity of the expansion of the merger market has been astonishing," said Arthur Fleischer, a partner at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, a mergers and acquisitions law firm in New York. Nothing suggests that this trend will cease any time soon. Scale, location, financial capacity and the ability to compete globally help make it a very aggressive acquisition marketplace. It is also clearly stimulated by the availability of capital and the level of stock prices."
The fast pace of merger activity is nowhere more evident than in the media and telecommunications industries, where deregulation and international competition have removed both commercial and territorial barriers. The possible British Telecom-MCI deal follows by months the announcement of the Bell Atlantic Corporation's $21.3 billion acquisition of Nynex Corporation. Earlier this year, SBC Communications bid $16.5 billion for the Pacific Telesis Group; World-Com Inc. announced the purchase of MFS Communications Company in a stock swap valued at $13.6 billion, and the Hughes Electronics Corporation moved to acquire Panamsat Corporation for $3 billion.
But about 60 percent of the activity is taking place among mature industries and companies -- in such fields as retailing, banking and health care -- driven together in a search for strength and lower costs because they are unable to increase profits through price or production increases.
Sears, Roebuck & Company has announced it intends to buy the Orchard Supply Hardware Stores Corporation for $308 million, while Staples Inc. has an agreement to acquire its larger rival, Office Depot Inc., in a $3.36 billion deal. More recently, the Rite Aid Corporation announced an agreement to acquire Thrifty Payless Holdings Inc., in a $1.4 billion stock deal. The move would create the dominant drugstore chain on the East and West Coasts, even as Rite Aid sheds hundreds of stores in the Southeast, where it runs a distant fourth to its competition.
Safeway Inc., the supermarket chain, was also seeking to become a market leader on the West Coast when it announced plans to buy the Vons Companies, a leading chain in Southern California, for $1.6 billion.
Although many consumers fear that the merger trend will lead to layoffs, higher prices and less competition, bankers, lawyers and corporate executives contend that the tidal wave of mergers and acquisitions enables the combining companies to cut administrative expenses and redundant services and to pass along the savings.
"All this is leading to massive consolidation, making American business as strong as ever, and leading to lower prices for consumers," the investment banker Peter Solomon said.
Amid the surge of multibillion-dollar deals, Merrill Lynch & Company moved into first place in handling transactions after years of running behind Goldman, Sachs & Company and Morgan Stanley. According to Securities Data, Merrill Lynch has advised on deals valued at a total of $145.3 billion so far this year, compared with $127.7 billion for Morgan Stanley and $92 billion for Goldman, Sachs. At the same time, J. P. Morgan, a relatively recent entry to the merger field in the United States, has climbed into seventh position.
The explosion of merger deals has witnessed the resurrection of Bruce Wasserstein, the financier who heads Wasserstein Perella & Company. The once highflying deal maker, who urged corporate executives to dare to be great during the 1980's by undertaking huge takeover battles and assuming comparable debt, became a symbol of the excess of the era. His firm drifted out of the standings as colleagues defected.
But Mr. Wasserstein and his firm have made a comeback, albeit as a gentler, less public deal maker, ranking 11th this year among merger advisers, up from 20th in 1992. He is currently advising Aetna Life and Casualty Company on its $8.8 billion bid to purchase U.S. Healthcare Inc. and form the nation's largest medical benefits company; he is also advising Diamond Shamrock on its friendly $1 billion acquisition of the Ultramar Corporation, which would create the third-largest independent oil refining and marketing company.

If completed at $22 billion, the acquisition of MCI by British Telecommunications would top the list of largest foreign takeovers of American companies and would help propel merger volume to a new record. (Source: Securities Data Company) (pg. 38)

HEADLINE: A Plunge From Hoop Dream to Nightmare

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ with VINCENT M. MALLOZZI 

 BODY:
Richie Adams sat in the stands at Madison Square Garden two weeks ago with the bill of his baseball cap pulled low over his face, his eyes darting back and forth as the New York Knicks and his buddy Larry Johnson scrambled across the court.
He wasn't hiding from his fans that day, the people who might have remembered him as a star basketball center, a jaw-dropping leaper with tireless legs who played for Jerry Tarkanian and the University of Nevada-Las Vegas during the early 1980's. Instead, Mr. Adams said, he was ducking drug-running killers who were tailing him around town, accusing him of murdering a teen-age girl. 
 "I'm on the run," Mr. Adams, who admits using cocaine and hanging out with neighborhood gangsters, said after the game. "I can't go home because drug dealers there want to kill me."
Six days later, Mr. Adams, 33, was arrested and charged in the killing of Norma Rodriguez, a 14-year-old girl who was found dead on Oct. 15 in the Melrose section of the Bronx, one floor below Mr. Adams's mother's apartment. She had been bludgeoned to death near the elevator. A bloody Adidas sneaker, size 13 1/2, was found just outside the building.
Mr. Adams turned himself in Oct. 23 and pleaded not guilty to murder the next day. Family and friends of Ms. Rodriguez, who lived across the street, said Mr. Adams had been stalking her.
Mr. Adams's tumble from pro prospect to suspect in a gruesome killing was slow and incremental and, to his coaches and teammates, heart-breaking. Mr. Adams, they say, did not miss just one opportunity to play with the Johnsons and Jordans of the N.B.A. He missed a string of them.
There was an offer from the Washington Bullets, international league contracts, a casino job in Las Vegas, and the pleas and affection of his U.N.L.V. coach, Mr. Tarkanian.
"Everybody in Las Vegas loved him, but every time he went back to New York he got in trouble," said his coach, Mr. Tarkanian, holding back tears. "We tried real hard to get him not to go back to New York."
New York, though, was Mr. Adams's haven. On the streets of Harlem and the South Bronx, he understood instinctively what to say and when to say it. It didn't matter that he couldn't read or write well.
What mattered was his prowess on the court, and in the end, the steady supply of cocaine and easy adulation it brought him, friends say. Despite the streetwise veneer, Mr. Adams was also a man more malleable than tough, a willing follower who never considered taking a lead position off the court.
"When he was around good people, he did the right thing," said Danny Tarkanian, the coach's son and Mr. Adams's friend and former teammate. "When he was around the wrong crowd, he messed up."
On the hardwood, Mr. Adams seemed to float above it all. He was gifted, a 6-foot-9-inch player who was nimble on his feet and rebounded with confidence and precision.
In New York City, his size and agility turned him into one of the most sought-after summer tournament players. The Animal, people called him. In Las Vegas, his talent made him a celebrity.
 
Player of the Year, Two Years in a Row
In each of his last two seasons at U.N.L.V., in which the Runnin' Rebels finished with a combined record of 57-10, he was the conference player of the year. He finished his college career with 1,168 points and 623 rebounds. Some say that in his prime, Mr. Adams could have outrebounded Dennis Rodman.
In 1985, he made the ultimate leap, becoming a fourth-round draft pick for the Washington Bullets. The day after the draft he was arrested for stealing a car in the Bronx. It was the beginning of his free fall.
"Richie was a great player," said Mr. Tarkanian, who was ultimately forced out of U.N.L.V. amid controversy and a feud with the university president. He is now head coach at California State University at Fresno.
"What made him such a special person," Mr. Tarkanian said, "is that despite his greatness, he was never cocky or self-assuming. He never boasted about the things he accomplished on the basketball court.
"He was one of the quickest jumpers I have ever seen. He was like a pogo stick, he was so quick off of his feet, and he could jump just as high the second time as he did the first, and just as high the third time as he had jumped the second."
Mr. Adams was at his best from 1981 to 1984, while he was at U.N.L.V. He warmed to his teammates quickly and worked hard on the court. Toward the end of his career there, he was always the first to volunteer to speak to elementary-school children about staying off drugs and graduating from high school, advice Mr. Adams never took to heart.
At one Rebel party honoring the players' parents, Mr. Adams brought seven local children as his guests. During his off time, he took children no taller than his kneecaps to the 7-Eleven for Slurpees.
"He loved talking to the kids," said Paul Brozovich, a former teammate. "And the kids really loved him."
But Mr. Adams, who had not yet learned to read or write at 14, could not shake off the lure of New York City's streets. At times, he so missed hanging out with his "get-high" buddies in New York that he isolated himself from the team. Coaches and teammates thought he was manic-depressive. Mr. Adams was convinced he just needed to go home, and he did that, when his grandmother died, taking a year off in 1982 before returning to play for the next two seasons.
That year, Mr. Adams ambled around his gritty neighborhood in high style, a star admired even by rich drug dealers. It was a feeling he had always coveted, one he first tasted in 1978 as a hotshot player on the top-ranked Benjamin Franklin High School team in East Harlem, teammates said.
"He never wanted to leave his neighborhood," said a Franklin High School teammate and lifelong friend, Gary Springer, who now lives in North Carolina. "He was just a street kid like the rest of us."
From an early age, Mr. Adams had a penchant for trouble. The people around him chalked it up to poor upbringing, simple-mindedness and dangerous friendships, but they held out hope that his talent would prevail. At school, he was a truant with a reputation for using drugs and stealing, said Stan Dinner, a former basketball coach for Franklin High, now closed, who recruited Mr. Adams.
"Every now and then, he would shock you by doing something stupid," Mr. Dinner said. "He would get caught stealing apples from the cafeteria when all he had to do was ask for them."
Mr. Dinner recalls picking up the phone in his office one afternoon and hearing a police officer tell him Mr. Adams was in custody. "Richie had stolen my car," Mr. Dinner said. "He went on a joy ride. Of course, I dropped the charges."
At home, after he left U.N.L.V. and squandered his shot at the N.B.A. by being arrested, Mr. Adams sought refuge on the asphalt playground courts of Holcombe Rucker Memorial Park in Harlem, where the city's best players face off every summer in a brash and brazen display of skill.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain and Stephon Marbury were among the best who made it. Many more did not, like Joe Hammond, dubbed the Destroyer; Herman (the Helicopter) Knowings, and Earl Manigault, called the Goat, who dunked a ball backward 36 times in a row to win a $60 bet.
The Rucker League summer tournaments, which have no official sponsors, also earned a reputation for bending the rules, and sometimes the law, former players and coaches say. High stakes gambling on games, under-the-table payments to players and team sponsorship by drug dealers are not uncommon. It is no secret that the best players are paid well for these ultracompetitive tournaments. Victory at Rucker Park is a matter of honor to drug dealers.
"There is definitely a drug element in the Rucker League, and a few teams are run by drug dealers who are looking for their own fame," said James Ryan, who has coached Mr. Adams in summer tournaments since he was a teen-ager. "They love saying, 'I have Richie Adams on my team.' "
 
$1,000 a Game, Spent on Drugs
Mr. Adams found he could make a comfortable living playing in local tournaments.
"A lot of basketball teams I play for in different tournaments are run by drug dealers who pay me to play for them," he said after a recent Knicks game. The dealers, he said, often dropped him off at home at the Andrew Jackson Houses in a gleaming Mercedes-Benz or Lexus. He had a steady paycheck and his ego was being stroked. He was needed on the court.
"In his prime, Richie made a ton of money playing in the summer leagues," said Lenzell Vaughn, who played with Mr. Adams in tournaments and was known as the Predator on the court. "People would do anything to have him play for them. They would buy him clothes, sneakers and even food, if he was hungry."
But Mr. Adams, who Mr. Ryan said was probably making $1,000 a game during his best years, spent most of his money on drugs, especially cocaine, friends said. Even after he fathered two children with different women, he kept draining his wallet to get high, they said. Not even the drug dealers approved, Mr. Ryan said.
"Of course it was drug money he was being paid, but no one told him to buy drugs with it," Mr. Ryan said. "Heck, if these dealers wanted to see Richie get high, they would have paid him in drugs, not cash, because that would have been a lot cheaper. Believe me, no drug dealer, especially the ones who bet big money on some of those games, would want to see one of their players show up high."
When his money ran out, Mr. Adams turned to crime. Between 1988 and 1989, he was convicted three times. He snatched two purses and held up a woman at an automated teller machine, placing a gun to her jaw. In April 1989, Mr. Adams was sent to an upstate prison, where he played ball behind barbed wire as shotgun-toting guards watched.
Through it all, his teammates and coaches tried to help him see past the easy money. Mr. Tarkanian sent him airline tickets to Las Vegas. Mr. Adams cashed them in. He lined up a job for Mr. Adams at a casino, a route many former U.N.L.V. players take when they graduate, but Mr. Adams ignored the offer.
After Mr. Adams was sent to prison, Mr. Tarkanian and his son, Danny, tried unsuccessfully to get the Governor of Nevada to permit him to enter a work-release program in Las Vegas. Teammates and friends encouraged him to play basketball abroad, and he did, briefly, in Argentina, but New York never failed to tug him home.
"Playing in those summer tournaments in Harlem," said Mr. Dinner, Mr. Adams's former high school coach who now owns a restaurant, "Richie was a legend here in New York, and that's one of the reasons why he always wanted to go back. It was a safe, comfortable place for him."
When he got out of prison in April 1994, Mr. Adams returned to his mother's apartment in the Bronx. People in the neighborhood pulled for him once again.
"There was a lot of love out here for him, but he just went back to it," said James Howard, who grew up in the same projects and remembers when Mr. Adams came home.
Eventually, it became common knowledge in his building at 3050 Park Avenue that little had changed. Mr. Adams still used drugs, friends said. He was still unemployed.
But one thing was different: his game. No longer a young man with a marquee name, Mr. Adams was paid considerably less for his time on the court. Fewer games came his way. Neighbors said he again turned to stealing to finance his habit, sometimes in his own building. The crimes were not reported, they said, because residents were afraid.
"People stayed clear of him," Mr. Howard said. "He was a smooth operator. He never stayed long here."
His basketball buddies also noticed that he had taken another downward turn. "I was aware that Richie had drug problems," Mr. Vaughn said. "He'd show up before games and say, 'I'm so tired.' He was real dragging and his eyes looked so droopy. I knew right there he was getting high."
Mr. Dinner remembers Mr. Adams coming into his restaurant last year. "He looked horrible," Mr. Dinner said. "His hair was matted and his clothes did not look fresh. I gave him an order of chicken wings and a bottle of beer. He said, 'Coach, can you spot me a few bucks?' "
Still, the people who know him best said they are astonished that Mr. Adams, a man never seen fighting, not even after taking an intentional elbow to the face on the court, could have committed murder. Most said they never heard him mention Norma Rodriguez, the girl he is charged with killing. As for the size 13 1/2 sneaker found nearby, Mr. Adams says he wears a size 15.
"I don't know if Richie did this," Mr. Dinner added, "but anything is possible. Drugs do strange things to people, and Richie is a very strong guy. What a shame. What a waste. Here's a guy who really had a chance to go places."

HEADLINE: 'President McKinley's Paper' Evolves, and So Do Its Political Endorsements

SERIES: AN AMERICAN PLACE: Editorial History

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: CANTON, Ohio, Nov. 1

 BODY:
In 177 years, Canton's newspaper, The Repository, had never endorsed a Democrat for President. "President McKinley's paper," they called it, and it really was, owned by his wife's family. In the 1896 Presidential election, run from the front porch of the McKinley home here, special editions of The Repository featuring the daily speeches of William McKinley were printed each evening and sent round America by train.
Far into the modern era, it continued a Republican paper editorially and in news columns. For four decades, through the 1970's, The Repository was run by Clayton G. Horn, a legendary Ohio editor and rabid Republican, who once banned his reporters from using the name of Canton's Democratic Mayor in the paper, who rewrote the editorial on the Kent State killings in 1970 to be more supportive of the National Guard and had such a close relationship with James Rhodes, the Republican Governor of Ohio, that he could call and say, "Jim? Clayt! I want you in my office tomorrow at noon!" And the Governor would be there. 
 Then, in 1992, The Repository endorsed Bill Clinton. "You could feel the earth tremble," said Michael Hanke, The Repository's current editor. A former publisher of the paper, John Siam, a Republican, who presided over the endorsements of Presidents Reagan and Bush in the 1980's before retiring in 1990, put it this way: "I felt like throwing up when I read it." W. R. Timken Jr., the fourth-generation Timken to run the steel and bearing company here, said, "I thought they were nuts."
That the paper of McKinley, Rhodes and the Ohio National Guard would endorse Bill Clinton, says a lot about how much small-town newspapering and politics have changed in America in the last decades and about the kind of Democrat Mr. Clinton is. The 1992 endorsement was the final, most public step in a slow transformation that began 25 years earlier when the Thomson chain bought The Repository.
The Repository's editorial board met Monday, Oct. 21, at 10 A.M. to decide the paper's 1996 Presidential endorsement. Attending were James Smith, 37, the publisher, who came here in January 1995, from Thomson's corporate headquarters in Stamford, Conn.; Mr. Hanke, 47, the editor for 16 years now; Bill Hopper, 60, the editorial page editor, and David Kaminski, 44, the managing editor. As is true at all 85 Thomson newspapers, the local publisher has the final word on endorsements. Mr. Smith would later say, he came in, "looking for a reason to endorse Dole."
They agreed that the economy and character were the big issues, and that they needed to decide, as Mr. Hanke said, whether President Clinton had "fulfilled our wishes" from the paper's 1992 endorsement.
"Character isn't just about the womanizer or the guy involved in Whitewater," began Mr. Hopper. "If you broaden it out, you see a man willing to take some tough decisions, take some risks."
As for Mr. Dole's political character, Mr. Hopper said: "I was terribly disappointed. The Dole I expected was not the Dole running for President. He immediately changed positions." Mr. Hopper mentioned the 15 percent tax-cut proposal and the selection of Jack Kemp, whose supply side views were at odds with Mr. Dole's ideas. "So I don't think it's a clear-cut decision. The character issue is not all a minus for Clinton."
"I'm frightened," said Mr. Kaminski, "that we will be embarrassed as a newspaper if we endorse Clinton and have a huge scandal break out." He said Mr. Hopper's idea to factor in Mr. Clinton's political character for taking on groups like the gun lobby, could be "the way out of this problem."
"To maintain our integrity," said Mr. Hopper, "the editorial would have to raise the possibility that something may blow up."
The publisher looked uneasy. "A newspaper's choice in making an editorial endorsement should be on a higher plane," Mr. Smith said.
Today under Mr. Hanke, The Repository, with a daily circulation of 62,000, is a fairer, better quality newspaper than it was 25 years ago, (named the best paper of its size in Ohio the last two years.) Indeed, Mr. Hanke is so guarded about his politics in this place where secrets don't keep, he registers as an independent.
On the other hand, The Repository is also a far less influential paper than it was in the 1950's, 1960's, and 1970's, when its cigar-chomping, profanity-spewing, tyrannical Republican editor teamed up with Canton's business elite to bring two state colleges and a medical school to this region, move two highways to more convenient spots, and snag the Pro Football Hall of Fame for Ohio's ninth-largest city.
In those days under Clayton Horn, there was no editorial board meeting to decide a Presidential endorsement. "Clayt wrote the editorial and handed it to me," said Mr. Hopper, the editorial page editor here for 28 years. "And we printed it."
In the 1960's, Mr. Horn was No. 1 on a list of the 10 most influential people in Stark County. The Football Hall of Fame is in Canton thanks to Mr. Horn. Germane Swanson, a sportswriter, had the original idea. "Clayt was into bowling at the time and he said, 'That's a 12-strike idea! Let's go for it!' " recalled Mr. Swanson. Mr. Horn brought together William Umstattd, The Timken Company president and Paul Brown of the Cleveland Browns, who in the 1930's had coached one of Stark's great high school football powers, Massillon.
Mr. Umstattd lined up business leaders. Mr. Brown handled the National Football League. And Mr. Horn took care of publicity. On Dec. 9, 1959, the campaign began with a story in The Repository headlined, "Pro Football Needs Hall of Fame and Logical Site Is Here." In two years it was.
Mr. Hanke, the current editor, was a cub reporter in the early 1970's covering a regional board meeting about bringing a state medical school to nearby Rootstown. Mr. Horn and the Akron Beacon-Journal editor, Ben Maidenburg, were both on the board and the only ones talking at the meeting, according to Mr. Hanke. "Maidenburg and Horn said, 'You do this, you do this, I'll call Jim,' " (Governor Rhodes). "I'll call Vern," (Vern Riffe, Speaker of the Ohio House at the time). "And that was it."
The Repository in those days was the flagship of the Brush-Moore newspapers, a small chain that included a half-dozen small-town Ohio papers. Mr. Horn wrote editorials and wired them to the other papers which were under orders to print them. In an interview with The Repository in 1993, shortly before he died, Mr. Horn explained his philosophy. "This was a Republican newspaper and you didn't forget that," he said, bragging that one year 22 of 23 endorsements were Republicans. "And 22 won!" he said.
In the 1950's Canton was a wide-open town, with a red light district. "Clayt wanted it cleaned up, so he had Stanley Cmich run for Mayor," recalled Mr. Swanson. Mr. Cmich, a Republican, of course, served 20 years and was widely respected.
But there was another side to Mr. Horn, that would not be acceptable in newsrooms today. In the 1950's he banned the name of the Democratic Mayor, Charles Babcock, from the paper, referring to him as "a city official."
Mr. Hanke says as a young reporter, Mr. Horn spiked one of his stories that made the Republican Mayor look wrong on a revenue-sharing issue. Mr. Hopper's editorial on the four students killed at Kent State was also spiked. It was replaced by Mr. Horn's own editorial that was supportive of the National Guard, which was sent to the campus by Mr. Horn's political ally and friend, Governor Rhodes, to keep order at a university where Mr. Horn was a member of the board.
"Has anyone read anything that makes the tax-cut plan close to viable?" asked Mr. Smith, the publisher.
"No and I've looked," said Mr. Hanke.
Mr. Kaminski had a question for the publisher. "Let me ask you. Do you feel, as the operator of our business, that this administration has been a problem? Is it difficult to do business under Clinton?"
"The answer," said Mr. Smith, "is in the results and the truth of it is, it's not. The last couple of years have been better than the early 90's. A lot of folks I talk to are supporting Dole, but will say on the side, 'I can take a couple of more years like the last couple.' Just look at the companies here. Hoover's doing O.K., thank you. Diebold's making big profits, Timken's doing all sorts of expansion."
"We're looking at another record quarter for Timken," said Mr. Kaminski, adding that Ed Semmler, the business editor, "was pitching it" for page 1 at the morning news meeting.
In 1980, a new publisher, Mr. Siam, was brought in by the Thomson chain. He picked as his editor Mr. Hanke, a Canton native and Notre Dame graduate, who was only 30 at the time but had worked almost every job on the paper. Mr. Siam was impressed by Mr. Hanke's intellect, his sense of fairness and his feelings for Canton. Indeed, in the 16 years since, Mr. Hanke had many chances to climb the Thomson corporate ladder, but chose to stay. He is the kind of editor who issues as few orders as possible. On primary night last March, he was at the board of elections with his political reporters, helping them download results from their computers.
"I'm one of the luckiest guys you'll meet," said Mr. Hanke, the son of a union construction worker. "I'm editor of my hometown newspaper." His goal was to make The Repository the best paper of its size in Ohio. "I thought it would take just a few years," he said.
Shortly after taking over, Mr. Siam and Mr. Hanke recall being asked by some Republican Party leaders to lunch at Bender's, the favorite downtown political hangout. "We went upstairs and sat down," said Mr. Hanke, "They wanted a political contribution to the Republicans. I was steamed, but Siam didn't say anything for a while. We had a few drinks, then Siam said, 'I'm sorry, we don't do that.' Afterwards we were walking back to the paper and I said, 'I can't believe that.' And he said, 'Mike it's their job to ask, it's my job to say no.' "
For the first time candidates were invited to come in and make their case on why they should be endorsed -- both Republicans and Democrats. Mr. Hanke wrote Editor & Publisher, the industry's trade publication, and had the paper's affliation switched from "Republican" to "Independent."
In 1996 the paper has endorsed a few more Democrats than Republicans for office; in 1994, more Republicans.
The entire editorial staff is only 65 people, including clerks and secretaries, so each new hire has been precious. There were many who had given years of service and couldn't be let go, but couldn't adapt to a modern newspaper, either.
"I'd move people aside who couldn't do the job and let them keep their titles," said Mr. Hanke, "then I'd put in more talented people with lesser titles to do the job."
They went hunting for young, aggressive reporters. At a suburban meeting one night, Mr. Hanke found the paper's star projects reporter, M. L. Schultze, who worked for a radio station at the time. She was hammering questions at an official during a break while the rest of the press was out having a smoke. For the first time, they sought out talented minority reporters like Charita Goshay, a journalism school graduate who was designing department store windows when the city editor, Rick Senften, found her.
Five years ago The Repository finally cracked the Associated Press awards, finishing third in its category. Three years ago, it was second, and the last two years, first. "It was always my goal," said Mr. Hanke. "It just took so much longer than I thought."
Mr. Hopper said, "I'd say he's earned another four years."
"Dole on the whole has given us nothing to vote for," said Mr. Hanke.
"If he had," said Mr. Kaminiski, "the paper would endorse him."
"If he hadn't said that goofy 15 percent," said the publisher.
"I think of Clinton as a student of history," said Mr. Hanke, "I think he's interested in how he'll be viewed down the road. Because of that I think he'll try very hard to do" things that "will have significant impact in this term."
"Mr. Publisher," Mr. Hanke added, "you have the veto power."
"We have serious concerns about this man," said Mr. Smith, "his lack of character, the integrity of the White House and his appointments. Right?" Mr. Smith wanted the editorial to make some comment on "the political system that gives us candidates we can't get excited about." There was an awkward quiet.
"Maybe it's a subject of other pieces," said Mr. Hanke, and Mr. Hopper said, "You endorse somebody, you endorse them warts and all."
"It's pretty damn sad," said the publisher. "The pre-campaign Dole, we would have endorsed. Ah. . . . geeze."
For all The Repository has improved, there is something that has been lost in communities like Stark with the passing of the Clayton Horns. Mr. Horn was the catalyst for a ruling elite that made things happen. Today, there is a power vacuum in mid-sized Ohio cities like Canton and Dayton and Springfield that is obvious from driving downtown and seeing so many vacant buildings on the main streets.
"Clayt would have done something about those problems," said Mr. Hopper. "He was absolutely fearless in pursuing things for this community."
Today, the newspaper's community causes are safer, like helping fight illiteracy. The Repository's influence comes through its news pages, like its investigative pieces by Ms. Schultze of corruption in local Head Start programs.
Mr. Hanke says, "I hear people say, 'Don't blame Mike, he can't tell his reporters what to do the way Clayt would.' The implication is I don't have the authority. The truth is, I believe an editor's job is to provide an environment so journalists are free to do their jobs."
Mr. Horn, on the other hand, tried to control things to the very end. Two years before he died, he mailed in his advance obituary. "I wrote it myself," he told Mr. Hanke, "because I wanted to get it right, damnit."
"The newspaper will catch hell for this," said Mr. Kaminski.
"Well, Clinton and the Democrats are a hell of a lot more liberal than we are on most issues, right?" said Mr. Smith.
"The Democrats aren't as liberal as they used to be," said Mr. Hanke, "and we're not a Republican paper. I don't think we have been in several years. We're independent people who tend to take the conservative side."
"I'll write a draft," said Mr. Hopper, "and we'll all take a crack at it?"
"Write her up," said Mr. Smith.
Last Sunday, The Plain-Dealer in Democratic Cleveland to the north, endorsed Mr. Clinton and The Dispatch in Republican Columbus to the west, chose Mr. Dole, while the paper of McKinley, Mr. Hanke and Mr. Smith swung Democrat this time.
 
Living midway between Democratic Cleveland and Republican Columbus, the citizens of Canton, Ohio, and surrounding Stark County have a history of voting for the winning Presidential candidate. This is the 34th article in a yearlong series that seeks to explore the forces shaping the political debate at the grass roots.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: RACES FOR GOVERNOR;
A Democrat Is Struggling in a Democratic Haven, West Virginia

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: MARTINSBURG, W.Va., Oct. 28

 BODY:
Charlotte Pritt, the Democratic nominee for governor here, likes to brag of the close relationship she forged with President Clinton during a brief ride on Air Force One a few months ago.
If she is elected and calls the White House to request help for West Virginia, Ms. Pritt assures voters, Mr. Clinton's response will be, "How much, and when do you need it?" 
 Right now it is Ms. Pritt, a former teacher and state senator, who needs Mr. Clinton's help in what is shaping up as the nation's tightest governor's race. Tagged by her Republican opponent as too liberal even for heavily Democratic West Virginia and dogged by feuds with members of her own party, she has seen an early lead disappear and now trails former Gov. Cecil H. Underwood in the race to succeed Gov. Gaston Caperton, a Democrat who has served two terms and is barred by state law from seeking a third.
Mr. Clinton has no plans to do what would help Ms. Pritt most: campaign in West Virginia for her in the race's closing days. Still, Ms. Pritt links herself to Mr. Clinton at every chance, and her best hope is that a wide margin of victory here for the President and other Democrats, including Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, will bring her the votes she needs.
But West Virginia -- one of 11 states electing a governor this year and among the 7 with Democratic incumbents -- ranks, along with Indiana, as one of the best hopes for Republicans to gain a governor's mansion.
The latest statewide poll, conducted Oct. 17-18 by the Mason-Dixon Research polling organization among 822 registered voters who said they were likely to vote, showed Mr. Underwood leading by 48 percent to 43 percent. The poll had a sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
For Mr. Underwood, the race is a chance for a remarkable political resurrection. Elected governor in 1956 at age 34, he was the youngest chief executive in the state's history. Under the state's Constitution at the time, he was barred from seeking a second term in 1960 but ran and lost two later races for governor, in 1964 and 1976.
He will turn 74 on Election Day, and if he wins, he will be West Virginia's oldest governor.
Mr. Underwood has been campaigning as a moderate who can build on the progress that the state -- long ravaged by the decline of coal mining and other industries -- has made in recent years in attracting new industry and reducing unemployment. A former college president who has been active in luring technology companies to West Virginia, he has emphasized reducing regulations on business, cutting state spending and improving education.
He has also raised questions about whether Ms. Pritt, a coal miner's daughter from the heavily unionized southern part of the state, is too beholden to labor and other special interests and would scare away industries considering moving to or expanding in the state.
Ms. Pritt, who is 47, has taken some pro-labor positions, saying she would make state employees eligible for collective bargaining and promising to increase the amount of money that corporations have to pay into the workers' compensation fund.
She argues that her working-class background makes her particularly sensitive to the concerns of working families, and her platform includes a promise of universal access to health care by the end of her second term. Yet she has increased her efforts to moderate her image, portraying herself as a friend of small business and a member of the National Rifle Association.
"When people say business is going to leave because of Charlotte Pritt, well, they don't have a lick of common sense, as my Momma used to say," she said. "I'll be the hardest fighter to keep the good-paying jobs that West Virginia's ever seen."
Although she retains a strong base in the state's southern coal-mining district, she is having a tougher time with moderate Democratic swing voters elsewhere, particularly here in the northeastern panhandle.
She also suffering from a rift she caused in the party establishment. Four years ago, after losing in the Democratic primary to Mr. Caperton, she ran a write-in campaign in the general election that failed but left him furious with her. Still angry, Mr. Caperton has given her only the most tepid support.

MCI Shares Soar on News Of British Telecom Talks
MCI stock rose 20.4 percent in extremely heavy volume as word leaked out that the company was negotiating a merger with British Telecom. The stock was the most active and the largest percentage gainer, rising $5.125 to $30.25. American depository receipts for British Telecom fell $2.125, to $55.50. 
 MCI's rise came on a lackluster day in the market, as traders worried about the election and about the potential for lower corporate profits. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.45 to 6,021.93. [Page 41.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities slipped, as economic reports showed the pace of growth in jobs and manufacturing slowing but not enough to ease investors' concern that inflation could rebound later this year. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.68 percent, up from 6.64 percent Thursday. [41.]
 
G.M. Sales Decline 7.9 Percent; Reich Calls for Strike Settlement
General Motors reported a 7.9 percent decline in vehicle sales last month from a year earlier, even as Chrysler, Honda and Toyota all announced their highest October sales ever. G.M.'s car sales were off 24 percent, but sales of pickup trucks, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles rose 22.1 percent. G.M. executives and U.A.W. leaders continued contract talks, as Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich called for a settlement of the union's three-day strike. [39.]
 
Detroit Seeks Slower Air Bags
The Big Three auto makers asked Federal authorities for permission begin using air bags that inflate more slowly to reduce the risk of neck-injury deaths among children and short adults from rapidly inflating air bags. [1.]
 
High Court Accepts Asbestos Cases
Agreeing to confront the litigation crisis caused by huge numbers of lawsuits over exposure to asbestos, the Supreme Court accepted two cases that will help define how the Federal courts treat the legal claims of people who have been exposed to toxic substances but have not yet become ill. [8.]
 
Longer Hours for German Shops
German retailers tried hard to look happy as the nation's stores were allowed to begin staying open past 6:30 P.M. on weekdays -- but never on Sunday. Privately, however, many small shopkeepers grumbled that longer hours would raise labor costs without increasing sales -- and even give rise to American-style malls. With more families having two wage-earners, consumers have demanded longer shopping hours. [3.]
 
Viacom's Earnings Advance
Viacom said that its operating profits rose 31.7 percent in the third quarter, based on the strength of results from its MTV Networks, Paramount studios and Blockbuster video stores. With a one-time $1.3 billion gain from the sale of its cable systems, net income was $1.4 billion, or $3.82 a share, up from $93.8 million, or 21 cents a share. [38.]
 
Corn and Soybean Futures Fall
Corn and soybean futures prices fell as ideal weather was forecast for this weekend, allowing farmers to harvest bumper crops. Crude oil futures fell to a two-month low, as rising heating oil inventories signaled an end to last month's rally. [40.]
 
Dollar Falls Against Yen and Mark
The dollar fell after Lloyd M. Bentsen, a former Treasury Secretary, said further gains would hurt American competitiveness. The dollar was quoted in New York at 113.31 yen, down from 114.05 late Thursday, and at 1.5145 marks, down from 1.5178. [40.]
 
New York Allows Mace Sales
The sale of Chemical Mace and other self-defense sprays became legal in New York State, and at least one store in Manhattan reported heavy sales. But there was no sign of a widespread stampede. [27.]

HEADLINE: Standing by His Man In Role After Role;
Mickey Kantor, Gutsy Campaigner, Has Smoothed Clinton's Path

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: ASHTABULA, Ohio, Oct. 29

 BODY:
It is midday at the sprawling Pinney Dock, and halfway through a tour of the piles of coal and iron ore moving off the waterfront on Lake Erie, Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor is already spewing the endless statistics that he repeats nonstop from one Congressional district to the next.
Told that companies in this northeastern corner of Ohio are badly in need of better trained recruits, he goes into a familiar patter. "We've created 2.6 million new jobs a year -- higher than job growth under President Reagan, and, as you know, much higher than under President Bush" -- and tells local newspaper and television reporters that the Republican incumbent in the district has obstructed every effort in Washington to improve worker training. 
 Spotting raw materials headed for nearby auto plants, Mr. Kantor cites "the 900,000 people now directly employed in the autos and auto-parts sector, the highest figure since the 1960's," and then, barely pausing for breath, races through a review of Ohio's export surge: "Twenty-two billion dollars! Up from just $15 billion when this President took office!"
Even the Democratic candidate Mr. Kantor has come to endorse, Thomas J. Coyne, who is Mayor of a nearby town, seems a bit stunned by the numerical blitz. He tells Mr. Kantor that it's too bad he missed the local pig roast the previous weekend. "On Tuesday we'll roast something else," Mr. Kantor shoots back.
If the Clinton Administration has run a perpetual campaign for the last four years, no one has pursued the strategy with more vigor than Mickey Kantor. First as United States trade representative, and since last spring as Commerce Secretary, following the death of Ronald H. Brown, he has fine-tuned the ancient Washington art of using trade accords to benefit the political fortunes of the President. Expansive and insistent, by turns charming and combative, he has talked for four years about the need to open markets. But his critics, who are particularly plentiful in Canada, Mexico, Japan and China, make a strong case that he is never shy about turning to protectionism if that is the best way to mollify a key constituency or defuse anger against the Administration in a key electoral battleground.
This is, after all, a man who keeps two telephones on his desk, one for official business and the other a private line, which he pays for himself, for endless political strategizing. "I once saw him talking on both at the same time," one of his former aides and admirers recalled recently. "And that's the real Mickey: total fusion."
He has kept the flow of low-priced Mexican tomatoes to Florida in check, using the threat of trade sanctions against Mexico to quiet the complaints of growers in a state that until a few months ago Mr. Clinton appeared to have little chance of winning. The growers are still unlikely to support Mr. Clinton, but they have not organized against him.
Late last year, he moved to suspend a provision of the North American Free Trade Agreement that would have allowed Mexican trucks to rove through Texas and California. His argument: Inspections show many of the trucks are unsafe, and many are laden with hidden caches of drugs. But the delay, which continues, in letting them into the country had a convenient side benefit for truckers in two of the most electoral-vote-rich states in the country.
Long before most Americans were focused on the 1996 campaign, Mr. Kantor, working from the trade representative's building across from the White House, was overseeing deals on wheat and softwood lumber that quieted discontent in the Midwest and Northwest, even though the solution in both cases imposed quotas that amounted to highly managed trade.
And Mr. Kantor's most high-profile trade battle -- a bruising dust-up with Japan over autos and auto parts that consumed him during the first half of 1995 -- has had a not entirely coincidental payoff. It helped win back the support of labor leaders who were outraged at him after he pushed through the Administration's two biggest free-trade deals, Nafta and the worldwide trade accord that established a new and powerful world trade organization.
"Nafta's come and gone," George Becker, the international president of the United Steelworkers of America, said while campaigning in Pennsylvania with Mr. Kantor. "We've come to understand each other."
Mr. Kantor insists that in each of these cases good trade policy came before good politics. He committed himself to solving the tomato problem, he notes, years before anyone could know that President Clinton had a shot at winning Florida. He said it would have been "foolishness" to allow unsafe trucks in to the country. And "there was no politics in the auto deal," he said, which arose from "a clear vision that the inability to get cars and car parts into Japan was a symbol of our past failures" in trade policy.
"To be successful at this you need to be political without being partisan," he concluded. "But are there incidental political benefits in opening markets and creating jobs? You bet there are."
Mr. Kantor's political skills have been taxed this last week. As he campaigned, his department was enmeshed in the controversy over John Huang, the Asian-American who held a midlevel job in the Commerce Department until last December, when he moved to the Democratic National Committee as its chief fund-raiser in the Asian-American community. Several of those contributions now appear to have been illegal, and Commerce has been beseiged with demands from Congress and the media for a full accounting of Mr. Huang's actions at Commerce, particularly his apparently limited role in policy making.
Mr. Huang was gone from Commerce before Mr. Kantor arrived. Still, the Commerce Secretary has found himself in the uncomfortable position of handing over documents that have kept the story alive -- to the annoyance of White House officials who have been trying to contain the damage. Moving through Ohio and Pennsylvania the other day while keeping up with the disclosures by phone, it was clear he was unhappy.
In Mr. Clinton's economic war room, while Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has played the role of the quiet, unflappable master strategist who has watched the charts and kept the troops from wandering away from the message of deficit-cutting, Mr. Kantor has been the fiery tactician. When he showed up in Geneva to negotiate the car accord with Japan, he brought along a bamboo sword used in kendo, a highly ritualized form of Japanese fencing, and presented it to Ryutaro Hashimoto, then the trade minister, now Japan's Prime Minister.
Mr. Kantor's detractors say he has often sliced and diced reality in advancing the Administration's cause.
Robert Lighthizer, trade adviser to the Dole campaign, recently called Mr. Kantor's record "a terribly failed policy" that has left the country with economic anxiety.
"The merchandise trade deficit last year was the worst in history, and this year it will be worse yet -- and twice what it was when the President came to power in 1993," Mr. Lighthizer said. "We've seen a loss of manufacturing jobs and stagnant wages."
Moreover, he said, "our trading partners are treating us like patsies," singling out China as particularly successful in avoiding real penalties for its trade practices. But Bob Dole has made only scant reference to trade in the campaign; a speech on the subject he was said to be preparing never materialized.
Mr. Kantor, who ran Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign, shrugs off the partisan attacks. "It is critical that we build confidence among the American public that we are going to stand by them and make sure that our competitors play by the same rules that we have to play by," he said during his trip to Ohio and Pennsylvania. "That is in my head all the time. And if that helps the President, well there's no shame in that."
Most trade experts agree that Mr. Kantor has racked up a considerable number of accomplishments; the auto deal with Japan has been more successful than American executives expected, even though Tokyo has opened only a fraction of the American car dealerships Mr. Kantor said it would.
Mr. Kantor's defenders point out that the Commerce Department and the trade representative's office have frequently been occupied by political loyalists. Robert S.Strauss, a former Democratic Party chairman, was President Jimmy Carter's trade representative, and William E. Brock, a former Republican chairman, was President Ronald Reagan's. Hanging outside Mr. Kantor's door at the Commerce Department is a portrait of one of his predecessors, Harry L. Hopkins, who was Franklin D. Roosevelt's closest confidante and who, like Mr. Kantor, was charged with both placating the business community and neutralizing it as a potent political opposition.
The parallel is not lost on Mr. Kantor. Everywhere he goes campaigning these days -- Detroit, Phoenix, Seattle, Miami and Newark -- he points out that if Mr. Clinton is elected to a second term on Tuesday, he will be the first Democrat to pull off the feat since F.D.R.
"You have to conclude that Kantor has been enormously skillful at measuring the climate," said I. M. Destler, a University of Maryland trade expert who has just finished a study of the workings of the National Economic Council, an institution the Clinton Administration invented to move economic issues to center stage in the White House. "The first two years were all about market openings, and he closed big deals. And the next two were about political holding actions," strategic retrenchments to make sure that neither workers nor corporate chiefs felt that the Administration was sacrificing them to some ideal of free trade.
"I'm not a free trader," Mr. Kantor happily admitted at a breakfast with reporters in Washington a few weeks ago. "A lot of our agreements have been regulated trade agreements. The goal is to nurture American workers and industry. It is not to adhere to some kind of strict ideology. That would be the height of foolishness."
It is still unclear what role Mr. Clinton's loyalist might play if Mr. Clinton wins a second term. It is unlikely to be at Commerce, a job Mr. Kantor resisted when the President was looking to quickly fill the post after Mr. Brown's death. Mr. Kantor's associates say he agreed only to fill out the term.
When Mr. Kantor relaxes after a long day of stumping for Democratic candidates, he concedes that running the Commerce Department, a lumbering barge of 36,000 employees, is too managerial for his temperament. He clearly misses the informal collegiality of the trade representative's office, which has a staff of 200 and is among the more efficient corners of the Federal Government.
"As the trade representative, I could delve into the middle of every issue and either get the base hit or not," he said recently. "At Commerce, you can't do that. I've had to learn to control my need to dive into every detail. It's the difference between being a manager and a player."
Now the question is whether Mr. Kantor will be a manager or a player in a second term, should Mr. Clinton win. There is talk of Attorney General and of White House chief of staff, a job Mr. Kantor desired four years ago. Now a bit calmer, and more familiar with the chaos of the White House, he seems torn about his next move and could end up once again practicing law.
"I'm totally focused on Nov. 5," he said. "On Nov. 6, I'll worry about what's next."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE RUNNING MATE;
On Stump, Gore Shows a New Touch in Connecting With Crowds

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 1

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore, whose boxy shoulders and predilection for polysyllabic earnestness have often made him seem like a kind of uptight Mr. Rogers, looks relaxed these days. No, really.
Mr. Gore is loping through a fast-paced but low-pressure campaign sweep in the last days before the election, mainly intended to help local Congressional candidates. 
 By all appearances, he is having a ball -- whether jabbing at the Republican-controlled Congress, working the pep-rally crowds that his advance teams assemble on college campuses or kidding with reporters on the Vice-Presidential plane.
But it is also a side of the Vice President that most people have not seen. In his previous campaigns, for Vice President in 1992 or for President in 1988, his speeches were more often noted for their awkwardness, or for diffidence. In his debate last month with the Republican Vice-Presidential nominee, Jack Kemp, Mr. Gore was soft-spoken and polite.
Speaking today at an outdoor rally at Faneuil Hall in Boston, Mr. Gore shouted and punched his fist into the gray sky, railing against the Republicans in Congress.
"They march in lockstep," he told the crowd. "They don't vary. They all hold hands, and they jump off the cliff together,"
He jokes about things he always has, like his supposedly stiff demeanor, and about things he often has not, including the notion of one day being President himself. To judge by the audience, the jokes are hitting home.
At an outdoor speech on a Galveston, Tex., pier on Thursday, Mr. Gore at one point gestured to the seal of the Vice Presidency that adorns the front of his podium.
"If you look at that seal and close your left eye and hold your head just right, it says, 'President of the United States,' " Mr. Gore said. The partisan crowd of more than 1,000 roared approval. "It gives me a thrill every time I do it," Mr. Gore added.
Several forces explain the Vice President's newfound loose limbs: the Democrats are leading in the polls by comfortable margins, and Mr. Gore is drawing substantial crowds with many who have come to see him in particular. At most stops, at least one or two signs or a shout from the audience suggest a Gore Presidential bid in 2000.
But campaign aides offer an additional explanation. They say Mr. Gore's final campaigning week is revealing how much he has learned at Mr. Clinton's side over the last four years.
"These two men are great students of each other," said Robert Squier, the Clinton-Gore campaign's media consultant, who was traveling with the Vice President this week. "One of the things that Gore draws from Clinton is an understanding of how important connecting is in politics, not just speaking to them, but connecting."
But Mr. Squier said the Clinton influence is subtle, as in its effect on Mr. Gore's timing.
When the Vice President tells a joke or makes a point, Mr. Squier said, there is often now a half-beat pause that was absent four years ago, or even before this campaign. The pause, to Mr. Squier's media-conscious eye, shows a new confidence Mr. Gore has in himself.
"He makes the audience come to him," Mr. Squier said.
But along with that relaxed posture, and in many ways in contrast to it, is a tightly controlled campaign that longtime Gore watchers say is far more scripted than some of his past campaigns.
Mr. Gore's relaxed style sometimes seems like a role he is playing while the old Al Gore stands at attention somewhere beneath.
At the New Zion Baptist Church in Louisville, Ky., for a packed service last Sunday afternoon, Mr. Gore began, as he often does, with a patter of parody about his own stiffness.
Within 15 minutes, most of the people who heard those jokes were shaking their heads at the contradiction because Mr. Gore was shouting with the hoarse growl of a bluesman.
Much as the gospel choir had just done before his speech, he modulated his voice down into the lower registers, keeping it at a monotone until the tension rose, then broke out, whooping a message of civic involvement, couched in the language of the prophet Ezekiel.
"Every time someone is suffering or persecuted, let there be another standing with them -- let it be you, let it be me!" Mr. Gore shouted. The congregation began responding, echoing Mr. Gore's phrases and affirming them, as they just had with their pastor.
"He was preaching," said one trustee, Aaron Carter.
But then, like a switch, the growl and the fire were shut off. "On this occasion, thank you for the opportunity to be in your church," Mr. Gore said quietly in conclusion, reverting to form.
Sometimes the old Al Gore seems itching for a comeback. In Albuquerque, N.M., on Tuesday night, for example, he began his speech at the University of New Mexico with a rhapsody about the value of technology research.
The boredom level rose among the high school marching bands invited to perform.s.
But then the arm-waving, gravel-voiced Preacher Gore returned with a tirade against the Republican challenger Bob Dole's proposal to eliminate the Department of Energy that finances much of the New Mexican research economy.
The students were back, waving and cheering.

HEADLINE: Auto Makers Seek to Reduce the Danger of Air Bags' Impact

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1

 BODY:
Chrysler, Ford and General Motors have asked the Federal safety authorities for emergency permission to switch to air bags that inflate more slowly, seeking to reduce the risk of neck-injury deaths among infants, children and short adults when air bags inflate at up to 200 miles an hour.
The auto makers said today they would begin installing such bags within months in cars sold in Canada, where no Government permission is needed. They also said they would work harder to teach adults to keep children in the back seat. 
 Since 1990 about 30 children, including infants, have died when they were struck by passenger-side airbags, which are only now coming into common use. Safety officials say the number of such deaths is likely to rise rapidly unless something is done, because passenger-side airbags are nearly universal on new cars now.
But the officials stressed that about 1,100 lives had been saved by air bags since they came into wider use. The auto makers said that they had no research on how much the slower air bags would cut the casualty rate, but that they thought slowing the inflation speed of bags by 25 percent would help. They said the bags would probably not reduce the safety factor for average-sized adults, for whom they were designed.
The slower air bags would be very similar to the ones used today, but with less of the explosive propellant that inflates them. They are not expected to cost any more than the current ones. Switching over will take some time but the first ones could be on the road in Canada in a few months, said Andrew H. Card Jr., the president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, who represented the companies.
The auto makers cannot use them in the United States until the standard is changed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. An agency spokesman, Tim Hurd, said the companies' petition would be answered "soon," but he would not elaborate.
Mr. Card, who was Transportation Secretary in the Bush Administration, said he had approved the air bag rules now in force. They are based on protecting a 165-pound man of median height who is not wearing a seatbelt and who is in a frontal collision at 30 miles an hour.
At the time Mr. Card approved the regulations -- on Dec. 14, 1992, he recalled today -- only about 15 percent of front-seat passengers were using belts, but now the number is about 67 percent. In Canada it is 90 to 95 percent, he said.
An air bag that opens 25 percent more slowly would provide the same level of protection to belted occupants, Mr. Card said. In a study of "real-world crashes" of unbelted occupants, the depowered air bags would have been sufficient, he said.
"We're saying the crash test for the unbelted dummy does not best reflect what's happening in the real world," Mr. Card said.
According to safety engineers, the current air bags can injure babies in infant seats that keep them too close to the dashboard, or children who are wearing the lap belts but slip the shoulder belts behind them. The airbags may hit some short adults too hard and too high.
"The injury that smaller-statured individuals seem to die of mimics a hanging," Mr. Card said. "Basically it's a broken neck."
He said the three auto companies would write to the owners of all 22 million vehicles with passenger-side air bags and remind them not to seat children or infants in the front, and would put additional warning labels in new cars, beyond the ones already used, which are often tucked away on the sun visors or in a part of the passenger compartment visible only when the passenger door is open.
Mr. Card said today that the auto makers' education campaign would teach people "how to sit in the car, how to buckle up, and how to respect an air bag." The National Transportation Safety Board recently called for better labels and an education campaign, and predicted a sharp increase in the number of children killed by air bags as they became standard on the passenger side.
In the long term, safety experts want "smart" air bags that would sense the stature of the person in the passenger seat and vary their speed of inflation. But "it's not likely that a breakthrough technology will be on the market until well into the turn of the century," Mr. Card said, because of the need for testing.
Ricardo Martinez, who heads the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said in a statement that he applauded the industry for sending letters to the owners of vehicles with passenger-side air bags. And a spokesman at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, Stephen L. Oesch, said, "We are very supportive of the action they've taken today."
In high-speed crashes that kill the driver or passenger, said Mr. Oesch of the insurance institute, the problem is not the air bag -- it is that the crash crushes the structure of the vehicle. The auto makers, he said, should be allowed "more design freedom" to develop bags to work well with people big and small.
Joan Claybrook, a former Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the president of Public Citizen, a watchdog group founded by Ralph Nader, also applauded the auto makers' decision to send letters but said the long-term solution was smart airbags, "including two-stage deployment with slower deployment at lower speeds."
"This needs to be put into production as soon as possible," she said.

HEADLINE: Contract Settlement Averts Wider Strike At General Motors

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Saturday, Nov. 2

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union announced an agreement early this morning on a new three-year labor contract, averting a national strike against the world's largest auto maker and likely bringing to an end the greatest labor unrest in the American automobile industry since 1970.
Negotiators did not settle a three-day strike by two local unions, but a resolution of those walkouts seems likely very soon. 
 The deal, which is subject to a ratification vote by 215,000 G.M. workers, bears a strong resemblance to contracts that the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation have already signed with the U.A.W. The contracts are intended to make the Detroit auto makers' stop the long shrinkage of their work forces while still letting them reduce their labor costs and compete more effectively with non-union factories that Japanese and European auto makers have built in the South.
Each auto maker agreed to keep overall employment close to current levels, although with a few escape clauses, such as in case of recession. The employment guarantees slightly reduce the incentive for auto makers to rely on outside suppliers, since they will have to pay their workers anyway.
The union even gave the auto makers an incentive to hire more workers, by allowing them to pay somewhat lower wages in any auto parts industries they may enter. Ford has already begun a broad review of what parts can now be manufactured in-house to make use of the lower wages.
But the auto makers, notably G.M. and Ford, gained a little more flexibility this autumn to sell a handful of unprofitable auto parts factories. And while the union won wage increases that will exceed the inflation rate by a couple percentage points a year, it was not as aggressive in demanding pay increases as it has been in some previous labor contracts negotiated during prosperous times in the auto industry.
Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W.'s president, announced the new labor contract at about 2 A.M., saying: "We have it. We're happy about it."
The Canadian Automobile Workers, a separate union, has already reached deals with Chrysler and G.M. and is trying to reach an agreement with Ford by next Monday. A short strike there cannot be ruled out, but few industry experts expect a prolonged walkout.
So while there may still be a few isolated walkouts at G.M. factories in the months' ahead, today's agreement seems likely to end months of conflict that pitted a more militant American labor movement against the nation's biggest companies in a struggle over corporate downsizing and outsourcing. G.M. is the nation's biggest company in terms of sales, while Ford is the second largest and Chrysler is the ninth largest.
G.M.'s sprawling empire of assembly plants and auto parts factories, which produce a little over 1 percent of the nation's economic output, has suffered three massive strikes this year. A 17-day strike last March at two brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, forced G.M. to close most of its North American assembly plants and temporarily lay off 177,000 workers.
A three-week strike by G.M.'s Canadian workers that ended on Oct. 23 also produced heavy layoffs, as severe shortages of auto parts idled many American factories. G.M. said today that 19,000 of its American workers still have not been able to return to their jobs because of the lingering effects of that strike.
The latest strike, and potentially the most costly of all, began on Tuesday evening when 7,500 U.A.W. workers walked out at G.M.'s most profitable assembly plant and at one of its most important truck parts factory. Because G.M.'s truck factories have been running at full speed and have scant supplies of spare parts, the latest strike quickly affected other operations. G.M. closed four highly profitable assembly plants that make pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, and idled another 11,000 workers. Outside companies that make parts for G.M. also began temporarily laying off thousands of workers.
Auto analysts put G.M. combined losses from these strikes at about $1.3 billion in foregone after-tax profits. By comparison, only 46 publicly traded American companies earned more than $1.3 billion in all of 1995, a year of record corporate profits. The strikes have also cost the Federal Government as much as $600 million in taxes that G.M. would have paid on these profits.
G.M. may recoup half its losses by asking workers to put in a lot of overtime in the months ahead, Wall Street experts said.
Tonight's settlement came after Labor Secretary Robert E. Reich had publicly urged both sides today to strike an agreement. Mr. Reich said that Labor Department officials had tried to "make sure that all parties know that there is a national interest at stake, that we hope and encourage them to reach a settlement."
But it was unclear that Mr. Reich's efforts had affected the timing of tonight's deal. Labor Department officials also told union leaders and company executives that Federal mediators were available if needed. But both sides' negotiators declined the offer, following an auto industry tradition in which union and company officials have prefered for decades to deal with each other with no outsiders present.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Shaving Fares On the Shuttle

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
LAST summer, I spent a lot of time trying to find a cheap shuttle trip to Boston, a daunting task because the advertised shuttle fares represent perhaps the highest per-mile rate in the country, a result of the predominance of business travelers in the Northeast corridor. But I knew there were weekend discounts and I had a couple of coupons. There was also the possibility of an airline senior coupon book that could mean a cheaper fare if I needed to take the trip more than once in a year.
My experience indicates it is worthwhile to shop for a shuttle ticket and, most particularly, to avoid going to the airport ticketless, because the walk-up fare is the highest. There is some irony in that, because when the shuttle began more than 30 years ago, the point was that travelers could go at any hour and pay a standard fare. 
 The gimmick was, and in the East still is, that one passenger in line for a flight can theoretically end up on an otherwise empty new plane if the preceding one is full; as long as there are passengers -- meaning more than one these days -- the airlines roll out the planes. Delta reports having put on as many as 22 extra sections in a day. The shuttles run by six airlines in the busy corridor between San Francisco and Los Angeles do not do this: a traveler waits until the next scheduled departure.
For the Boston-New York-Washington shuttles, as this article went to press, both Delta and USAir were advertising one-way weekday fares of $173 each way between New York and Boston or New York and Washington. (All fares cited exclude a $3 airport departure charge.) This fare reflects an increase that went into effect at the end of August when the 10 percent Federal tax resumed.
Amtrak offers no stable benchmark, since it is now adapting its fares to demand. However, if one plans ahead of time, the cheapest ticket on a conventional train from New York to Washington is $60 one way. The best price on a weekday Metroliner is $106 and on a weekend Metroliner, $88. The cheapest New York-Boston fare is $43.
 
 
 
Saving Money but Not Time
 Train trips are longer: three hours on the Metroliner between New York and Washington; at least 20 minutes more on conventional trains. The New York-Boston run takes at least four and a half hours. Where you arrive also affects travel time: Penn Station, Union Station and South Station are all downtown and on subway systems; getting out of the airports takes longer.
All the flights take roughly an hour. Delta leaves on the half-hour from the Marine Terminal at La Guardia, Logan Airport in Boston and National in Washington, starting at 6:30 A.M. weekdays (6:45 from Washington because of a noise curfew). The last flights are at 9:30 P.M. weekdays, except those from New York to Washington, which end at 9. Weekend schedules start an hour later and end an hour earlier.
USAir's flights leave on the hour from the USAir terminal at La Guardia, Logan and National. They start on weekdays at 6:30 A.M. from New York and Boston, with the next flights at 7 A.M. The last Boston-New York and New York-Boston departures are 10 P.M. The Washington starting hour is 7 A.M. and the last flight from there is at 9 P.M.
Delta bought the Pan American Shuttle in 1991. The Eastern Air Lines Shuttle, which began it all in 1961, became the Trump Shuttle; its operation was taken over by USAir in 1992 although the USAir Shuttle company is separate from USAir.
My fun began with a free booklet called NY96 Funpass, published by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority with the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, which expired Aug. 31; a new version is planned for next year. I learned that with the fancy Metropass in this booklet one could purchase a Delta Shuttle ticket for travel all day Saturday or Sunday at $80 the round trip. I called the 800 number and the agents eventually found the data, which doomed the project: The trip must begin in Washington or Boston. The agent explained that the idea was to bring people into New York City, not send them away.
Another coupon booklet, called Manhattan Today, leads off with a page for the USAir Shuttle. This coupon allows discount travel at slower weekday periods: flights at 11 A.M., noon, 1 and 2 P.M. and 9 and 10 P.M. The coupon in the current booklet, valid until Jan. 31, offers a fare of $77 each way, $154 for the required round-trip purchase. If you add the $5 cost of the booklet, for a total of $159, and use the ticket going in only one direction, you can still beat the $173 regular fare. On a round trip, it's a winner: $159 vs. $346. It's worth noting that this coupon says "standby only," meaning that USAir will not roll out a new plane for you.
The $5 Manhattan Today booklet, which contains restaurant and store coupons for New York as well as the USAir coupon, can be ordered by phone with a credit card at (800) 685-6760. The booklet is published every four months; the current booklet covers Oct. 1 to Jan. 31. The people at the USAir information number, (800) 428-4322, seemed confused about it, but Terry V. Hallcom, chairman of the USAir Shuttle, said the coupon was intended simply to be taken to the airport.

 
 
Weekend Fares
 Setting aside coupons, I examined weekend shuttle fares. This is a thicket.
Delta and USAir both have an "off peak" weekend walkup fare of $79 one way, excluding airport charges, no round-trip purchase required. It is valid all day Saturday, and on Sunday until 2:30 P.M. on Delta and until 3 P.M. on USAir.
Both airlines have another one-way weekend fare, currently $51, which requires purchase three days in advance. It is valid all day Saturday and until 11:30 A.M. Sunday on Delta and noon on USAir. This fare went up a notch at the end of summer, but on Delta the traveler may now take along one child 12 or younger free.
Delta and USAir also have two restricted advance-purchase fares that require a round-trip purchase. The 14-day advance purchase costs $144 round trip and requires a Saturday-night stay. The seven-day advance purchase costs $176 round trip, with no Saturday-night stay required. These tickets are valid in the slow midday hours, after 7 P.M. Monday to Friday and all day Saturday or Sunday.
In addition, both companies have coupon booklets providing discounts for travelers aged 12 to 24 or those over 62. A book of four coupons, each valid for a shuttle flight, costs $227, or about $57 a flight; a book of eight costs $418, or about $52 a flight.

 
 
Few Solo Flights
 Do Delta and the USAir Shuttle still roll out a vast empty plane for a passenger who cannot get aboard the chosen flight? Very seldom, Mr. Hallcom said. It makes better economic sense, he said, to put angry USAir passengers into a cab to Delta and let them take a flight leaving in half an hour.
And my Boston trip? The shuttle flight I took cost yet another amount -- $115 one way, known as an "unpublished" fare, meaning it was negotiated with Delta by the travel agent for my employer. And that is another issue.

HEADLINE: Airline Dining, No Soup to No Nuts

BYLINE: By RALPH SCHOENSTEIN; RALPH SCHOENSTEIN's latest book is "Superman and Son" (Rutgers).

 BODY:
DIETING ALOFT was already rampant in late 1995 when American Airlines discovered that it could save $100,000 a year by removing one olive from each salad it served to its passengers. But this was just the tip of the iceberg lettuce, for other airlines have gone far beyond merely deregulating salad: they have been canceling whole meals in the hope that passengers have eaten in the terminal.
Last summer the Air Transport Association revealed that this country's airlines now were spending only $4.45 on meals per passenger, $1.15 less than they had spent in 1992, and the decrease is accelerating. Is the next step frequent-fasting miles? 
 Considering blood sugar a frill, United Airlines now serves just a beverage on flights up to 889 miles, unless the flight is during a traditional mealtime, and many longer trips are broken into two legs, neither of which qualifies for a meal. It is now possible to travel for 12 hours and feel that you are preparing to take monastic vows.
There is, of course, a sunnier way to look at no pie in the sky.
"Airline food has always been awful," said Peter Bauer of Miami, president of Youngone America sportswear company, "and now it's gotten both worse and less."
Does not less of worse produce a happy double negative for America's travelers?
For many, yes, but alas not for me: I have always loved airline food, a confession that belongs on a talk show about eating disorders. Some small genetic flaw in me -- the scientific name is bad taste -- has left me unable to discriminate between food that is served in Paris and food that is served in Federal prisons.
Many years ago in a mess hall at Fort Dix, I was actually heard to say, "This food is pretty good," a comment that my comrades felt was an attempt at a discharge for insanity. When I left the Army, I replaced the mess hall with railroad and airline food; a grand sweep of transportational tastelessness was calling to me.
Often I was lured to Philadelphia by the custards at the 30th Street Station, for my favorite dish has always been food that is either intentionally custard or drifting that way. And on airlines flying domestic routes, I used to find myself sitting with my wife and one or two of my daughters when a flight attendant brought us dishes that defied identification.
"Pass everything that isn't green to Dad," my wife would say, and I received a cornucopia of potential food.
Now, however, like millions of other travelers, I have to buy my own imitation food in the terminal instead of having the airline serve it to me.
To airline analysts, it was inevitable that passengers would become stratospheric Oliver Twists.
"After losing more than $13 billion from 1990 to 1994, the industry was desperate to cut costs," said David Swierenga, the Air Transport Association's chief economist. And Lee Howard, president of Airline Economics International, a consulting firm in Georgia, said, "The big airlines all learned from Southwest, which never made a pretext of serving anything but peanuts or cookies."
"The peanuts!" said Caroline Feller, who flies more than 100,000 miles every year to set up reading programs in libraries around the world. "It couldn't have been hard for the airlines to remove the taste from meat, but peanuts must've been a real challenge. You know, I once actually mailed a whole meal back to an airline."
"At the junk mail rate, I presume," I said. "But Caroline, it's still a very mixed situation -- for people with taste, that is; I'm not talking about myself. I mean, it is a blessing when your intake of cardboard goes down. Wasn't it Aristotle who said, 'Less is more'? "
"Aristotle never flew American from Miami to Dallas," she said, "when even first class has no meal. And then I switch planes in Dallas and miss the evening service."
"The evening service," I replied, "should be a prayer for all passengers who forget to eat in the terminal."
"The only way to beat it is to fly first class to Asia. Then you get the caviar and pressed duck. The hunger project operates only in the United States."
If Caroline wants to upgrade nuts, she should fly Continental, where a woman named Miss Loberto (she wanted the rest of her name kept confidential) told me, "We've recently gone back to our original peanuts. The original Coke, too."
"Any original things I can slice?" I asked her.
"We're always considering changes in our food service."
At most airlines today, a change in the food service means ending it.
"The public asked us to eliminate the food," said Cindy Reeds in customer relations at Delta. "About a year and a half ago, we took a survey of a thousand passengers -- all types of people -- and they said they wanted lower fares, so we got rid of the meals."
"Lindbergh would have admired their toughness," I said. "He ate only half a sandwich on a whole Paris flight -- and it wasn't served."
The flying public, however, seems to be of two minds, for another woman at Continental told me, "So many people have been calling to say, 'You're not feeding us.' But they do love their fares. And recently we did start using fresh bread."
"Instead of stale?" I said.
"No, frozen. The taste wasn't too good."
"Even in boom times before deregulation," said Mr. Howard, "when the only competition was in amenities, airline food was often poor. USAir, for example, always served very little."
"So it's been an easy transition," I said "to serve even less."
"They're down to raisins and Ry-Krisp. The bargain-hunting public is controlling this thing. Business people on expense accounts will still want to eat, but they'll have to look hard for the food."
"Somewhere outside the plane."
 THE great jettisoning of food has led to delicious -- you'll pardon the word -- irony: on the Internet, American Airlines is now offering a cookbook of the meals it is trying not to serve. The airline's hope seems to be that passengers will eat these meals at home and then fly, reversing the usual sequence and using the plane just for digestion.
But no cookbook can distract a traveler from the fact that United States airlines, which, says the Air Transport Association, saved $368 million last year by cutting meals, are soaring to new levels of competitive deprivation.
"Passengers used to have a choice of three or four hot meals, but now they're lucky to get a roll with a slice of ham or turkey" on shorter trips, I was told by one flight attendant at United.
What might the future of flying be?
Perhaps one day, I will go out to JFK for a flight to Los Angeles that will cost $14.95 or 10 subway tokens, if I buy my ticket at least a half-hour before takeoff. When I enter the plane I find no flight attendants, for passengers voted to get rid of them. They voted to get rid of the copilot too and replace him with something from the Sharper Image.
At cruising altitude I walk to the rear of the plane, where the pilot is slapping a candy vending machine.
"There's just no maintenance on these things," he says. "Maintenance was such a nice frill."

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
In Mexico, Bargains As the Peso Slides On

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
TWO years ago, one peso was worth 30 American cents. Today it is the equivalent of about 13 cents. As a result, Mexico has become a moveable feast of bargains. Hotels, taxis, restaurants, movies, picnic food, handicrafts and many other vacation accouterments now cost far less than in the United States.
"I had no idea the values would be so dramatic," said Vincent Davis, an engineering student from California who came south this year planning to travel for three months and stayed for six because rambling around Mexico has turned out to be so cheap. 
 The devaluation of the Mexican peso, which began with a crash in December 1994, has continued as an intermittent slide, most recently by losing 3 percent of its value against the dollar last month. Inflation has raised consumer prices here during 1995 and 1996 by about 75 percent, making daily life for the average Mexican worker painfully austere. But for travelers paying in dollars, the effects of the advantageous exchange rate have far outstripped inflation.
"Hotels are a real bargain now," said H. H. Felsted, the editor of a travel newsletter, Mexican Meandering, published in Austin, Tex. Last month he and his wife traveled to San Antonio, where they stayed in a Holiday Inn for $89 a night. In contrast, they later went to the northern Mexico city of Monterrey, where they stayed in the Hotel Rio, a tidy, modern establishment with a swimming pool. There the Felsteds paid a weekend rate of $45 a night, although the Hotel Rio's rates rise to $57 on weeknights.
Prices of some luxury hotels are also lower now than two years ago, even though most have always priced their rooms in dollars. A standard room at the Hotel Camino Real in Mexico City's Polanco district cost $180 before the 1994 devaluation. Today the same room goes for $160.
Other luxury hotels have not cut their rates. And when the high season begins on Dec. 21, many hotels will hike prices by 50 to 100 percent. In January 1995, a standard room in the luxurious Ritz-Carlton in Cancun cost $245. Today it costs $295, and in high season (through mid-April), it will cost $443.
Food prices in Mexico will seem extremely reasonable to Americans. A meal in most restaurants costs $10 or less. A sumptuous feast for two, beginning with Herradura tequila and continuing with Chilean wine and chicken mole at the Asador Vasco, on a balcony overlooking the colonial square in Oaxaca, can be had for $35.
Ground transportation is also a bargain. Two years ago a taxi ride from the international airport to downtown Mexico City cost $16. Today it has dropped to $8.50. The Mexico City subway, with stops at the airport, the Museum of Anthropology and dozens of other attractions, costs one peso, or 13 cents, for an unlimited ride. That is up from 40 centavos, or 8 cents, a year ago.
Flights in Mexico, tied to fuel and to international aircraft-leasing costs, have grown costlier. Round-trip air fare between Mexico City and Guadalajara on Mexicana Airlines, $180 before the 1994 devaluation, now costs $197. But for intercity travel, Mexico's first-class buses are cheap and clean.
Air tickets to and from the United States, paid in dollars, fluctuate according to the airline industry's own dynamics, generally having little to do with the Mexican economy. But travel agents and airlines serving Latin America said that excursion tickets purchased weeks in advance have tended to drop in price over the past two years, while regular coach tickets have risen. In November 1994, the round-trip excursion fare from Newark to Mexico City on Continental Airlines was $388, said Marta Rosas, a Continental spokeswoman. Currently the fare is $258, she said.
The favorable exchange rates have attracted record numbers of foreign travelers, said Javier Solis Diego, a spokesman for Mexico's Department of Tourism. Last year more than 20 million tourists traveled to Mexico, up from 17 million in 1994, he said. Underlining the low cost of travel here, however, the 20 million travelers who came in 1995 spent an average of $305 each, down from $370 in 1994. The figures include foreigners who visit Mexico's northern border cities, as long as they stay overnight.
The government projects that 23 million foreign tourists will visit Mexico in 1996, and that 1997 will see a further 15 percent increase, Mr. Solis said.
Runzheimer International, a Wisconsin company that advises American businesses on the costs of executive transfers and travel to foreign cities, has compared the cost of food, clothing and other goods and services in Mexico City with the cost of the same items in American cities. The company estimates that for $80 a traveler in Mexico City can buy goods and services that would cost $118 in New York, said Peter D. Packer, a Runzheimer spokesman.
"Mexico City is now among the least expensive places in the world," Mr. Packer said.

HEADLINE: Long Island Q&A: Steven B. Tanger;
The Outlet Shopping Center as a Growing Retailing Concept

BYLINE: By THOMAS CLAVIN 

 BODY:
AS president and chief executive officer of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc., Steven B. Tanger runs a family business that his grandfather, Moe Tanger, started 78 years ago, and that his father, Stanley Tanger, continued.
The company's mall in Riverhead, one of 27 it owns in 22 states, opened in May 1994 and now has 68 tenants. At 287,000 square feet, the Tanger Outlet Center in Riverhead is the largest on the Island. 
 The company has received approval from Riverhead town for an additional 450,000 square feet of shopping space, and in July the company broke ground for Tanger II. It is estimated that this will bring the total number of shops to close to 200.
The company, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange with a total market capitalization of $400 million, has its headquarters in North Carolina, but Mr. Tanger and his family live part-time in Southampton.
Q. Why was Riverhead chosen as the site of the most recent Tanger Outlet Center?
A. First, we wanted an outlet center on Long Island because of its huge density of population and very high average income. But Long Island is over-retailed, with every form of product distribution already available through WalMart, K-Mart, Caldor and strip malls. What was missing were factory outlets, and we thought we could do well on Long Island if we could select the right site.
Typically, we look for sites on major interstates, and on Long Island that meant we wanted to be on the Long Island Expressway. There wasn't much available to us in Nassau County and western Suffolk. Even if there was, our tenants are manufacturers of brand-name products and their customers are the major department stores. They want to be at least 20 miles away from malls so as not to compete directly with retailers. There were very few choices left once we plugged in that criteria, and we're not speculators.
Q. Initially, were Riverhead officials knowledgeable about and open to a factory outlet center?
A. Yes, for two reasons. When the Calverton base shut down a few years ago, 2500 jobs were lost, so the surrounding population and economy took a hit. Some sort of replacement would be welcome. Second, prior to our finding this site, the town fathers created a factory overlay zone for the central community in anticipation and hope a factory outlet center would develop there. So they were already aware of the economic advantages of our type of development. It was a classic win-win situation for the host community and our company and its shareholders.
Q. After over two years in Riverhead, have economic goals been met?
A.
, In the first full year after expansion, we anticipate generating $8 million in sales tax revenue. Unlike other retail distribution channels, less than 5 percent of our sales come from within five miles of our shopping center. This is the exact opposite of your major box users such as K-Mart, where 95 percent of their business tends to come from a 5- or 10-mile radius. We are drawing people to Riverhead from 50 to 75 miles away, and many of these people have not been to Riverhead before.
In addition, we're working with a local entrepreneur and the town to create a trolley system to link our property to Splish Splash and downtown merchants. We're one of few shopping center developments to allow a transportation system to come onto our property and take our shoppers away to other shops and attractions. We want to extend Main Street out to our center. This is very important because at present we are bringing in excess of three million people to Riverhead.
Q. Though the bottom line is encouraging now, looking back, was developing a center in Riverhead a risk?
A. It was a major risk. When we started to tell people about locating in Riverhead, I was told that I was crazy. They said no one goes past Exit 70 on the L.I.E., and no one goes to Riverhead unless they need driver's license renewed or a building permit.
But we understood that the L.I.E. was becoming literally the Main Street of eastern Suffolk County. We knew of no major retail distribution center east of the Smithaven Mall. We thought that if we were fortunate enough to attract the right customers and the right management group to run the center, we would attract enough people to expand rapidly in the hopes of becoming the regional mall on Long Island, located in Riverhead. And we're on our way.
Q. In addition to the Riverhead site, what is fueling the popularity of factory outlet malls around the United States?
A. People love a true value. They trust brand-name products, and in the 22 states where we operate our channel of distribution, and of course that of other outlet centers, is based upon consumers buying directly from manufacturers. The middle man is cut out. Without the middle-man profit, the consumer should get the very best price on broadest selection of brand-name products. That's why there are now 324 factory outlet centers in the country, and that number is growing.
Q. Is there a threshold, a possibility that the factory outlet concept could soon peak and then decline in popularity?
A. Like evey other channel of distribution, the factory outlet industry going through changes. But we're not talking about a business fad. The outlet store concept has been around for 100 years. Previously, they were called employee stores.
Q. Why have your centers grown to be so large, rivaling and exceeding retail malls?
A. The original outlet centers of 15 years ago were really quite small, 40,000 to 60,000 square feet. Today they average 250,000 square feet. However, of the over 300 factory outlet centers in the country, only 70 are in excess of 200,000 square feet. The large centers are a recent phenomenon, obviously in response to demand or we'd all go broke.
What will happen is the smaller centers may evolve into other types of retailing unless they are in tourist areas where three or four can be clustered. The smaller centers in smaller towns may not be outlet centers in five to 10 years.
Q. What indications do you have that consumer demand will support a larger center?
A. We are strong believers in research driving our decisions. We listen to consumers telling us what they want. The L.I.E. links Riverhead not only to Nassau and Suffolk Counties, but people are coming from as far away as New York City. Once you get past a certain point on the L.I.E., the driving is easy. And when you get off at Exit 73, essentially you're in our parking lot. The experience so far has demonstrated that we have tapped a consumer demand no one else was satisfying.
Q. Putting consumers aside, have you been welcomed by residents of the Riverhead area?
A. It seems so. One reason is we have about 700 employees now, and after expansion we will have around 2,000. That almost makes up for what was lost at Calverton. We may be the biggest employer in Riverhead, and one of biggest in Suffolk County.
Another reason is our economic impact on the local school system, which involves everyone who pays school taxes in addition to the children. Apart from the effect on property taxes, we have a program where we give back to school systems. In January and February, schools collect receipts of products purchased at our center and turn them in, then we donate back to school system, with no strings attached, 10 percent of those receipts. The schools have used this money to install computer labs, gymnasium floors, and other things that couldn't get approved through normal channels in a time-efficient manner.
Q. How do you counter criticism that your Riverhead center is taking business away from local merchants and drawing consumers away from the North and South Forks, which depend on seasonal business to survive?
A. With perhaps a few isolated cases, I don't think that is happening. We are active members of local Chambers of Commerce, and the Southampton Chamber asked me to be its keynote speaker at its annual meeting in September.
We don't sell pharmaceuticals, groceries, automobiles, washing machines and other so-called hard goods, so we don't compete with a lot of merchants in town.
There is some direct competition. In Bridgehampton there is a Gap store and we have a Gap outlet, 30 miles away. Both do very well.
Once the new center is open, we anticipate 10 million visits a year. Next to Niagara Falls, we will be the most visited tourist attraction in the state. Q. Other than doing business, have you got involved with local interests?
A. I've tried, and it's going well. I grew up in North Carolina and that's where my family is based, but we spend as much time as we can in the Southampton and Riverhead area. We've made a lot of friends here and have gotten involved. We've hosted charitable events, one being for Southampton Hospital and another for the Fresh Air Fund. I'm also on the board of overseers of Southampton College and vice-chairman of the Business Committee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. My whole family over the years has attempted to be part of the communities where we have outlet centers. In recent years I've probably spent more time here than anywhere outside of North Carolina.
Q. Is being the third generation to run the family business confining or enjoyable?
A. I have been truly blessed to have had the opportunity to work 10 years with my father and grandfather, then the last 25 years with my father, who continues to offer advice based on experience. He spent 35 years working with his father. We know how to separate family affairs from business affairs because we've done it for so long. My father had to do it with his father, and I'm having to do it with my father. I'm proud of the fact that the family business has survived for over 75 years. There are not many of those left.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: John Wargo;
Pesticides in Food, Children at Risk

BYLINE: By BILL SLOCUM 

 BODY:
THE potential danger of toxic chemicals in pesticides has been called an "invisible hazard," but for John Wargo of Westbrook, the evidence of continued contamination and its risks to humans is all too clear.
Nearly a quarter-century after the Federal Government began banning toxic pesticides, Mr. Wargo, an associate professor of forestry, political science and environmental studies at Yale University, argues that the threat posed by pesticide use continues unabated. 
 The message is contained in his new book, "Our Children's Toxic Legacy" (Yale University Press, $30), a volume already being compared to Rachel Carson's 1962 classic "Silent Spring." Mr. Wargo, an unabashed admirer of Ms. Carson, said he is pleased with the comparison, but concerned, too. "It could make me a target," he said.
That may be expected, considering his strong criticisms of both the pesticide industry and Federal regulations which he claims too often underestimate the risks pesticides, especially as residue in the food supply.
One of the book's chapter titles, "Fractured Law, Fractured Science," sums up Mr. Wargo's case.
What little regulatory protection exists, he writes, is driven by the introduction of pesticides on a case-by-case basis, a reactive rather than proactive policy.
Worse, he adds, is the assumption among regulators that a chemical compound is innocent until proven guilty, a mindset that can mean years of use before a dangerous pesticide is banned.
Mr. Wargo recently discussed his book, and his concerns, at lunch in a Thai restaurant near his office in New Haven. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. You argue for a more unified body of regulations. Yet you also point up the wide divergence of views on the threat of pesticide use. So how can you expect consensus?
A. Pesticides are very difficult because they carry great benefits, in health protection as well as crop protection. Yet they carry risks. Pesticides aren't like fat or alcohol, you can't label them in foods. It's a different kind of risk management problem. Unlike other chemicals, pesticides are not unintentionally toxic to some species. They are intentionally toxic, which is why we are using them.
Q. You argue there are many different ways toxins enter the human food chain. What are your biggest concerns?
A. I have to say it's not clear. We still don't know which toxic effect we should be most concerned about. We ought to be concerned about all of them, about licensing these compounds without understanding their effects or how we are exposed to them. Once I understood that, I started thinking about it in terms of experimentation.
Q. That we are experimenting on human beings?
A. Yes. Exactly.
Q. Why do you single out children as a group at risk?
A. In 1985 my graduate students and I started looking at this huge, huge data set put together by the United States Department of Agriculture. We noticed that kids' diets were extremely different from adult diets. Their diversity is so much lower. So any contaminant on any one food they eat would translate into a higher level of exposure. Also, kids take in more of these foods for each unit of body weight, to fuel growth.
Q. Are children's foods any more toxic than adults'?
A. Fruits and vegetables are pretty tough to grow in some parts of the country without fungicides. Fungicides are commonly classified as possible or probable carcinogens in animal studies.
Children's intake of fruit juices and mushed-up vegetables is greater per unit of body weight than adults', so their exposure to any fungicide residue would be higher.
There's also a pretty convincing intuitive argument that because kids' cells are reproducing at a rate faster than adults are, it's probably not a great idea to expose those cells to chemicals that pose a higher cancer risk, cancer being an abnormal reproductive process. During a period of cell growth, you want the most normal conditions to exist.
Q. What are some examples of the Federal Government permitting the use of a dangerous pesticide?
A. There are so many. I think you could go back and look at every chemical that the Environmental Protection Agency banned, and then ask: "Why did it take so long?" It was very common in the 1970's and 1980's for the E.P.A. to have taken 10, 12, even 14 years to review a chemical, waiting for the data to be what they termed "good enough" before prohibiting it from the marketplace.
Q. How does the risk of pesticide exposure compare to other purported cancer risks, i.e. secondary smoke and radiation? Some might say we are being poisoned so many different ways, why get worked up about one more?
A. I would turn it around and say that's a good logic for being vigilant. One out of every four people get cancer in their lifetimes and as many as 45 to 50 percent are unexplained by genetic factors or behaviors such as smoking. Most of the scientists at the National Cancer Institute believe that environmental factors are playing some role. That's a pretty good logic for thinking carefully about which factors are posing the greatest risk.
Q. Don't some naturally occurring materials expose people to carcinogens, too?
A. It's not clear natural compounds are posing a cancer risk at the same level as synthetic compounds. The data are quite poor.
We know aflatoxins, molds common on some grain products, are carcinogenic, so it makes good sense to keep them out of the food supply, and the grain and nut industries are careful about that.
From my perspective, an ideal government would be one that managed the most risky compounds in a way that kept people from being exposed to them regardless of whether they are natural or synthetic.
Q. How do you view those on the other side of the pesticide debate? Are they willfully ignorant, or is it an honest difference of opinion?
A. I always wonder who's paying them, and what their stake is in the regulatory decision.
But getting beyond that, I think it's really two different viewpoints on how we should be managing hazards given the uncertainty in the data. I favor caution, driven by the history of incremental chemical-at-a-time licensing. I think that law has failed us because we've broken up the questions into bits and pieces.
Q. How do you view the recent insecticide sprayings in southeastern Connecticut, to deal with the mosquito-transmitted equine encephalitis virus?
A. The question is whether it's reasonable to spray the landscape with insecticide to try to prevent an epidemic. I think in this case, the answer is a qualified yes -- if we choose an insecticide that has the least level of toxicity to humans. In this case they have chosen one that has a very low level. It is highly toxic to fish, though.
Q. That can't make you happy.
A. We're trading off risks. So what's reasonable? Trading off kids dying of encephalitis for some ecological risks? It seems like a reasonable trade-off, if you meet a couple of conditions. People have to be warned before a spraying. And flying over schools, cars and school buses should clearly be avoided.
Q. You claim that people have been all too willing to trade off economic risks for ecological risks. Isn't this a similar scenario?
A. That's a whole different kind of issue. If you're dealing with increased yields per acre of crops or increased jobs, and trade those off against risk to kids, I say unfair. But if you're trading off risk to kids for risk to kids, then you choose the lower risk.
Q. Do you see any political party as being better able to address the pesticide issue? Or will it require a wholesale rethinking by everyone?
A. We're certainly fortunate to have people like Al Gore and E.P.A. Director Carol Browner, who have very strong concerns for kids' health and made recent efforts to revise pesticide policies. But this country still needs a wake-up call. This Administration is heading in the right direction. But the scale of the problem is being grossly understated.
Q. What do you hope your book will accomplish?
A. My agenda is one of public education so parents and consumers can be more knowledgeable about the risks they face. That knowledge will empower them. The message will get back to industry.
I'm a big fan of public awareness and risk education.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION;
The Master Skeptic Steps Aside

BYLINE: By WARREN BERGER 

 BODY:
ON A RECENT MORNING at his quiet office in the Washington bureau of ABC News, David Brinkley looked and sounded -- as he often does on his Sunday-morning program, "This Week With David Brinkley" -- like a man who had been woken too early. With his heavy-lidded eyes and laconic, halting manner of speaking, which distinguished him when he was a co-host of the groundbreaking "Huntley-Brinkley Report" in the 1950's and 1960's, Mr. Brinkley has always seemed unusually sedate for a television newsman. Now, at the age of 76, he seems more so: his shoulders slouch a bit, his soft-featured face is smaller and more drawn, and his voice, no doubt affected by lung surgery last year, is sometimes weak.
But given an opportunity, Mr. Brinkley can still rail against Washington with considerable vigor. Asked about Tuesday's Presidential election, he quickly launched into an assault on the process of nominating candidates: "It has completely broken down," he said. Later, he groused about Government spending, and characterized Congress as "a fractious, self-centered, arrogant bunch." And he said that he regarded President Clinton -- who has granted him the first post-Election Day interview, on Friday, two days before Mr. Brinkley steps down as host of "This Week" -- as "a classic politician." (That's no praise, coming from Mr. Brinkley.) 
 Though Mr. Brinkley can seem like a bit of a curmudgeon these days, his trademark skepticism and succinct candor have long been appreciated, and will assuredly be missed, by viewers who have been watching him for the last 40 years, first on "Huntley-Brinkley," then as an "NBC Nightly News" anchor with John Chancellor and finally as host of "This Week," which he helped begin in 1981. After next week's program, which will include the interview with the President, Mr. Brinkley will relinquish the role of host to two of the program's longtime panelists, Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts. Although he will continue to contribute commentary, the title of the program is expected to become simply "This Week."
With Mr. Brinkley at the helm, the program's blend of political news, commentary and sometimes quarrelsome debate established it as both a ratings leader and a trend setter on Sunday mornings, inspiring a wave of similar pundit chat programs over the years. Tim Russert, the host of NBC's "Meet the Press," which has recently been challenging the ratings supremacy of "This Week," said of his competitor, "David Brinkley redefined Sunday-morning TV."
Almost everyone involved with Sunday-morning television is wondering how its competitive landscape will change after Mr. Brinkley's semiretirement. "I think we can have a successful show without David, but at the same time there's no doubt that we're losing the linchpin," said Mr. Donaldson. "I've always maintained that David Brinkley is the principal draw of the broadcast, because viewers trust him and feel comfortable with him."
The president of ABC News, Roone Arledge, acknowledges that "there is the possibility that we'll lose viewers." But he hopes that he can soften the blow by keeping Mr. Brinkley at least partly involved in the program. "I was determined that we not do what CBS did with Walter Cronkite, which was to have him just suddenly go away," he said.
In any case, Mr. Arledge, who lured Mr. Brinkley away from NBC 15 years ago by offering him the host slot on "This Week," insists that a change in Mr. Brinkley's status was inevitable. Mr. Brinkley had been talking about scaling back his involvement in the program, indicating that he wanted that to happen sometime after the 1996 election. At the same time, Mr. Arledge felt that the program, which was his creation, needed to be "freshened up," he said.
"Everybody has copied our format over the years," he said, "and now we need to take the next step forward."
No doubt adding to the pressure for change has been the rise in the ratings of "Meet the Press." In recent weeks, and for the first time consistently, that program has been drawing more viewers than "This Week." " 'Meet the Press' is now perceived to be the hotter show of the two," said Andrew Tyndall, who reports on the television news business for The Tyndall Report, an industry newsletter.
But Mr. Arledge asserts that the decision to change hosts was not influenced by the ratings pressures. "If we were worried about ratings, we would have tried to keep David here longer," he said. Rather, he said, the move was made in response to Mr. Brinkley's wishes and also grew out of Mr. Arledge's concern about Mr. Brinkley's health. Though Mr. Brinkley returned to the program soon after his operation, he has seemed at times to be moving a step slower than his feisty round-table partners. "David had a serious operation, and while I think he was able to come back, I've noticed an energy level drop-off," Mr. Donaldson said.
Mr. Tyndall said he believed that Mr. Brinkley's on-air performance had clearly fallen off: "He always had that laconic style, but in the last year he has begun to look tired."
ABC News insiders also note that Mr. Brinkley's familiar skepticism has lately sometimes veered toward crankiness. "There's been more of a tendency to say, 'They're all a bunch of crooks on Capitol Hill,' though I don't think he really feels that way," said one person at the network.
For his part, Mr. Brinkley insists that he is feeling quite well these days, his frail appearance notwithstanding. "I probably can't run as fast or lift as much as I used to, but this job requires no heavy lifting," he said.
Of the decision to scale back his role on "This Week," Mr. Brinkley said: "I've done this for a long time and now I want to do something different. That's all." Mr. Brinkley is interested in producing documentaries about history and culture, and ABC News has already signed him up to do a couple.
As for his skepticism about politics, and any crankiness thereof, Mr. Brinkley said: "As long as I've known anything about politics, I've been skeptical. And it has evolved. The more I saw, the more skeptical I became."
As he wrote last year in his best-selling memoir "David Brinkley," he became immersed in politics early in his career, when he left his home state, North Carolina, to take a job as White House correspondent with NBC News. In 1956, he and Chet Huntley began doing their influential nightly news broadcast, which ran for 14 years, with Mr. Brinkley reporting from Washington and Mr. Huntley from New York.
Mr. Brinkley achieved a number of "firsts" during his years at NBC, including writing and serving as host for the first television news magazine, "David Brinkley's Journal," in the 1960's. But some of his finest moments involved the coverage of politics by "The Huntley-Brinkley Report," particularly its live reporting from the party conventions, beginning in 1956.
By 1964, the program's coverage of the Democratic convention drew a remarkable 84 percent share of the viewers. President Clinton has said that the Huntley-Brinkley coverage of the conventions piqued his early interest in politics. "David Brinkley created a whole generation of political junkies," said the ABC News political analyst Jeff Greenfield.
Mr. Brinkley did that in part by bringing a more casual, impressionistic tone to his discussion of politics, as he shared observations and anecdotes, often humorous, with viewers. "He appreciated the human side of politics, and got a chuckle out of it," Mr. Greenfield said. "He treated politics in the manner H. L. Mencken did, as a great spectator sport."
MR. DONALDSON SAID Mr. Brinkley was also "able to cut through the fog and explain the essence of an issue in a way that everybody could understand." And Mr. Brinkley's unusual, low-key manner of speaking also sets him apart from more aggressive commentators. (When Mr. Brinkley speaks, particular words in each sentence are singled out for emphasis; because of this, Mr. Donaldson observed, "David and I can say exactly the same thing, but when he says it, it just sounds more interesting.")
Mr. Brinkley was often dissatisfied with what he saw in Washington, but he remained unfailingly polite. "One of the things that stands out about David is that he's so civil to everyone," said Mr. Arledge. When Mr. Brinkley has chided politicians and government bureaucrats -- as he has done most Sundays on "This Week" -- he has usually done it gently, and wryly.
On one program, Mr. Brinkley reported on large batches of mail that the Postal Service had failed to deliver in Washington, and he speculated that the misplaced mail might have included a letter from President Clinton asking Congress to enact Mr. Clinton's earlier promise to cut taxes for the middle class. "That certainly got lost somewhere," Mr. Brinkley noted.
Though he has waded in Washington politics for 50 years, Mr. Brinkley has tended to distance himself from most politicians. There are no pictures of Presidents on his office walls, though he has known all of them since Roosevelt. Instead, the office is decorated with a few family snapshots and a picture of a mansion that was next door to his boyhood home in Wilmington, N.C., where Mr. Brinkley began his journalism career as a teen-age writer for The Wilmington Morning Star.
Aside from Winston Churchill, whom he admired greatly, Mr. Brinkley seems to have few fond memories of the politicians he has known. He was regarded as an enemy by President Richard M. Nixon, though Mr. Brinkley says he is not sure why. "I think he figured, wrongly, that I was part of the Washington liberal establishment," he said. The Presidential campaign of Senator Barry Goldwater in 1964 also viewed him as a foe, he says. "The Goldwater people were constantly following me into elevators and threatening me with bodily harm," Mr. Brinkley recalled, with a smile.
Mr. Brinkley is not given to nostalgia. Speaking of Huntley, who died in 1974, Mr. Brinkley said: "We weren't really close. He was always in New York, and I was always in Washington."
And Mr. Brinkley explained the enormous success of "The Huntley-Brinkley Report" -- which, according to one 1960's survey, made its anchors more famous than the Beatles -- in this way: "I wrote pretty well, and Huntley looked good and had a great voice."
While many Americans who watched television in the 1950's and 60's fondly recall the way he and Mr. Huntley used to personally bid each other good night on the air, Mr. Brinkley has always thought the famous nightly sign-off, which was the idea of network producers, was "silly and inappropriate."
Not surprising, Mr. Brinkley is expected to do nothing very sentimental next Sunday on his final broadcast as host of "This Week." And though Tuesday's election will probably be the last he covers as full-time network newsman -- he'll provide commentary during the evening -- he seems, like many Americans, a little bored by this particular contest.
"I like surprises, and so far there haven't been many this time," he said, contrasting this election to the one in 1960 that kept Mr. Brinkley and Mr. Huntley on the air awaiting a winner all night and halfway into the following day. "This one seems to be cut and dried," he said. "This is a pretty quiet time in American history, with no wars, no recession, no divisive bloodthirsty issues. That's good, but it doesn't make for very exciting politics."
Regarding the future of "This Week," Mr. Brinkley says he will leave it to Mr. Arledge and others to decide which new directions the program should move in. Mr. Arledge says that the program will probably begin to broaden its focus beyond Washington politics and that various format and personnel changes are still being worked out.
Mr. Brinkley, too, is expected to broaden his focus beyond the Beltway. In addition to producing historical documentaries, he plans to write books (his third, "Everyone Is Entitled to My Opinion," was published last month) and travel with his wife, Susan. And now that he no longer has to be at the ABC News studios every Sunday morning, he also plans to begin sleeping in on weekends. "It's painful rolling out of bed at 5 in the morning on Sundays," he said. "I won't miss it."

HEADLINE: The Arab Worlds as Seen Through Film Makers' Eyes

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER; Judith Miller, a reporter for The New York Times, is the author of "God has 99 Names: Reporting From a Militant Middle East."

 BODY:
THE TITLE OF THE remarkable film festival now at Lincoln Center is a bit of a misnomer. "The Centennial of Arab Cinema," which features 36 Arab films, all of them subtitled and many never before shown in this country, celebrates the 100th anniversary not of Arab film per se but of Egyptian cinema.
As the films themselves suggest, however, any homage to Arab cinema means paying tribute to Egypt, which made half of the more than 6,000 Arab films produced since 1896, when the first Egyptian film, a short, was shown in Alexandria. 
 Half the festival's films are also Egyptian. But the rest, from seven other Arab nations, prove that while Arab cinema is historically beholden to Egypt, gifted Arab directors have adapted the medium, often brilliantly, to express local concerns.
"The diversity of these films shows that there is no more an 'Arab' cinema than there is an 'Arab' world," said Mouny Berrah, an Algerian sociologist and film critic who lives in Washington. "These films reflect the many different national cultures of the Arabs."
The festival, which opened on Friday and runs through Dec. 5 at the Walter Reade Theater, is ambitious, covering vast historical, social and political ground. It has to be. Most New Yorkers have had little exposure to these works. According to Alia Arasoughly, a Palestinian-born film teacher who, with Richard Pena, program director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, organized the event, the festival and two related panel discussions this weekend are the first major effort to present Arab film culture comprehensively in the United States.
Most of the films transcend national, linguistic and religious barriers. Consider Tewfiq Saleh's 1955 film "Darb Al-Mahabil" ("Fool's Alley"), about the chaos wrought by a winning lottery ticket. And their emotional force shows that if Arabs did not invent melodrama, their best directors have deified it as a genre.
The range is broad. There are some three-hanky dramas, but some without the Hollywood endings in which good guys win. There are also zany musicals and outrageously funny comedies, though many of these have an overtone of darkness that underlies the best of the region's artistic products.
For those who know the Middle East, the films evoke a wrenching nostalgia. For those who do not, they begin to explain the region's intense appeal, the hold it retains not only on those who abandon it but on foreigners who, having once tasted Nile waters, return again and again to be delighted and brokenhearted..
"Al-Azimah" ("Determination"), the festival opener (it will be repeated on Tuesday), is also its oldest. The film, made in 1939 and directed by Kamal Salim, reflects Hollywood's influence on classical Egyptian film. This Muhammad-meets-Fatma story, which features passionate kissing (far rarer in Egyptian films today), a rousing neighborhood brawl and, yes, a happy ending, nonetheless marks the beginning of the realist tradition in Egyptian films. One theme is the rigidity of the Egypt's class system and the impact of the country's vast unemployment on the young.
The festival includes several films like this one, works that helped make Egypt the center of Arab film for more than two decades; in fact, Samir Farid, an Egyptian critic, described the prosperous period from 1945 to 1952 as Egypt's golden age. But also featured are several extraordinary films from the second phase of Arab cinema, what Ms. Berrah calls the "liberation" phase, when many films explored concerns related to post-colonial life.
Among the best from this period, from the 1950's through the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, are "Bidayah wa-Nihayah" ("The Beginning and the End"), by Salah Abou Seif, the Egyptian master of realism, which has a superb performance by a young Omar Sharif, and Youssef Chahine's masterpiece, "Bab al-Hadid" ("Cairo Station"). Mr. Chahine both directs this smoldering account of life among the poor inhabitants of Cairo's railroad station and plays a crippled newspaper dealer whose sexual obsession with a lemonade seller leads to tragedy.
ANOTHER MASTERPIECE IS "Al-Ard" ("The Land"), a Chahine film made after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war; the movie ends not with justice, the Hollywood-on-the-Nile happy ending, but with a lynching.
According to Ms. Berrah, a third phase of Arab cinema, one that more openly explores personal subjects like sex, religion, political oppression and the subjugation of women, emerged after 1967. It was after this war that censors, working under discredited Arab governments, temporarily stopped clamping down on caustic originality.
A Tunisian movie, "Halfaouine, Child of the Terraces" (1990), concerns a boy allowed in the women's baths. "Our Heedless War," a 1995 video documentary from Lebanon by Randa Shahal, weaves the death of the director's father with that of Beirut during its 15-year civil war; also from Lebanon is "Hurub Saghirah" ("Little Wars"), a 1982 film by the talented Maroun Baghdadi, who lived in Paris during the 1980's and returned to Beirut in 1993, only to die in an elevator accident.
"Ahlam al-Madinah" ("Dreams of the City"), by Muhammad Malas, one of Syria's most talented directors, portrays a boy coming of age during the politically turbulent 1950's and early 60's. Mr. Malas flouts the politically correct image of the virtuous poor to describe the often emotionally crippling effect, especially on women, of the idealized Arab family's embrace.
The festival does have omissions, like any film by Duraid Lahham, Syria's Woody Allen, and his scriptwriter Muhammad Maghut, whose satirical portraits of Arab life and politics are admired in much of the region. Nevertheless, the series is a welcome counterpoint to the caricatures of Arabs and Arab life so prevalent in American cinema.

HEADLINE: ATLANTIC CITY;
A Master Dealmaker

BYLINE: By BILL KENT 

 BODY:
WHAT comes through that door" -- Marty Wood pointed to the front of his pawnshop -- "you just wouldn't believe."
There was the man who came in with a prosthetic right foot. "He asks me how much I can give him for it," Mr. Wood said. "I say: 'Absolutely nothing. We don't take body parts.' " 
 And what about the one who came in with a parrot? "I told him, 'This is a pawnshop, not a pet shop.' He said, 'But what if I can get it to talk?' I said, 'Get out of here!' "
But the most interesting story from Mr. Wood, 61, a second-generation Atlantic City pawnbroker, does not end with a punch line.
"From where I am, things could be better," he said. "I'd rather be in a building that I own instead of paying rent. But aside from writing one more check every month, I have no complaints."
Exactly two years ago this month, Mr. Wood read in newspapers of a plan to build a shopping area, with a supermarket, on land adjacent to his pawnshop. The shopping area would be financed, in part, by the Casino Reinvestment and Development Authority, a state agency. It takes a little more than a penny from every gambling dollar left in Atlantic City and spends it on urban renewal projects and other civic and cultural improvements all over the state.
Mr. Wood thought a supermarket was a stupid idea. "You don't build a supermarket in a neighborhood where nobody wants to live anymore," he said. "You build it where the people are living, up around Connecticut Avenue, where all that new housing is going up."
Along with numerous nightclubs and restaurants, the pawnshop Mr. Wood's father opened on Kentucky Avenue in 1927 was a fixture of the city's mostly black Westside section. Wood's-Money-to-Loan, one of only two licensed pawnshops in the city, has made small cash loans in exchange for jewelry, musical instruments, even suits of clothing, to musicians, entertainers, residents and visitors from as far away as Florida and California.
In November 1994, he received a letter from the development authority informing him that it was using the power of eminent domain to condemn his pawnshop. Mr. Wood would receive compensation of $85 a square foot, roughly $85,000. The authority would also pay moderate business relocation expenses.
The letter further stated that Mr. Wood had until the end of 1994 to vacate his property unless he wanted to join the hundreds of Atlantic City business and property owners fighting the authority in court.
Mr. Wood called his lawyer: his son, Eric Wood. Eric told his father he could not represent him in any legal matter dealing with the authority because his firm represented the authority in other legal matters.
Mr. Wood persisted: "You think they could give me $100,000?"
Eric suggested that Mr. Wood try doing what almost none of the numerous homeowners and businesses displaced by casino-related projects have done: go with the flow. "Think of how much you'd save on legal fees," Eric said.
Mr. Wood accepted the $85,000, pushing back his moving date to the end of January 1995. He found a vacant storefront two blocks south, on Atlantic Avenue. Then he ran up a bill for moving expenses that fell somewhat short of $20,000, including a new security system and 7,800 32-cent stamps, so that each and every customer in his files would know that his business address had changed.
It took Mr. Wood most of a day, with a Brinks armored car and four police officers, to make the move. Then the letters went out. "For two months, we had a dip in business," he said. "It takes some of our customers a while to get the message."
The city's second supermarket opened at Kentucky and Atlantic Avenues this summer. By then, Mr. Wood said, his old customers had found him and brought new customers from the casinos.
Although the pawnbroker's business is not a growth industry, Mr. Wood said: "We have our niche, and we're very comfortable in it. Our business has never been better -- so good, in fact, that I've been able to specialize. We now only loan money on jewelry, musical instruments, cameras, TV's and VCR's. Just the other day, a guy came in with a set of false teeth. I told him to see a dentist."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/East 57th Street;
For Mickey, Bugs and Nike, It's Breakfast at Tiffany's

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
DIRECTLY across 57th Street from the mahagony and marble hush of Tiffany's, heroic size statues of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck in formal clothing doff their top hats to visitors.
Just to the east of Tiffany's on 57th Street, a five-story sneaker and apparel store, Niketown, opened last week. A few blocks south on Fifth Avenue, Mickey and Minnie Mouse cavort on a marquee. 
 Clearly the neighborhood is changing. The corner of Fifth and 57th Street and a few blocks to the east were once the center of gravity for high-toned, high-priced shopping in New York. Ladies in Chanel suits shopped for accessories in Hermes and for baubles at Van Cleef & Arpels. The carriage trade flourished.
Then the Warner Brothers Studio Store showed up in October 1993 in old bank and office space on the northeast corner of 57th Street and Fifth Avenue. At first it was a fairly modest, three story, 30,000 square foot emporium selling mostly soft goods linked to Bugs, Daffy and Warner's immense collection of still and moving picture cartoon characters.
Tourists and families with children loved it and Studio Store officials began looking upward. When the store reopened recently it had grown to nine stories and 75,000 square feet with a wider variety of merchandise and special floors for interactive games, a cafe and candy store and a 74-seat viewing space for the screening films, including the first computer-generated 3-D cartoon feature, starring Daffy Duck and Marvin the Martian.
Entertainment retailing is taking the area by storm and reactions are mixed. "The comments are all over the lot," said Josh Kuriloff, a senior director of Cushman & Wakefield, which represents the Crown Building on the southwest corner of 57th and Fifth. "Some retailers think the street should maintain a Tiffany image, like Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills or Michigan Avenue in Chicago."
"But that is like saying Microsoft does not exist," he added. "Today's world includes technology and entertainment and that's what you have to present."
"It is becoming clear that entertainment and luxury retailing are not mutually exclusive," said Benjamin Fox, a partner in New Spectrum Realty Services. "People who can afford Chanel are also interested in Nike. We have become a less formal society, and retailing has evolved to match that."
Entertainment retailing is a relatively new approach to the business that uses movie characters or sports figures to establish an attractive setting where customers are given something extra while shopping.
"Over the years retail had been heavily overbuilt in this country and you had all the problems with the time-pressed consumer and women in the workforce," said Peter Starrett, the president of Warner Bros. Studio Stores. "Shopping had gone from being a near pastime for many people to a form of drudgery.
"I think entertainment retailing tapped into something that was always there," he added. "We tried to make shopping a happy experience, something more than just a product. People reacted by taking home a part of the environment."
GLITZY as the new stores are, retail specialists in the brokerage community noted that Chanel, the epitome of upscale designer goods, moved a few doors east earlier this year to a completely renovated building where it has a 99-year lease. Louis Vuitton, the French marketer of luxury leather goods, is building a 23-story tower, designed by Christian dePortzamparc, next to Chanel, with plans to use the first two floors for a retail store and the upper floors to house the parent company's offices.
"You are seeing that completely opposite retailers can live harmoniously right next to each other," said Joseph A. Fabrizi, an associate director at Cushman & Wakefield. He said that stores like Warner, Disney and Niketown appeal largely to the tourists that are becoming an increasingly important part of the New York economy, while the older, luxury stores have an established clientele that tends to return over and over again, regardless of changes in the neighborhood.
Many argue that the new stores bring more total traffic to the area, for the benefit of all. "If you only have one type of store in an area, it limits the number of people who walk past your store," said Richard Seligman, a retail broker with the Edward S. Gordon Company. "A store like Warner's attracts huge volumes of people."
Others note that Warner and Niketown are opening in an area with some of the highest rents in the city, which indicates that the retailers are convinced that the economics are favorable and the landlords think their expectations are realistic.
"Space on 57th Street between Fifth and Park Avenues ranges from $400 to $600 a square foot, and you have to do 10 times that in sales to make it all work," said Faith H. Consolo, a senior managing director of Garrick-Aug Associates. She said 57th Street east of Fifth Avenue was traditionally the preserve of higher price retailers while the western stretches of the street were populated by stores that appealed to bargain hunters and, lately, theme restaurants like Planet Hollywood and Motown.
"We tried to bring some of the apparel guys west, but they always refused," Ms. Consolo said. "It was as if they would get a nosebleed west of of Fifth."
But others argue that the two blocks of 57th Street between Fifth and Park are such a prime location that economics is not the only motivation for retailers to establish stores there. "If you are paying $300 a square foot, you can probably justify $150 to $200 on sales," said Mr. Fabrizi. "The last $100 is because you need a flagship in New York. You are showing you are strong enough to establish a presence in this location."
IF the tonier neighbors of Bugs, Mickey and Niketown are upset, they are not making much noise about it. In fact, the Bulgari jewelry store diagonally across 57th Street from Warner's is displaying in its windows, along with more traditional products, the hand-drawn cels used to make cartoon movies.
Some people are positively enthusiastic about the change. An official of Tourneau, which is building a store on 57th Street, on the same block as Tiffany and Niketown, said, "We chose the site because of its eclectic mix of stores.
"A true shopping mecca cannot be a mecca to just one stratum of society," said Anthony J. D'Ambrosio, executive vice president of the watch retailer. He said the new stores, for all their emphasis on cartoon characters that exist only as figments of the imagination, or on the reflected glory of sports heroes, are managed by very sophisticated retailers.
"They have made shopping exciting and entertaining again," said Mr. D'Ambrosio, whose own store is scheduled to open next spring.
Still, some change can be wrenching. When industrialists erected buildings, they carved words like "commerce," "industry," "transportation," "communications" and the appropriate symbols in the granite facade panels flanking their doorways.
At the Warner store, the stone panels have legends like "action" and a carving of Wile E. Coyote chasing the Roadrunner, or "suspense" and a depiction of Batman on some mythical mission.
Mr. Starrett of Warner Bros. said the company did not originally plan to locate on the corner of 57th and Fifth, where he said the rental rates are among the highest in the world. "You would have to go to some parts of Hong Kong or the Ginza in Tokyo to find anything higher," he said.
He said the company wanted to establish a flagship store on Fifth Avenue, somewhere in the 50's. As they explored they found that the building on the northeast corner of the famed intersection had been largely vacant for four years. "At first we were not interested in the whole building, just the retail space," he said.
But as sales boomed, the company took over most of the building, occuping 75,000 of the 85,000 total square feet. The landlord, Daiichi America Real Estate, maintains its offices on the top floors.
Mr. Starrett said the real significance of the entertainment retailers is that they "have helped prove you can do business on 57th Street at less than the designer level."

HEADLINE: The End for Winsted Hospital

BYLINE: By SUSAN PEARSALL 

 BODY:
AFTER six months of community debate and legal wrangling over the future of financially strapped Winsted Memorial Hospital, the end came quickly. Litchfield Superior Court Judge Richard A. Walsh ordered the hospital closed on Oct. 25, three days after receiving an independent report that showed there was no money to pay employees.
"The financial condition of Win-sted Memorial Hospital is more than precarious," Judge Walsh wrote in his decision. "Indeed, it is nothing less than desperate -- so desperate that there is nowhere to turn." 
 The decision affects 206 full- and part-time employees, who were laid off without receiving severance pay or earned vacation pay. Lawyers for the hospital said they would file for bankruptcy in Federal court under Chapter 7, which requires liquidation of assets to pay off creditors.
The judge based his decision on a report prepared by court-appointed receiver, E. Cortright Phillips of Fairfield, who replaced James E. Sok, former chief executive of the hospital, and testimony in a lawsuit filed by Attorney General Richard Blumenthal to block the closing. Mr. Phillips, now retired, served on the State Commission on Hospitals and Health Care from 1992 to '95 and worked in the banking industry.
"When I got to the financial situation at the end of August, I was shocked," Mr. Phillips testified. Between October 1995 and last August, hospital admissions dropped by 38 percent, causing an operating loss of $3.2 million, according to his report. Preliminary figures indicated the operating loss would reach $3.7 million for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, he said.
While the hospital was licensed for 73 beds, "its average daily in-patient census over the last six months has been less than 10 patients, and the census is declining," Mr. Phillips said in his report.
Earlier this year, Mr. Sok blamed the sudden decline on managed-care providers, which tend to exclude small hospitals that cannot afford steep discounts, and increased competition between Winsted Memorial and Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in Torrington, a larger hospital about 25 minutes away.
The judge's decision to close the hospital was a blow to the Community Trust for Winsted Hospital Inc., a group of local residents who had hoped to replace the current board of directors if the judge found they had mismanaged hospital affairs. But he did not.
The decision ends, for now, months of bitter dispute between hospital officials and residents who differed sharply on how to provide medical care in a rapidly changing health care environment.
On April 23, the hospital's directors voted unanimously to approve a "new vision" proposed by hospital administrators that would close in-patient beds and convert the hospital to a residential care center for elderly men and women. Under the plan, the hospital would have remained open for out-patient services until a new, more cost-effective ambulatory-care center and emergency room were built on another site.
Within days, a petition drive to keep the hospital open collected more than 10,000 signatures. The effort was organized by Charlene LaVoie, a community lawyer who works for free for the citizens of Winsted as part of a nonprofit trust established by the consumer advocate Ralph Nader, a Winsted native, and his sister, Claire, who still lives there.
The group maintained the directors should look at small hospitals that have survived, despite similar obstacles, by establishing innovative new programs.
Hospitals officials, backed by most of the medical community, had decided to go ahead with their plan by affiliating with Hartford and Charlotte Hungerford hospitals and closing in-patient beds, when Mr. Blumenthal filed his lawsuit on Sept. 10. It was disclosed in court testimony that Mr. Sok and Daniel Dombal, vice president for financial services, received bonuses totaling $150,000 to promote the plan.
Ben Serafini and his wife, Sue, both worked at Winsted Memorial. He was in housekeeping; she was in admitting and registration. Now both are unemployed.
How does Mr. Serafini feel about the situation? "Sad and disgusted," he replied. "We didn't expect to go out not having anything. We thought there would be something there for the community, even if we didn't have our jobs."
The Serafinis will sign up for unemployment benefits and soon begin looking for new jobs. But first they're taking some time off, "to wind down from all that happened," Mr. Serafini said.
Under the administration's plan, some 100 employees would have kept their jobs when in-patient beds closed.
Perhaps Ms. LaVoie and the community group were too fixed on saving in-patient care at any cost?
"There were no other options," Ms. LaVoie insisted. "A hospital is an institution in this community, not a walk-in clinic. Small hospitals are surviving all over the country, and it could have survived here."
Mr. Sok, the former hospital executive vindicated by the court proceedings, is angry about the bankruptcy. "It's a tragedy the the community and the hospital were blocked from accepting the $9.5 million in financial support that Hartford Hospital and Charlotte Hungerford Hospital were willing to provide to rebuild, retool, renovate and reposition Winsted Memorial Hospital," he said. "Instead, the community lost a century-old institution and the $10.6 million it put into the local economy, because some people were resistant to change."
With the longer drive to a hospital, local officials are concerned volunteer ambulance crews may not be able to take time from work to respond to daytime calls. Paul S. Vayer, the town manager, said he expects to hire a paid medic to solve that problem, but the Winsted Volunteer Ambulance Association will no longer be able to offer free service.
It has been a stressful six months for Douglas Gerard, an internist in Winsted and member of the hospital board of directors. But he has just sold his practice so he can stay in Winsted and concentrate more on patients than business details. However, Dr. Gerard sounded a warning.
"People should pay attention," he said. "This could happen in other places, too."

HEADLINE: Teaching English Around the Dinner Table

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WESTCHESTER'S business voice is changing, and one of the reasons is the remarkable growth of minority-owned businesses.
In the last 10 years, the number of Asian-owned companies alone has doubled and a sixfold increase in the number of Hispanic-owned businesses has been recorded, according to the most recent statistics from the county's Office of Economic Opportunity. Charles Gonzalez, president of the Westchester Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in White Plains, estimates that there are at least 2,500 Hispanic business owners in Westchester. 
 But success brings problems. And one that looms large is the language barrier.
"Business people and professionals quickly realize that they need more than survival English in order to be upwardly mobile," observed Beth S. K. Morris, president of Unispeech in White Plains. Ms. Morris, who has a doctorate in speech and hearing sciences, runs a company that specializes in teaching verbal skills to business people who are not native speakers of English.
"As a result of Westchester's ethnic diversity, I have a global client list," said Ms. Morris, who also speaks French and Spanish.
"Many of our county's best and brightest are foreign born," she said. "They have medical degrees or doctorates in engineering and computer science. Some are employers who run mid-sized companies. These are people who already have basic English but they have a need and desire to improve their verbal communication skills.
"They not only want to perfect their diction, grammar and English pronunciation," she added, "but they want to learn English in the vernacular, the lingo, the slang, the special American nuances and subjects that are not found in textbooks. One of my clients, a Hispanic executive who works for an international computer company, wanted to learn how to talk about American football. He kept confusing it with soccer, which of course, goes by the name of football in other countries."
The best way to learn to speak another language, Ms. Morris emphasized, is through conversation. And since conversation takes place most effortlessly around the dinner table, Ms. Morris and a colleague, Lorraine Way, have started a new language program in an environment conducive to conversation, a restaurant.
"It's a realistic setting for conversing," she said. "The participants have dinner together with us at the Exotic Foods Cafe in Ossining, owned by Martha Camacho, a Hispanic businesswoman who serves very tasty food. The group is kept deliberately small in order to give everyone a chance to get into the conversation. In Latin and European cultures, sitting around the table and talking is the normal thing to do, so conversation flows easily."
Ms. Way, a former adjunct professor of Spanish at Pace University, started her business, the Language Way in Ossining, 18 months ago. She is proficient in Spanish and French.
"I help business people, professionals and tourists become verbal in both Spanish and French," she said. "Many of my clients are physicians and health care aids, who work in neighborhoods with large Spanish-speaking populations. It is essential for them to understand and speak Spanish in order to care for their patients."
The ability to speak French, Ms. Way said, is becoming increasingly important for those involved with commerce and business in the international marketplace.
"Even though English is the language of business there are many places in the world where it isn't adequate," Ms. Way said. "I have clients who deal with companies in the French-speaking countries in Africa where, in order to get business, speaking and understanding French is important."
But business is not the only motivation for learning how to speak in another language, Ms. Way said.
"One of my dinner students, Nina Weireter, the daughter of an American father and a Cuban mother, never learned to speak Spanish as a child. She wants to learn it now, to be able to teach her children something about their heritage and because she has a Spanish nanny."
By contrast, Ms. Morris said, most of her students are like Susana Lara, who is improving her English, to get ahead in business.
"Susana is a typical client," Ms. Morris said. "She is from El Salvador, but earned a master's degree in business from an American university so she speaks English on a good level. Although she's doing well professionally -- she's vice president of Sir Speedy, a printing firm in Pleasantville -- she feels she can improve her pronunciation and vocabulary in order to make her sales presentations and her very frequent telephone conversations more effective."
Observing that the telephone exaggerates flaws in diction and pronunciation, Ms. Morris said: "For the foreign born, the telephone is the bane of their existence. One of my clients, an Indian-born journalist, was upset because he was constantly asked to repeat certain words and, too frequently, their meaning was still unclear. Other students find the cold-call strategy, a common business strategy used in the U.S. a nightmare for those not used to American ways. I often base speech sessions around such business problems."
English speakers learning conversational Spanish most often have problems using the correct tense, Ms. Way said. "There are two verbs in Spanish making it extremely confusing, but the wrong tense completely alters the meaning of a conversation, so that is something we always work on."
Both groups meet for eight sessions, from 6:30 to 7:45 P.M. at the restaurant. Ms. Morris's group meets on Tuesdays; Ms. Way's on Thursdays. The cost, including dinner, is $ 20 a session. For information, call 923-7724.
Unispeech also specializes in corporate work. Companies hire Ms. Morris to work with personnel in key company positions who are not native English speakers. They usually are highly trained specialists who need to upgrade their verbal skills," she said. "One of my corporate students is a Mexican nuclear physicist, another is a Chinese computer technician. I see them during business hours in the privacy of their own offices."
Ms. Morris and Ms. Way also provide on-site team language instruction to the employees of organizations and corporations in Westchester.
"Right now, we're working with a major hotel," Ms. Way said. "I will be working with management executives to increase their proficiency in Spanish, and Beth will work on teaching spoken English to the large non-English-speaking staff."

HEADLINE: What Drives a Batterer? Issues of Control

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
COMPLAINTS by battered spouses -- women and men -- increased sharply last year, as did deaths caused by domestic partners. In New Jersey, reports of domestic violence increased 22 percent over 1994, to 86,213, in part because the authorities take it more seriously and because more women are seeking help. And 61 adults were killed by domestic violence, compared to 42 in 1994.
Last year, nearly half of all reports of domestic violence in the state led to arrests. And more women -- for a great majority of victims are female -- are filing complaints and seeking other help. 
 But women are actually at highest risk when they seek help. When a woman leaves her abuser, her risk of being injured or murdered increases by 75 percent, the Coalition for Battered Women says.
"He's losing power and control, and that's what it's about," said Barbara Price, executive director of the coalition, a statewide group based in Trenton. The abuser's logic, she says, "If I can't have you, no one will."
Battering has only recently been taken as seriously as child abuse or, for that matter, animal torture. New Jersey passed its first law against battering a spouse only 15 years ago, about a century after cruelty to animals was outlawed. Since then, the coalition, founded in the mid-1970's, has opened shelters for battered women and their children in every county, with 12 to 40 beds. The state covers the cost.
These shelters house women of no means and women who have left $500,000 houses, women with little schooling and with college degrees. "Domestic violence crosses all socio-economic lines," said Carol Vasili, supervisor of the state Office on the Prevention of Violence Against Women. "The only piece connected to economic status is, does the woman have access to any money when she leaves?"
Many woman who safely leave abusive relationships must then find ways to support and care for children alone, since it is often hard to collect child support. Fear of losing the children is a potent reason for remaining in a destructive marriage, for, contrary to popular belief fathers win three-quarters of all custody fights, the coalition says.
Hiding from an abusive spouse also takes a toll. The state Legislature is considering a law that would conceal a battered spouse's address by funneling mail and child-support checks through a government address.
The time a family may stay in a shelter is limited, ranging from two weeks to two months. But shelters do provide a place for battered women to take their children and to get their bearings in safety.

HEADLINE: IN PERSON;
Abused No More

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
THIS is what Debbie Karamanol remembers about her 12-year marriage: Her husband threw hot coffee on her. He broke her hand. He blackened her eyes and blackened her eyes and blackened her eyes. He threw her down the stairs for cooking pork chops too rare. He threw her down the stairs for carrying the baby he wanted aborted.
This is what she knows about her life after marriage: She runs her own business. It grossed $357,000 last year, and she expects to double that this year. She hires women like her, women whose husbands once beat them and who have mustered the courage to leave that life to make it on their own. It is a source of support -- financial and emotional -- for herself, her business partner, Pam Sullivan, and her 12 sales representatives, all who have left abusive husbands. 
 It takes some doing, employing these women. Ms. Karamanol worries about stalkers. She does not list her business in the phone book. She has no sign on the door. Mail is directed to an address in Wayne, although the office is in Hoboken. Ms. Karamanol and Ms. Sullivan are accustomed to dealing with restraining orders and employees who have to take time to go to court hearings. Their business is printing; their mission is helping battered women live on their own.
"This is not just a job," Ms. Karamanol said. "We have a personal stake in it."
Ms. Sullivan concurred: "We go way beyond Avis."
True, the business is still rather dicey. Not long ago, Ms. Sullivan borrowed money to keep the company afloat, using her car as collateral. She lost the car and still can't afford to buy a new one.
But the office, like the business partners, has an air of success. The women share a well-lighted one-room office in downtown Hoboken. On Mondays, when the sales reps meet, they sit on folding chairs pulled from the closet. The shiny desks, the leather chairs, the posters are as stylish as the female partners. On a recent Friday afternoon, Ms. Karamanol, 45, wore a sport jacket, which fit sleekly over her slender frame, and running shoes. Her reddish-brown hair was jaunty, the bangs framing eyes highlighted with shadow and mascara. Ms. Sullivan, also 45, had white-blond hair falling to her shoulders, and pink buffed nails and lips that coordinated with her long pink plaid jacket. Together they looked more like television sitcom stars than veterans of years of anguish hidden within suburban comfort.
Ms. Karamanol named her company after her new life: Independent Graphics. It is a printing brokerage. Its sales reps comb their counties for businesses that want four-color brochures, menus, cards, T-shirts. The orders are sent to the outside printing shops that give good work at a good price.
She learned of these shops only after she left her husband and their suburban house in Wayne. He was, and is, a corporate manager; they lived well. She shopped and prepared fancy recipes and cared for their son, Fredrick, now 18. And she waited, all day, for him to come home. "I was afraid of the garage door opening at night," she said.
He hit her, she said, for any reason or no reason: "You're worthless. You made dinner wrong. You painted the house wrong." She says she'd blame herself. If she were better, she thought, he'd stop.
Why didn't she leave him? This is the question everybody asks. Ms. Karamanol -- educated, obviously competent, from a Wayne family she describes as supportive and prosperous -- could surely have survived on her own. The answer is, she did leave -- all the time. But she always went back.
In the early years, she loved him. Later, she had no place to go and no faith that she could find a job. She was afraid of losing her children; she was afraid of being homeless. "If you're from an affluent area like Wayne, you're not likely to go to a battered women's shelter in the inner city," she said. Not that she would have known where to find one.
Why didn't she seek help? Because, she said, she was ashamed. The beatings were a "deep, dark, dirty secret."
It was worst when she was pregnant with Courtney, now 11. He didn't want the baby. He beat her every night, she said. She was terrified he would make her miscarry or damage the unborn child. It was joy over her unscathed newborn that gave her the energy to escape.
"There was nothing wrong with her head, no retardation," Ms. Karamanol said. "I was so grateful she was healthy. I felt God blessed me."
With no credit, no job experience and no confidence, she took what she could find -- waitressing, mainly. For years she floundered, working three or four or six jobs at a time to make ends meet. An employment agency led her to first substantial full-time job, selling for a printing broker. She promptly signed up the Meadowlands Sports Complex. "I didn't know I had sales ability," she said.
She sold -- successfully, she says -- for a few years. Then the boss called her in. He was replacing her. Sorry, but the new employee was not a divorced housewife, but a man, "a man with real sales experience," he said. Maybe she should try catering or something. The employees certainly enjoyed the homemade cheesecakes and stuffed croissants she was constantly taking to the office.
As Ms. Karamanol tells it, she didn't even force the boss to say the nasty words. "I said, 'I'll leave. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Thank you very much.' "
After a second job in which, she said, the boss would shut the door, tell his secretary to hold all calls and chase her around the desk as in a Playboy cartoon, something snapped. "I got tired of being pushed around," she said. "I wanted some respect."
She took the $66 in her bank account and had business cards printed: Independent Graphics.
"I was stupid," she said.
Ms. Sullivan batted back: "I call it courageous."
From home, Ms. Karamanol called around to see if local companies had printing work. "You're in luck," a bank manager told her. "We have a job right now."
From her first job, she took printers' phone numbers with her. She understood color separation and deadlines. That first job for the bank paid $2,700.
That was two years ago. Day after day, she made calls -- cold calls -- for 10, 12 hours a day. She landed jobs from Riverside Mall, Nickelodeon, Sussex County Senior Services, Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen and non-profit groups, including several battered women's shelters in New Jersey. From the shelters, from displaced homemakers' groups, she obtained names of other women like her, who had left abusive husbands and had children to support but no job experience. She hired a few, paying a 10 to 15 percent commission and health insurance.
INDEPENDENT GRAPHICS outgrew her living room. She needed a business loan, but no one was willing to lend to a divorced woman with no business record. Not the Federal Government's Small Business Administration, nor the state, nor the Passaic County Economic Council. Certainly no private bank -- until, in the process of methodically applying everywhere, she tried West Jersey Community Bank in Fairfield.
This is how Sally Schwartz, a bank vice president, explains the apparently risky $10,000 loan: "You can't lend money with numbers all the time. You can't lend by your heart, but you can lend by your gut. You can't lend money because you feel sorry for them. But my gut feeling was: 'This is going to work. She doesn't have collateral or assets, but this is going to work.' "
Ms. Schwartz took the application to John Van Voorhis, who was then the president of West Jersey Bank, which has since been bought by Sovereign Bank. "I looked at his face and he looked at me," she said, "and he said yes."
Ms. Karamanol has now rented an office, attended seminars to learn about debt equity and financing, and applied for another loan for computers. "Then we can really expand," she said.
However much the company grows, Ms. Karamanol plans for Independent to stick to its mission, to be openly and avowedly a business of and by battered women. This is what sales reps say almost immediately in their pitches. It is printed on fact sheets they stuff into packages to clients. It is the topic they turn over at Monday meetings, exchanging advice when the sales talks are done.
Although she's on her own, Ms. Karamanol still lives with remnants of her marriage. Her former husband makes harassing phone calls several times a day, she said. Because they share custody of the children, she cannot obtain a restraining order. Unlike Ms. Sullivan -- who says, "I'm still the romantic; I still have the hope Mr. Right will come along" -- she has no intention of giving up being single. After all, what for? "Men remarry for companionship," she said firmly. "Women remarry for a paycheck."
It took nearly 20 years for her to realize she can earn her own paycheck. And more than that, she can now to help other women in need earn one, too.

Mid-October Storm Highlights Fire Island Concerns

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
WHILE Fire Island lost no houses during the nor'easter that pounded the New York metropolitan area Oct. 19, its battered beaches lost large chunks of sand in some areas as the churning seas washed over dunes and walkways.
In Seaview, for example, most of the sand that was scraped from the beach this summer to replenish dunes was washed away. 
 Speaking of the dune in front of the oceanfront house that he and his wife, Patricia, own, Keith Fogerty said, "It is 75 percent to 80 percent gone."
Seaview's experience was echoed in the Village of Saltaire. "The storm took away some of the new dunes we built and we lost a substantial amount of sand," said the Mayor, Martin M. Berger, a Manhattan lawyer. Two houses were lost in a storm in 1992, he said.
Narrowing beaches, vanishing dunes and property damage from storms have long been a way of life for this 32-mile-long barrier island that forms the Fire Island National Seashore and stretches from Moriches Inlet to Fire Island Inlet.
The Shinnecock and Moriches Inlets, created by hurricanes in the 30's and stabilized by jetties in the 50's, and the construction of a series of jetties called groins in Westhampton Beach that was started in 1964 but never completed are blamed by residents for stopping the natural flow of sand from east to west, robbing their beaches of sustaining sand.
Each storm brings an increased sense of urgency that a coordinated beach restoration project be undertaken by Federal, state and local agencies before breaches occur. Residents say all the agencies created the problems because they share the costs.
"An overwash would have a disastrous affect on the mainland and would affect the salinity of the Great South Bay," said Mr. Berger, the Saltaire Mayor. "Millions of people and dollars depend on the stability and integrity of Fire Island."
Of the island's 3,700 or so houses, about 50 have been swept away by storms since 1992, with the latest casualty a house in Corneille Estates, west of Ocean Beach, which was lost to the sea in early October.
Many more houses might have been lost to date had not seven of Fire Island's 17 communities, including Seaview and Saltaire, formed erosion control districts to protect their beaches. Residents are paying off the total of $8 million raised since 1993 in bond issues through extra tax levies.
"A lot of projects have been done piecemeal and that doesn't work," said Jane Ekstein, executive director of a nonprofit advocacy group called Save Our Seashore, which was formed in 1993 in response to Fire Island's erosion problems.
Its constituency now extends from Montauk Point to Coney Island, Mrs. Ekstein said, "but Fire Island is our focus because it is one of the most endangered areas, and along with Shinnecock the only place where there hasn't been a project mounted."
HAD local efforts and a $4 million state project at Robert Moses State Park undertaken in 1993 been leveraged with Federal funds, a $40 million project could already have been launched, she pointed out.
Last June, a beach-restoration plan was drafted by the New York district office of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal agency in charge of maintaining navigable waterways.
Some environmental issues must still be resolved before the plan, which requires state approval, is sent to the corps' Washington office for policy review.
The plan calls for creating a 270-foot-deep beach and constructing a 15-foot high dune and to maintain the beach at its restored level for 30 years.
The cost is estimated to be $59 million. No work would be done in the federally designated Wilderness Area.
Under a cost-sharing formula, the Federal share would be 65 percent, the state's share 24.5 percent, and the county share, 10.5 percent. Owners of property representing two-thirds of the assessed value on Fire Island voted in favor of a self-taxing district to pay up to half the county share, but not more than $4 million.
The objective of the project, said Joseph R. Vietri, special assistant to the corps' district engineer for strategic planning, is to stabilize the barrier island beach and to protect the mainland, not private property on Fire Island, as some critics claim.
"The bulk of all the benefits would go to the back bay of Long Island, and benefits attributable to homes on Fire Island are incidental to the whole project," he said.
The proposed project would be an interim step until the corps completes a study of the barrier island system between Montauk and Fire Island. The study was originally authorized in 1960 and completed in 1977. But in 1978 the President's Council on Environmental Quality, among other Federal agencies, instructed the corps to do further studies of erosion problems. The so-called reformulation study, which did not begin until 1993, is due to be completed in 2003.
There are concerns that the interim plan would be implemented without a full review of its effects on the environment and fish and wildlife.
The theory of barrier island geology is that these islands are not naturally stable and that they move, said Robert G. Murray, a biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service, a Federal environmental agency with which the Army Corps of Engineers must coordinate activities. Breaches are not necessarily bad since they allow sand to be transported to the bay to form new wetlands and mudflats, he said.
"There are still a lot of questions and the answers are in the reformulation study," he said. "Yet the Corps of Engineers is on the brink of moving ahead with this project without knowing whether it's the best solution." A state breach contingency plan would also avert any major incursion from occurring, he added.
But others say that it is critically important to protect Fire Island now.
"While protection of endangered species is important, it is not the only resource value on Fire Island that has to be protected," said Gerard Stoddard, president of the Fire Island Association, a homeowners' group.
"Unless Fire Island maintains its geologic integrity, there will be effects not only on the ecology, but also on the economy," said Mr. Stoddard, who also is chairman of the Long Island Coastal Alliance in Manhattan, a coastal policy analysis group. "You are talking about fundamental changes on the entire Great South Bay."
WHILE Mr. Stoddard said that he felt confident that a project will start by 1998, others fear that given budget cutting and the political climate in Washington, the project will only move forward if additional pressure is applied.
About 300 property owners are suing the Army Corps of Engineers and Suffolk County in Federal District Court in Brooklyn seeking more than $200 million in damages for property values lost, they say, because of governmental-agency mistakes.
"We don't believe we can get these governmental agencies to repair years of neglect and mismanagement without the additional pressure of this lawsuit," said Edward Lewis, who owns a house in Fire Island Pines. "What we really want is that they fix the beaches, but if that's not achievable, we'll take the damages."
The case could go to trial as early as March, said John J. O'Connell, a Manhattan lawyer who represents the homeowners.
A settlement in December 1994 in a similar action brought by residents of what is now the Village of West Hampton Dunes resulted in a $32 million beach restoration project that is now under way. Groinfields are being modified and new ways to bypass sand at inlets are being implemented.
"The settlement in West Hampton Dunes coincided with a government task force report on coastal erosion that for the first time admitted what everyone involved already knew -- that much of the South Shore erosion problems were man-made," said Mr. O'Connell, who also represented West Hampton Dunes residents.
"Everyone thought that that settlement marked the beginning of a new era in coastal erosion protection with the various levels of government and property owners working together," he added.
But the euphoria was short-lived, he said, because of concerns over budget cuts in Washington following Republican victories in 1994 and the Clinton Administration's withdrawal in 1995 of support for shore protection projects that were without national significance.

New Baseball Parks Taking the Field in the State

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
PLANS are advancing in New Jersey for three baseball stadiums and the possibility of a fourth, in Bridgewater, is being explored.
The approved projects -- in Newark, Atlantic City and North Wildwood -- will be home to minor-league or independent teams. If completed as planned in 1998 they will bring to six the number of minor-league stadiums in the state. The others, in Trenton and Frankford Township in Sussex County, opened in 1994 and marked the return of professional baseball, after a 15-year absence, to New Jersey where, some authorities say, the first game between organized teams was played in Hoboken in 1846. 
 Officials of the municipalities involved consider the stadiums not only a way to compete for entertainment dollars, but also to promote commerce, tourism and open and recreational space.
Professional ballparks can help attract "sports-minded people with dollars to spend" to an area and establish it as an entertainment destination, said Jonn T. Kaatz, director of the sports, entertainment and leisure division at the Dallas office of Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm.
The stadiums, which, for the most part, are publicly financed, can also produce such potential "public offshoots" as raising tax revenue and spurring economic growth, Mr. Kaatz added.
Since 1985, 76 minor-league stadiums have been or are being built in the country. Attendance at minor-league games is also on the rise, increasing to over 33 million in each of the last three years from 27 million in 1992, according to the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues in St. Petersburg, Fla., which governs minor league teams nationwide. And that, industry experts say, underscores a move toward affordable, family-oriented entertainment.
But Mr. Kaatz cautioned that ballparks did not constitute a panacea for urban ailments. Challenges such as securing the public funds and addressing concerns over traffic and quality of life, among others, also exist.
To increase the odds for success Mr. Kaatz said such projects should complement other community initiatives.
That is the case for the $13 million project on the Delaware River in Trenton, considered by many to be a success. It comprises a 6,150-seat stadium for the Trenton Thunder, an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers; a riverfront walkway, a picnic area and a boat launch.
The project "has given state workers a reason to stay in the city and outsiders a reason to come," said Mercer County Executive Robert D. Prunetti, noting that it had helped change the perception of Trenton. Attendance was 437,396 this year, the highest among teams in the Eastern League.
It is also spurring other development, Mr. Prunetti said, noting that a nearby vacant factory was being converted to a restaurant/nightclub. He said plans were also advancing to reshape a mile-long stretch of the waterfront for recreation and commercial uses, and to link that area to two others. They are the state capital environs, where new housing is planned, and a former 45-acre industrial area that is being turned into a mix of housing, commerce and cultural and recreational amenities, including a possible minor-league hockey arena.
The idea, said Mr. Prunetti, is "to create a triangle" of economic development that will be a magnet like Baltimore's Inner Harbor.
That same approach is being taken in Newark. After months of delays over environmental and community concerns, city and Essex County officials recently approved financing for a $22 million sports complex to include a 6,000-seat ballpark and a 6,000-seat soccer stadium. It will rise in the Ironbound section on a nine-acre park along the Passaic River recently closed because it was found to be polluted. It will now be cleaned up.
PLANS also call for a replacement park to be built elsewhere in the East Ward. That park will be developed first and with community input to address concerns of neighbors who objected to the stadium project because they felt the new park would not be built or be inferior to the old one.
City and county leaders consider the complex a second anchor to the waterfront's revival and another step in the city's rebirth. The other anchor is the $200 million New Jersey Performing Arts Center, including a 500-seat theater and a 2,750-seat concert hall, which will open downtown next October.
Also in the works is a federally financed riverfront greenway of more than two miles with a public walkway at the water's edge. It will link the Ironbound neighborhood on the east -- with its stadium and myriad multi-ethnic restaurants -- to the Pennsylvania Station area in the middle and the performing-arts center neighborhood on the west.
By linking these attractions together "we are creating reasons for people to enjoy Newark as center of entertainment where they can go for beer and a hotdog or white wine and Verdi," said Thomas Banker. He is executive director of the semi-autonomous Essex County Improvement Authority, which will develop and manage the sports complex.
County Executive James Treffinger called it the use of public money "to ignite new fires of economic growth."
The authority will lease the complex to users, with the ballpark set to become the home of the Newark Bears, whose principal owner is Rick Cerone, the former Yankee catcher and Newark native.
The team is part of the Atlantic League Inc., an independent franchise founded by Frank Boulton and Peter Kirk together with such former major league baseball players as Mr. Cerone and Buddy Harrelson, a former New York Mets manager. Mr. Boulton said he and his partners were bringing their franchise to eight high density areas with, among other things, large corporate populations and a supportive political climate. That is the case in Newark as well as Atlantic City, where the team has not yet been named.
In that oceanside resort 25 city-owned acres at the edge of its old but still operating airport are being turned into a $12 million, 6,000-seat stadium. The Albany Avenue site is some seven blocks from the nearest casino.
The stadium is intended to help establish the city as a family vacation and convention center, not just a gaming town, said Louis Toscano, a senior policy adviser for Mayor James Whelan. "Minor-league baseball is a nice fit," he said.
The project is also moving ahead at a time when some $7 billion in public and private investment is planned or under way. That exceeds the $6 billion invested since the first casino was built in the city in 1978, said Mr. Toscano.
AMONG the other projects are the expansion of existing casino hotels and the construction of new ones that will triple the number of casino hotel rooms to 27,000 by the end of 1999. Beyond that there will a 1,000-room noncasino hotel joined to the state's $268 million convention center, set to open in May. Plans for the existing convention hall call for turning it into a special-events area for concerts and sporting events as well as a family entertainment and retail complex.
In the seaside resort of North Wildwood, public financing is now being completed for a 5,500-seat, $10.5 million ballpark on an 18-acre site edging the Herford Inlet. The site, once a municipal landfill that was closed in the 70's, will be sealed. Construction of the stadium is to start this spring, said Bob Heal, the city administrator, noting that it would be home to an affiliate club of a major league team.
In Bridgewater in Somerset County, local and county officials are considering a proposal for an up-to-7,000-seat, $16 million stadium for an independent or minor league team. It would rise on 25 no longer contaminated acres of a 565-acre Superfund site owned by American Home Products, where 461 acres must still be cleaned.
A committee appointed by the county's Board of Freeholders is expected to make a recommendation next month on whether any publicly financing of such a project is justified, said James B. Ventantonio, the committee chairman.

HEADLINE: CONGRESS;
Bound for Washington? Voters Will Soon Decide

 BODY:

FIRST DISTRICT
Most of Camden County and parts of Burlington and Gloucester counties.
 
INCUMBENT Robert E. Andrews, 39, of Haddon Heights, three-term Congressman. Elected in 1990 to succeed Jim Florio; member of the International Relations Committee and the Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee. Former Camden County freeholder and lawyer.
CHALLENGER Mel Suplee, (R), of Bellmawr; his 57th birthday is today. A retired Federal employee, he now works as a purchasing specialist for Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Has unsuccessfully run for mayor of Bellmawr and for state Senate.
THE RACE The incumbent, who has his eye on the New Jersey State House, has little to worry about in this Democratic district. Republicans were forced to come up with a substitute candidate over the summer after the withdrawal of the candidate who had won the primary running unopposed. Crucial issues, according to Mr. Andrews, are protecting Medicare and protecting the environment.
 
SECOND DISTRICT
All of Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland and Salem counties. Part of Gloucester County and one municipality in Burlington County.
 
INCUMBENT Frank LoBiondo, (R), 50, first-term Congressman from Vineland. Member of the Banking and Financial Services Committee and the Small Business Committee. Member of state Assembly from 1988 to 1994; operations manager for LoBiondo Brothers Motor Express, a family trucking company.
CHALLENGER Ruth Katz, (D), 44, a lawyer from Ventnor. Former counsel to House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment.
THE RACE Although Mr. LoBiondo is favored, Ms. Katz could be within striking distance, according to some independent political publications analyzing congressional races. The district was represented for many years by William J. Hughes, a Democrat. Calling health care a crucial issue, Ms. Katz says her priority would be to control Medicare costs and to promote long-term and nursing-home care. Ms. Katz, who has been endorsed by the New Jersey Environmental Federation, assails the Republican record on the environment, including protection of the New Jersey shore. Mr. LoBiondo, who has had several tough races in his political career, supported the changes in welfare policy approved by Congress and favors Republican measures to balance the budget.
 
THIRD DISTRICT
Parts of Burlington and Camden counties and southern Ocean County.
 
INCUMBENT H. James Saxton, (R), 53, six-term Congressman from Southampton. Member ofe National Security Committee and Resources Committee; vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. Has worked in real estate and insurance and served in the state Assembly and Senate.
CHALLENGER John Leonardi, (D), 40, of Cherry Hill Township. An Army officer for 14 years, he is now in the Army Reserves. President and chief executive of the Greater New Jersey Regional Multiple Listing Service.
THE RACE This is a decidedly lopsided race, with Mr. Saxton firmly entrenched in a district that has voted Republican for many years. Mr. Leonardi, who was drafted by the Democrats when they could not persuade an experienced politician to run, has almost no campaign money. He does, however, have the backing of the New Jersey Education Association and the National Education Association.
 
FOURTH DISTRICT
Parts of Burlington, Mercer, Monmouth and Ocean counties.
 
INCUMBENT Christopher H. Smith, (R), 43, eight-term Congressman from Washington Township. Member of Veterans' Affairs and International Relations committees.
CHALLENGER Kevin J. Meara, 38, a former Hamilton Township councilman from 1990 to 1994. Marketing representative for P.S.E. & G. Ran unsuccessfully for the state Assembly as an independent in 1991.
THE RACE Mr. Smith has easily won the last several races and seems destined to do so this year, when his opponent has almost no campaign money. Mr. Meara is hoping for a boost from Democrats who want to regain control of Congress.
 
FIFTH DISTRICT
Parts of Bergen, Passaic and Sussex counties and all of Warren County.
 
INCUMBENT Marge S. Roukema, (R), 67; nine-term Congresswoman from Ridgewood, the longest-serving member of the New Jersey delegation. Member of Banking and Financial Services Committee and the Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee.
CHALLENGER Bill Auer, (D), 56, a former electrical engineer who now works in advertising. A resident of Allendale and a former member of the local planning board.
THE RACE In an overwhelmingly Republican district, Mrs. Roukema has repeatedly easily won re-election. She received 74 percent of the vote against Mr. Auer in 1994.
 
SIXTH DISTRICT
Southern and middle Middlesex County and coastal Monmouth County.
 
INCUMBENT Frank J. Pallone Jr., (D), 45, Long Branch. A lawyer specializing in maritime law, he was originally elected to Congress in 1988 to succeed the late James J. Howard. Member of Commerce Committee and Resources Committee.
CHALLENGER Steven J. Corodemus, (R), 44, a lawyer who lives in Atlantic Highlands. Three-term state assemblyman.
THE RACE Although Mr. Pallone is considered the leader, it is a hard-fought campaign. In Congress, Mr. Pallone has specialized in environmental and fishing issues, both important topics for coastal residents. Mr. Corodemus can also claim credit for state environmental legislation, including coastline protection. The candidates follow party lines in their disagreement on Bob Dole's proposed 15 percent tax cut. Mr. Pallone, who initially opposed abortion, now supports a woman's right to have an abortion and Mr. Corodemus opposes it.
 
SEVENTH DISTRICT
Parts of Middlesex, Somerset and Union counties and a bit of Essex County.
 
INCUMBENT Robert D. Franks, (R), 45, a two-term Congressman from New Providence. Member of Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Budget Committee. Former member of state Assembly; former state Republican chairman.
CHALLENGER Lawrence Lerner, (D), 61, a patent lawyer from Warren in Pohatcong Township.
THE RACE Although the Seventh District has been represented by a Republican for nearly 25 years, there are more registered Democrats in its current configuration and Mr. Lerner has put $500,000 of his own money into his first race for public office. Although Mr. Franks won re-election by a healthy 59 percent of the vote two years ago, his predecessor, Matthew Rinaldo, won by 75 percent in his last race Mr. Lerner opposes cuts in Medicare spending, supports tax credits for college costs and opposes cuts in spending for environmental protection. Mr. Franks voted for the recent welfare bill and supports a balanced-budget amendment. He points to the bill signed by President Clinton to dredge the Ports of Newark and Elizabeth as one of his major accomplishments.
 
EIGHTH DISTRICT
Parts of Essex and Passaic counties.
 
INCUMBENT William J. Martini, (R), 49, a one-term Congressman from Clifton and a lawyer. Member of Government Reform and Oversight Committee and Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
CHALLENGER William Pascrell Jr., (D), 59, Mayor of Paterson since 1990; member of state Assembly since 1988.
THE RACE One of the most hotly contested Congressional contests in the state, if not the nation. Both sides, with help from the national parties, could spend as much as $1 million. The city of Paterson is heavily Democratic, but it is surrounded by Republican-leaning suburbs and Mr. Martini won his first race by the slimmest of margins. Mr. Pascrell has not been shy about noting that Representative Martini has voted with Newt Gingrich more often than other Republican members of the New Jersey delegation, while Mr. Martini, describing Paterson as a deteriorating city, says Mayor Pascrell is at fault.
 
NINTH DISTRICT
Parts of Bergen and Hudson counties. Since 1982, Robert G. Torricelli has been Congressman.
 
DEMOCRAT Steven R. Rothman, 44, of Fair Lawn. Former Mayor of Englewood; Bergen County Surrogate Court Judge.
REPUBLICAN Kathleen A. Donovan, 44, of Lyndhurst. Former member of state Assembly; former chairwoman of Republican State Committee. Former chairwoman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, appointed by Governor Whitman. Bergen County Clerk, 1988 to 1996.
THE RACE One of the most hotly contested, races in the state. One would think that Mr. Torricelli's hold on the district, plus President Clinton lead in the polls, would make this a gimme for the Democrats. But many believe Ms. Donovan has a good chance. She touts herself as a pro-choice, pro-environment, pro-gun-control politician and has won endorsements from groups that normally support Democrats, like the Sierra Club and the National Education Association. Mr. Rothman, who has the backing of many union and consumer groups, describes himself as a fiscally conservative, socially progressive Democrat who will stand up to House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
 
10TH DISTRICT
Includes parts of Newark and Jersey City, plus suburbs in Essex and Union counties.
 
INCUMBENT Donald Payne, (D), 62, four-term member of Congress from Newark. Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. Former Essex County freeholder; former Newark Councilman.
CHALLENGER Vanessa Williams, (R), 35, a lawyer from Newark. Former Essex County Superior Court clerk.
THE RACE Mr. Payne is a popular incumbent in a heavily Democratic district. (In 1994, for example, he captured 76 percent of the vote.) Mr. Payne was one of the few Democrats to vote against President Clinton on the welfare bill. His opponent, Ms. Williams, is a political novice and member of a group called Concerned Black Republicans. She supports school choice, a balanced-budget amendment and welfare reform.
 
11TH DISTRICT
Covering all of Morris County and bits of Essex, Passaic, Somerset and Sussex.
 
INCUMBENT Rodney Frelinghuysen, (R), 50, first-term Congressman from Harding Township. Former Morris County freeholder and member of the state Assembly.
CHALLENGER Chris Evangel, (D), 39, a vice president of Moody's Investors Service, who lives in Morris Township. Former member of Jersey City School Board and Jersey City Finance Committee; delegate, 1988 Democratic National Convention
THE RACE Mr. Frelinghuysen, a member of one of New Jersey's most distinguished political families, would seem to have this one clinched: he is well known and won in 1994 with 71 percent of the vote. But Mr. Evangel has been buoyed by the endorsement of The Star-Ledger and is hoping for help from the coattails of President Clinton. Mr. Evangel has tried to link Mr. Frelinghuysen with (surprise, surprise) Speaker Newt Gingrich and accused Mr. Frelinghuysen of not doing enough to stop corporate downsizing in the district. Mr. Frelinghuysen, for his part, is counting on his reputation as a fiscal conservative and social moderate, his long-standing service in the district, plus a bevy of endorsements and from business, police and mental health groups.
 
12TH DISTRICT
All of Hunterdon County and parts of Monmouth, Mercer and Middlesex. Richard A. Zimmer, who has represented the district since 1990, is running for Senate.
 
DEMOCRAT David M. Del Vecchio, 40, the Mayor of Lambertville since 1991. Senior executive for economic development in the state Treasury Department since 1991; former acting executive director of the Essex County Improvement Authority.
REPUBLICAN Mike Pappas, 35, of Rocky Hill. Somerset County Freeholder since 1984. Former Mayor of Franklin Township and former member of Franklin Township Council. Partner in family-owned insurance agency in Somerset.
THE RACE Considered close. Democrats are upbeat because they believe that Mr. Pappas, an anti-abortion conservative who opposes the ban on assault weapons, is too far to the right for the district's moderate Republicans. Mr. Del Vecchio has been promoting himself as a centrist who would cut the capital gains tax and who supports the death penalty. Mr. Pappas has billed himself as an anti-tax crusader and says more responsibility should be shifted to states and towns. One problem for both candidates is that they are relatively unknown.
 
13TH DISTRICT
Includes a chunk of Hudson County with slivers of Essex, Middlesex and Union.
 
INCUMBENT Robert Menendez, (D), 42, two-term Congressman from Union City. Former Mayor of Union City; former member of state Assembly and Senate.
CHALLENGER Carlos Munoz. (R), 50, a West New York resident who works at the Hudson County welfare office. Has run unsuccessfully for state offices for almost 15 years.
THE RACE Mr. Menendez captured 71 percent of the vote in 1994, and Mr. Munoz has no money and no support from the party. Still, the race is drawing attention. That's because Mr. Munoz, a Cuban native who moved to the United States in 1972, may be the first Federal office seeker to campaign entirely in a foreign language. Mr. Munoz reads and write English just fine; it's just the speaking part that is tricky. So during a recent televised debate, Mr. Munoz (actually, Dr. Munoz, because he was a veterinarian in Cuba) sparred in Spanish with Mr. Menendez, who, though fluent in Spanish himself as New Jersey's first Hispanic House member, replied in English.

Redress For Broken Nest Eggs

BYLINE: By MARGARET CRANE 

 BODY:
WHEN a worker loses money in a 401(k) or similar retirement plan, is the company or the worker responsible? Generally, the worker is, because he chose where to put his money.
But the issue is being clouded by lawsuits brought by workers at the Unisys Corporation and Color Tile Inc. Last month the Supreme Court sent the Unisys case back to a lower court, which will determine whether the employees or the employer are on the hook for losses suffered by the plan. At issue in this case, and in a similar Federal suit filed in Texas by a Color Tile worker, is whether the investments were prudent choices by the companies. Companies have usually considered themselves exempt from liability as long as they give workers a large menu of investment options. Now they are waiting to find out if that is enough. 
 If the courts find in favor of the employees, workers nationwide might gain new recourse when something goes wrong. Such rulings might encourage companies to offer more investment choices and to disclose more information about those investments.
But at least one benefits expert warns of a possible corporate backlash.
"If employers become so nervous about potential liability, they may become too conservative in making investments or afraid to have defined-contribution plans" like 401(k)'s, said Ian D. Lanoff, a lawyer and former administrator of the Labor Department. "Or they could provide too much information and give employees what look like proxy statements."
The Supreme Court let stand a ruling by the Federal appeals court in Philadelphia that ordered a trial concerning losses in a 401(k) plan at Unisys, the information services company in Blue Bell, Pa. Among the several investment choices in the plan were guaranteed investment contracts issued by the Executive Life Insurance Company of California. The contracts are similar to certificates of deposit, paying an interest rate on the principal invested.
But Executive Life failed in 1991. Though some employees, including Michael Blumenthal, then the chairman of Unisys, transferred their investments out of Executive Life in time, the bankruptcy filing froze about $176 million of the original $213 million invested by Unisys employees.
Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Federal law known as Erisa that regulates pensions and 401(k)-type retirement plans, companies are given broad protection from employee suits about investment returns if the investment choices in the plans are diversified. Because the decision of which investment to select is left with employees, companies have not been held responsible for losses.
But the options must be prudent, and in the Unisys case, the Federal appeals court in Philadelphia found earlier this year that if a company is not, then employees could not be held responsible for losses. Unisys must now prove at trial that its investment options were prudent as well as that it kept employees adequately informed about the investments.
"Companies cannot get away with simply throwing fund choices at employees. There has to be some investigation behind whether an investment is viable," said Shaun O'Brien, a staff lawyer at the Pension Rights Center, a worker-advocacy group in Washington. "One of the issues in the Unisys case is whether, in selecting the GIC's to begin with, the employees should have been informed of the precarious status of Executive Life. There's a certain level of responsibility in picking the funds."
Employees at the Allied Construction Equipment Company in St. Louis last month settled a 1992 suit involving Executive Life contracts of their own, which had made up the majority of their company profit-sharing plan. Thomas E. Held, the president of Allied, contends that the Boatmen's Trust Company, which managed the plan, never told him and his 18 employees of the Executive Life investment. When Executive Life went bust, Allied employees lost about $300,000, almost all the money in their plan.
"We gave Boatmen's the nod to invest," Mr. Held said. "But how could the largest trust company in Missouri take a small company's profit-sharing plan, put it in a single guaranteed investment contract from Executive Life, a company that was heavily invested in junk bonds, and wipe out the savings of people who had worked for Allied for years?"
Boatmen's refused to comment, but in court filings, the company asserted that its Executive Life investment was diversified because the assets of an insurance company are by their nature diversified.
Employees of Color Tile still don't know how much money they lost. Most of their 401(k) is invested in company stock and real estate, but the company, a retailer of home-decorating materials based in Fort Worth, declared bankruptcy in January. That froze the estimated $20 million in the plan and its exact value is unknown.
In June, a Color Tile employee filed a lawsuit in United States District Court in Dallas questioning the prudence of the investments. The suit contends that the administrators and trustee of the plan violated their fiduciary duties under Erisa by not offering a diversified plan. Jeffrey S. Osgood, a lawyer representing the defendants, said there is no validity to the suit's claim.
Under current law, a company cannot have more than 10 percent of its defined-benefit plan, like a traditional pension plan, invested in company stock, but there is no such restriction on 401(k)'s and other defined-contribution plans. So the Color Tile investment itself was not illegal. At issue, however, is whether the investment options that the company's employees were offered constituted a diversified enough portfolio and whether those options were prudent. The trial is expected in the spring.
 Legislation was introduced in Congress last year to extend the 10 percent rule to some 401(k) plans, but the bill stalled. It is expected to be debated again next year.
Dennis R. Coleman, a principal with Kwasha Lipton, an employee benefits consulting firm in Fort Lee, N.J., said that, depending on how the courts rule, the Unisys and Color Tile cases could find that fund administrators are liable for investment performance and require them to keep employees better informed about their investments.
"These cases deal with imprudence and misrepresentation where plan participants were left holding the bag," he said.
Mr. Lanoff, a lawyer with Groom & Nordberg and former administrator of the Labor Department's Erisa program, said he hopes such cases will result in a reasonable balance between providing ample disclosure and clarifying the Erisa provisions.
"This case points out the yin and yang of Erisa," he said. "It was passed to provide protections to employees to prevent certain pension-fund abuses and to provide protections to employers to make them more comfortable in offering pension plans by making them less burdensome."
J. Peter Hynes, a spokesman for Unisys, said the company's 401(k) plan was diversified with six investment options. He also said that at the time, Executive Life had received top credit ratings from Standard & Poor's. "We feel our company did its due diligence," he said.
When those credit ratings changed, Mr. Hynes said employees were notified and, within six months, withdrew about $70 million from the contracts. "The company continues to try to recover pension funds from Executive Life's bankrupt estate," he said.
Mr. Held of Allied would not say how much money his company will recover from Boatmen's, but said that the dispute taught him to pay better attention to his pension. "In the future," he said, "I'll get more information about where my money is going before I'll take anyone's word for it."

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
Search for Scholarships Can Be a Bitter Lesson

BYLINE: By MARTHA NOLAN McKENZIE 

 BODY:
JESSE SALDANA 3d's dreams of an athletic scholarship to the University of Texas at El Paso crumbled along with his knee during a high school football game in his senior year. Without the money, his parents doubted that they could afford to send him to the school. But then he was reached by a company that guaranteed to find him a scholarship or grant.
All his family had to do was pay a $179 fee. 
 What the Saldanas said they received, after months of waiting, was a list of about 40 sources, consisting mostly of contests, loan programs and scholarships for which the deadline had already passed.
"They didn't give me a name that was worth sitting down and writing a letter to," said Jesse Saldana Jr. of San Antonio, the father of Jesse, who eventually received some local scholarship money and is now a freshman at the university.
The company the Saldanas dealt with, College Assistance Services in Sunrise, Fla., is one of four concerns and two individuals that the Federal Trade Commission filed charges against in several Federal District courts in September, accusing them of defrauding families out of a total of about $10 million. The agency added two more companies to the lawsuits at the end of October. The agency has obtained court orders freezing the assets of all the companies and their owners and forbidding them to use deceptive schemes. The F.T.C. also is seeking permanent injunctions against the companies and restitution for consumers. The agency said two of the companies have responded to the complaint and both have denied wrongdoing.
"It's a fraud of the 90's, and it's growing," said Heather Hippsley, an F.T.C. senior staff lawyer who is working on the cases. "When inflation was high, we saw investment scams with rare coins. With escalating college costs, it's a perfect environment for scholarship scams."
Tuition at public colleges more than tripled since 1980, while household income increased only about 90 percent, the General Accounting Office says. Today, four years at a public university, including tuition, fees and room and board, costs an average of $28,000, versus about $73,000 at a private school, says the College Board, the research group that administers scholastic tests.
That is causing more families to seek aid. Each year a little more than half of all college students get financial aid, according to Jack Joyce, associate director of information and training services at the College Board. But more and more of that aid is in the form of loans and work-study programs. In the last school year, scholarships and grants accounted for 48 percent of the total $50 billion in student aid, down from 42 percent in the 1986-87 school year. And Mr. Joyce said he expected the scholarship portion of the pie to keep shrinking.
According to Mark Kantrowitz, who runs a home page sponsored by the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators on the World Wide Web, an estimated 300,000 people were victimized last year by scholarship search companies.
"I suppose I really wanted to believe help was available," said Helen Ward of Culpeper, Va., who thought the $199 she paid Career Assistance Planning in Atlanta guaranteed a scholarship for her son, Michael Dennis, a sophomore at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va. She said it took six months of haggling to get her money back.
The F.T.C. contended in August that the defendants falsely guaranteed scholarships or grants of at least $1,000 for their customers and did not honor offers of refunds. The defendants are College Assistance Services, Career Assistance Planning, Student Assistance Services in Plantation, Fla., Student Aid Inc. in New York, Deco Consulting Services, Unimark Industries, both of Lauderhill, Fla., and two individuals, Christopher Nwaigwe and Udoka Maduka of Washington. College Assistance Planning and Student Aid were also charged with unauthorized credit card and bank account debiting.
"We will show there was no intention to deceive," James Lewis, the lawyer for Student Assistance Services, said. "People paid for what they got, and that was leads on scholarships. As far as we can tell, everyone who complained got their money back."
Alan Jay Braverman, a lawyer for College Assistance Services, said: "I'm not telling you there is not abuse going on -- there is abuse. But my clients did not abuse the system at all. They were trying to run a legitimate business."
Lawyers representing the other defendants declined to comment.
Jodie Bernstein, director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that people should be alert for the following claims made by some search companies:
* "We have access to information not available to the general public." But often, the same information can be obtained through libraries and the Internet.
* "We will do the work for you." But often, applicants must fill out their own scholarship and financial aid forms.
* "We can tap into some of the billions of dollars in scholarship money that goes unclaimed each year." But only 3.5 percent of scholarships are unclaimed, totaling in the low millions of dollars, according to Daniel J. Cassidy, president of the National Scholarship Research Service in Santa Rosa, Calif., and author of "The Scholarship Book" (Prentice Hall, 1996, $21.95).
* "We guarantee you a scholarship or your money back." No one can guarantee a scholarship.
"A guarantee is the best tip-off of all," Ms. Bernstein said.
Legitimate scholarship search companies fear that consumers will find them guilty by association because of the F.T.C. action.
"We're all going to take a hit on this," Mr. Cassidy said. "I've already had a customer call me wanting her money back because she read that we were all scams."
Some educators, however, question the usefulness of even the good firms, which typically charge $50 to $200 for lists of scholarships and financial aid providers.
Wayne Huey, director of counseling for Lakeside High School in Atlanta, said, "I think a student using computer data bases, the Internet, reference books in libraries and information from college financial aid offices and high school guidance counselors can find the exact same information at no charge."
 
Information Aids For Financial Aid
 
Here are a few of the many sources of information for obtaining scholarships and other financial aid:

ON LINE
* The Financial Aid Information Page, which is on the World Wide Web (http:// www.finaid.org) is sponsored by the National Association of Financial Aid Administrators. It contains information on scholarships and grants, as well as warnings about fraudulent search firms. The association has another site (http://www.nasfaa.org) that offers consumer scholarship tips.
* The College Board Web site (http:// www.collegeboard.org) contains a database of scholarship sources called Expan Scholarship Search. A similar database is available in many libraries and guidance counselors' offices through a software program called Fund Finder, also from the College Board.
* The Student Loan Marketing Association home page (http://www.salliemae.com) offers information on scholarships, grants and student loans.
* S.R.N. Express (http://www.rams.com/ srn/search.htm) is a free Web version of the data base of the Scholarship Resource Network, a search firm. It focuses on private-sector aid, like academic scholarships.

BOOKS
* "College Costs and Financial Aid Handbook" (College Board, $16). This how-to book includes an outline of major aid programs, a discussion of how financial need is determined and a look at college costs.
* "The Scholarship Book," by Daniel J. Cassidy (Prentice Hall, $21.95). This is a guide to private-sector scholarships, grants and loans.
* "Need a Lift?" published by the American Legion and available by writing Emblem Sales, P.O. Box 1050, Indianapolis, Ind. 46206 ($3). It lists sources of information on careers, scholarships and loans for all students, with an emphasis on children of veterans.
* "Financial Aids for Higher Education" edited by Oreon Keeslar (Brown & Benchmark, $58). It lists more than 3,000 sources of financial aid, with details on eligibility criteria.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
A Market-Moving Guru Plans to Run Funds

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
FOR three months, Elaine Garzarelli has predicted the United States stock market will fall by 15 to 25 percent. Now, she wants to put your money where her mouth is.
On Oct. 25, Ms. Garzarelli, a market guru with a wide following among both institutional and individual investors, asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to start two new mutual funds. The strategy of the Garzarelli Balanced fund and the Garzarelli Affinity Equity fund will be based on her proprietary method of sector analysis, which relies on 14 economic and market statistics to make predictions about stock prices. 
 Rarely in the history of the fund industry has a person whose single utterance can shake the market to its foundations also headed a mutual fund. But Ms. Garzarelli is one of a few Wall Street commentators who has that kind of influence. On July 23, the Dow Jones industrial average undertook a 100-point midday reversal after she suddenly turned bearish, predicting a big market decline.
That prediction has yet to come true -- in fact, the market is some 12 percent above its level at the time of her prediction. Now, the confluence of her roles as market analyst and fund manager raise ticklish issues of potential conflicts of interest, which current and former regulators say could limit her propensity to talk about the market's direction.
This will not be Ms. Garzarelli's first foray into mutual fund management -- although potential investors in the new funds will find no mention of that in the new funds' prospectus. Were they to seek out her record, they would find it mediocre at best.
And while the funds bear her name, Ms. Garzarelli will not be choosing all of the securities in the new funds' portfolios. Instead, after she sets their asset allocations, others will pick the individual securities for each fund's portfolio.
Ms. Garzarelli's fame as a prognosticator relies chiefly on a prediction nine years ago. In the summer of 1987, while she was a quantitative analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, she told clients that stocks were in for a steep decline.
At about the same time, Shearson started a mutual fund based on Ms. Garzarelli's skills as a sector analyst. When the market crashed in October 1987, the fund was largely in cash. Thus, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index declined by about 23 percent in the last four months of that year, the Sector Analysis fund rose 2.4 percent.
That propitious timing gained Ms. Garzarelli wide fame and a multimillion-dollar annual salary. Two years ago, she struck out on her own, starting Garzarelli Investment Management in Chicago. She recently started a joint venture with Zachs Investment Research to market her research and she began soliciting subscribers for a newsletter, in addition to managing money for wealthy individuals and institutions.
The potential success of the Garzarelli funds will rely on more than simply her asset-allocation skills. In the case of the Balanced fund, individual securities will be chosen by a committee of managers from her investment company. Stocks in the Affinity fund will be chosen by a subadviser, Gregory Lai, a former manager for Pimco Advisors who now heads Affinity Investment Advisers in Newport Beach, Calif.
Both funds will have wide investment flexibility. According to the preliminary prospectus, at least 25 percent of the Balanced fund will be invested in bonds, and at least 65 percent of the Affinity fund will be in equities or equity-related securities, under "normal market conditions."
But while the prospectus states that the funds will seek "risk levels equal to or lower than the general market," they have considerable flexibility. If Ms. Garzarelli's indicators tell her another crash is looming, "each fund may invest up to 100 percent of its assets in short-term, high-quality money market instruments," the prospectus states.
Nearly every other conceivable type of security is open to investment by both funds -- including futures contracts, options, stocks or bonds of foreign companies or governments, currency exchange contracts, even zero-coupon "strips" -- the interest portion of zero-coupon bonds and the type of derivative that wreaked havoc on many bond funds in 1994 when interest rates shot up.
Ms. Garzarelli insists, however, that the funds "are not going to take any big chances." Instead, in an interview from Milan where she was on a business trip, she vowed, "I'd be happy to beat the index by a couple of percentage points."
INVESTORS in the Shearson fund Ms. Garzarelli managed would have been happy had she attained that for them, especially in 1988. That year, the S.& P. 500 rose 16.6 percent, but the Sector Analysis fund fell 13 percent. In subsequent years the fund tracked the market more closely, but the sector fund gained just a little more than half as much as the S.& P. 500 over its seven years. When Ms. Garzarelli left the firm two years ago, the fund was merged into another run by Smith Barney, the successor firm to Shearson.
Investors who read the prospectus for the new Garzarelli funds will find no mention of the manager's previous experience managing a mutual fund. In fact, they might be led to believe that she has no such record. "Neither the Adviser not the Sub-Adviser has any prior experience managing a U.S. registered investment company," the prospectus states, referring to Garzarelli Investment Management and Affinity Investment Advisers.
That is technically true. In any case, Ms. Garzarelli said, the Shearson fund's performance was hurt by high expenses and other factors, including missing a buy signal in 1988 and being limited to buying stocks on the firm's recommended list. For the new funds, total operating expenses are estimated at 1.5 percent for the Affinity fund and 1.25 percent for the Balanced fund, about even with the average domestic stock fund.
When the funds will start accepting investors' money is unclear, although Ms. Garzarelli said her partners hoped it would be soon, in light of her prediction that the stock market will head sharply lower sometime after the election. "What they want to do," she said, "is start it now so we can get all the good performance when the market drops."
It remains to be seen if managing a mutual fund will cramp Ms. Garzarelli's style as a market prognosticator. No one at Garzarelli Investment Management will discuss the prospectus or the firm's specific plans once the funds start up, citing S.E.C. rules against comments that can be construed as marketing funds before they win approval.
Robert Plaze, deputy director of the S.E.C.'s division of investment management, declined to comment on this situation specifically. But in general, he said, "anybody managing money who has the potential to move the market has to be careful not to run afoul of the anti-fraud rules," which prohibit intentional market manipulation.
"There isn't anything that says a manager can't mouth off about what they like" in a particular stock or the market as a whole, said Kathryn McGrath, a former director of the S.E.C.'s mutual fund division who is now a lawyer at Morgan Lewis & Bockius in Washington. "But if you do it with a particular intent and effect of manipulating the market, then you're in trouble."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLATBUSH;
Flatbush Ave. Renaissance Brings Hope For Kings

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
It isn't quite a complete turnaround for Flatbush, because even after the neighborhood's Golden Age was over, after the Brooklyn Dodgers left town and the Loew's Kings movie palace closed down, the avenue didn't lose all its allure. Still, by the late 70's, the commercial strip near Flatbush and Church Avenues was clearly in decay: discount shops dominated and scores of shuttered businesses became graffiti-strewn emblems of decline.
But in the last several years, there has been an economic renaissance in the neighborhood, encouraged by a drop in crime and concerted efforts by local merchants, the Flatbush Development Corporation and the city to revive Flatbush. 
 "We have practically no boarded-up businesses," said Jack Katz, executive director of the Flatbush Avenue Business Improvement District, which was founded in 1990 and represents 195 merchants between Parkside Avenue and Cortelyou Road. "We've got people shopping the avenue. It's safer. It's cleaner. We've got the whole package."
But there is a sad twist to Flatbush's economic revival. The Loew's Kings, the gigantic, ornate movie palace built in 1929 that was the magnet for development of the neighborhood in the first place, remains a dormant, deteriorating, memory-filled behemoth.
The theater, which drew masses to its vaudeville shows and feature films, was the catalyst for construction of the mansions that line the streets west of Flatbush Avenue and the businesses that turned the strip into a bustling corridor. Coinciding with a general decline of Flatbush Avenue, the Kings closed in 1978, when the city took it over for nonpayment of taxes, and has remained unused since.
"It's such a magical place," said Bruce Paul Friedman, who grew up in Flatbush and started the organization Save the Kings 10 years ago. "The Kings started Flatbush and it deserves a second chance."
After an unsuccessful attempt to find a developer for the Kings in 1990, the city's Economic Development Corporation, hoping to take advantage of the current commercial upswing in Flatbush, is expected to solicit developers again within the next month.
The bustle of development proceeds around the theater, which is in the heart of the neighborhood on Flatbush near Tilden Avenue. There are signs of growth everywhere, from the construction of a Rite-Aid drugstore on Flatbush and Church to the fresh sand laid down last month for what is soon to be a new municipal parking lot on Tilden Avenue. Blockbuster Video opened on Flatbush six months ago, Dr. Jay's, a sporting goods store, a few months later, and there is a Burger King on the way.
The redevelopment spurt was started two years ago when the Caldor department store replaced the Macy's store on Tilden Avenue. Along with the arrival of other new businesses, apartment buildings have been renovated, Brookdale Hospital Medical Center completed a new primary care center on Flatbush, near Cortelyou Road, in August and major renovations are under way at Erasmus Hall High School.
Also in the works is a $10 million municipal parking lot project financed by the Brooklyn Borough President's office, the city and Sears, which has an adjacent store. The lot, along with a roof garage above Caldor's, will provide 763 free parking spaces for shoppers on Flatbush Avenue, which has long been plagued by traffic jams and scarce parking.
"What happens with development is you almost have a psychic moment where everyone realizes, 'Gee, we could really do this,' " said Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. "I would say the Flatbush market is anything but flat." SARAH KERSHAW

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Americans Don't Like Treasury Bonds

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Over the last two years, since the last Congressional election, the Treasury bond market has done very well, with the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds falling from 8.16 percent to 6.67 percent.
And over that time period, how much money do you think American investors have put into Treasuries? 
 If you said zero, you overestimated the investment attraction of such bonds. Americans, individuals and institutions combined, have been selling Treasury securities for the last couple of years.
That's why we think the Treasury rally should be named for Blanche duBois, the Tennessee Williams character who averred she had "always depended on the kindness of strangers." For it is foreigners who have put up the cash as our Government sought to finance its budget deficits.
The buyers have been foreign governments, individuals and institutional investors. Some were seeking a good yield. (These days, the payout on a one-year Japanese Government security is almost four-tenths of one percent. At that rate, Japanese investors can double their money in just 174 years. (A similar United States Government obligation pays 5.4 percent.) But in other cases, the buyer was a government simply trying to invest dollars that had been accumulated in efforts to keep the local currency from rising against the greenback.
The result: While at the end of the Bush Administration foreigners owned less than 20 percent of all Treasury bonds not held by United States Government agencies (mainly the Federal Reserve and Social Security), now they own 30 percent.
In the past, when foreign ownership of Treasuries rose, there have been fears about what might happen when foreigners sold. In fact, there have been few periods of net liquidation by foreigners. The only full year in the last 20 when foreigners sold was 1979, when they cut back $24 billion, to $119 billion, and interest rates did rise. Now foreigners own $1 trillion in Treasuries.
That could yet be a concern in this cycle. But it may be that the more interesting fact of the Treasury market is just how uninterested Americans seem to be. From the end of 1994 through last August -- the latest figures available -- Americans cut their investment in Treasury securities by more than $100 billion. During the same period, mutual fund investors alone put more than twice that into United States stock funds -- and also put $15 billion into junk bond funds.
Jim Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, argues that investor aversion to Treasuries reflects a lack of fear. If you don't fear a bear market in stocks, there is no reason to guard against it. If you don't fear a recession or the possibility of defaults, there is no reason to buy Treasuries instead of more risky bonds.
So money that might have gone into Treasuries has gone into riskier assets instead. The interest-rate spreads -- that is, the risk premiums -- for buying corporates rather than Treasuries, or junk bonds rather than investment-grade ones -- are very low. And the smallest rally in Treasuries has been in the safest ones of all, Treasury bills. Over the last two years, as the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds fell by about one and one-half percentage points, the yield on three-month Treasury bills fell by about a quarter of a percent.
The investment attribute least valued today by investors -- and therefore the cheapest to buy -- is safety. Those foreigners who bought Treasuries may be on to something.

HEADLINE: Where the Choice (Yes, a Choice) Lies on Tuesday

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AFTER 10 months of campaigning, after the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars, after innumerable witless speeches and enough wretched television commercials to last a lifetime or two, the voters of America are underwhelmed, or so they tell the pollsters. Many of them say it doesn't really matter who is elected President this week.
They are wrong. 
 It may be, as the columnist George Will has suggested, that too much emphasis is placed on the President and his power to shape the nation's destiny. It may be that "such talk encourages what needs to be constantly discouraged -- the hubris of government and its delusions of mastery." And it may be, as many maintain, that Presidential elections are no more than lotteries, because campaign promises are written in sand.
Still, choosing Roosevelt over Hoover changed the whole balance between government and business, and choosing Nixon over McGovern prolonged the national agony in Vietnam, among other things. Practically (although not constitutionally) speaking, Presidents can take the country into war. They can shift dollars from guns to schools. They can lift the nation up or let it down.
This year as in so many others, the candidates have told us that this is one of the most important elections in history. Vote for my opponent, says Bob Dole, and the nation's morality will be sorely endangered. Vote for my opponent, says Bill Clinton, and you will fall off the bridge to the 21st century.
That is so much autumn hyperbole. The country faces no war-or-peace decisions, and no domestic crisis like the Depression is at hand. Moreover, the two major-party candidates are both internationalists, broadly speaking, and both free traders; both believe, to varying degrees, in government's duty to care for the powerless; both have said that the problem of keeping Medicare and Social Security from going broke will probably have to be handed over to a nonpartisan commission.
 
 
 
The Differences
 But President Dole, particularly if supported by a Republican Congress, would scale back affirmative action, probably seeking some national version of California Proposition 209 to prohibit racial and gender preferences in public hiring, contracting and education. He would move no further in reforming health care. He would trim immigration and push to make English the nation's official language. He promises to work for Constitutional amendments mandating a balanced budget and establishing term limits for members of Congress. He vows to cut Federal spending for a range of social programs and increase it for the military.
Unless the Democrats win control of both houses of Congress, which would constitute a considerable surprise, a second-term President Clinton would be constrained in his actions. He might or might not try to extend health insurance, perhaps to cover all the nation's children. He would resist any erosion of abortion rights, such as a ban on late-term procedures. He would cut taxes much less than Mr. Dole and would probably avoid any major overhaul of the tax code.
Mr. Dole has made a major campaign issue out of campaign finance, particularly contributions by foreigners. Mr. Clinton has promised reform. But neither man has committed himself to anything as far-reaching as the bill proposed by Senators John McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, which would ban political action committees and clamp down on unregulated "soft money" gifts.
Nor, for all the talk about tax cuts and balanced budgets, is it clear how either man would get there. The two men's sharply differing philosophies are evident in the language they choose to explain it.
"I have proposed a program of tax cuts for working families," Mr. Clinton says, "that focus on education and child-rearing and are clearly within our ability to balance the budget so we can continue to keep interest rates down and the economy growing." To which Mr. Dole replies: "I have one big plan, to give you back more of your hard-earned money and more of your freedom, because you can run your own life better than any government bureaucracy ever can or ever will."
The era of big government may be over, but Mr. Clinton wants to use the tax code and Federal spending in one way (call it the way of the semi-reformed liberal), Mr. Dole in quite another (the way of the sometime supply-sider).
It is not easy to judge how the two men might react to trouble abroad. But Mr. Dole has said he would accelerate NATO's expansion. He would probably take a harder line if a post-Yeltsin crisis developed in Russia. And he might be less willing to extend the stay of American troops in Bosnia for a year, a prospect that seems certain in a second Clinton Administration.
Finally, there is the matter of Supreme Court justices. On issues from abortion to term limits to affirmative action, the men and women chosen to replace the jurists who are approaching retirement will exert a powerful influence, and clearly Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton would seek very different sorts of nominees. But history has frustrated Presidential wishes in this area.
For every Clarence Thomas, whose ideological persuasion survives the transition to the Supreme Court, there is an Earl Warren, who surprises. So there is no guarantee that a vote for Bob Dole on Tuesday will shift the court to the right or that a vote for Bill Clinton will keep it where it is today.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
When the Best Policy May Be No Policy at All

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
DASHING through the airport, you pass a Mutual of Omaha insurance kiosk. Scenes of T.W.A. Flight 800 flash before your eyes. You already have life insurance, but is it enough? Now you can get $300,000 worth of flight-accident coverage for a mere $6 a trip. You know you're being foolish -- the taxi to the airport was far more dangerous than the flight to Dallas -- but you sign up.
Well, at least you're not alone. Mutual of Omaha sells roughly 150,000 policies in airports every year, and by no means does frivolous insurance stop there. There is a policy to soothe your every worry, whether it is cancer, breaking your ankle before your trip to Asia, or huge veterinary bills if your cat needs surgery. You can insure an adoption, a wedding or child support, or you can buy a policy to make sure your car loan is paid if you die. You can even pay to ease the pain if you can't use your Broadway theater tickets. 
 But while the coverage seems cheap -- a few dollars on your life if your plane crashes, a couple of hundred dollars if you end up in the hospital with cancer -- it can add up quickly. Taken as a whole, such insurance offers consumers little value for their money.
The expenditure would almost always be better put toward making sure you have enough of the insurance you really need: auto, home, life, health and disability. "People have a limited amount of money to spend on insurance," said Glenn Daily, a consultant in Manhattan who advises consumers on life insurance matters. "They should spend it wisely."
To be sure, some of these policies may make sense. If it took you years to save for a trip to China and your favorite aunt is ailing, buying trip-cancellation insurance may be a good idea. Wedding insurance may be worthwhile if you do not want to risk tens of thousands of dollars in deposits, and pet insurance might pay if you are unable to afford four-digit veterinarian bills.
Still, insurance is worthwhile only if it offers coverage that is comprehensive and protects you against a catastrophic financial loss, said J. Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America. He advises consumers to avoid policies that offer only a sliver of the protection they need, like insurance for cancer but not for heart disease, or protection against a financially trivial loss, like a missed Broadway show.
Here is a look at nearly a dozen kinds of insurance that consumers may want to avoid.

Flight-Accident Insurance
The chances of dying in a plane crash are extraordinarily slim, but nervous travelers buy it anyway. Sales typically jump as much as 10 percent after a serious accident like the T.W.A. crash, Mutual of Omaha says. People "don't really buy it as a substitute for their life insurance policy," said Holly Richmond, a vice president for the Tele-Trip Company, which sells the insurance for Mutual of Omaha, but for "peace of mind."
Yes, your family will need money if you die -- that's what life insurance is for -- but they will not need an extra $200,000 to $500,000 just because you died in a plane crash rather than from a heart attack. You should avoid any policy that pays more if you die in some sort of gruesome accident, Mr. Daily said. Your family should be well protected no matter how you die.

Rental Car Insurance
The next time you find yourself at a car-rental counter, resist the impulse to take the loss-damage waiver unless you absolutely need it. While not technically insurance, it serves the same purpose, releasing you from liability if the rental car is wrecked or stolen. You can also buy liability insurance in case you are sued by a third party.
Chances are you already have coverage under your own auto policy, and you may automatically receive it from your credit-card company at no extra charge. The coverage from the rental-car agency is "way, way overpriced," Mr. Hunter said. A driver in New Jersey renting from Hertz would pay $15.99 a day for the waiver, or nearly $6,000 a year. The liability insurance adds $3,000 to the tab.
Why would anyone consent to what seems like highway robbery? You might if you do not have auto insurance or if your regular insurer does not cover you. For example, though regulations vary from state to state, State Farm generally does not cover a rental car if you rent it for business, rent it for three weeks or longer, or rent it overseas.
 
Cancer Insurance
If you have health and disability insurance, cancer insurance is probably superfluous. Buying it makes as much sense as buying car insurance that covers the fender but not the windshield, said Bonnie Burns, a health insurance consultant to consumer organizations.
And though a cancer policy may look like health insurance, it does not cover your actual medical bills, paying you only a fixed amount per day, warns Glenn Pomeroy, the Insurance Commissioner for North Dakota. People without other insurance could easily end up staring at huge unpaid bills.
Although insurance companies say these policies pay for related costs like having someone take care of your dogs or putting your family up in a hotel near the hospital, make sure you need the extra coverage. Consumers generally pay out a lot more in premiums than they receive in benefits, which concerns regulators, Mr. Pomeroy said, adding that many policies pay as little as 30 to 40 cents on the dollar. Aflac Inc., the largest supplemental insurance company, says it pays 71 cents in benefits on cancer insurance in the United States, including reserves for future losses, for every $1 of premiums.
A few states, like New Jersey and Connecticut, have outlawed cancer policies.
"For the Medicare population, these policies make no sense whatsoever," Ms. Burns said. And anyone under 65 is "getting a very inefficient benefit for an expensive premium."

Children's Insurance
While fear prompts some people to buy insurance, others are motivated by love. About 30 years ago, Gerber Products decided to sell proud parents more than just baby food -- it would also offer them life insurance for their children.
Forget it. The whole purpose of life insurance is to replace lost income, and with the possible exception of child movie stars, a child's death rarely represents an economic loss.
The pitches for such policies vary, but parents should probably ignore them all. Gerber guarantees that a child will qualify for life insurance as an adult, "regardless of poor health, hazardous job or anything else that could make another company refuse coverage." But this is an incentive that few will ever need, since 96 percent of those who seek life insurance are able to get it, according to the American Council of Life Insurance. And if your child already has a condition that would rule out being insured as an adult, you probably would not get a child's policy either.
Another pitch: that these policies build "cash value," which can be turned over to the child at age 21. But the amount is roughly equal to the premiums paid, with no return on the money. Put the cash in a savings account instead, and you would be earning interest.
Some insurers also sell another kind of policy for children, variable life, which invests some of the money as a way to save for college. But parents are usually better off putting the money in a mutual fund.
 
Consumer Credit Insurance
Another poor value: insurance on your mortgage balance, your car loan or your credit-card balance. "If you have adequate insurance to replace your income, you will be able to replace the income needs for your debts," said Raymond E. Forgue, a professor at the University of Kentucky and president of the American Council on Consumer Interests.
Even if your existing insurance does not cover your debts, the money will be taken out of your assets, so your family is not necessarily on the hook. Only a family member who has co-signed a loan will inherit your debt. You may need more insurance, whether it is to pay off large debts or estate taxes, if your estate consists of a closely held family business or some other illiquid asset, said Frederick Raffety, a financial planner in Rockford, Ill.
Still, if you do want extra coverage, you should probably buy more life or disability insurance. Consumer-credit insurance "is not the cheapest way," said Donna Lee H. Williams, the Delaware Insurance Commissioner. Consumers receive slightly less than 50 cents in benefits for every $1 of premiums they pay for credit life and disability, according to Gary Fagg, an industry consultant.
 
Adoption Insurance
Adoption insurance, introduced by Fireman's Fund Insurance two years ago to protect someone who is adopting if the birth mother changes her mind, might occasionally make sense, but only if you could not afford to try to adopt again.
Be aware, though, that not all of your bills will be covered. While the policy reimburses you for what you paid in living and medical expenses for the birth mother, only 10 percent of the benefit can go to legal fees. And in a handful of states, including New York, you may not be reimbursed for all of your legal fees, if any.
When you add it all up, you may not be risking that much. The birth mother's medical expenses may already be covered by her own insurance, or the adoptive parents may be obliged to pay them only after the adoption is final. Depending on where the birth mother lives, living expenses may also be modest. The insurance "only makes sense when you have a significant amount at risk," said Michael Goldstein, a lawyer in Rye Brook, N.Y., who said the vast majority of his adopting clients were not risking more than $3,000. Since you have to buy at least $5,000 in coverage, and it costs $750, you would end up paying a quarter of your costs in insurance in that case.
 
Child Support Insurance
Covering child support payments if the supporting spouse is thrown out of work, this insurance is also pricey and provides limited coverage. One policy, offered by Cigna Property and Casualty, pays if the supporting spouse is laid off, but not if he or she gets sick or quits a job. And anyone under 25 or over 55 is not eligible to sign up.
What's more, the coverage is good for only four months. That's too short a period to be useful, Jane King, a financial planner in Wellesley, Mass., asserts. If you do not have enough in savings to get you through, she recommends taking out a home-equity loan before the layoff occurs.
The premiums also add up. After three years, you could end up paying in premiums more than 40 percent of your potential benefits -- "awfully expensive unless you're awfully sure you're going to lose your job," Mr. Raffety, the financial planner, said.
 
Wedding Insurance
Since weddings can run into tens of thousands of dollars, Fireman's Fund Insurance offers $2,000 to $20,000 (and sometimes more) in coverage for nonrefundable deposits if the ceremony is postponed or canceled because of the death of a cousin or the arrest of the groom. But if you are not spending a small fortune on the wedding, you may want to say, "I don't."
The likelihood that your plans will change is low. Because a typical wedding is meticulously arranged months in advance, Marcy Blum, a wedding planner in New York, said, "postponements are extremely unusual." And if the lovebirds get cold feet as the big day nears, the policy will not pay.
Even if you do postpone your marriage, you can sometimes get a deposit back if the room can be rebooked and the band can find another gig.
Some of the additional coverage available may also be redundant: the wedding hall or your personal homeowners' insurance might provide personal liability, for example, if your guests trash the banquet hall during the reception.
 
Trip Insurance
Travel-cancellation insurance is worthwhile only if you are planning an expensive trip and you cannot get most of your money back if your plans fall through. Still, there are many travel agents like Richard Nigosian, president of Bond Street Financial in Manhattan, who "strongly recommends" that his clients consider it.
Travelers should also think twice before signing up for the other coverage included in trip-insurance packages. A policy that covers emergency medical evacuations is hardly essential if you are spending two weeks in Atlanta, but if you have Medicare and are traveling overseas, you may need additional medical coverage.
If the main reason you are buying trip-cancellation insurance is that you are worried that your asthma could flare up and prevent you from traveling, the policy needs to cover pre-existing conditions. Many policies do, provided that you sign up within a day or two of booking reservations. And as with wedding insurance, you can forget about getting your money back if you simply change your mind.
 
Pet Insurance
For those worried about mammoth veterinary bills, there is pet insurance. The American Humane Association, the country's oldest animal-protection society, endorses the idea for anyone who is either unwilling or unable to afford care for their pets. "If you have a pet you love, why put it to sleep if you can cure it?" asked Jack L. Stephens, who founded Veterinary Pet Insurance, the Anaheim, Calif., outfit that covers furry friends.
But remember that treatment for most routine ailments is rarely a significant blow to the family finances. While care can run into the thousands of dollars, the average claim paid by Mr. Stephens's company is only $220. Unless you are on a limited budget, it makes more sense to bank those premiums -- $100 or so a year -- and save for any unexpected bills.
What's more, like most other insurance, the pet policies exclude pre-existing conditions. For instance, if your cat has been diagnosed with feline leukemia, it will not be covered until it is considered disease-free for six months.

Broadway Ticket Insurance
Does a missed evening on Broadway constitute a financial catastrophe? Hardly. But that doesn't mean you can't buy insurance to protect you. For $5 a ticket, Theatre Direct Inc., a New York ticket agency, will give you a refund if you can't make it to the show after buying tickets. The catch is that you have to cancel in writing and return the tickets two business days before the show -- no protection against a sudden case of flu or gridlock on the Long Island Expressway.
And a family of four would be out only $320 if, say, they were forced to miss "Cats" -- unfortunate, maybe, but hardly enough to plunge anyone into bankrutpcy. The risk of missing the musical also seems small: only 5 percent of those who have purchased the insurance have returned their tickets since the coverage was first offered earlier this year, said Bruce Amick, the agency's director of operations.
If you really hate the idea of being out all that money, resell the tickets yourself, which is what Theatre Direct does. While Mr. Amick notes that finding someone to buy your "Cats" tickets will be harder than selling orchestra seats for "Rent," it is certainly not impossible. Otherwise, chalk it up to bad luck.
So remember: a little insurance here, a little insurance there, and pretty soon you're out a tidy sum. Take a couple about to be married: they could spend about $200 for wedding insurance, $12 for flight insurance, $165 or so for trip-cancellation insurance, $100 in liability insurance for their rental car, $10 for Broadway ticket insurance, and who knows what else -- a total of about $500. If they are anxious enough to buy all that coverage, they might want to splurge instead on a few sessions with a good therapist.

How Will Wall St. Vote on the Vote?

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
LESS than two weeks ago, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell back below 6,000, there was plenty of talk that the threat of a Democratic takeover of the Republican-controlled Congress -- President Clinton's re-election being taken for granted -- was already sending tremors through the stock market.
But by the end of last week, all that conventional wisdom seemed to be forgotten. Even before the October employment data were released on Friday, the latest economic data -- especially the very moderate third-quarter increase in wages and benefits -- helped push the Dow back over 6,000. More important, the yield on the 30-year bond plunged to 6.64 percent, its lowest since April. 
 So is the election not worrying the market? No. But it is a lot easier for investors to dismiss such political concerns if the more important, fundamental economic forces that move markets over the long term are going in the right direction. That is, until the election results are in. Then, the market will react.
But don't look for a Wall Street consensus: the opinions on what happens after Election Day are sharply divided. In other words, the tips on how to play the election results have their risks.
David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, predicts a Dow decline to 5,800 -- a 3.7 percent drop -- if the Democrats sweep Congress. "It would be hard to make a new high before the end of the year while we waited to see what they would do," he said.
Joseph V. Battipaglia, the chief investment strategist at Gruntal & Company, disagrees.
Unless the Democrats unexpectedly win an overwhelming victory in Congress, "there will not be any substantive change in policy," Mr. Battipaglia said. Democrats "are being more conservative and not upsetting the apple cart," he added, which should keep in check the more liberal Democrats who are in line to head some key committees.
He acknowledges that the shock of such a change would send bonds and stocks immediately lower. But a recovery would follow. He said investors would see continued good news on inflation, hear the new Democratic leaders talking centrist themes and see a moderate Cabinet from President Clinton. "Then the market becomes accustomed to that," he said. "It sees that there will not be big changes and gets back to the economic fundamentals."
A Democratic sweep, of course, is only one of several election scenarios -- and not the most probable. The most likely outcome is that the Washington status quo will prevail. If not that, the Republicans may well keep control of either the House or the Senate, probably the Senate.
And then there is always the possibility, though it may seem remote based on current polls, that Bob Dole will pull off an upset.
And where does Wall Street stand? "The market wants a status quo election," Mr. Shulman said. "They view this as the best of all possible worlds."
If the status quo persists -- and that's the expectation among those taking bets in the University of Iowa political futures market -- then it is likely that the economic fundamentals, which ruled last week, will continue to do so. Steady or declining interest rates, a moderate pace of roughly 2.5 percent economic growth and continued low inflation all could help push stock prices higher.
But two other status-quo scenarios could be more troubling.
One is that Mr. Dole may be right in prophesying that the slowdown of the economy in the third quarter is not foreshadowing a soft landing and subsequent rebound but a recession just around the corner. Economic downturns don't help stocks.
The other is the revenge of the Republicans. If they maintain control of Congress, they surely will step up the investigations of the President, throwing in the latest disclosures about campaign contributions from foreigners for good measure. The Justice Department has already taken the first step in deciding whether to ask for the appointment of a special prosecutor, who would be the fifth special prosecutor looking into accusations of wrongdoing on the part of current or former Clinton Administration officials.
How that plays out in the markets is hard to say. If the investigations intensified gridlock between the White House and Congress, little may be done to cut Federal budget deficits or retool the ailing Medicare program. If the investigations begin to look worse for the President, that could also hurt. "Typically, the market does not like weak Presidents," Mr. Shulman said.
And for those who think the past is a guide to the future, there is always the hope that history might repeat itself. The problem is in figuring out whose textbook to trust.
To begin with, in every Presidential election year since 1952, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose in the fourth quarter. With the average increase for Democratic winners at 3.9 percent, that implies the S.& P. index, which closed Friday at 703.76, could move another 1.5 percent, to 714.12.
Kenneth L. Fisher, the chief executive officer of Fisher Investments Inc. in Woodside, Calif., takes a longer view. In nearly every Presidential election since 1928, he found, the S.& P. 500 fell in the first or second year of the new term.
But like most election tips -- beyond remembering to vote -- there is a catch.
There have been three exceptions, starting with Truman. While the S.& P. 500 fell in the fourth quarter after Truman's stunning victory, it climbed in 1949, 1950 and then in 1951 and 1952. Then came Ronald Reagan's second term, which also turned into four up years for the S.& P.
The third? President Clinton, who is gunning for his own four-year run.

Quaker Waking Up to a Snapple Hangover

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
QUAKER OATS may be gearing up to report its biggest loss ever.
The loss, stock analysts and institutional investors say, would be a bookkeeping write-off of $1 billion or more in the current quarter to put a realistic value on the Snapple beverage business that Quaker bought for $1.7 billion in 1994. 
 Such a move would plunge reported earnings for the year deeply into the red. The consensus estimate of 19 stock analysts who follow Quaker is $1.28 a share in profits this year, according to Zacks Investment Research. A $1 billion write-off would amount to well over $7 a share.
Considering the close attention investors have been paying to Snapple's disastrous performance, though, stock analysts see no reason for such a write-off to make a big dent in Quaker's stock, which ended Friday's trading at $35.25 a share.
Facing facts in an accounting sense might be extremely embarrassing for William D. Smithburg, Quaker's embattled chairman, but the write-down would have no impact on cash earnings, on the prospects for reviving Snapple or on Quaker's other businesses. Nor would it address what's really on Wall Street's mind: How soon will Mr. Smithburg do something to live up to his promise to lift Quaker's market value?
Mr. Smithburg has no easy choices. Michael Mauboussin of CS First Boston is the only stock analyst confident enough of swift progress to recommend Quaker shares. He expects some strategic move that will push the stock price up to the low 40's in the next three to six months.
Greg Jackson, an analyst at Yachtman Asset Management in Chicago, a large Quaker shareholder, said, "The truly economical thing would be to sell Snapple and use the loss to offset capital gains on pet foods," referring to the company's 1995 sale of its pet foods business to Heinz in the United States for $725 million and to Dalgety P.L.C. in Europe for $700 million.
Mr. Jackson concedes that it may be hard to get a good price, say $700 million or more, for Snapple. Any purchaser would be hobbled by many of the problems weighing down Quaker, including distribution contracts that prevent Snapple from retreating to the East and West Coasts where its products are most popular.
The global solution would be to sell all of Quaker. The company has long been considered a takeover candidate because it is the smallest major food conglomerate. No rival is interested in all of its businesses, but analysts point out that Philip Morris, for example, might snap up Quaker's food businesses to merge with its Kraft subsidiary if it could line up a quick buyer for the beverages. Analysts estimate the breakup value of Quaker at $45 to $50 a share.
The simplest move might be to sell or spin off Gatorade, which analysts say is worth more than $2 billion. But a sale would saddle the company with a big taxable gain. Moreover, the companies that might be most attracted to Gatorade, Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, might face antitrust problems if they bought it.
Some analysts say the best course would be to package Snapple with Gatorade, taking Quaker out of beverages altogether. But such an alignment could hurt shareholders by discouraging a buyer from paying top dollar for Gatorade.
There's one good reason why Quaker is cautious about moving hastily. Snapple may be much easier to sell or spin off, with or without Gatorade, if its new management team, led by Michael Schott, can make it even marginally profitable next year. Snapple lost $55 million last year. It is expected to trim that loss this year, but remain deeply in the red. The first returns on whether Mr. Schott has found a path to profitability won't be in until late spring.
The uncertainty is hard for Wall Street to swallow. "It would be close to a buy at its current level if they just had a clear plan for getting rid of Snapple," said Steven Galbraith, who follows the company for Sanford C. Bernstein. He raised Quaker from a sell recommendation to a hold when the stock hit $31 in July.
Quaker said it would not comment on when or whether it would take a write-off on Snapple before it had completed its long-range plans.
Wall Street is not always rational when it comes to writing off good will, the excess amount that an acquiring company pays over the tangible value of the acquired company's buildings, inventory and other physical assets. When Sony took a $2.7 billion write-down on its investment in two Hollywood film studios, Columbia and Tri-Star, its shares plunged 5.6 percent that day. When the Allegiance Corporation, a medical products spinoff of Baxter International, said on Friday that it would take a $550 million charge for good will, its stock rose 6 percent, to $19.875.
Some analysts say a slight stock bounce would be the most logical outcome of a Quaker write-down, since the company would no longer be amortizing the good will over 40 years, an accounting process that reduces earnings by about 12 cents a share each quarter. Without the good will, Quaker's reported earnings per share would rise, and that might encourage buying by technical traders, who follow numbers without looking at what's behind them.
But impatient investors could penalize the company for failing to take more drastic steps. On Oct. 24, Quaker's shares fell $1.75, to $34.625, in heavy trading when the company announced third-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. A stellar performance by Gatorade and the cereal business was not enough to offset disappointment that Mr. Smithburg did not announce plans to dispose of Snapple.
"He's bought about as much time as he can," said John McMillin, who follows food companies for Prudential Securities.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLATBUSH -- CINEMA;
The Kings of Flatbush

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
As the neighborhood around the Loew's Kings undergoes a development renaissance, the city is attempting to sell the theater. The city's Economic Development Corp. is expected to invite developers to make new proposals for the property within the next month or so. SARAH KERSHAW
 
Structure -- Once known as the "crown jewel of Brooklyn," the 78,200-square-foot theater, with 3,692 seats, is the third largest performing space in the city. Its decor is an unusual hodgepodge of Art Deco, Baroque and Renaissance, and its enormous lobby, where theatergoers would play canasta and mah-jongg while they waited for performances to begin, features giant walnut columns, sweeping staircases, gilded ceilings, marble fountains and two huge Art Deco chandeliers.
 
Heyday -- On Sept. 7, 1929, the Kings, the flagship of the Loew's chain, opened its doors. The theater hosted some of the biggest performers of the day, who appeared to promote their films. Among them were Bob Hope, Milton Berle, Jimmy Durante, Eddie Cantor, Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, Cab Calloway, the Nicholas Brothers (above), Bette Davis, Joan Crawford and Marlon Brando.
 
Decline -- Despite decreasing attendance, the Kings stayed open through 1978, when the city took over the theater for nonpayment of taxes.
 
Rescue attempts -- The city solicited developers in 1990, restricting use to a theater format, but a proposal to turn it into a multiplex theater never materialized. Meanwhile, the structure fell into disrepair, and between 1987 and 1992 the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, allocated $1.5 million to renovate the roof and other structures and repair the theater's plumbing. Rough estimates put the cost of restoring the theater -- for any use -- at about $10 million.
 
Future -- Unlike the city's 1990 solicitations to develop the theater, uses of the space will not be restricted in new proposals. Although some other old movie palaces in the city are protected with landmark status, the Kings is not, which means developers could tear it down.

BYLINE: By HUBERT B. HERRING 

 BODY:

THE ECONOMY
Voting by the Numbers
Here's the familiar image: the American voter, heading for the polls, takes a hard look at the economy and then makes a choice. Now it might be overly kind to suggest that the American voter takes a hard look at anything except whatever ball is at that moment being passed, hit or dribbled on the tube. But assume, for the moment, the validity of the vote-your-pocketbook theory. Where did things stand last week as the Government bestowed its final pre-election statistics on a data-weary public? The picture's a bit fuzzy. Unemployment held steady at a relatively low 5.2 percent, and the monthly growth in payroll jobs was a healthy 210,000. But wages, which you'd think would flourish with such numbers, showed their slowest rise in a year -- 0.6 percent in the third quarter. Consumer spending stalled in September, and the overall economy slowed to a 2.2 percent growth rate for the quarter, prompting Bob Dole to cry that the sky was surely about to fall. If he's right and the economy does sink into recession, it will -- if Bill Clinton wins -- be a cruel joke on Republicans. For Mr. Clinton won four years ago just as, unknown to voters, the economy under George Bush was stirring to life; and this time, if a recession does lurk, it would be awfully tough to persuade voters of it now. The election aside (if that's possible), what do these conflicting numbers add up to? One theory: an odd hybrid known as a "growth recession" -- growth, yes, but nothing to get excited about in the voting booth.
 
STOCK MARKET
Let the Sun Shine In
They'll try anything to keep this stock market rally going. Now everyone knows that people feel gloomier when deprived of sunshine, but last week -- just as we were sent hurtling toward a bleak December with the end of daylight saving time -- the New York Stock Exchange proposed an expansion that would create a trading floor flooded with natural light. And sunnier traders would have to mean sunnier stock prices, right? The exchange, desperately in need of more space, proposed a trading floor floating above Broad Street, with a pedestrian passage below. Above would be an eight-story, glass-enclosed atrium, allowing traders to look straight up to the sky. They may still be in the dark a lot, though, for some crazy ideas are floating around about 16-hour, or even 20-hour, trading days.
 
WATER ECONOMICS
Restoring a River
The West makes such convoluted deals with its water -- swapping it, selling it, damming it up, sending it vast distances to create incongruously lush desert lawns -- that it's a wonder the stuff doesn't all evaporate in its travels. Now the weighty economics of water has taken yet another twist. Loans through the Clean Water Act are used mainly to treat water to get it up to Federal standards. But last week a deal was reached that for the first time will use such loans to restore a river -- the Truckee River, which runs through Reno. Hundreds of Western rivers, one expert said, are "garbaged up, dammed up or dried up." But this one will be restored by buying farmers' rights to the water, bringing -- in this spot, at least -- the whole water game full circle.
 
SUPERSTORES
Nike, Nike and More Nike
What is Nike trying to be, anyway -- the Microsoft of sneakers? It already has 37 percent of the world's sports-shoe market, and it has so many athletes in its pocket that when you see one endorsing a shoe, you assume the shoe will have that ubiquitous slash. Yes, faint murmurs are heard from, say, New Balance (2 percent of the market), that it has wide shoes, American-made shoes. But Nike makes the big noise, and that noise got even louder last week when it opened Nike Town on East 57th Street in Manhattan -- 5 floors, 5,000 products, 66,520 feet of sales space, a multimedia studio showing, naturally, films about Nike, you name it. But one shopper passing by on this ritzy stretch off Fifth Avenue had simply this to say: "no class."
 
 
 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
So There Are Mountains
Sorry, but it's good news/bad news time again. Southern Californians can actually see their mountains a bit more often these days (they're only about 10,000 feet high), for the air is the cleanest it's been in 40 years. When the "smog season" ended on Thursday (what a depressing season to have!), there had been just 7 severe smog alerts, down from 121 in the gasping year of 1977. Credit goes to reduced auto emissions and a reformulated gasoline in use since June. The new gas alone, the State Air Resources Board said, had the same effect as taking 3.5 million cars off the road. So that's the good news. The bad news: On 87 days this year, Southern California's air -- under Federal standards -- was still unhealthy.
 
PHILANTHROPY
A Tale of Two Numbers
It's funny how numbers, concrete as they are, tell only the tip of a story. Here are two sums in the news last week: $14.5 million and $15 million. Roughly the same, but what different facts lie behind them! The $14.5 million tells a long, rich, painful tale: it was the sum raised in Vienna at a Christie's auction of a bounty of art stolen by Nazis -- Old Master paintings, tapestries, porcelains, you name it -- with most of the proceeds going to Holocaust victims. The $15 million, in stark contrast, was what Bill Gates gave to Harvard, for computer and engineering programs. That was, though, the equivalent of an average person digging into a pocket for a few pennies. Mr. Gates is worth about 1,000 times that, though -- more than $15 billion -- and he's been criticized -- most publically by Ted Turner -- for giving away so little. But "I just started a family," he said; he'll focus on philanthropy later. For now, it'll be only pennies from Microsoft.
 
JOB SECURITY
Miserable on Broadway
The hot topic of job security popped up in an unusual place last week. It wasn't a downsizing exactly, more like a resizing. You don't normally think of actors as having I.B.M.-type lifetime careers (the old I.B.M., that is), but then you get these shows that just never end, like "Cats" or "Les Miserables," and you find actors getting mortgages instead of waiting on tables. Shows can get stale, though, and you can't let "long-run-itis" turn a musical into "Madame Tussaud's," said John Caird, co-director of "Les Miz." His solution, unheard of on Broadway: replace the cast. On March 12, for the show's 10th anniversary (it's outlived many a high-tech startup), the new cast will appear. And some new actors can get mortgages.
 
CAR LEASING
Zero, Give or Take $1,000
Some ads you can take with a grain of salt. It's "the best," they blare, but you know in your heart of hearts that hyperbole might have crept in. But "zero down" on a car lease? Sounds pretty precise, doesn't it? It turns out, though, that when Mazda says "zero down" (or, to be fair, "a penny down"), it neglected a $450 "acquisition fee" and other little matters. The total, to drive out the door, is actually more like $1,000. In response, 14 states have filed suit against Mazda, accusing it of unfair labor practices. Of course, as a Minnesota official put it, such fine-print sleight of hand "isn't limited to Mazda" -- but its ads were "especially egregious." Of course, in car-leasing roulette -- a game played by 25 percent of new-car drivers -- it's easy to be confused about just what kind of deal you're getting.

HEADLINE: The World;
Why China Has No Ears For American Demands

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
IN the last four years, America has remained right where it began in its efforts to change China.
As a candidate in 1992, Bill Clinton set his sights on making China's rulers -- dictators, he called them -- agree to stop spreading missile and nuclear technology to unstable parts of the world. 
 As a Southern governor who had campaigned for civil rights in America, he also was appalled at the harsh treatment of China's pro-democracy dissidents.
As President, Mr. Clinton asked why China's markets were closed to American firms while the American market was saturated with Chinese goods, which seemed to be one reason China was so rapidly becoming an economic power to be reckoned with.
 
 
 
I've Been Here Before
 Now, at the end of his first term and perhaps the beginning of a second, Mr. Clinton finds himself in a familiar place, in part because China's rulers are consumed by their own internal politics and remain an inflexible lot to deal with. Mr. Clinton did not help his case last year by getting into the middle of the mainland's reunification courtship of Taiwan with a visitor's visa for Taiwan's President and the recriminations that followed.
But the larger problem has not been the momentary miscalculations; China's leaders have come to believe that intransigence is rewarded when dealing with Washington; that a well timed fit of indignation to an American Secretary of State or a noisy military exercise can change policy in the White House. What a contrast to the 1970's, when Chinese leaders courted American approval because they considered the American relationship the key to China's modernization.
Today, the same "dictators" rule, only they seem stronger because they have spent four years standing up to what they call "American power politics" and "pressure tactics" and "interference."
After flirting with a more tolerant attitude toward free speech when Beijing wanted to host the 2000 Olympics, they have imprisoned dozens of dissidents whose only crime was to raise their voices. The latest example, last week, was the 11-year sentence for Wang Dan, a leader of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations of 1989.
In 1996, as in 1992, the Chinese Politburo refuses to discuss whether it supplied the design for Pakistan's nuclear bomb, as American intelligence believes China did, and whether it will provide continuing help to Pakistan and Iran as they pursue their arms buildups.
And, after considering a new stage of bold economic reforms in 1993, the Politburo feared they would lead to worker unrest and so China's moribund state factories remain protected by a fortress of trade barriers longer than the Great Wall.
If current realities did not count in politics, it would be easy to imagine America in recent decades as one of China's greatest friends and benefactors, helping with technology and aid to lift the lumbering giant of Asia out of the misery its people have long suffered.
That was the spirit of 1979, when Deng Xiaoping toured the country, met Jimmy Carter at the White House and wore a 10-gallon hat at a Houston rodeo. Anything seemed possible then, because China seemed to be listening to what America wanted from it.
But recent history has interfered: the Tiananmen massacres in 1989, the secretive nuclear assistance to Pakistan in the 1980's and 1990's, and the continued barriers to America in most of China's market.
In such circumstances, perhaps there is another way to approach the Chinese.
In 1984, when Mikhail Gorbachev was emerging as the most promising successor to the post-Brzezhnev line of Soviet leaders, the Reagan Administration made it clear to him that deep anti-Communist sentiments in Congress, and in American society, would prevent progress on ending the cold war unless he agreed to change Soviet behavior on a broad front, including human rights, an end to military confrontations and a general raising of the Iron Curtain.
China has never been the global enemy that the Soviet Union was during the cold war, and it is not in the state of economic near-collapse that impelled Mr. Gorbachev to accept Mr. Reagan's terms.
But there are similarities in the political problem Beijing has handed American leaders.
Beijing wants to make progress on the trade and economic front. Forty percent of its exports are sold to Americans.
China needs more American capital and technology to develop its industries and power plants.
Beijing's leaders also need an end to American sanctions against high technology sales.
But Beijing's insecure leaders refuse to help any American leader make the political case for ending the lesser cold war that exists across the Pacific. China, its leaders say, will change in its own good time. Meanwhile, America should make the concessions.
Deng Xiaoping, still brooding after the Tiananmen massacres, said as much to former President Richard Nixon on a visit to China in October 1989: "The United States should take the initiative, but it's not possible for China to do so, because the U.S. is strong and China is weak, China is the victim. Don't ever expect China to beg the United States to lift the sanctions. If they lasted 100 years, the Chinese would not do that."
The men poised to succeed Mr. Deng seem even less capable of initiative. And no Gorbachev-like figure has emerged in China to find the voice with which to talk plainly to an American President. But that does not have to prevent an American leader from speaking more directly to China about the minimum standards of behavior it expects Beijing to meet
For four years, Mr. Jiang and his hard-line Prime Minister, Li Peng, have refused to move decisively to end the captivity of so many political prisoners or to disclose what Beijing's scientists helped erect in Pakistan's nuclear basement.
 
 
 
Standing Pat
 They have refused to end the simmering military confrontation that threatens Taiwan, and they have refused to demonstrate to the people of Hong Kong or Taiwan that sovereign confederation with the mainland is a safe bet for keeping their freedoms. And, grimly, China's secret policemen have turned Tibet into a windowless prison.
Like President Clinton in his first term, whoever is President next year will be far freer to take political risks over China than the Presidents who faced the Soviet Union, if only because there is no consensus on China.
But Beijing's leaders seem to be betting that they can keep getting concessions from Mr. Clinton without paying any price. By their refusal to bend, they betray their fear that what Mr. Gorbachev wrought in engaging America was an end to the system that produced him and an end to his personal power. China's leaders think they can dig in their heels, even as their soaring economy drags them toward a future where monolithic control by the Communist Party will be laughable. But resistance has become their religion.
The next President is bound to try to pull them forward again in an effort to constrain these instincts. China is too big to ignore, even if the only reward for the struggle may be a return to the place where the effort started.

HEADLINE: Snooze Alarm;
The Year of the Yawn

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio

 BODY:
NOT a vote has been counted, but one return is already in: This will almost certainly be remembered as one of the dullest Presidential campaigns in recent times.
Bob Dole sees it in the small crowds he finds in his travels. President Clinton's aides, with perfunctory apologies, are already talking about the election in the past tense, wondering only how low the turnout will be. Local newspapers in cities like this one and network newscasts reflect the nation's mood by the amount of attention they devote to the contest between the two candidates, which is very little. 
 The conventional wisdom for 1996 is set: Even with Mr. Dole's furious campaign windup and questions about Mr. Clinton's fund-raising, this was the boring election -- just as surely as the 1988 Presidential election was the one that pioneered vicious attack ads. And if history is any guide, it is only a matter of days before the backlash begins, with flags raised about the damage a low-impact election inflicts on the democratic process.
But before the recriminations begin, one question needs to be answered: Is a boring Presidential election every once in a while really such a bad thing?
On the most obvious level, the placid waters of the 1996 Presidential campaign suggest a nation at peace with its politics. Many voters may simply choose to stay home. The economy is good, the country is not at war and President Clinton has rebounded from the depths of his unpopularity just two years before. Elections can be wrenching and divisive affairs -- witness Richard M. Nixon's contest with George S. McGovern in 1972. And after a run of particularly quarrelsome contests these past few years, voters might be grateful for an intermission.
The White House certainly thinks so. George Stephanopoulos, one of Mr. Clinton's senior aides and strategists, argues that a Presidential contest that he predicts will leave "no cultural imprint" is a healthy sign of "maturity and community" in the country. From that high point, Mr. Stephanopoulos jumped to offer a more self-interested analysis of what he views as its benefits.
"When you're an incumbent, and the economy is doing well," Mr. Stephanopoulos said recently, "boring is good."
But while this campaign was dull, there is a strong argument that it should not have been. The 1996 contest had the potential to be an ideological pivot, comparable to Franklin D. Roosevelt's second Presidential victory in 1936 against Alfred M. Landon (a Kansan like Mr. Dole), a win that inspired Mr. Roosevelt to title his Presidential papers that year, "The People Approve." What the people approved in 1936 was Mr. Roosevelt's activist view of government, and it set the political tone for this country for close to 40 years. What the people might have approved this year -- had Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton been more obliging -- was either of the competing views of government presented by House Republicans in 1994 or by the more governmentally ambitious Mr. Clinton who ran in 1992.
 
'Me Too'
Why the political campaign turned out the way it did is a reflection on both the skills of Mr. Clinton and the shortcomings of Mr. Dole. From the start of this contest the White House did all it could to diminish interest in the race. Candidate Clinton in 1992 blazed out of New Hampshire brimming with fresh ideas: He would guarantee health care for all, end welfare as we know it, reform the campaign finance laws, provide college scholarships that would be paid with public service and reduce the size of government. Those ideas stirred small audiences in the grange halls of New Hampshire in January 1992, and huge audiences in college gyms at this time four years ago. For better and for worse, they set the tone for Mr. Clinton's first two years in office.
This year, a politically chastened and timorous Mr. Clinton ran on a far lighter agenda. And he proceeded to embrace Republican positions with such relentless efficiency that Mr. Dole was left taunting his opponent as the "Me Too" President. There was not much else for the Republican Presidential nominee to say.
And even if there had been much to talk about, Mr. Dole was not the man to do it. Mr. Dole's performance this year made clear that communication or vision -- "so-called vision," as Mr. Dole liked to call it -- was not his strength. He never presented a vision for the country because, it became clear, he could not. He never had to during his years as a legislative leader in Congress. And he was uncomfortable with the hard economic and social lines drawn by Speaker Newt Gingrich and Republicans in the House, when they took power in 1994.
 
Flight From the Contract
Like Mr. Clinton, Mr. Dole made his own pragmatic ideological calculation last spring that linking himself to Mr. Gingrich's policies would doom his race for the Presidency. With Election Day now upon him, more than a few members of Mr. Dole's party, and a few academics, are arguing that he might have found a way to associate himself with the more attractive elements of the Contract With America, without being scuttled by association with Mr. Gingrich. But he never tried to do that.
"From the Republican standpoint, what the Congress has done over the last year and a half -- and what they have tried to do -- could be defended a lot more strongly and intelligently than Dole has managed to do," said William G. Mayer, an assistant professor of political science at Northeastern University. Or as Mr. Stephanopoulos put it: "We had a lot of help from Dole. He never made news."
Students of American elections, the very people who tend to define the conventional wisdom every four years, are suggesting that the country will pay a price for a bland election. "It's bad because what a campaign should be is something that exposes hidden facets of these candidates -- and that gives us a better opportunity to judge them as potential Presidents," said Michael R. Beschloss, the historian. "When you've got a campaign that doesn't really do that, what it means is you're left at the end of the campaign with the same information you had at the beginning."
Doris Kearns Goodwin, the Presidential biographer, said with the campaign ending she felt a profound sense of disappointment, particularly after the hopes raised by Mr. Clinton's ambitious candidacy of 1992. "I remember feeling that I wanted my kids to live through one of those periods when people really cared about politics," Ms. Goodwin said. "I look back at the 60's -- being part of the civil rights movement and going to Mississippi. It makes you feel large.
"Human nature hasn't changed," she continued. "That capacity to get involved is still there. But campaigns now are not designed to bring that out in people."
 
Democracy in Distress
Those comments are reminiscent of the warnings echoed after most recent elections. In 1988 it was the hard edge of President George Bush's campaign against Michael S. Dukakis, which many politicians and academics said polluted political discourse. In 1992 voters were alienated by excessive attention to the mechanics of politics -- focus groups, polling, production of advertisements -- rather than a discussion of policy. In retrospect, it's unclear whether either contest caused lasting damage to the nation.
But 1996 is one case where the warnings might prove right: there really might be a price to be paid for this election, in the form of four more unsettled years in Washington and some important decisions delayed. If Mr. Dole wins, the only mandate he can claim is to push through his tax-cut plan. Mr. Clinton would take a second term with even less guidance from voters. Should Mr. Clinton decide to pursue an unpopular political initiative -- which is what many of his supporters from the left hope he will do if he wins this, his last election -- he will have to do so without citing the election returns as an endorsement of his platform or philosophy. In 1992 he was able to refer to his election when he presented his proposal for universal health care to Congress.
The elections of 1992 and 1994 hinted at what might have been. The election of 1996 had all the potential to resolve the unanswered questions of those previous contests.
Of course, voters might be getting exactly what they want. Maybe the campaign was boring because Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole both sensed that America wasn't ready to make a stark choice; remember that the campaign season's top epithet was "extreme." Resolving the conflicts of a political era is interesting, but sometimes people prefer the less stirring course of groping for a middle ground.
For better or for worse, that bridge -- to borrow perhaps the only memorable metaphor of this long campaign -- will not be crossed anytime soon.

HEADLINE: Word for Word/Will Rogers;
To an Enduring Wit, Election Day Was More Fun Than Halloween

BYLINE: By ANNE CRONIN 

 BODY:
"ALL I know is just what I read in the newspapers." Will Rogers's famous setup line could also have been, "All I know is what I write in the newspapers." In 1922 the humorist, who became known as the "Cowboy Philosopher" while working in the Ziegfeld Follies, agreed to produce a weekly column for The New York Times and the McNaught Newspaper Syndicate that would echo his stage material. His first Sunday column appeared in The Times on Dec. 24. By the time of his death at 56 in a plane crash in 1935, Rogers's daily syndicated column and his special dispatches to The Times had 40 million readers -- a third of the American population.
Rogers opined on everything from bootleggers to baseball, but (like a certain latter-day rich Texan) the Oklahoman saved his best digs for politics. Rogers always claimed that this was fate, since his birthday, Nov. 4, 1879, happened to be Election Day. 
 These newspaper writings, some from The Times and some from the syndicated columns, may have originally taken aim at Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover, but it does seem that the fellow who "never met a man I didn't like" might have had premonitions of candidates to come. ANNE CRONIN
The reason I want to touch on the Senate today is that, as I am writing this, they are having what is called a filibuster. The name is just as silly as the thing itself. It means that a man can get up and talk for 15 or 20 hours at a time, then be relieved by another, just to keep some bill from coming to vote. . . . One Senator threatened to read the Bible into the record as part of his speech. And I guess he would have done it if somebody in the Capitol had had a Bible.
 
PUB-DATE: March 4, 1923
 
There is only one way to get even with Harding now and that is to leave him in there another term. Besides, the Democrats come nearer getting what they want when they have a Republican President than they do with one of their own. They wanted this League of Nations thing and couldn't get it with their own gang. Now it looks like the Republicans are going to give it to them under an assumed name [the World Court, which the Senate later rejected] -- of course, it may just be for spite.
Then the Democrats wanted the farm loans. Well, they got that. They didn't want the ship subsidy, so they didn't get that. So, personally, I think that it has been one of the best Democratic Administrations that the Republicans ever put on.

There's the one thing that no nation can ever accuse us of, and that is secret diplomacy. Our foreign dealings are an open book, generally a checkbook.
 
Oct. 21, 1923
Everything nowadays is a saying, or slogan. . . . Congress even has slogans: "Why sleep at home when you can sleep in Congress?" "Be a politician -- no training necessary." "It is easier to fool 'em in Washington than it is at home, so why not be a Senator?" "Come to Washington and vote to raise your own pay." . . .
Even political campaigns are run and won on slogans. Years ago some fellow run on "the Full Dinner Pail" and after he was elected they opened it and there was nothing in it. . . .
Some fool that didn't know American politics had J. W. Davis run on "honesty." Well, that had no more place in politics than I have in the Harvard faculty. . . .
Coolidge ran on "economy," which is always good for the boobs. It's like getting up at a dinner and saying, "I am proud to be here." It's an old gag but it always goes. Economy beat honesty by 8 million, and as soon as he got in he raised Congress' and the Senate's salary and redecorated the White House. So away goes another slogan!

We are all in a lather over lobbying. If a man with no official connection can change a whole conference, it's not him you want to investigate; it's the "buys" that he influenced. If we have Senators and Congressmen that can't protect themselves against the evil temptations of lobbyists, we don't need to change our lobby, we need to change our representatives.
Any person that can't spot a propagandist and lobbyist a mile away must be so blind that they still think toupees are deceptive and can't tell a hotel house detective from a guest.

Come pretty near to having two holidays of equal importance in the same week, Halloween and Election, and of the two Election provides us the most fun. On Halloween they put pumpkins on their heads, and on Election they don't have to.
 
Nov. 2, 1930
Mr. Hoover, the consolation you have from the whole American people is no doubt greater than that ever shared by a losing President. There was nothing personal in the vote against you. You just happened to be associated with a political party that the people had just "lost their taste for." There is something about a Republican that you can only stand him for just so long. And on the other hand there is something about a Democrat that you can't stand him for quite that long. Nov. 9, 1932

There just seems to be something about running for President that you can never get out of a fellow's head. He never seems to figure his chances. It can be on an "off year," or "Leap Year" and just nominate him, and he is perfectly tickled to death. That he will wind up just being a defeated candidate never seems to enter his head. That "the time is not ripe for it" is as foreign to his thoughts as the moon.
 
Nov. 20, 1932
I was born on Election Day, but never was able to get elected to anything. I am going to jump out some day and be indefinite enough about everything that they will call me a politician, then run on a platform of question marks, and be elected unanimously, then reach into the Treasury and bring back my district a new bridge, or tunnel, or dam, and I will be a statesman.
 
PUB-DATE: March 11, 1933
I generally give the party in power, whether Republican or Democratic, the more digs because they are generally doing the country the most damage, and besides, I don't think it's fair to jump too much on the fellow that is down. He is not working -- he is only living in hopes of getting back on the graft in another four years.
 
PUB-DATE: May 14, 1933
The phenomenal popularity of the Roosevelt Administration now meets its severest test. They are starting to decide where all this money they have been appropriating will come from.

HEADLINE: War's Plunder and the Swiss;
The New Old News of Nazi Loot

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
IT is sensational news: tales of looted gold, stolen art treasures and other wartime plunder secretly passing from the Nazis to the well-manicured hands of bankers in Switzerland.
The steady drumbeat of recent stories has fascinated readers and viewers. But a small group of historians and writers who have researched the subject say they are baffled: Why has the known suddenly become news? 
 "The basic outline of all of this has been known for many years and for people to pretend they have sensational new stuff is simply not true," said Arthur L. Smith Jr., a retired professor of history at California State University and the author of "Hitler's Gold" (Berg Publishers, 1989).
History sometimes has a curious way of lying dormant before the right spark ignites attention and touches off wide reverberations. The current firestorm over Swiss banks appears to have been stoked by the end of the cold war, the 50th anniversary of World War II and a recent convergence of political interests.
"In 1996, it seems to be ringing the right bells," said Marc Masurovsky, who has studied the "Safehaven" program, the American wartime effort to prevent the Nazis from secreting wealth to neutral countries like Switzerland. Records from that program are the source of some of the supposed new revelations, but Mr. Masurovsky said, "Anyone could have walked into the National Archives in the 1970's and seen these documents."
It has long been known that after the war, Swiss banks were left with numerous unclaimed (and still unquantified) deposits made by Jews throughout Europe who were fearful their assets would be seized by Germany. Many of those Jews later perished in the Holocaust. There has also been little doubt that Switzerland, fearful of Nazi conquest, accepted tons of gold looted from European governments by the Nazis as they marched across the continent.
But for decades the Swiss banking industry, which takes pride in its secrecy and discretion, thwarted inquiries about the fate of such lucre. And since the 1970's, recovering it had not been the top priority for many major Jewish organizations, which were occupied with more pressing matters like tracking down surviving Nazi war criminals. The collapse of Communism, however, reinvigorated Jewish efforts to reclaim lost wartime properties in Eastern Europe, and the 50th anniversary of the end of the war last year rekindled interest in the war's murkier episodes. It was only a matter of time before the focus became Switzerland.
Under pressure from the World Jewish Congress and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, the Republican chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Swiss bankers agreed this spring to let independent auditors for the first time to search their archives for any unclaimed wartime accounts.
The issue of unclaimed Jewish accounts became commingled with broader (and embarrassing) questions about Switzerland's handling of Nazi gold and about the accommodations this supposedly economically-neutral nation had made with the Third Reich. In September, the British Government issued a report saying that the Swiss could still be holding much of the Nazis' stolen gold.
As Switzerland's war past has leaped from obscure history books into the popular media, some new details have emerged, but a lot of history has been born again as news. One example: Mr. D'Amato's staff publicized "recently declassified" documents showing that the Wehrli Bank, a defunct Swiss concern, had been a clearinghouse for Nazi assets. The wartime history of that bank was well documented by Nicholas Faith, an English journalist, in his 1982 book "Safety in Numbers" (Viking).
Little-known facts often get lost in history, and sometimes it takes time, changing attitudes and the right circumstances for them to attract attention. In 1951, Seymour J. Rubin, a former American Government official, wrote in a legal journal about a 1949 pact between Switzerland and Poland under which unclaimed assets of Polish nationals in Swiss banks could be used to compensate Swiss citizens whose property had been confiscated by Poland's Communist regime. Many of those assets presumably belonged to Jews and others killed by the Nazis.
In that era of cold-war calculation, the United States may have been loath to antagonize the Swiss over the deal. But when Mr. D'Amato and Jewish groups released documents about the Polish deal at hearings in Washington last month, they created a furor. The deal even struck many Swiss as news, at least at first blush. In any case, Swiss officials promised to determine what happened to deposits affected by such agreements with Communist countries.
 
 
 
Cooperation
 Such cooperation is a sign that the postwar generation now in power in Switzerland may be ready to come to grips with the nation's past, and that may be the biggest change. Israel Singer, the secretary general of the World Jewish Congress, said, "Today, we are only dealing with responsible parties, not guilty parties."
But while new inquiries could yield genuine revelations, there may be disappointments. Mr. Faith, for one, suspects that the amounts of money left in the abandoned Jewish bank accounts are relatively small, because many Jews refused to believe the Holocaust was coming until it was too late and didn't have time to safeguard their assets. And the task of tracking down abandoned accounts 50 years later is daunting, because many were opened through middlemen and some of the banks active during the war have since collapsed or been absorbed.
Still, some progress has already been made. Even before agreeing to an outside audit, Swiss banks said they had found 774 accounts totaling about $32 million, a figure rejected by Jewish groups as absurdly low. (In the 1970's, the banks also conducted a study of unclaimed assets and said they had found $5.2 million, which they turned over to charity.)
Mr. Singer said his group and others would not be satisfied until they have a full accounting of all the property stolen from Holocaust victims.
"This is the last unfinished business of the Holocaust," he said. "It is time to draw a black line at the bottom and finalize these accounts."

HEADLINE: A Bulgarian Is Slain And Motives Are Many

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: SOFIA, Bulgaria, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Who killed Andrei Lukanov, the longtime Bulgarian Communist leader who was close to the Russians, friendly with the Americans and respected by many Bulgarians?
"This was 100 percent a political murder; he had a lot of information on corruption," said one of his confidants, Kancho Stoychev, publisher of Now, a newsmagazine here. 
 "He was a victim of accounts that had to be settled," said Ivan Tatarchev, the prosecutor who investigated Mr. Lukanov's Communist past. "It is no secret that he was one of the millionaires of Bulgaria. How he became a millionaire when he was a civil servant others can answer."
Friends and foes talk freely about the killing of Mr. Lukanov, 58, who was gunned down at midday on Oct. 2 outside his apartment house here in the capital. He was the highest-ranking Communist leader from the 1970's and 80's still active in the murky nexus of Bulgarian politics and business.
The bottom line, many Bulgarians say, is that there were plenty of motives for some current senior Government officials to want Mr. Lukanov out of the way, and there is little confidence here that anyone will be charged.
A spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry, Rossitsa Marinova, said the assassination of Mr. Lukanov remained under investigation.
Killings are not unusual in this crime-hardened country, but Mr. Lukanov's slaying was different. It was the first killing of a major political figure since the period between World Wars I and II.
Mr. Lukanov, who was born in Moscow and climbed the Bulgarian Communist apparatus to its Politburo, was widely respected, even by critics who said they could grudgingly admire though not approve of his political and economic tactics.
In the mid-1980's, as Deputy Prime Minister in charge of the economy, he was responsible for negotiating Bulgaria's foreign loans and setting up its trading companies abroad.
He helped engineer the ouster of the Stalinist dictator Todor Zhivkov in 1989. The first Prime Minister in post-Communist Bulgaria, Mr. Lukanov was believed to have been active in diverting Communist Party funds into businesses headed by former Communists.
When opposition forces won elections in 1991, Mr. Lukanov was investigated for embezzlement. The prosecutor's office charged him with using Government money for the financing of Communist Party activities abroad in the 1980's. But after he was elected to Parliament, he was immune to further prosecution.
As the Bulgarian economy collapsed this year, Mr. Lukanov came into sharp conflict with the current Prime Minister, Zhan Videnov, 37.
Mr. Lukanov wanted Mr. Videnov to make more concessions to the International Monetary Fund, experts here said. The two men also came into conflict over the power of rival economic groups: Mr. Lukanov was loosely allied to Multigroup, while Mr. Videnov was said to have links to Orion, a business group headed by his cronies.
When their political differences became wider, Mr. Lukanov started to brand Mr. Videnov's circle as "scavengers," apparently an allusion to the fact that Mr. Videnov's businessmen were still trying to profit from the pulverized Bulgarian economy.
Mr. Lukanov's associates say the former Prime Minister was ready to confront Mr. Videnov with corruption charges inside a meeting of the governing Socialist Party. Mr. Videnov has not commented publicly on the reports of corruption.
"Lukanov knew virtually everything and he was no friend of the groups around Videnov," said Krassen Stanchev, executive director of the Institute for Market Economics.
Mr. Stoychev said Mr. Lukanov hoped Mr. Videnov would go voluntarily. "He wanted the Prime Minister to resign, and his idea was to present information on the corruption in the Prime Minister's circle to the parliamentary group," Mr. Stoychev said.
Mr. Lukanov had been invited to attend the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars as a visiting scholar starting in October. Mr. Lukanov and Mr. Stoychev met the day before his killing to go over logistics for his trip.
"We were discussing such things as how to get a cheap hotel, rent a cheap car in Washington," Mr. Stoychev said. "He told me very briefly, 'Things are mature.' From this I understood he was ready to act. He was planning to unite people who are or might be opposed to Videnov and act through the parliamentary group." The next day, Mr. Lukanov was leaving his apartment for a meeting when, according to Mr. Stoychev, a gunman emerged from a car across the street and shot Mr. Lukanov at the front door.
At the funeral, many Bulgarians noticed that Mr. Lukanov's widow refused to shake the hand of Mr. Videnov, who had expressed his condolences and praised Mr. Lukanov.

HEADLINE: Matthew Miles, 69; His Research Led To School Reform

 BODY:
Matthew Bailey Miles, a psychologist and theorist on the educational process, died on Oct. 24 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 69 and lived in Tappan, N.Y.
The cause was lymphoma, his family said. 
 Dr. Miles, a former professor of psychology and education at Teachers College of Columbia University, was a senior research associate at the Policy Research Center of New York and Washington.
He studied what he called the "social architecture" of schools. His investigations of group dynamics, organizational development, school reforms and qualitative data analyses charted the field of educational change. He provided educators with guideposts for observing, evaluating and making constructive adjustments in the classroom.
He was the co-author, editor and author of some 20 books on such subjects as parent-teacher dynamics, networking, innovation and lasting school improvement. Over the years he conducted research projects for the Office of Education in Washington, the New York City school system, the World Bank and the Carnegie and Ford Foundations, among others.
Born to missionary parents in Burma, he graduated from Antioch College in Ohio and earned a doctorate in education at Teachers College, where he taught from 1954 to 1970.
Dr. Miles is survived by his wife of 47 years, Betty Baker Miles; two daughters, Sara Miles of San Francisco, and Ellen Miles of Montpelier, Vt.; a son, David, also of Montpelier; a brother, Paul R. of North Scituate, Mass.; a sister, Josephine M. Schuman of Phippsburg, Me., and three granddaughters.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: NORTH CAROLINA;
He Isn't Soaring This Time, But Helms's Foe Gains Ground

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C., Nov. 2

 BODY:
Six years ago, Harvey Gantt's race against Senator Jesse Helms was not so much a campaign as it was a crusade. The crowds were big and boisterous, the rhetoric broad and sweeping. Even when the Democratic challenger did not say so explicitly, the campaign was clearly out to make history, both by ending the career of a conservative icon and by electing the first black Southerner to the Senate since Reconstruction.
Either because North Carolina was not ready for him, or because Mr. Helms was, Mr. Gantt fell just short, losing 53 percent to 47 percent. The margin of defeat came from white voters, only 35 percent of whom cast ballots for Mr. Gantt, perhaps five or six percentage points less than he needed. 
 In his rematch against Mr. Helms this year, Mr. Gantt must capture the white voters he failed to persuade in 1990. To do so, he has focused his campaign not on the racial or social issues that Mr. Helms used to great advantage back then, but on a portfolio of populist economic issues -- increasing student loans, raising the minimum wage, creating tax credits and deductions for day care and college tuition, and protecting Medicare -- that have helped him define his differences with his opponent. There is more talk this year about Head Start than about history.
There are other contrasts with the 1990 campaign. At 75, Mr. Helms is six years older and noticeably less healthy. With the Republicans controlling Congress, he is more powerful, a factor that cuts both ways. Mr. Gantt has kept pace with the four-term incumbent in fund raising, with both men collecting about $7 million.
It is a Presidential year, which should drive up turnout. There are nearly 700,000 more voters on the rolls, many of them transplants who have moved to North Carolina to take advantage of a booming economy. And unlike 1990, when Mr. Gantt was blindsided by a Helms advertisement on affirmative action, the Democratic challenger has placed Mr. Helms squarely on the defensive in the final days of the campaign.
But the primary difference is that Mr. Gantt, hoping to de-emphasize the issue of race for the white voters he so desperately needs, has effectively focused his campaign on the question of which candidate most supports average families. With some voters, at least, the tactic seems to be working.
"I like his values on education and his ideas on taxes," said Debbie A. Oliver, a white 24-year-old mother of one who moved to Burlington, N.C., from West Virginia five years ago. "Jesse Helms, I don't know, he just seems like he's not for the everyday person."
There are still plenty of North Carolinians who disagree. Polls show Mr. Helms holding a slight lead, and most political scientists predict that he will win again, although few discount the possibility of an upset.
"It's never over because Helms's negatives are so enormous that if the right people turn out, you can beat him," said Ted Arrington, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. "But I don't think it's very likely."
Among his traditional supporters, Mr. Helms is beloved not only for his beliefs but also for his backbone. "You may not agree with everything he says but you always know where Jesse stands," said Cicely A. Steffen, a 56-year-old mother of seven children from Graham.
The wild cards in the race are the state's new voters, most of whom are white. Many are assumed to lean Republican, but not as far to the right as Mr. Helms.
Dr. Hodges Davis, an orthopedic surgeon originally from Louisiana who moved to Charlotte four years ago, said he voted Republican more than half the time but planned to vote for Mr. Gantt. "Harvey Gantt's not my perfect candidate, but Jesse Helms is just everything I'm against," he said.
But his wife, Rebecca, a devoted Republican, said she considered Mr. Gantt to be too liberal and planned to cancel out her husband's vote.
Mr. Helms is sticking largely to his traditional script. His television advertisements label Mr. Gantt a liberal and tie him to homosexual causes, a tried-and-true tactic for turning out the incumbent's conservative base. "He's raised millions from gay activists from New York to San Francisco," an announcer says of Mr. Gantt in an advertisement that hit the airwaves this week.
Mr. Helms has again used his advertising to insinuate race into the campaign, but in a far more subtle way than in 1990. A recent Helms advertisement contends that in the 1980's, Mr. Gantt "used his minority status" to purchase an interest in a Charlotte television station.
Late this week, the state Republican Party mailed fliers to half a million households in three Congressional districts pairing a photograph of Mr. Gantt with that of the incumbent Democratic member of Congress in each district. Two of the three, Representatives Melvin Watt and Eva Clayton, are black. "Eva's bad enough . . . do you want Harvey too?" one mailing asks, before asserting that Ms. Clayton has voted for higher taxes and spending and against balancing the budget.
Democratic strategists consider the fliers a racial appeal. But Robert Wilkie, the executive director of the state Republican Party, pointed out that mailings had also been sent into the district represented by W. G. (Bill) Hefner, a white Democrat. "The racial charge has become so trite now that it's lost its meaning," Mr. Wilkie said.
In 1990, Mr. Helms surprised Mr. Gantt in the last two weeks of the campaign with a now infamous television advertisement that showed a pair of white hands holding an employment rejection letter while an announcer suggested that Mr. Gantt favored affirmative action policies that would cost whites their jobs.
But this year, it is Mr. Gantt and his supporters who have put Mr. Helms on the defensive.
Mr. Gantt, a 53-year-old architect and the former Mayor of Charlotte, has used television advertising to criticize Mr. Helms for voting for cuts in the growth of Medicare, and Mr. Helms has responded with commercials that accuse Mr. Gantt of "running dishonest TV ads to smear Jesse Helms on Medicare." In public appearances, the Senator leads his crowds in chanting, "There has never been a vote to cut Medicare."
In both speeches and commercials, Mr. Gantt has spent the last week attacking Mr. Helms, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, because the private foundation that operates Mr. Helms's archives has accepted large contributions from major corporations and foreign governments, including Taiwan and Kuwait.
"When you are making policy in the interest of the United States Government, you shouldn't be tempted -- you shouldn't have this appearance of conflict of interest," Mr. Gantt told a crowd in Burlington on Thursday.
Mr. Helms has been forced to respond in speeches and in two separate commercials, and the charges seem to have thrown him off his stride. Answering a television reporter's questions about the gifts this week, Mr. Helms first asserted that he did not know who had contributed to the foundation but he told the reporter moments later that his own station was the second-largest contributor.
"You can't influence me," Mr. Helms told the reporter. "Nobody can except the truth, and you put that in your pipe and smoke it, old boy."

HEADLINE: AMERICAN PROFILES -- Oregon;
In This Campaign, the Most Telling Signs in Oregon Say 'Help Wanted'

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: HILLSBORO, Ore., Oct. 31

 BODY:
On the day that Bob Dole was saying, "The evidence of a weak economy is everywhere -- everywhere!" Brian Norris, a longtime Republican, wondered what country Mr. Dole was talking about.
For more than a year, Mr. Norris has been trying to find enough construction workers for jobs here in the Portland suburbs, where housing subdivisions and new software factories are sprouting like Douglas firs on the ever-wet Oregon coast. 
 Just recently, Mr. Norris painted a large plea on the sidewalk window of the temporary labor agency he manages here: "We Need More Workers." Even at pay up to $25 an hour, there are simply not enough bodies to fill the job needs of the roaring Oregon economy.
"There is a huge shortage of workers, especially in construction," Mr. Norris said. "You'd be hard-pressed trying to convince anyone that these are gloomy times."
Like Oregon, many other parts of the country, from Virginia to the Great Plains to the San Francisco Bay area, are experiencing a labor shortage, according to Federal Reserve Bank regional reports. Even as the growth of the nation's economy slowed last month, which prompted Mr. Dole's outburst on Wednesday, perceptions are something else.
What seems more convincing than any political posters in this election year, in Oregon as elsewhere, are help-wanted signs. They tell a story, reflected in polls here and in most other states, about an absence of fear and a surfeit of hope.
"Take off the mask," Mr. Dole said. "It's not Halloween. Take off the mask! The economy is not good."
In the little Oregon village of Progress, at a costume store called Party Depot, the manager, Nick Apap, was asked about business.
"Excellent -- the best Halloween ever," said Mr. Apap, dressed in a costume with jailhouse stripes. "The only problem is, we are having a lot of trouble finding cashiers."
Painted on his store window, as big as the sales posters, was a message: "Now Hiring!"
In 1993, more than 70 percent of the people surveyed in an Oregon poll said the country was headed in the wrong direction. Now, those numbers have reversed themselves, said Tim Hibbitts, a pollster.
From the vineyards of the Willamette Valley, where the last of this year's plump pinot noir grapes are being crushed, to the vertical playground of Mount Hood, where an early snowfall has brought October skiers to the slopes, politics has become something of an afterthought.
People say they have largely made up their minds about their choice for President, and they are voting for a status quo they can see no reason to change.
"I don't have much use for politics, but business is terrific," said Vern Hass, who at the age of 68 is enjoying a second career as a nursery owner near the town of Tigard. "Clinton's been doing all right and Dole just seems like he's not up for the job. My relatives will kill me for saying this, but I already voted absentee, and I went for Clinton."
Although there is a close race for the Senate seat of Mark O. Hatfield, a Republican who is retiring, and there is a tough fight for a freshman Republican Congressman, Jim Bunn, Oregon residents seem spent in a campaign they describe as interminable.
The talk on these afternoons of buttery sunlight is more likely to be about hunting elk in the Coast Ranges, or about why the Oregon Ducks are foundering on the college football circuit.
Oregon, with a population of just three million in an area that stretches from the Pacific Coast to the desert of the Great Basin, has long had a buoyancy of character even in the hardest of times. The state was founded as a farming pot of gold at the end of the Oregon Trail rainbow. Towns with names like Promise, Pleasant Home and Sunnyside are a long way from American Gothic.
But the state economy went into a severe tailspin in the late 1980's and early 1990's when its timber industry collapsed, and there was little to fall back on. Since then, Oregon has grown an economy that President Clinton has cited as a model for a trade-dependent future, with new high-tech factories turning out computer chips and wafers for sale around world. Last December, for the first time, employment in technology concerns surpassed that in forest products.
In the Portland metropolitan area, full of new homes looking out at the pyramidal 11,239-foot summit of Mount Hood, unemployment is around 3 percent. Intel, the California-based chip manufacturer, is investing $2.2 billion in new factories it is building west of Portland, generating demand for everything from wallboard laborers to booth operators at drive-through espresso shops.
Certainly, none of the scores of people interviewed in this state echoed Mr. Dole's sentiment that this is the worst economy in 20 years. Retailers are offering big clothing and food discounts as sweeteners to fill cashier jobs at $7 an hour.
"It's bordering on a boom town around here," said Bill Calder, an Intel spokesman who used to work for Senator Hatfield. Intel is hiring retrained former loggers for many manufacturing jobs, Mr. Calder said, but the company is experiencing "a tremendous shortage of software engineers."
"All you have to do is go into an electronics store and watch 40-inch televisions sail out the door," Mr. Calder said. "Or go to the auto dealer on Saturday and see new Hondas get sold in a frenzy, like it's a grocery store. There's a general feeling in the air that things are pretty good."
Much of the Oregon boom was driven by California exiles fleeing the recession in the Golden State. But now the migration north has slowed to a trickle, and still Oregon has little but blue skies ahead in the next five years, said the state's chief economist, Paul Warner.
Up and down the West Coast, where Mr. Clinton holds double-digit leads in the polls, there have been multiple-digit gains in employment. California, while its unemployment numbers are slightly higher than the national average, has made up the 500,000 jobs it lost in the early 1990's. Last month, a record-high number of people, 14,489,000, held jobs in California, and the state's 7 percent unemployment rate was the lowest since 1991.
In Washington State, the Puget Sound area is adding 50,000 new jobs a year -- a 4 percent growth rate that is more than twice the national average -- as the Boeing Company and numerous software concerns fatten their payrolls.
Mr. Norris, the Republican, is voting Democrat for President this year. He was laid off by United Parcel Service, but landed on his feet in this suburb west of Portland. He made up his mind on the Presidential race after the first debate and has paid little attention to politics since then.
"It was obvious after that debate that Clinton was going to win," Mr. Norris said. "I decided to vote for him because I think we need to look to the future, not the past."
He does not trust Mr. Dole's promise of a 15 percent tax cut, saying, "I have yet to hear how he's going to pay for it." And he likes the family leave law, which Mr. Clinton championed. Time, he said, is more important than money.
Voting in this state has become something of a jugling act, as the ballot is crammed with dozens of proposals. The airwaves are devoid of Presidential commercials but are jammed with arguments about the numerous ballot measures.
The beleaguered Oregon voter has to make decisions on such things as banning cows from salmon streams, using bait and dogs in bear hunts, raising the cigarette tax 30 cents a package to pay for health care, and deciding whether to count nonvoters as "no" votes on ballot measures. The last proposal would most likely end up counting some dead voters as "no" voters, The Oregonian noted in an editorial.
And there is a proposal to raise the Oregon minimum wage to $6.50 an hour by 1999, to put it well above the national minimum, which goes to $5.15 from $4.75 on Sept. 1, 1997.
A ballot measure that would require insurance companies to pay for alternative health care like herbal and vitamin remedies is the only real political issue that excites Bernhard Ruppel, a Republican.
Mr. Ruppel, who lives in the town of Boring, is a Dole supporter. He said his town's name would pretty much describe how people feel about the Presidential election.
"People are apathetic," he said. "They say Dole has already lost, to forget about it. Myself, I can't go for Clinton because of moral decline and Clinton's ethical problems."
Under the dryers and curlers at the Hair Hunters Salon in Hillsboro, the talk has not dealt with politics for some time, said Terri Stansell, the owner.
"Those who have talked about it said they were going for Clinton," Ms. Stansell said, "not because they like him, but because Dole doesn't do anything for them."
Independent polls show Mr. Clinton with a 20-point lead in Oregon, a state that has long been Republican but has gone Democratic in the last two Presidential elections. More typically, this state is full of independents. Signs for Ralph Nader and Ross Perot are more ubiquitous than Dole or Clinton signs in many areas.
Despite Oregon's recent run of good luck, there is a subcurrent of cynicism, even among the prosperous. Asked to rate the state of American democracy in this last Presidential election of the 20th century, Mr. Hass, the nursery owner, said, "Probably a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. We've lost some of our vision, our goals. You think of Washington, Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt. Those were Presidents you could get excited about."

HEADLINE: Tribe Famous for Horses Sees Future in Them

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS 

DATELINE: LAPWAI, Idaho

 BODY:
As Rudy Shebala walks through a pasture full of quietly grazing horses on a nickel-gray autumn day, a long-legged colt approaches him and nuzzles his arm, and Mr. Shebala reaches out and scratches the sleek beast's nose.
It is an unusual horse Mr. Shebala is stroking. This cross between an appaloosa and a rare Central Asian breed called akhal-teke is the centerpiece of a campaign the Nez Perce Indians hope will resurrect their horse culture, a proud tradition of selective breeding and horsemanship that was destroyed by a 19th-century war. 
 Tribal leaders also hope the breeding program will provide a "culturally appropriate" business on a reservation plagued with an unemployment rate as high as 70 percent.
Mr. Shebala, a Navajo Indian who is married to a Nez Perce, runs the breeding program. "We were once horsemen, we once raised cattle and worked our own land. These horses will help us get the old ways back."
The Nez Perce were famous among Western tribes for the quality of their horses and sophisticated breeding. In 1805, when Lewis and Clark stumbled out of the Bitterroot Mountains into present-day eastern Idaho after a torturous trip, the Nez Perce gave them food and shelter. In his journal, Meriwether Lewis wrote of the Nez Perce: "Their horses appear to be an excellent race. Many of them look like fine English coursers and would make a figure in any country."
In the summer of 1877, the Nez Perce were ordered by the United States Army to leave their homeland in the Wallowa Valley of eastern Oregon for a smaller reservation in Idaho. But the Indians fled. Some 800 men, women and children and 2,000 horses traveled more than 1,100 miles in four months, battling the pursuing Army, trying desperately to reach Canada.
Most were caught in a final battle in north-central Montana 30 miles south of asylum, where their leader, Chief Joseph, made the famous statement that he would "fight no more forever." The Nez Perce warhorses, bred over generations, were scattered, and the breed disappeared.
Deprived of their horses and with their nomadic existence at an end, the Nez Perce people severed contact with this distinctive part of their past.
"The loss of horses was like the loss of a good friend, like losing a dog," said Angel McFarland, whose parents are taking part in the tribal breeding program. "It's similar to taking away our braids, our strength; and with the horses, we have that strength back."
Four akhal-teke stallions were donated to the tribe by a Minnesota breeder. The idea is to blend the appaloosa's blocky, muscular traits as well as the distinctive "blanket" -- spots on the rump -- to the slim and elegant akhal-teke horse of Turkmenistan. Akhal-tekes are believed to be similar to the original Spanish horses brought to North America, which were the progenitors of the Nez Perce war horse.
The offspring, Mr. Shebala says, will be similar to the type of horse that was lost. The first foal crop of 24 horses was born last spring, and are distinctive looking, with long legs, an erect neck and a narrow chest and head. Along with their graceful look, they have been bred for their endurance and riding comfort.
This new breed, Mr. Shebala says, has been named the Nez Perce horse. "We want a horse that people will remember us for," Mr. Shebala said. A registry of the new breed is being created, and it is hoped that the demand for the horse will be enough to create employment for the tribe. The new breed has brought a renewed interest in the old ways on the reservation, where many stories handed down about Nez Perce horsemanship are still remembered. "My great-grandfather was called Man of the Horses," said Horace Axtell, a tribal elder. "He would walk a circle around his horses and they wouldn't leave it."
The breeding program dovetails with two others the tribe has developed to help young people. The Young Horseman's program aims to instill the horse tradition in 20 Nez Perce, ages 13 to 21, each year, teaching them to care for, raise and ride horses. Most of the participants had never been on a horse; now they are helping with cattle roundups and taking tourists on trail rides.
Another program, called Mounted Scholars, is for children from elementary to high school age who are doing poorly in school because of problems at home. Math, history and other subjects are taught, with the curriculum built around horses. Classes include riding instruction. "The outside of a horse," said Rosa Yearout, a board member of the program, "helps the inside of a kid."
The pride generated by the horses on a reservation beset with high unemployment and other social ills is almost palpable.
"His name is Skeeter, and he's my little horse, 'cause I always ride him," said one 12-year-old girl in the Mounted Scholars program, as she sat on an appaloosa. Children are taught about Jackson Sundown, the nephew of Chief Joseph, who was the saddle bronc champion at the Pendleton, Ore., roundup in 1916. With his braids tied together under his chin, the 50-year-old Nez Perce rode a horse name Angel to victory.
The Nez Perce program is part of a trend to create "culturally appropriate" development on reservations throughout the country. The breeding program, which has cost more than $500,000 so far, was financed by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Nez Perce tribe and a nonprofit group called the First Nations Development Institute, which promotes such businesses in Indian country.

HEADLINE: THE 1996 CAMPAIGN: The Election: A Voter's Guide To the Issues And Candidates;
Races in Connecticut for Congress and Plan to Widen Crime Victims' Rights

 BODY:

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 
Second District Candidates
 
EDWARD W. MUNSTER, 55, Republican. Retired statistician at Pfizer. Served one two-year term in the State Senate before challenging Mr. Gejdenson in 1992, a race he lost by 4,000 votes, and again in 1994, when he lost by only 21 votes.
 
SAM GEJDENSON, 48, Democrat. Seeking his ninth term, the dean of the Connecticut delegation to the House. A former farmer from the rural community of Bozrah.
 
The District
 
The Second is the state's largest district geographically, covering most of eastern Connecticut. It has been in flux economically as military jobs have declined and as gambling and tourism have increased with the rise of the Foxwoods Casino in Ledyard and the recent opening of Mohegan Sun Resort in Montville.
 
The Issues
 
As in his previous campaigns, Mr. Munster has characterized his opponent as a liberal and "career politician" who has lost touch with his constituents. Mr. Gejdenson has criticized Mr. Munster for his alliance with Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House. Both candidates say they support welfare reform, abortion rights and Medicare, though Mr. Gejdenson says the Munster-supported Contract With America would have "thrown elderly people out on the street." For his part, Mr. Munster has accused his opponent of playing the "Medi-scare" card with the elderly. On the sensitive local issue of Indians annexing land, Mr. Munster says that laws need to be changed to protect property owners, while Mr. Gejdenson says issues should be worked out between tribes and towns.
 
Analysis
 
After nearly defeating Mr. Gejdenson in 1994, Mr. Munster has been even more aggressive in this campaign. But Mr. Gejdenson has also been running hard. Both candidates have run negative advertisements. A recent independent poll showed Mr. Gejdenson leading by 13 percentage points, and his aides say he will benefit if Mr. Clinton wins a substantial victory in the state.
 
Fifth District CandidatesGARY A. FRANKS, 43, Republican. Seeking his fourth term; was the first black Republican elected to the House in 60 years. Former labor relations executive who lives in Waterbury.
 
JAMES H. MALONEY, 48, Democrat. Former state senator from Danbury and a lawyer; making his second attempt against Mr. Franks.
 
The District
 
The Fifth is economically diverse, with wealthy suburbs like Ridgefield and blue-collar cities like Waterbury and Meriden. Once a Democratic stronghold, it was seized by the Republicans in the 1984 Reagan landslide. It was the only Connecticut district George Bush won handily in 1992.
 
The Issues
 
Mr. Maloney is again trying to paint Mr. Franks as a Congressman out of touch with his district who has voted against moderate propsals like increasing the minimum wage and family leave. Mr. Franks defends his record while emphasizing economic development and his commitment to tax cuts and a balanced budget.
 
Analysis
 
Several factors may make this a close race: Mr. Franks benefited two years ago from having John G. Rowland, the Republican Governor who once held Mr. Franks's seat, on the ballot; and four years ago a third-party candidate split the Democratic vote. Mr. Maloney has also raised a relatively sizable campaign fund -- $440,000 as of Oct. 15 -- and is devoting more than a third of it to advertising. Mr. Franks raised $390,000, and has not campaigned aggressively, spending $85,700 on advertising as of Oct. 15. In addition, President Clinton's strong lead in the district may help Mr. Maloney.
 
But although Mr. Maloney has gained 5 percentage points since July 31, according to a recent independent poll, Mr. Franks still has a 10-point lead. To win, Mr. Maloney has to overcome a significant hurdle: many voters still do not know who he is.
 
Other House Races
 
(X denotes incumbents)
FIRST DISTRICT Kent Sleath, Republican; Barbara B. Kennelly, Democrat (X)
 
THIRD DISTRICT John Coppola, Republican; Rosa L. DeLauro, Democrat (X)
 
FOURTH DISTRICT Christopher Shays, Republican (X); Bill Finch, Democrat
 
SIXTH DISTRICT Nancy L. Johnson, Republican (X); Charlotte Koskoff, Democrat
 
PROPOSITIONS
 
Question No. 1
 
Under the proposal, the State Constitution would be amended to provide certain rights to crime victims.
 
As well as other guarantees, victims would gain the right to make statements to the court before a plea agreement was accepted or the accused was sentenced, would be entitled to restitution, could communicate with prosecutors, be notified of court proceedings as well as the arrest, conviction, sentence, imprisonment and release of the accused.
 
The Issues
 
Supporters, pointing to repeated instances in which victims have been treated poorly in court, say they want to "level the playing field" between the accused and victims.
 
Supporters of the proposition point to one celebrated case in Litchfield County: The mother of a murder victim, James B. Irwin Jr., was ordered by the judge to leave the courtroom, the judge publicly criticized comments made by the father, and they had to seek help from the State Legislature to receive a trial transcript.
 
Opponents say trials would be turned into victim advocacy programs, diluting the primary interest of justice: determining the guilt or innocence of the accused. They predict erosion of the presumption of innocence, and a diminishing of the court's position of detachment in enforcing the law.
 
They predict that a defendant could receive a lesser penalty if a prosecutor were persuaded by victims to reject plea bargaining and go to a trial when evidence is weak.
 
Analysis
 
Some 20 states have already approved similar resolutions. With the Connecticut Legislature overwhelmingly passing a resolution to place the issue on the ballot, the amendment is widely expected to pass, especially considering the unprovocative language of the question: "Shall the Constitution of the State be amended to provide certain rights to victims of crime?"

HEADLINE: THE 1996 CAMPAIGN: The Election: A Voter's Guide To the Issues And Candidates;
Guide to New Jersey Elections for the Senate and 13 Seats in the House

 BODY:

UNITED STATES SENATE
 
Candidates
 
ROBERT G. TORRICELLI, 45, Democrat. Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1982; has been a member of Congress's Committee on International Relations and its Select Committee on Intelligence. Lawyer in private practice from 1981 to 1982; later served as an aide to Gov. Brendan T. Byrne and as assistant counsel to Vice President Walter F. Mondale. Born in Paterson, now lives in Englewood. Has raised more than $7 million for this race.
 
RICHARD A. ZIMMER, 52, Republican. Elected to the House in 1990; has been a member of Congress's Committee on Ways and Means. Served in the State Assembly from 1981 to 1987 and in the State Senate from 1987 to 1990. Lawyer in private practice from 1969 to 1975; general attorney at Johnson & Johnson from 1975 to 1990. Born in Newark, now lives in Delaware Township, in rural Hunterdon County. Has raised more than $4 million.
 
PAUL A. WOOMER, Green Coalition Party
 
RICHARD J. PEZZULLO, Conservative Party
 
MARK WISE, Future Now Party
 
STEVEN J. BAELI, Protecting Freedom
 
WILBURT KORNEGAY, Independent People's Coalition
 
MARY JO CHRISTIAN, Natural Law Party
 
OLGA L. RODRIGUEZ, Socialist Workers Party
 
The Issues
 
Mr. Zimmer is a self-proclaimed fiscal hawk who has placed a priority on cutting spending and taxes and eliminating the Federal deficit. Mr. Torricelli says that he, too, wants to balance the budget but would fight cuts in Medicare, environmental protection and education aid.
 
Mr. Torricelli's television advertisements have focused on government services his opponent has voted to cut, calling him "too extreme for New Jersey." Mr. Zimmer, meanwhile, has attacked Mr. Torricelli's spending record, calling him "foolishly liberal," as well as his character, referring to the assistance he gave to the daughter of a fugitive.
 
Analysis
 
Polls throughout the campaign have found the candidates in a dead heat, but 50 percent of voters are not firmly committed to either candidate, an unusually high percentage for a Senate race.
 
In the final stretch, both campaigns have been criticized by political leaders around the state for the negative tone of commercials that have dominated the race, which they say have turned off voters.
 
Bob Dole's flagging campaign has not helped Mr. Zimmer, who has distanced himself from the Presidential candidate recently. President Clinton's significant lead in New Jersey bodes well for Mr. Torricelli, but both parties agree the race remains close.
 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 
Because ballot order is selected randomly by county, candidates are listed alphabetically.
 
Eighth District Candidates
 
BILL MARTINI, 49, Republican. Won election to the House of Representatives in 1994 after an expensive and bitter race against Herb Klein, a freshman Democrat. Served on Clifton City Council and Passaic County Board of Chosen Freeholders; also a former assistant United States Attorney for New Jersey.
 
WILLIAM J. PASCRELL JR., 59, Democrat. Has been Mayor of Paterson since 1990 and a member of the State Assembly since 1987. Previously served as Paterson's public works director and its director of policy, planning and development. Taught public school for 12 years and served as president of the Paterson Board of Education.
 
The District
 
The Eighth includes the blue-collar urban centers of Paterson and Passaic as well as suburban towns like Glen Ridge, Wayne and West Orange. Once a haven for Democrats, it is now highly competitive. Mr. Martini became its first Republican Congressman in 35 years when he won in 1994, with 49.9 percent of the vote.
 
The Issues
 
Mr. Martini has campaigned as a fiscal conservative, calling for more spending cuts and a reduction in size of the Federal Government. Mr. Pascrell has focused on social issues, attacking the Republican Congress's proposal to slow the increase in Federal spending on Medicare by $270 billion over seven years and calling for more federally financed anti-crime programs. Both candidates say they would support a balanced-budget amendment and a reduction of the capital gains tax.
 
Analysis
 
The Democrats consider this their best chance to win back one of the eight Congressional seats held by New Jersey Republicans. Mr. Pascrell has repeatedly linked Mr. Martini to the House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, and the Contract With America, much of which Mr. Martini supported during his freshman term. Mr. Martini has tried to distance himself from the Republican leadership, stressing his own environmental record and support for an increase in the minimum wage. The candidates have predicted they will spend more than $1 million apiece, making this the state's most expensive Congressional race. Leaders in both parties agree that it is also one of tightest.
 
Ninth District Candidates
 
KATHLEEN A. DONOVAN, 44, Republican. Has served as the Bergen County Clerk since 1988. Spent 19 months as chairwoman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and served one term in the State Assembly. Spent 20 months as chairwoman of the state Republican Party. Resident of Lyndhurst.
 
STEVEN R. ROTHMAN, 44, Democrat. Left his job as the Bergen County Surrogate Court judge in January to run for Congress. Mayor of Englewood from 1983 to 1988; currently works for a law firm in Saddle Brook while living in Fair Lawn.
 
The District
 
Covering parts of Bergen and Hudson Counties, the Ninth is one of the smallest in size and most densely populated of New Jersey's 13 Congressional districts. Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 2-to-1 ratio, and the district usually favors Democratic candidates, but half of the registered voters are independents.
 
Robert Torricelli, the Democratic Senate candidate, has held the Ninth District seat since 1982.
 
The Issues
 
The candidates have similar positions on many issues: both support abortion rights, gun control and federally funded environmental programs. Ms. Donovan has portrayed herself as a moderate who would not feel obligated to vote with the Republican majority and who opposes Bob Dole's proposal for a 15 percent tax cut. Mr. Rothman has focused on taxes and Government spending, criticizing "corporate welfare" and calling for a tax deduction for college tuition.
 
Analysis
 
Odds favor Mr. Rothman, since the district has elected a Democrat Congressman, Mr. Torricelli, since 1982 and Mr. Rothman shares the Democratic ballot with Mr. Torricelli and President Clinton. But both parties have devoted extra resources to this race, and it is considered close. And Ms. Donovan, who has better name recognition and is stressing her moderate views, is the district's strongest Republican Congressional candidate in years.
 
12th District Candidates
 
DAVID M. DEL VECCHIO, 39, Democrat. Has served as the Mayor of Lambertville since 1991. Once an aide to Gov. Jim Florio, is on leave from a job in the State Treasury Department.
 
MIKE PAPPAS, 35, Republican. A partner in a family-run insurance business who has served as a Somerset County Freeholder since 1984. Served one year as the Mayor of Franklin, in Somerset County, and now lives in Rocky Hill.
 
The District
 
One of New Jersey's largest and wealthiest districts, the 12th encompasses 41 towns in five counties.
 
It includes rural areas, shore towns and middle-class and wealthy suburbs. Most registered voters are independents, but the electorate almost always favors Republicans.
 
The Issues
 
Neither candidate is well known, and both have struggled for name recognition in a district that stretches from the Delaware River to the Jersey Shore.
 
Mr. Pappas is a staunch opponent of abortion; Mr. Del Vecchio supports abortion rights and has made it a campaign issue, labeling the race "the mainstream versus the extreme."
 
Both candidates have portrayed themselves as fiscal conservatives, calling for a balanced-budget amendment and a reduction of the capital gains tax.
 
Analysis
 
Mr. Pappas's opposition to abortion helped him defeat three more moderate Republicans in the primary, but the Democrats are hoping his conservative platform will alienate the district's large number of independents and moderate Republicans. The Republicans contend that Mr. Pappas's chances are strong in a bedrock Republican district whose popular outgoing Congressman, Richard Zimmer, is on the Senate ballot. Mr. Pappas has raised more money than Mr. Del Vecchio, and has outspent him in the final weeks of the race.

13TH DISTRICT Robert Menendez, Democrat (X); Carlos E. Munoz, Republican
 
PROPOSITIONS
 
Public Question No. 1
 
The environmental bond act being proposed would provide $300 million for dredging, disposal of dredged material and pollution cleanup: $205 million would be used to dredge shipping channels in North and South Jersey and to dispose of the dredged material; $70 million would be used to clean up polluted sites and water supplies; $20 million would finance economic development projects in South Jersey; $5 million would be spent controlling plant growth in lakes.
 
The Issues
 
Political and business leaders have long warned that New Jersey's ports, which pump billions of dollars into the economy, will languish if the polluted silt that has collected in shipping channels is not removed. They point out that since New Jersey cannot continue dumping contaminated silt offshore because of Government regulations coming into effect in 1997, this money would help finance alternatives. Critics, who argue against increasing the state's long-term debt, have been fairly quiet in any opposition.
 
Analysis
 
Businesses, labor unions and environmental groups have thrown their support behind the proposal, forming a coalition that has widely publicized and promoted it. Since New Jersey has a long history of approving environmental bond acts, this one is expected to pass if voters have learned about it ahead of time.
 
Public Question No. 2
 
An amendment to the State Constitution would dedicate 4 percent of the revenue from the corporate business tax -- about $48 million a year -- for pollution cleanup. One-third of the money would be spent on improvements to underground storage tanks, and at least one-sixth would be spent testing and improving water quality. The rest would be spent cleaning up polluted sites around the state.
 
The Issues
 
State officials argue that the Department of Environmental Protection, which stands to lose $10 million in the next fiscal year, can keep paying for cleanups at 100 polluted sites around the state only through next summer. By setting aside revenues from the corporate business tax, the proposal would guarantee a steady source of funds. There has been no organized opposition to the proposal.
 
Analysis
 
Since the amendment does not involve a tax increase, and New Jersey voters consistently rate the environment as one of their biggest concerns, this proposal has a good chance of passing.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE SENATE;
Democrats Battle Odds to Regain Senate Control

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2

 BODY:
Democrats could regain control of the Senate in Tuesday's elections, but they would have to overcome the odds and win more than two-thirds of the many races that appear to be close.
The outlook is unusually hazy because there has not been another year recently, party officials and students of politics say, when so many races for the Senate seemed to be up in the air this near Election Day and when so many voters were saying they had not decided on a candidate. 
 In New Jersey, for example, a poll this week showed that about one-third of those questioned planned to vote for Representative Richard A. Zimmer, the Republican candidate, about one-third supported Representative Robert G. Torricelli, the Democrat, and the other third were still undecided. [Page 48.]
Polls show close races in other states, from Maine to Oregon, in urban states like Massachusetts and Illinois and rural ones like South Dakota and Wyoming.
As a result, party control of the Senate in the Congress that convenes next year may be determined on Tuesday by the last-minute decisions of voters in more than a dozen states.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, predicted in an interview that Republicans would end up with 54 to 56 of the 100 Senate seats in the next Congress. His counterpart, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, is forecasting a Democratic victory.
But most independent authorities discount those predictions. "Anybody who is confident about the outcome of the Senate elections should be ignored," said Stuart Rothenberg, publisher of a nonpartisan newsletter about Congressional elections.
This is the arithmetic:
Republicans now hold 53 Senate seats to the Democrats' 47. That means Democrats must gain a net of three seats on Tuesday to have a majority, assuming President Clinton is re-elected and Vice President Al Gore can cast the tie-breaking vote.
Sixty-six senators (34 Republicans and 32 Democrats) are not up for re-election . Of the 34 contested seats, 19 are now held by Republicans, 15 by Democrats.
In 15 of the contested races, senators who are running for re-election seem to have their races more or less locked up. Ten of those senators are Republicans; 5 are Democrats.
In two other states, Kansas and Rhode Island, popular Congressmen, one a Republican and the other a Democrat, are the heavy favorites to replace senators from their party who are retiring.
That leaves 17 states where the vote in the Senate race could go either way. Democrats must win 12 of those races to have the 50 seats they need for a majority. Republicans need to win only 6 of the 17 to have the 51 seats they would need with a Democratic Vice President.
Such a disproportionate share of victories in close races, which the Democrats need to gain a majority, is unlikely, but it has happened.
In 1980, 13 Senate races were decided by 4 percentage points or less. Republicans won 10 of them and took control of the Senate. In 1986, 6 Senate races were decided by such a small margin. Democrats took 5 of those races and won back the Senate.
Mr. Rothenberg suggests that the likelihood of the Democrats regaining the Senate in this election is about 1 in 3. Charles E. Cook Jr., who publishes a competing nonpartisan newsletter that also handicaps Congressional races, puts the chances at no better than 1 in 4.
Both say that the best bet is that the close races will break more or less evenly between the parties. Based on past experience, the Presidential election will probably have no effect on the outcome of the Senate elections.
The Senate races this year have produced some of the most compelling political contests in years.
In Massachusetts, Senator John Kerry, a Democrat, is being challenged by the Republican Governor, William F. Weld. Both are tall, handsome, wealthy and articulate Ivy Leaguers with thoroughbred pedigrees, and they are proven vote-getters. The winner will have his ticket stamped to national prominence.
The race, which has been neck-and-neck all year, could come down to Senator Kerry's party affiliation against Governor Weld's personality. Democrats have a 3-to-1 advantage in voter registration in Massachusetts. Governor Weld has cultivated a charming, laid-back manner, while Senator Kerry sometimes seems aloof.
In North Carolina, Senator Jesse Helms, a Republican who is the scourge of liberals across the country and the implacable foe of Federal aid to the arts and whose campaigns over the years have often included subtle appeals to racial anxieties, is being challenged by a black architect, Harvey Gantt, a former Mayor of Charlotte. Six years ago, Mr. Helms narrowly defeated Mr. Gantt.
In Minnesota, there is another rematch. Senator Paul Wellstone, a Democrat, is facing Rudy Boschwitz, the former Republican Senator he ousted in 1990. Mr. Boschwitz could have run for an open Senate seat two years ago and probably would have won handily. But the word in Minnesota is that he preferred to seek revenge against Mr. Wellstone.
In Maine, the tight race to succeed Senator William S. Cohen, a Republican who is retiring, is between two candidates whose backgrounds could hardly be more dissimilar. Joseph E. Brennan, 61, has been on almost every ballot since he was first elected to the Maine Legislature in 1964. A liberal Democrat, he was Governor from 1978 to 1987 and a Congressman from 1987 to 1990. He ran for Governor again and lost in 1990 and 1994. His opponent, Susan M. Collins, 43, is a moderate Republican who has never held elective office.
Jill Docking, a stockbroker, has a chance to become the first Democrat elected to the Senate from Kansas in 64 years. She is running against Representative Sam Brownback to fill the last two years of the term of Bob Dole, who resigned to concentrate on running for President.
The other seat from Kansas, which is being vacated by Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, a Republican who is also retiring, will almost certainly be won by Representative Pat Roberts, also a Republican.
Representative Tim Hutchinson is hoping to be the first Republican Senator from Arkansas since Reconstruction.
One reason there are so many close races is that 14 senators (8 Democrats and 6 Republicans) are resigning. This is by far the greatest number of open seats since popular election of senators began in 1914. (Before then, senators were elected by their state legislatures.) The previous record was 10 open seats in 1978. Four of those open seats are in the South, and they could be the key to which party winds up controlling the Senate.
The Democratic Senators who are resigning -- Howell Heflin in Alabama, David Pryor in Arkansas, Sam Nunn in Georgia and J. Bennett Johnston in Louisiana -- almost certainly would have won had they sought re-election. That would have vastly improved the Democratic prospects of taking over the Senate. Now, all four seats are up for grabs.
Democrats calculate that they must hold at least two of those seats and probably need at least three to have a majority in the next Congress. Republicans are counting on winning at least two and think they may take all four.
In the close races, Republicans believe they have the edge in Alabama, Maine, North Carolina, Wyoming and Kansas for the Dole seat.
Democrats feel somewhat confident of winning in Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota.
If both sides are right, party control of the Senate will boil down to the elections in six states: Arkansas, Colorado, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Oregon.
If Republicans win just one, they will retain control of the Senate.

THE ARITHMETIC
Republicans now hold a 53-to-47-seat advantage in the Senate; 34 seats are being contested this year. Democrats must gain at least a net of 3 seats to win control of the Senate -- assuming President Clinton is re-elected and Vice President Al Gore has the tie-breaking vote.
 
SAFE SEATS: 11 REPUBLICANS
 
Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Larry E. Craig of Idaho, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, Phil Gramm of Texas, James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Ted Stevens of Alaska, Fred Thompson of Tennessee, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and John W. Warner of Virginia. In addition, Representative Pat Roberts of Kansas is expected to hold for Republicans the seat left open by the retirement of Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum.
 
SAFE SEATS: 6 DEMOCRATS
 
The Democrats are Max Baucus of Montana, Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Carl Levin of Michigan and John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia. Representative Jack Reed of Rhode Island is expected to keep for Democrats the seat left open by the retirement of Senator Claiborne Pell.
 
TOO CLOSE TO CALL: 8 SEATS HELD BY REBUPLICANS
 
Colorado
 Hank Brown is retiring
 Republican: Representative Wayne Allard
 Democrat: Tom Strickland, lawyer
 The environment is the biggest issue in this race, which looks like a dead heat. Clinton is strong in Colorado, and that could give Strickland a leg up. But a conservative ballot initiative on parental rights could bring Republicans to the polls and give Allard an advantage.

 Kansas
 Bob Dole resigned. His replacement, Sheila Frahm, was defeated in the Republican primary.
 Republican: Representative Sam Brownback
 Democrat: Jill Docking, stockbroker
 Both candidates are excellent campaigners. Brownback represents the most conservative wing of the party. Docking has never held office, but the name is well known because her husband, Tom, was Lieutenant Governor, and his father and grandfather were popular Democratic Governors. She has an uphill fight. Kansas has not elected a Democratic Senator since 1932.

 Maine
 William S. Cohen is retiring
 Republican: Susan M. Collins, former Cohen staff member
 Democrat: Joseph E. Brennan, former Governor and former Representative.
 In a battle of contrasting personalities, a moderate, pro-choice, 43-year-old Republican woman who has never held public office may have a slight lead over a 61-year-old liberal Democratic man who has been on the ballot running for one office or another for a quarter of a century.

 New Hampshire
 Republican: Senator Robert C. Smith
 Democrat: former Representative Dick Swett
 Smith, one of the most conservative Republicans in the Senate, is facing an unusual Democratic tide in what is normally the most reliably Republican state in the East, but Swett, a moderate Democrat, is by no means home free.

 North Carolina
 Republican: Senator Jesse Helms
 Democrat: Harvey Gantt, former Mayor of Charlotte
 A rematch of the 1990 race in which the conservative Senator used an 11th-hour advertising campaign to defeat the Democrat hoping to be the first black Southern Senator since Reconstruction. Few North Carolinians are neutral about Helms. He always has had close races. In the past he has done better on Election Day than he did in pre-election opinion polls.

 Oregon
 Mark O. Hatfield is retiring.
 Republican: Gordon Smith, State Senate president
 Democrat: Tom Bruggere, business executive
 Smith has already lost one Senate race this year, when he ran for the seat of Bob Packwood, a Republican, who retired in disgrace. Bruggere has never run for office before. Both men earned fortunes in business. The race is going down to the wire.

 South Dakota
 Republican: Senator Larry Pressler
 Democrat: Representative Tim Johnson
 Both men have repeatedly been elected statewide. South Dakota voters may have been subjected to more television commerecials on a Senate race than voters in any other state. This looks like the Democrats' best chance to oust a Republican Senator.

 Wyoming
 Alan K. Simpson is retiring
 Republican: State Senator Mike Enzi
 Democrat: Kathy Karpan, former Wyoming Secretary of State
 Usually Republicans get elected in Wyoming. Enzi has had surprising trouble locking up this race, but the smart money is probably on him.

TOO CLOSE TO CALL: 9 SEATS HELD BY DEMOCRATS

 Alabama
 Howell Heflin is retiring.
 Republican: Jeff Sessions, State Attorney General
 Democrat: Roger Bedford, State Senator
 All year, this has looked like the Republicans' best hope of winning a Democratic seat. Sessions still seems to have the edge, but Bedford cannot be counted out.

 Arkansas
 David Pryor is retiring
 Republican: Representative Tim Hutchinson
 Democrat: Winston Bryant, State Attorney General
 The outlook has bounced around all year. Lieut. Gov. Mike Huckabee seemed to have the seat sewed up. Then last summer, Gov. Jim Guy Tucker resigned over charges related to Whitewater. Huckabee decided to abandon the Senate race and become Governor. That made Bryant the favorite for the Senate. Then Hutchinson was persuaded to run for the Senate, and the race has become neck and neck.

 Georgia
 Sam Nunn is retiring
 Republican: Guy Millner, business executive
 Democrat: Max Cleland, Georgia Secretary of State
 Cleland is probably the betting favorite, and Democrats are confident of winning. But Republicans smell an upset in a conservative and increasingly Republican state.

 Illinois
 Paul Simon is retiring
 Republican: Al Salvi, former State Representative
 Democrat: Representative Richard J. Durbin
 Salvi, representing the right wing of his party, won the primary over a more moderate Republican. Democrats thought this handed them the Senate seat. Durbin, a liberal, will probably win, but Salvi has been a more formidable candidate than Democrats expected.

 Louisiana
 J. Bennett Johnston is retiring
 Republican: Woody Jenkins, State Representative
 Democrat: Mary Landrieu, former State Treasurer
 Jenkins may be too conservative on social issues for Louisiana. Landrieu must shore up her support among blacks. Landrieu seems to be ahead. But Jenkins, with strong financial support from the party in Washington, closed fast in the primary, and he could do so again.

 Massachusetts
 Republican: Gov. William F. Weld
 Democrat: Senator John F. Kerry
Neither man has a clear edge. Both are liberal on social issues. Weld takes the national Republican line on economic matters like limiting spending on social programs, while Kerry generally sides with the state's senior Senator, Edward M. Kennedy. The race may boil down to a contest between Weld's personality against Kerry's party affiliation in this normally strong Democratic state.

 Minnesota
 Republican: former Senator Rudy Boschwitz
 Democrat: Senator Paul Wellstone
 Wellstone defeated Boschwitz in 1990. Boschwitz is seeking revenge is a bitter match between ideological opposites. Wellstone is probably the most liberal Senator. Boschwitz was a middle-of-the-roader in his 12 years in the Senate, but he is running now as a down-the-line conservative.

 Nebraska
 J. James Exon is retiring
 Republican: Chuck Hagel, investment banker
 Democrat: Gov. Ben Nelson
 A month ago Nelson, a popular Governor with moderate political views, seemed to have an insurmountable lead. But Hagel, a proponent of tax cuts, seems to have rallied. Nelson is still favored, but late polls show the race to be close.

 New Jersey
 Bill Bradley is retiring
 Republican: Representative Richard A. Zimmer
 Democrat: Representative Robert G. Torricelli
 This has been one of the most bitter and costly races in the country. Voters will have to slog to the polls through all the mud that has been slung by both candidates in commercials and debates. DAVID E. ROSENBAUM (pg. 34)

HEADLINE: Fordham and Garden Renew Tower Dispute

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

 BODY:
In a clash that has spanned two years of discussion and legal challenges, two Bronx cultural titans, the New York Botanical Garden and Fordham University, are facing off again over a proposed radio tower on the college campus.
Last week, Botanical Garden officials, who say that the planned 480-foot tower for the campus radio station, WFUV, across from their property would mar the tranquillity of the garden's prized Conservatory, offered a new alternative: a flagpole radio tower measuring 185 feet that they said would be just as effective. 
 But Fordham officials accuse the garden officials of using the flagpole to delay an imminent decision by the Federal Communications Commission on whether Fordham can complete the radio tower.
"To insist that further exploration of hypothetical alternatives and continued public debate are required is simply another attempt to delay resolution of an unreasonably prolonged and increasingly costly dispute," said Fordham's president, the Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare.
A spokesman for the Botanical Garden, Karl F. Lauby, scoffed at the suggestion that the garden's proposal was a stalling device. The garden, he said, has come up with several plans that suit the needs of both institutions, including a tower designed by a team of engineers. He said that garden officials were puzzled about Fordham's stance and questioned whether Fordham was building the tower, which can be leased to other broadcasters, for financial gain.
"Fordham has known for months, since the summer, that the garden has been working on an alternative that involved a structure that was more esthetically pleasing and met their broadcast needs," Mr. Lauby said. "The idea that Fordham would suggest we sprung this on them and the F.C.C. at the 11th hour is ridiculous."
The skirmish between the two institutions began in May 1994, when Fordham began construction of the 45-story tower on Southern Boulevard across from the famed Enid A. Haupt Conservatory in the Botanical Gardens. The tower would replace an antenna atop a campus building, and its additional height, university officials said, was needed to comply with F.C.C. guidelines that seek to reduce public exposure to radio waves. Officials said the tower would also help the noncommercial station to continue to reach its audience of 15,000, which it depends on for support. The site, officials said, is on a firm rock foundation chosen after an exhaustive search.
Two months later, garden officials, who knew nothing of the initial plans, took their objections to the Building Department, which ordered an immediate halt to construction pending review. More than half the tower had already been built.
Garden officials argue that the steel structure, even at its unfinished height, intrudes upon swaths of pristine glens and flower beds on the 250-acre property, casting an ugly shadow over the conservatory, which is undergoing a $25 million renovation. At the least, they say, public hearings should be held to give Bronx residents a chance to respond.
"This part of the Bronx is one of the most beautiful areas," Mr. Lauby said. "The tower has a jarring impact visually. It mars the garden and really looms over the conservatory. The tower is a slap in the face to the Bronx. This tower would not be tolerated in Central Park or Prospect Park. It does not improve this part of the Bronx. It denigrates it and devastates it."
Fordham agreed early to undertake a new search for alternative spots, in collaboration with garden officials. After considering several other sites, including one at a highway interchange in the Bronx and one on city-owned property outside the city, the university decided to stick with its original decision.
"We were talking," Mariellen Gallagher, a Fordham spokeswoman, said of the two-year process. "It seemed then that the talks were civil and productive, then finally it didn't seem to be going anywhere."
The garden has suffered several setbacks in its efforts to block the tower. The Buildings Department ruled in November 1994 that the steel skeleton could be built 25 feet from where the uncompleted tower now stands. The garden appealed the decision, and lost last year.
Then, on June 10, 1996, Justice Sheila Abdus-Salaam of the New York State Supreme Court ruled that the garden would not "suffer any significant economic harm."
The garden appealed that decision, and last week proposed the new alternative.

BILL CLINTON
Speaking at a rally yesterday in San Antonio:
" What do you think the Republicans would be saying if they had a President who had presided over an Administration that had cut the deficit by 63 percent, that had the highest job growth rate of any Republican Administration in 20 years, the lowest average inflation in 30 years, the biggest decline in income inequality among working people in 27 years, the lowest combined rates of unemployment and inflation since Lyndon Johnson was President 28 years ago -- if they had a record like that, what do you think they'd be saying? 
 "They'd be saying it is morning in America. They'd be saying that the President can virtually levitate. Why? Why are they doing what they're doing? Why is the election in doubt? Why aren't we ahead in Texas in the polls? It is an affair of the heart. It is because we have practiced the politics of division for so long, we have tried to turn our opponents into aliens. We have been told, oh, those Democrats, they don't really believe in work and being tough on crime and all that. This is an affair of the heart.
"And I tell you, this country does well when we find common ground, when we build bridges together, when we acknowledge it does take a village. And when we say we're on our own and our opponents are our enemies, and they're no good, and we need to be divided from one another, we always pay the price. "

Tax Could Lower Pay

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
If the owners somehow ratify the labor agreement at their meeting in Chicago on Wednesday, Major League Baseball will have a new economic scorekeeping system. The revolutionary luxury tax will change how player payrolls are computed.
Scheduled to be in effect for the next three seasons, the luxury tax is designed to put a drag on player salaries by inducing teams to lower their payrolls to avoid paying the tax. The new method for computing payrolls will differ in four ways from the long-used system: 
 *Average annual value of multiyear contracts will be the basic figures used instead of yearly salary plus a prorated share of a bonus.
*Contracts for a team's 40-man roster will be included instead of limiting the payroll to players who are on a team's 25-man major league roster or disabled list on Aug. 31.
*If a player plays for more than one team during a season, a proportion of his salary, either on a one-year contract or based on average annual value of a multiyear contract, will be charged to a team for as many days of the season as he is with that team. Until now, the entire salary was charged to the team that had the player Aug. 31.
*The cost of players' benefits, about $5 million a team, will be added to each payroll instead of being separate from the payroll.
Cecil Fielder serves as a useful example. Under the long-used method of computing payroll, once the Detroit Tigers traded Fielder to the Yankees on July 31, his 1996 income of $9,237,500 would be charged to the Yankees' payroll. Even though the Tigers paid Fielder for two-thirds of the season, they would not be charged for any of his 1996 salary.
Under the pending method, with the annual average value of Fielder's contract $7,237,500, the Tigers would be charged with $4,864,549 for 123 days of the season, the Yankees $2,372,951 for the remaining 60 days.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Labor Deal in Jeopardy as Selig Stays Silent

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
When they meet in Chicago on Wednesday, baseball's team owners will decide whether they want to have peace with the players for the next four years under terms their chief labor executive has negotiated or renew the war from which their business has still not recovered. Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, is apparently not afraid of a renewed war.
As the meeting approaches, more and more people on both sides have expressed the view that without Selig's endorsement, the pending labor agreement is dead. No endorsement has been promised. 
 Selig says he will not tell the clubs what he thinks of the agreement their negotiator has negotiated. He wants each club to decide for itself, he says. What Selig is apparently saying is that he doesn't want to influence someone to vote for the agreement, then have that person discover sometime down the road that he doesn't like the deal, blaming Selig for it.
"Is there any chance this deal can be resuscitated at the 11th hour?" a lawyer who has been involved in the labor war said yesterday. "Sure, there's a very remote chance, but the momentum is so negative, it's going the other way."
The five-year agreement is centered around a luxury tax that would be in effect for the next three seasons. The plan is designed to induce teams to avoid paying a tax by lowering their payrolls.
The absence of a Selig stance is one reason the deal appears to be in the throes of death. The continued silence of the silent majority is another.
While Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox and other owners opposed to the deal lobby their colleagues intensively to vote no, owners who favor the agreement have not campaigned in its -- or their -- behalf. With 21 of 28 votes needed, the outcome will be decided by a small group of owners or officials of clubs who can be swayed.
Five "no" votes seem to be definite: Reinsdorf; the Tribune Company, owner of the Chicago Cubs; Wayne Huizenga of the Florida Marlins; David Glass, chairman of the Kansas City Royals, and Claude Brochu, managing partner of the the Montreal Expos. John Harrington, chief executive officer of the Boston Red Sox, has emerged as a Reinsdorf ally and will most likely vote no.
In fact, within days of each other, newspaper columns appeared in Chicago and Boston newspapers that reflected the tenor of the current campaign against the deal. Reinsdorf and Harrington were seen by people on both sides as the sources of the attacks. One attack was on Randy Levine, the owners' chief negotiator, the other on Donald Fehr, the players' chief negotiator. In the attack on Levine, in a Chicago paper, unnamed owners called for his dismissal, saying the only reason he would not be fired was that his mother-in-law is a friend of Selig's wife.
Reinsdorf's hand appeared to be so evident in that attack that during a conference call of Major League Baseball's executive council last Wednesday, other owners criticized Reinsdorf, a council member, for it.
In the absence of a Selig endorsement, baseball people wonder whether he even likes the deal. If he doesn't, they wonder why he allowed Levine to negotiate it. When Levine became the owners' latest point man in the effort to get a new collective bargaining agreement, Selig told the union, "When you talk with Randy Levine, you're talking with me."
But despite Fehr's efforts to elicit his position, Selig has declined to back Levine, who has been the only management negotiator or official in two and a half years to induce Fehr and his aides to move close enough to the owners' position to make a deal.
If the owners repudiate the agreement Wednesday, Levine is expected to resign shortly thereafter. His forced departure would recall the forced resignation four years ago of Fay Vincent as commissioner. Selig and Reinsdorf wanted Vincent out of the way because they were preparing to go to war with the players and they knew Vincent would stand in their way. They denied that intention at the time, but events have cast serious doubt on their denials.
Besides the resignation of Levine, who had previously worked in the Giuliani administration in New York City, the owners' rejection of the agreement would produce other results:
*Interleague play scheduled for 1997 would be dead. That would also end the likelihood of placing the two expansion teams, Tampa Bay and Arizona, in different leagues.
*Small-revenue clubs would not receive money from their wealthier brethren for 1996 under the new revenue-sharing plan, meaning five clubs, including Montreal and Kansas City, would forfeit more than $4 million each.
*An estimated $500 million to $1 billion in prospective sponsorship deals would continue to lie dormant, further delaying the game's economic recovery from the 1994-95 strike.
*The 11 players who need service time from the strike to be eligible for free agency would have to remain with their clubs.
Because Selig's endorsement is seen as so critical to the Wednesday vote, some who favor the agreement have suggested a way to elicit his view. When Tom Ostertag, general counsel in the commissioner's office, calls the roll, they said, he should call Milwaukee first. Even though Selig has said his daughter, Wendy, will cast the Brewers' vote, it would certainly reflect her father's view.
But it is possible that Selig will have a secret ballot.

HEADLINE: SIGNALS FROM ROME -- A special report.;
Shift to Right Looms at Top for U.S. Catholics

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS and GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
The Roman Catholic Church in the United States is on the verge of a major shift in its leadership that would cement years of appointments of conservative bishops by Pope John Paul II.
Within the next few years, four of the most important and influential archdioceses -- New York, Chicago, Washington and Philadelphia -- are likely to see vacancies, through the retirement or death of the cardinals who head them. The openings will give the Vatican a sweeping opportunity to reshape the profile of Catholicism's top American leadership. 
 "We're at a kind of crucial watershed," said James Hitchcock, a prominent Catholic conservative who teaches history at St. Louis University. "We'll have a national leadership that looks quite different in a couple of years."
Catholics and non-Catholics alike have a stake in the change in the church's leadership, in view of the size of the Catholic population (approximately 1 in 4 Americans) and the importance of the church's network of parishes, schools, social services, hospitals, colleges and universities.
The bishops are the main governing figures in Catholicism, with broad powers within their dioceses to teach authoritatively, regulate parish life and appoint or remove priests and other church officials. Cardinals are usually Vatican officials or the archbishops of major dioceses appointed to serve as papal advisers as well as electors in the choice of a new Pope.
A decade ago, a series of moderately liberal bishops spurred the National Conference of Catholic Bishops to take high-profile stands on national issues through pastoral letters that criticized American policy on the use of nuclear weapons and called for economic justice for the poor. But those men have since retired or left leadership positions in the conference.
These days, after a decade of new appointments by the Vatican, the bishops' conference has become more cautious and inward-looking, devoted to internal matters like balancing the conflicting demands of traditionalists and feminists in new translations of the liturgy. While church leaders continue to speak out on political issues, they no longer employ the open hearings and revised drafts that made the earlier pastoral letters churchwide events.
The shift toward conservatism will soon become all the more evident when the bishops lose their most influential moderate, Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago, long valued as a premier consensus-builder. Two months ago, he announced that the cancer for which he was operated on last year had returned and was incurable. Last week, he turned over all his routine duties to an auxiliary bishop.
Former Archbishop John R. Roach of St. Paul and Minneapolis said Cardinal Bernardin's death would have a "very serious" effect on the operation of the bishops' conference. "Not so much because he is the voice of liberalism," Archbishop Roach said, "but the voice of sanity, and a voice credible to great numbers of people.
"I don't see any replacement," he added.
Everyone agrees the church's leadership will become more conservative, but not on what this will mean in practice. Will it halt or accelerate the growing tendency of many Catholics to ignore church teachings when making up their minds on sexual and moral issues?
The bishops could become more -- or less -- outspoken on politically charged issues. They could shift away from their recent focus on the condition of the poor and immigrants, and concentrate on sexual conduct, the permanence of marriage, abortion and euthanasia.
Or their conservatism could be manifest mainly as circumspection, in which the prelates refrain from acting decisively at the national level and leave the initiative to local bishops, who in turn wait upon signals from Rome.
Such predictions are not easy, particularly because the Pope's recent appointments, although usually Vatican loyalists and theological conservatives, show important differences in style and temperament.
Very few of them, for example, resemble Bishop Fabian W. Bruskewitz of Lincoln, Neb., who threatened this year to excommunicate local members of groups who challenged church teachings or sought liberalizing changes in its practices.
For non-Catholics and for many Catholics who are only occasional churchgoers, the shift in leadership will affect how they perceive the church as a force in the nation's public life and how persuasive they find its messages on moral issues.
For practicing Catholics, the shift will affect not only how attractive they find the public face of their church but also the morale of their parish priests, the quality of their Sunday worship, the character of their children's religious education and dozens of the other concrete aspects of church life that either stir parishioners' enthusiasm or drive them into apathy.
The bishops, of course, do not constitute all of Catholic leadership. The church has its thinkers, preachers and artists, its philanthropists, neighborhood apostles and organizational geniuses.
Few bishops, for example, have had as much impact on American Catholicism as Thomas Merton, the monk and writer, or the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, former president of the University of Notre Dame.
But most of the church's institutional levers are ultimately in the hands of diocesan bishops and the auxiliary bishops who assist them, because church tradition makes them, in union with the Pope, the ultimate interpreters of doctrine and because, for the most part, they hold the deeds to church property.
These men's public pronouncements and choice of key officials can set the tone for a diocese.
A bishop's control of the seminary can influence the kind of young people who are drawn there and what the future clergy will be like.
Faced with the growing shortage of priests, a bishop can encourage greater roles for lay professionals (most of them women) in team ministries, or he can hope to attract new aspirants to the priesthood by maintaining clear distinctions between priests and laity.
By requiring approval of speakers invited to diocesan events, a bishop sends a message that some Catholics will read as rejecting new ideas and others will view as being doctrinally conscientious.
At a time when Catholic social service agencies are feeling the consequences of government cutbacks and Catholic hospitals are under pressure to merge or sell their facilities, the very survival of such institutions -- and whether they can maintain their Catholic character -- often depends on how adroitly a bishop can blend administrative talents, bargaining flexibility and religious purpose.

The Succession
 
Retiring Prelates Produce Shift
Even before Cardinal Bernardin announced that he was dying, the ebbing of his style of leadership was signaled by the retirements of three former presidents of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops: Archbishop Roach, Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco and Bishop James W. Malone of Youngstown, Ohio. Each was succeeded in his diocese by a bishop known to be more conservative.
Archbishop Roach described these retiring bishops as having "great faith in collaboration and in an open process."
"We were willing to run some risks," he said. "We thought that if we were open enough, an enormous amount of the spirit of God would come through the people."
By comparison, he said the more conservative bishops recently appointed had a greater fear that by departing from established practices, doctrinal "truth will be compromised."
Archbishop Roach was one of the few church leaders willing to be interviewed on the record. Many bishops shy away from discussing internal church decisions, fearing that they sound purely political. In addition, it is an unwritten rule for bishops never to comment on their own prospects for further advancement -- and none of the individuals now frequently discussed in church circles were asked about their chances.
Two decades ago, Pope Paul VI enacted a change requiring all bishops to submit offers of retirement at age 75. The effects of that change are starting to be felt in the major American sees.
Cardinal O'Connor, at 76, continues as New York Archbishop at the Pope's request. James Cardinal Hickey of Washington is 76 and continues to serve. Anthony Cardinal Bevilacqua of Philadelphia turns 75 in 1998.
The Pope will decide their successors. He will, however, receive recommendations from the Vatican's Committee for Bishops and the Papal Pro-Nuncio, Archbishop Agostino Cacciavillan, Rome's representative in Washington.
"I think the person who's really going to have a lot of influence here is Cardinal O'Connor," said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a senior fellow at Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University. As a member of the Committee for Bishops, Cardinal O'Connor is "in the perfect position to make recommendations," Father Reese said.
While the Vatican can be expected to appoint men it perceives to be strong loyalists, it also takes into account administrative skills, links to the outgoing prelate or to influential officials in Rome, and ties to a diocese with an opening.
Chicago, for example, has a long tradition of liberalism among the clergy and laity, and a bitter memory of conflict with the reclusive and conservative John Cardinal Cody, Cardinal Bernardin's predecessor. The manner in which a new archbishop asserts his authority could spell the difference between peace and turmoil.
Some of the names mentioned for the Chicago position are moderately liberal prelates with a link to the city or to Cardinal Bernardin: Archbishop Thomas J. Murphy of Seattle, or Archbishop Michael J. Sheehan of Santa Fe.
But some church leaders say a more likely candidate would be a moderate conservative like Archbishop James P. Keleher of Kansas City, a former Chicago priest. Bishop Edward M. Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., another Chicagoan, and Bishop John J. Myers of nearby Peoria, Ill., are perhaps too conservative, some church leaders said, although they have strong connections to Rome, as does Archbishop Justin F. Rigali of St. Louis.
Two solidly centrist Midwesterners are also logical candidates: Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk, Cardinal Bernardin's successor as Archbishop of Cincinnati, and Bishop Anthony M. Pilla of Cleveland, the current president of the bishops' conference.
The individual most frequently mentioned as likely to fill one of the cardinal-level positions is Bishop Donald W. Wuerl of Pittsburgh. A decade ago, he became nationally known when appointed bishop co-adjutor to Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle, a liberal the Vatican was trying to rein in. The appointment earned Bishop Wuerl the distrust of church moderates, but he has won high marks as a pastoral leader and administrator since succeeding Cardinal Bevilacqua in Pittsburgh.
Others mentioned as possibilities, most often for New York, are Bishop James T. McHugh of Camden, N.J., who once charted the bishops' anti-abortion strategy, and three prelates originally from New York: Archbishop Theodore E. McCarrick of Newark, Bishop Henry J. Mansell of Buffalo, and Auxiliary Bishop Edwin F. O'Brien of New York.
Any speculation, however, comes with a caveat: Past experience shows it is very difficult to predict the Vatican's choice. And recurring questions about John Paul's health and longevity add another layer of uncertainty.
Cardinal O'Connor, for example, had served less than a year as Bishop of Scranton, Pa., when he became New York Archbishop in 1984.
"John O'Connor wouldn't have been on anybody's list 12 years ago," said George Weigel, a Catholic moderate conservative and former director of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, who is working on a biography of the Pope. "So be prepared for interesting things."
Archbishop Roach warned against exaggerating the shift in the hierarchy. He and other church leaders said the bishops have not abandoned their interest in public policy or determination to defend groups like the poor and immigrants.
They were outspokenly critical of the welfare overhaul bill, and persist in urging unpopular causes like foreign economic aid. If there is a change in outlook, it is subtle, perhaps a greater tendency to respond to Government initiatives than to undertake their own.
Some of those most identified with the hierarchy's conservative wing are highly vocal on social issues. Cardinal O'Connor has come to the aid of labor unions. Cardinal Law has testified to the Massachusetts State Legislature against the death penalty. Roger Cardinal Mahony, Archbishop of Los Angeles, has opposed measures restricting immigration.

2 Different Approaches
 
Many New Leaders Show Flexibility
Even on matters of theology, church authority and traditional practices, many of the emerging conservatives are showing themselves flexible managers of their own dioceses, while they repudiate any questioning of traditional principles.
Archbishop Harry J. Flynn, who succeeded Archbishop Roach in St. Paul, for example, is a gracious but firm proponent of traditional theology. He seems content to put his weight to the conservative side without issuing a blanket challenge to liberals unhappy with aspects of official church teaching or practice.
"Ideologically we may be different," Archbishop Roach said of his successor. "He may have drawn some people to the right but he has not alienated anyone. His pastoral instincts are just superb. I don't see this diocese changing radically."
On the issues that have riled the bishops' conference, Archbishop Flynn has kept a low profile.
By contrast, Archbishop William J. Levada has established himself as one of the national spokesmen of the conservative wing of the church hierarchy. Archbishop Levada is a friend of Josef Cardinal Ratzinger, for whom he toiled in the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the office responsible for maintaining Catholic orthodoxy.
At the twice-yearly conference sessions, Archbishop Levada, a physically imposing man, is frequently at the microphone, raising objections, defending amendments, always striving to assure that no phrase or action opens the door to deviations from past teachings or weakens church authority.
But a different picture emerges from his initial months in San Francisco, an archdiocese with a liberal reputation. Priests there say that he has moved carefully.
"Everyone asks, 'How are you doing?' " said one priest, who asked not to be identified. "But he has not come down heavy on anyone yet."
The priest described Archbishop Levada's participation in events aimed at strengthening communities and defending immigrants.
"Social justice-wise, the Archbishop has been excellent," he said. "He likes to talk to people. He doesn't have to be the big expert; he can listen."
This kind of nonconfrontational approach by theologically conservative bishops has been profoundly disappointing to many conservatives.
Professor Hitchcock and his wife, Helen Hull Hitchcock, director of Women for Faith and Family, worry that liberal views remain entrenched in diocesan staffs.
"Bishops often go into a diocese and don't change any of the staff," Mrs. Hitchcock said.
James Hitchcock added: "The Vatican is taken with a diplomatic mindset; it would like people who would supposedly turn things around with extreme finesse."
 
The Future
 
Some See Lack Of Leadership
The new conservatism among bishops may not produce a dramatically different kind of leadership, but rather less leadership altogether.
A priest whose work takes him into dioceses around the country said that too many bishops lacked a vision or strategy that would give the clergy and lay leaders a long-run sense of a diocese's direction.
At the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, several bishops and other church leaders agreed that there is a growing reluctance to raise questions or make proposals unless the approval of leading cardinals and Rome is signaled ahead of time.
"The trust level among the bishops is far lower than a decade ago," a church official said.
Many Catholic leaders see the handful of active cardinals becoming an alternative center of leadership for the American church, which would make the forthcoming appointments all the more important.
The substitution of the cardinals, who are named by the Pope, for the national conference, which operates on the principle of one-bishop-one-vote, would be a return to an older form of leadership that last flourished when Francis Cardinal Spellman of New York was the official face of American Catholicism for most Americans.
Many conservatives would welcome a weakening of the bishops' conference, because they believe that the organization, influenced by liberal bishops and staff members, has interfered in the prerogatives of local bishops and created a buffer between the Vatican and dioceses.
Centrists and liberals counter that the church needs an effective and credible national voice both to get a hearing in public affairs and to deal with internal church matters, like the revelations of sexual abuse of minors by priests, which become national issues.
No one in the leadership appears to want one almost inevitable consequence of weakening the authority of the bishops' conference, a situation in which journalists would, in effect, be determining the voices of the church as they spotlighted whatever bishops or cardinals were found to be most personable, flamboyant or controversial.
Archbishop Roach does not anticipate any sudden U-turns in the bishops' leadership but something harder to gauge. What he fears, he said, is not conservative activism, but "a kind of deadlock."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "WHO'S WHO: Passing the Mantle of Church Leadership" Pope John Paul II has made the firm defense of official Catholic teaching a prime consideration for appointment as a bishop. Other considerations are administrative skills, familarity with local problems and approval by influential officials here or in Rome.
 
NEW YORK
 
John Cardinal O'Connor He has reached the retirement age of 75 but remains at the Pope's request.
 
POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS
The former New York priests: Archbishop Theodore E. McCarrick of Newark, a champion of immigrants who helped host the Pope's visit a year ago; Bishop Henry J . Mansell of Buffalo, who was chancellor of the archdiocese, and New York Auxilliary Bishop Edwin F. O'Brien, who is rector of the seminary. Bishop James T. McHugh of Camden, N.J., charted the bishops' anti-abortion strategy, and is known as a conservative political scrapper.
 
CHICAGO
 
Joseph Cardinal Bernardin Terminally ill with cancer, he has turned over his duties to an auxiliary bishop.
 
POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS
Two former Chicago priests: Archbishop Thomas J. Murphy of Seattle, a moderate liberal, Archbishop James P. Keleher of Kansas City, Mo., a moderate conservative. Bishop Edward M. Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., another Chicagoan, and Bishop John J. Myers of Peoria, Ill., are more conservative and have strong contacts in Rome. Archbishop Michael J. Sheehan of Santa Fe, N.M. worked with Cardinal Bernardin at the bishops' conference. Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk was his auxiliary and successor in Cincinnati. He and Bishop Anthony M. Pilla of Cleveland, both Midwestern centrists, also have ethnic links to Polish and Italian Catholics.
 
WASHINGTON
 
James Cardinal Hickey Like Cardinal O'Connor, he is 75 but continues at the request of the Pope.
 
POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS
With long Vatican service, Bishop Donald W. Wuerl of Pittsburgh is also mentioned for Chicago and Philadelphia. Sent to Seattle in a Vatican effort to strip liberal Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of his powers, he earned the distrust of church moderates, but has since won high marks as a pastoral leader and administrator in Pittsburgh. Bishop Sean O'Malley of Fall River, Mass., a Franciscan, worked as a priest with Hispanic Catholics in Washington. Bishop Keleher has been close to Cardinal Hickey. Archbishop Justin F. Rigali of St. Louis is mentioned for Washington and Chicago, possible because of his service in Rome until 1994.
 
PHILADELPHIA
 
Anthony Cardinal Bevilacqua Will submit his resignation in June 1998 when he turns 75.
 
POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS
Bishop Wuerl, who succeeded Cardinal Bevilacqua in Pittsburgh, could move across the state. Bishop McHugh is already nearby in Camden, while Archbishop McCarrick is in Newark. Archbishop John Foley, who heads a Vatican office, is a Philadelphian. Bishop Joseph A. Galante of Beaumont, Tex., who also served in the Vatican, is another native son, as is Bishop Francis X. DiLorenzo of Honolulu. Bishop Edward J. O'Donnell of Lafayette, La., is a moderate who is highly regarded by other bishops.

HEADLINE: New Union Contract Lets G.M. Trim Some Labor Costs

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 2

 BODY:
After months of sometimes acrimonious negotiations and strikes that idled tens of thousands of workers, the United Automobile Workers union and the General Motors Corporation concluded a new three-year labor contract early this morning.
The deal, which will probably be ratified soon by 215,000 G.M. workers, averted a likely national walkout by the U.A.W. after Election Day. G.M. and the U.A.W. also settled a four-day strike at a crucial truck parts factory in Indianapolis this evening that had idled four G.M. truck assembly plants. Both sides continued trying tonight to resolve a walkout at a highly profitable assembly plant in Janesville, Wis., that makes medium-duty trucks and the mammoth Chevrolet and GMC Suburbans. 
Gerald A. Knechtel, G.M.'s vice president for personnel, said at a 2 A.M. news conference today that the new national labor contract generally followed the pattern of deals that the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation had already signed with the U.A.W. Those contracts were structured to make the Detroit auto makers keep overall employment close to current levels while letting them reduce labor costs to compete with nonunion factories that Japanese and European auto makers have built in the South. The employment guarantees slightly reduce the incentive for auto makers to rely on outside suppliers.
The deal does give the auto makers an incentive to hire more workers by allowing them to pay somewhat lower wages in auto parts factories they buy or build. Ford has already begun a broad review of what parts can now be manufactured in-house to make use of the lower wages.
But the auto makers, apparently including G.M., gained a little more flexibility this autumn to sell a handful of unprofitable auto parts factories. And while the union won wage increases that will exceed the inflation rate by an average of a couple of percentage points a year, it was not so aggressive in demanding pay increases as it has been in some contracts negotiated during other prosperous times in the auto industry.
"The U.A.W. has decided the only way to maintain union employment in the auto industry is to be more competitive on labor costs with the nonunion companies," said Ronald A. Glantz, an auto analyst at Dean Witter in San Francisco.
While U.A.W. officials were cheerful at their news conference, and they emphasized that their bargainers had agreed unanimously on the deal, John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, was a little more cautious.
"Like any negotiation, you never get everything you want," he said. "We're pleased with the way it has worked out; we can get the things done that we need to get done."
In a rare departure from G.M.'s legendary buttoned-down style, Mr. Smith and Mr. Knechtel both had open collars at the early morning news conference. Mr. Smith wore a dark gray tweed jacket, black slacks and a striped white shirt. Mr. Knechtel wore a black suit with a gray shirt. Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W. president, and his aides were also not wearing ties when they held a separate conference at G.M. headquarters here.
Auto makers have a tradition of letting the union take credit for labor contracts at first, particularly until the workers vote on ratification. Union concessions tend to be disclosed much later.
When Ford reached the first deal with the U.A.W. on Sept. 16, some auto analysts raised concerns that G.M., with its large and relatively inefficient work force, could not afford to follow Ford's example in guaranteeing to keep employment at a minimum of 95 percent of current levels. But those fears began to subside as word trickled out that the Ford contract would allow work force reductions to accommodate productivity gains. U.A.W. officials also said that while they needed a 95 percent guarantee at all three auto makers, they were prepared to show some flexibility with G.M. by excluding a few factories from this requirement.
The guarantees of employment levels are mainly intended to prevent the auto makers from transferring auto parts manufacturing to outside vendors and drastically trimming their own work forces.
G.M. and U.A.W. officials refused to discuss the details of the pact. Workers and investors will be interested in the arrangements that G.M. makes with workers at the parts factories that will be sold. G.M. particularly wanted, and apparently received, permission to sell a factory in Flint, Mich., that makes hinges and electric window mechanisms and a factory in Livonia, Mich., that makes interior car-door panels.
"I know they're going to go ahead with the sale, but I don't know what they're going to do by our workers," said James D. Hale, the president of the U.A.W. local at the Flint factory, in an interview on Friday. After a three-week strike by the Canadian Automobile Workers that ended on Oct. 23, G.M. agreed to guarantee for nine years the pensions and health benefits of workers at two parts factories in Ontario that it is selling.
The Canadian union has already reached separate deals with Chrysler and G.M. and is trying to reach an agreement with Ford by next Wednesday. A short strike there cannot be ruled out, but few industry experts expect a prolonged walkout.
Strikes anywhere can disrupt the flow of needed parts among factories. G.M. said on Friday that 19,000 of its American workers still had not been able to return to their jobs because of the lingering effects of its three-week strike.
There may still be a few isolated walkouts at G.M. factories in the months ahead. While the U.A.W. and G.M. concluded the national agreement this morning, many of the union's local units have not yet reached factory-level agreements over issues like assembly-line staffing or purchases of goods and services from outside vendors.
When asked whether local disputes might lead to further walkouts like the strikes in Janesville and Indianapolis, Mr. Yokich responded with a thinly veiled warning to G.M. "We can't tell you what's going to happen at the other locals -- I would suggest that the company work very hard and get their locals cleaned up," he said.
G.M.'s sprawling empire of assembly plants and auto parts factories, which produce a little more than 1 percent of the nation's economic output, has suffered several major strikes this year, during the greatest labor unrest in the North American automobile industry since 1970. In addition to the Canadian strike and the two current local walkouts, a 17-day strike last March at two brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, forced G.M. to close most of its North American assembly plants and lay off 177,000 workers temporarily.
Analysts put G.M.'s losses from these strikes at about $1.3 billion in after-tax profits. The strikes have also cost the Federal Government as much as $600 million in taxes that G.M. would have paid on these profits.
G.M. recouped some of its losses from the Dayton strike by subsequently asking workers to put in a lot of overtime, and it may be able to do the same with the latest two walkouts, Wall Street experts said.
G.M., the nation's largest company in terms of sales, has a history of acceding to U.A.W. demands during strikes. But Mr. Smith contended that the latest walkouts in Janesville and Indianapolis had not forced the auto maker's hand. "This agreement started going before the truck strikes," he said. "I don't think the truck strikes affected it at all."
This morning's settlement came after Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich had publicly urged both sides on Friday to reach an agreement. Mr. Reich said that Labor Department officials had tried to "make sure that all parties know that there is a national interest at stake, that we hope and encourage them to reach a settlement."
But it was unclear whether Mr. Reich's efforts had affected the timing of this morning's deal. Labor Department officials also had told union leaders and company executives that Federal mediators were available if needed. But both sides' negotiators declined the offer.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DEMOCRAT -- On the Final Weekend, a Restrained Clinton and an Insistent Dole;
Unity Is Stressed by President in Texas Visit

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, Nov. 2

 BODY:
At a rousing rally in the shadow of the Alamo today, President Clinton began what he called "the last weekend of the last campaign of my entire life" with the upbeat oratory of unity and progress, promising to practice "the new politics of common ground" but getting in last licks at his opponent all the same.
"Common ground is better than division, and it works," Mr. Clinton told a crowd of thousands of supporters, using the dominant, poll-tested theme of his campaign in front of the old stone fort where Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie and company stood their ground against Santa Anna in the Texas war of independence from Mexico in 1836. 
 Surrounded by a bevy of Texas politicians, from former Gov. Ann W. Richards to Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros -- all of whom made sharp attacks on Bob Dole and Congressional Republicans -- Mr. Clinton strove to sound an appeal to reason, reciting his record on issues like declining crime, shrinking welfare rolls and a healthy economy.
"What do you think the Republicans would be saying" if they had a similar record? Mr. Clinton asked the cheering crowd under crystal blue skies and bright sunshine. "They'd be saying it is morning in America. They'd be saying that the President can virtually levitate."
But in a catch phrase he has begun using in the last two days and is apparently still experimenting with, Mr. Clinton also suggested that he was trailing in states like Texas because the election was "an affair of the heart," in which Democrats bore the burden of years of Republican efforts to demonize them as soft on crime and welfare. White House aides were later at some pains to explain or elaborate on Mr. Clinton's almost mystical language.
Campaigning with his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a state where he is trailing in the polls but hopes to pull off an upset, Mr. Clinton proved that his tongue is sharp enough when he wants it to be. He said that he had remembered the Alamo when the Republican-controlled Congress dared him to shut down the Government or accept its budget last fall.
"They said, 'Oh, he'll blink,' Mr. Clinton recounted. "And I said: 'You know, I'd a lot rather see the American people hurt for two or three weeks or two or three months than 20 or 30 years. Shut her down! I'm not going to buy your budget.' "
And he derided Mr. Dole's accusation this week that the national economy was at its worst level in 20 years. "I ask every person in Texas who believes it is the worst economy in 20 years to vote for Senator Dole, and every person who knows better to vote for me," Mr. Clinton said. "I'll gladly take the results of that election in Texas."
As usual, the party surrogates sitting beside him were much tougher. Mr. Cisneros, his voice booming, rolled off the list of Democratic catch phrases from F.D.R. to J.F.K. and accused the Republicans of efforts to cut the budget and attack Mr. Clinton's character that "have made this election personal."
Mixing Spanish and English, Ms. Richards assured the crowd that "Newt Gingrich y sus pistoleros are on the way out!" referring to the House Speaker and his "henchmen."
The President and Mrs. Clinton were joined on the platform by the actors Tommy Lee Jones and Jimmy Smits, and Mr. Clinton stepped up to the lectern to the strains of the theme from "Lonesome Dove."
After months of sharply worded television advertisements attacking Mr. Dole and just as many months of modest proposals for low-cost, popular programs aimed squarely at middle-class families, Mr. Clinton's aides said he had long intended to end the campaign on a conciliatory note.
The President used the speech here and his weekly radio address to sketch his bleak version of the state of the nation he campaigned to lead four years ago and his equally effusive view of the changes since then. In the process, he sought to paint his Presidency not as the conflicting series of accommodations, compromises and missteps that his critics attack, but as a consistent effort to forge a new kind of post-partisan politics.
"I had a simple strategy," Mr. Clinton said in the radio speech, summing up his efforts. "Reject old labels, false debates and divisive politics; instead, strengthen America's basic bargain -- opportunity for all Americans, responsibility from all Americans and a stronger community of all Americans."
To that end, Mr. Clinton said, he decided that he had to strive to balance the Federal budget while also protecting Medicare, Medicaid and educational and environmental programs, had to hire more police officers while also cracking down on guns and fostering crime prevention, and had to overhaul welfare while trying to create new jobs to move people off the rolls and into work.
Of course, Mr. Clinton's opponents and many objective observers would not agree that he has made such progress or has pursued such a lofty strategy. But he marshaled the statistics he loves to cite to make the best case he could: 10.7 million new jobs and 4.5 million new homeowners in the last four years, 2 million fewer people on welfare since he took office and crime rates at a 10-year low.
Later today, Mr. Clinton planned to campaign for Democratic Senate candidates in Louisiana and his home state, Arkansas, before flying off to Florida in hopes of becoming the first Democratic Presidential candidate to carry that state since Jimmy Carter in 1976.
In large and enthusiastic rallies in Santa Barbara, Calif.; El Paso, and Las Cruces, N.M., on Friday, Mr. Clinton reached into his grab bag of promises that amount to his agenda for a second term: offering tax credits and deductions for college education, connecting every school classroom to the Internet, expanding access to health insurance for children and the unemployed, extending the Family and Medical Leave Law to let parents attend teacher conferences and doctor's appointments with their children, and creating a corps of volunteers to tutor elementary school students in reading.
"If you want all these things I talked about," Mr. Clinton told his listeners at the edge of the Pacific in Santa Barbara, "in the end it will be to some extent an affair of the American heart.
"We must be willing to say, I tell you again, that in this country, all we need to know about you is whether you embrace our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, our Declaration of Independence; whether you are willing to show up for work or school tomorrow; whether you are willing to give your neighbors the elbow room to pursue their personal lives and their freedom; whether you are willing to treat people, even those with whom you dramatically disagree, with genuine respect, if they are law-abiding, hard-working citizens.
"And we ought to say, 'If you're that way, we don't need to know anything else about you -- you're part of our America, and we're going to build a bridge together to the 21st century.' "

Quick, Is the Economy Better or Worse?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
At the campaign's end, it was about the economy. But the question was which economy.
There is the economy Bob Dole kept talking about -- the "Clinton recession" he called it -- in which the 2.2 percent growth in the gross national product announced last week for the third quarter was a sure sign that good times were over. But it was hardly the statistic he was looking for, and by most estimates economic growth for the year will be 2.8 percent, well above Republican and Democratic predictions 12 months ago. 
 Then there is President Clinton's economy, where jobs grow on trees and -- his best news of all last week -- the deficit is headed down dramatically. For the 1996 fiscal year, it was $107 billion, hardly chump change but the lowest level since Ronald Reagan took office in 1981. It has declined 63 percent since Mr. Clinton came to office. Naturally, both parties haggled all week over which side was responsible for that. And neither mentioned that, for reasons too complicated for campaign speeches, it is likely to go back up. DAVID E. SANGER

HEADLINE: Dole Should Look at Affirmative Action Facts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Bob Dole has attacked affirmative action programs as being ineffective and unfair, arguing that they create discrimination rather than equal opportunity (front page, Oct. 29). 
 But the reality is more complex than his political rhetoric indicates.
In a study of 3,200 companies of all sizes in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit and Los Angeles that compared companies using affirmative action to those that do not, we found that minority-group members hired under affirmative action had weaker educational credentials than the white males.
But when managers were asked to judge their performance on the job, minority-group members and women hired under affirmative action were rated no worse than white males.
Most studies find that minority-group members in the United States still have fewer resources and less opportunity to pursue educational credentials than do whites; and even with comparable credentials, members of minority groups and women still face discrimination in the labor market relative to white males. Affirmative action helps to equalize opportunity across these groups.

HEADLINE: Can Harvard's Powerhouse Alter the Course of Black Studies?

BYLINE: By Peter Applebome; Peter Applebome is the national education correspondent for The New York Times.

 BODY:
On a gorgeous early fall afternoon, in a conference room overlooking Harvard Square, Henry Louis Gates Jr., has somehow moved from Hegel, to the lives of black slaves to the starship Enterprise.
 "The thing about black culture has always been that it was fundamentally dependent on the dominant culture, but it turned it inside out," he told five American Civilization graduate students from such disparate places as Japan, Alaska and the South Bronx. "It mimics it. It signifies upon it. It ironizes it. It riffs on it. How many people watch "Star Trek?" There's one that I really love where this guy gets trapped for eternity within a negative universe. This guy is trying to kill him, and if he kills him, then the whole universe will die because of matter and anti-matter. It was a relationship that was hostile, but, it was also the opposite, complicitous, in the way that matter can't exist without anti-matter, in the way that black people by pushing the limit, living on the fringe, define what happens in the rest of society." 
 Life is full of those kinds of excursions these days at Harvard's Department of Afro-American Studies, which since the arrival of Mr. Gates in 1991 from Duke has gone from a famously underachieving, largely unwanted stepchild at Harvard to perhaps the most celebrated assortment of scholars in America. For better or worse, and people see some of both, it's academia's version of the best party in town.
 On one level, the department's celebrity -- particularly with the arrival of the philosopher and author Cornel West from Princeton in 1994 and the sociologist and policy guru William Julius Wilson from the University of Chicago this fall -- is a yawningly predictable case of the rich getting richer. What could be less surprising than Harvard cornering the market on talent in a high-profile, left-leaning field?
 The question worth asking then, is what this means for African-American studies and the academy in general. O.K. Gates, West, Wilson Inc. -- and other less celebrated, but equally high-powered scholars who work with them -- are great for Harvard. What does it mean for the rest of us?
 Harvard certainly is not alone in embracing African-American studies, at a time that hundreds of departments and programs are competing for scholars and attention. But if the department that Mr. Gates has built in the end lives up to all its celebrity, it will have something to do with Mr. Gates' unlikely noodling around in the kingdom of Mr. Spock. It will be because Gates et al. will play a major role in finally taking African-American studies from an often marginalized and patronized field at the edges of the academy to its center.
That would be no small feat in a field born of campus unrest rather than academic initiatives and one that is often characterized as encompassing both serious scholarship and dubious racial polemics.
 "Everything today is show business, but you have a very interesting combination there," said Stanley Crouch, the iconoclastic black writer and critic. "You have a major scholar in Wilson, you have an extremely good organizer in Gates, you have an exceptional performer in Cornel West. So you have everything. Now, like anything that happens in Hollywood, you can have all the elements right and you can end up with a flop or you can end up with "The Godfather," where you have popular entertainment, enduring art and something that's extremely profitable."
 He continued: "But I'll tell you, that Gates is an extremely ambitious man, who I don't think wants to go down in history as just a guy who opportunistically got ahead because of the inability of white people to tell the difference between black quality and black fraud or black quality and black mediocrity. He's very ambitious and very smart, and you have to watch someone like that. He just might turn into something."
 "In retrospect, everything looks inevitable right?" Mr. Gates said as he peered at the sheet of yellow legal-sized paper that contains the outline for the department he wanted to build at Harvard. "But I'm telling you, not long ago, there was no prayer that this could happen. Once I got here we decided to concentrate on the humanities, cultural studies, go with our strengths. Be modest, but go deep. I'm mixing my metaphors here. I run out of sugar by 3 o'clock."
 Mr. Gates may run out of sugar, but his energy never seems to flag, which may be what it took to build the department at Harvard. A 46-year-old Yale graduate with a doctorate in English language and literature from Cambridge University, Henry Louis (Skip) Gates has gone from Yale to Cornell to Duke to Harvard, where he has built a department that has been compared to the monumental 1927 Yankees at the same time he has been cranking out pieces for publications, particularly The New Yorker, on race, politics, film and culture, at a pace that looks like a full-time job to most mortals.
 Of Harvard's big three, he's perhaps the most controversial, considered by some skeptics, particularly at the schools he left, a little too glib and ambitious for his own good. Those at more established black studies programs, like the one at Temple University, bristle at the notion that he's setting Harvard up as the model of how to do African-American studies.
 But, like Bill Clinton, another former Yalie whose energy, brains, charm and political savvy he shares, Mr. Gates has had great success in winning over his doubters. So far he has raised $11 million for various black studies projects at Harvard. One sign of the department's growing status is its move later this year from temporary offices over a drugstore to the campus' new Barker Center for the Humanities -- where the department and its research arm, the W.E.B. Dubois Institute for Afro-American Studies, will be the second-biggest tenant.
 "Part of Skip's mission is creating a constituency for what we're doing, and he's very good at it," said Kwame Anthony Appiah, a noted philosopher and novelist from Britain. Mr. Appiah is often viewed as Mr. Gates's intellectual alter-ego, and went with Mr. Gates from Cambridge to Yale to Cornell to Duke to Harvard. "What people don't understand is that he's a guy who really enjoys his life. He's not a guy who wants to be a big fish in a small pond. He wants to have the company of other impressive people, build something important, do something that matters. And that's what he's doing here."
 Liberal orthodoxy notwithstanding, Harvard's experience with black people and black studies has been extremely mixed. In its earliest days, students and professors and at least two university presidents owned slaves. As late as 1922, a university president, Abbott Lawrence Lowell, prohibited black students from living in the freshman dormitories, as was required for all white students. "I was in Harvard," said the writer W. E. B. Du Bois, who in 1895 became the first black recipient of a doctorate from Harvard, "not of it."
 Black studies at Harvard came about as a result of the campus unrest in the 1960's, and partly because of that, it never prospered, being viewed more as a political necessity than an intellectual one. When he was recruited from Duke in 1991, Mr. Gates began by having Henry Rosovsky, then Harvard's dean of the faculty of arts and sciences, coach him in the arcane academic politics of Harvard. The two sipped sherry late in the afternoon and plotted strategy on how to build support for African American studies. . What emerged from those sessions and others were ideas specific to Harvard and ones about the discipline as a whole.
 At Harvard, Mr. Gates presides over both the Department of Afro-American studies and its W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research. The department has seven faculty members, all with joint appointments in other fields like English, philosophy or economics. Forty-three students are majoring in Afro-American studies. The department now offers only undergraduate degrees, but a doctoral program is being planned.
 The Du Bois Institute, the oldest research institute in the field, this year sponsors 23 fellows studying subjects ranging from African oral literature, to the Harlem Renaissance, to the Atlantic slave trade to jazz and hip-hop.
 "To me what we're doing, not only us but other people in our field, is trying to establish the field as a valid area of study, as a valid area of intellectual inquiry," Mr. Gates said. "Imagine you were in a field that had been created by students occupying the library and the president's office. Chemistry wasn't created that way. English wasn't. There's a lot of energy these days in African-American studies, but there's a lot of wishful thinking, too. You can't make it up, man. You have to do the archival work, you can't just intuit the historical work, which is a lot of what's going on."
 Whether you accept his notion of the field in general, it's hard not to be stunned by how much is now going on in the department and the Du Bois Institute. Mr. Gates and Mr. Appiah, as co-editors, are hard at work on a breathtakingly ambitious revival of Du Bois' greatest dream, an Encyclopedia Africana of the entire African experience, both on the continent and around the world. There are already parts of a pilot version on CD-ROM with plans to eventually do the work on line, on disk and in print. In 1994, Harvard became home to the Image of the Black in Western Art photo archive, started in 1960 by Jean and Dominique de Menil of Houston, which documents 5,000 years of the representation of blacks in Western art in various media.
 In addition, Mr. Gates and Mr. Appiah revived Transition, a cheeky journal of culture and politics that was founded in Uganda in 1961 by some of Africa's best-known intellectuals. The journal features contributions by a glittering cast of black and white intellectuals. It's sort of a high-IQ, multicultural Wired for the world's 3,000 most clued-in academics and literary types. An upcoming issue, for example, is dubbed The White Issue -- non-whites writing on white culture, with pieces on subjects like the racial politics of gardening, "white trash," the cultural significance of white folks' hair, filmmakers Leni Reifenstahl and Martin Scorsese and white Africans.
 The Harvard Guide to African-American History, modeled after the Harvard Guide to American History, is a comprehensive guide to primary and secondary sources for African-American studies. Like the American history guide first published 40 years ago, it attempts to define the field and its source materials.
 The Black Periodical Literature Project, HE??TK??started at Yale in 1980 and all-but completed, is an attempt to collect and annotate all the short stories, poems and literary criticism that appeared in African-American periodicals from 1827 until 1940. The trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database is an attempt to gather detailed information on some 25,000 voyages in the Atlantic slave trade from 1650 to 1867 into a single database that will be the largest uniform, consolidated database of its kind in the world.
 And beyond that, Harvard is attempting to become the beehive around which black intellectual life buzzes with its conferences, lectures and an extended ensemble of regular contributors, ranging from the playwright and 1986 Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinko to the novelist Jamaica Kincaid to the filmmaker Spike Lee.
 "What I want to see happen, from a purely academic point of view, is I'd like to see people in our department be part of the generation that ends that cycle that African-American studies have been trapped in for a century -- each generation has to reinvent the wheel," Mr. Gates said, "the basic facts, things as basic as how many slaves left the West Coast of Africa boarded on ships, and how many got off on the other side. Those basic facts have never been established. You kill a field that way. I think we are doomed or blessed to be the generation that finally digs everything up so that another generation can do dazzling, brilliant, elaborate analysis."
 Mr. Gates' grand ambitions might sound wildly overblown if not for the team he has already put in place at Harvard. In truth, African-American studies at Harvard is far more than Skip Gates, William Julius Wilson and Cornel West. The department includes Mr. Appiah, an expert in African and African-American philosophy and literary theory; Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, an expert in African-American women's history; John F. Kain, an economist now studying the impact of suburbanization on the educational achievement of African-American children; James Lorand Matory, who studies African and Afro-Latin religion, and Werner Sollors, who specializes in 20th century literary history. All of the current faculty are on joint appointments with Afro-American Studies and with other departments -- a framework that is not uncommon at Harvard. And they often interact with other distinguished black faculty members at Harvard like Charles Ogletree and Randall Kennedy of Harvard's Law School, the sociologist Orlando Patterson, the government professor Martin Kilson, the education professor Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot and others.
 Still, the department's three high-profile stars help define what Mr. Gates wants to do.
Cornel West's office is like the academic answer to the "Sorcerer's Apprentice." It's as if the books stacked, horizontally, vertically and diagonally, piled in groaning, rickety piles on the floor, poking from the tops of overloaded shelves, have multiplied time and again, until there's nothing left but the space on his desk that's free of them, and there's not much of that.
 In the same way, Mr. West's lectures are far-ranging rambles through the vast thickets of race, culture and class. Mr. West, whose appointment is also at the Divinity School, is best known for his eclectic disquisitions on race and politics in books like "Race Matters," published in 1993, that combine elements of religion, democratic socialism and trade unionism into a new vision for the left and for racial rapprochement.
 Mr. West, 43, is the most overtly political of the three. But agree with him or not, it's hard not to be mesmerized by his teaching, and his classes are already among the most popular on campus.
 "The single most memorable class I've taken at Harvard was West's lecture on African-American music," said Nell Brown, a white senior majoring in Afro-American studies. "I remembered the way he closed his eyes as Ella Fitzgerald was singing, and you could tell, he just loved it so much. It was just a great experience. Plus it's amazing how accessible they are, even ones like Gates and West. I've found it easier to get time with them than with some associate professors of history."
 On the day, Mr. Gates was teaching his seminar (along with Ms. Higginbotham) Mr. West was teaching to a packed lecture hall at the opening session of his survey course in African-American studies.
 Attired in a blue suit, one hand clutching a piece of chalk, the other a well-worn copy of W. E. B. Du Bois's "The Souls of Black Folk," he paced back and forth, arms out, leaning forward, bending back, voice rising and falling, one foot in the academy, the other in the pulpit.
 "Will we be able to talk about race in such a way we can get beyond the finger-pointing and name calling and actually be self-critical and critical of each other so we can be empowered and enabled instead of paralyzed and debilitated?" he said. "It's so easy to talk about race in America, Du Bois would say, in a way in which we're paralyzed, and debilitated or just completely depressed."
His voice drops to a flat tone of generic Middle American ennui.
 "Dang, this problem's just so overwhelming. Let's have a drink. How's Michael Jordan? Let's turn on Oprah. Maybe she can help us solve the race problem. She's so nice. She's doing really well. She's No. 1."
 The Cornel West voice returns.
 "But she's got relatives and friends broke as the 10 Commandments," he said. "Just focusing on Oprah won't show us how the race problem can be solved. It's more complex than that. Du Bois said begin with art, because art tries to take us outside of ourselves. It's a matter of trying to create an atmosphere and a context so conversation can flow back and forth, and we can be influenced by each other."
 If Mr. West is both scholar and showman, William Julius Wilson is so staid, serious and somber, you figure he's the grown-up who's been brought in to maintain some semblance of order.
 His office is over at the Kennedy School, not Afro-American Studies, and though he moved in in September, it's impeccable. The books, including long neat rows of professional journals, are arrayed with perfect precision. His desk is spotless. While both Mr. Gates and Mr. West rattle on at a fever pitch, ideas tumbling around like laundry in a dryer, Mr. Wilson, in his dark glen plaid suit, oxford blue shirt and sober tie, is quiet, thoughtful, austere.
 Mr. Wilson first gained attention in 1978 for his still-controversial book, "The Declining Significance of Race." The book noted the increasing divergence of the black middle-class and the black poor in an attempt to take a look with more nuances at the workings of race in the United States and to develop more effective strategies for addressing inner-city poverty.
 His "The Truly Disadvantaged", published in 1987, is one of the most influential books on inner-city poverty, and his new book, "When Work Disappears," despite getting mixed reviews, has helped solidify his reputation as one of the most influential thinkers on race, class and poverty. Admirers say he has, as much as anyone, pointed policy makers toward the real economic issues, such as job loss, at the heart of inner-city poverty. Some black critics, however, say he has understated the persistence of racism.
 His arrival at Harvard after 24 years at the University of Chicago -- and previous courting by Harvard -- was Mr. Gates's biggest coup and perhaps biggest surprise, because Mr. Wilson's sober policy perspective is so different from the multicultural intellectual pyrotechnics associated with Mr. West and Mr. Gates.
 But, in the end, he said, his decision to move came because he agreed with Mr. Gates that many great minds are better than a few, that both in terms of affecting policy and being stimulated, there's a real logic to Mr. Gates' efforts to make Harvard something akin to the Brookings Institution for black America.
 "I didn't make the move because I was trying to enhance my academic career," said Mr. Wilson, 60, as he sat upright in a straight-backed chair, his hands folded in his lap. "I made the move because I wanted to be around a community of scholars who are public intellectuals, people who are doing very, very careful work but are concerned about reaching a wide audience, people who are concerned about the direction of the country and are trying to influence public perception, public policy. And there's a collection of scholars here, a critical mass of public intellectuals, the likes of which we haven't seen anywhere."
 There were other attractions.
 Mr. Wilson, who is not teaching this semester while he promotes his new book, said he knew of no African-American studies program with a focus on public policy and he was intrigued by Mr. Gates's desire for him to build such a program at Harvard. He also liked Mr. Gates's notion of a department that was expansive and looking from the black experience outward rather than merely focusing on the minutiae of the black experience itself.
 "We're looking at the growing convergence between Europe and the United States with respect to the concentration of poverty and race and the ways countries deal with those issues," he said. "We feel this discussion would help to inform the public policy debate, not just in this country, but in other countries as well. Countries in Europe are very, very concerned about what is happening in their inner cities. We gave a lecture at the London School of Economics in June, the day of the subway strike. People said no one would show up because of the strike. Well, the lecture was entitled "Are American Style Ghettos Emerging in Europe?" and the place was packed. So I think it's important for students who are concerned about issues of race to learn to get across cultural perspectives on these problems."
 If Mr. West's office is agreeable chaos and Mr. Wilson's is scholarly precision, Mr. Gates's is a pragmatic mix of the ethereal and the worldly, intellect and celebrity. There are plenty of books and tapes but there's also the Sony tape recorder, on which he records his New Yorker interviews; a framed ad his publisher took out for his memoir, "Colored People"; and pictures of him with Al and Tipper Gore, with his mentor at Harvard, Henry Rosovsky, with historian John Hope Franklin from Duke, and others.
 He's wearing a checked oxford blue shirt, a dark tie and sport coat, and everything about him -- from his tweedy look to his stunning verbal facility to his endless connections -- suggests the kind of figure a mad chemist might have invented as the perfect person to make African-American studies a success at Harvard.
 Indeed, while Mr. West seems open to anything -- Tolstoy as the greatest oblique chronicler of the African-American experience, for example -- Mr. Gates is as much strategist as thinker, studying the terrain, calculating the angles, figuring out the next moves to lure the next big stars. He's open about his intention to bring more big names to Harvard and adamant that it's about more than empire building.
 "The model for building excellence in every other great department in any given field has been to bring people together. Why should it be any different for us?" he said. "What happened with us when Afro-American studies was invented in the late '60's was they would put one here, one in Columbia, one at Yale, one at Princeton, it was like Johnny Appleseed dropping seeds, and 20 years later some great apple tree was supposed to sprout up. But we want to build a forest. The English department is the second or third best in the United States because you've got 20 good scholars. The history department is excellent because you have a dozen good scholars. That is the model for building a field. But where the logic broke down was in the creation of Afro-American studies departments. When we try to do what every other department is doing, we appear anomalous. But it's not. We're just building in the traditional way that departments in the academy build."
To some academics, there's something suspect about the blend of celebrity, appealing to a mass audience and advocacy that goes into the idea of being a public intellectual, a tag that has been applied to Gates, West, Wilson and others at Harvard. And some professors at Harvard quietly bristle at the notion that although the department's stars, like Mr. West and Mr. Gates, may be celebrities, they are not producing the kind of serious scholarship that is expected of others at Harvard. But the majority view is that it is hard to argue with the turnaround Mr. Gates has produced in the department and that the notion of celebrity scholars and public intellectuals hardly began at Harvard with Mr. Gates.
 "Harvard has always had people like this," said Harvard's president, Neil Rudenstine. "You can go back to Ralph Waldo Emerson or Henry David Thoreau -- he wasn't on the faculty, but he was around here enough. Different institutions have different temperaments and personae, and Harvard's always been a place where outspoken public intellectuals and scholars coexisted, either side by side or often in the same person."
 Outside Harvard Yard the view is often a little different.
 "Grrrrrrrrrrrrr. She's not going," growled a spokeswoman for the University of Pennsylvania when the mere mention of interviewing legal scholar Lani Guinier came up. Ms. Guinier is now at Penn, but is known to be on Mr. Gates' wish list. (Ms. Guinier, usually accessible, did not respond.) "Hasn't enough been written about Harvard? Don't you want to write about Penn?"
 Envy aside, the most outspoken critic of Harvard's department may be Molefi Kete Asante, chairman of the department of African American studies at Temple University.
 Temple has the nation's largest African-American studies program, one that has produced 42 Ph.D.'s and is the dominant Afrocentric program in the country, with its own flurry of journals and research projects like its Journal of Black Studies, and journals on dance and drama.
 Mr. Asante says he likes and admires the people at Harvard, and they say the same about him, but they represent the two poles of black scholarship: Temple stresses a "transcontinental and transgenerational" Afrocentric interpretation of culture and the black experience, stressing African heritage and roots. Harvard stresses the place of the black experience in the American experience. Mr. Asante argues that Eurocentric scholarship has slighted the role of the African experience and that to understand the black experience in America or elsewhere, you have to start with an Afrocentric approach. The scholars at Harvard, for the most part, agree with some elements of the Afrocentric approach, but they consider much of its scholarship suspect and its focus misplaced.
 "I think we're primarily interested in modernity, where they tend to spend more time on the pre-modern period, Egypt," said Mr. West. "I think they're partly right, but I still tend to think the modern experience of black people is a bit more discontinuous. There was a disruption. Asante's a good friend. We just have very different starting points."
 But Mr. Asante, for all his profession of admiration for Mr. Gates et al. isn't overflowing with praise for them. He said Mr. West profoundly misdiagnoses the ills at the heart of black life and Mr. Wilson's view of the declining significance of race has been proved wrong. And he said that by relying on joint appointments with other programs rather than a unified departmental approach, Mr. Gates' vision of African-American studies at Harvard is diluted, eviscerated and unfocused."
 "We're a full-fledged department with 13 faculty members, 12 black, one white, and we offer B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. programs," he said. "Harvard only has a B.A. degree. They're not in the same ball game with us. In fact, by relying on joint appointments, they've committed discipline suicide. When departments around the country look for a model, it's not Harvard. It's Temple. What they're offering is African-American studies on white terms."
 Similarly, Mr. Asante takes offense at Mr. Gates' notion that much of the Afrocentric teaching relies on suspect research and that the basic facts of African-American studies need to be defined once and for all by projects like the ones at Harvard.
 "Get out of here," Mr. Asante said. "We're not waiting for the messiah to come from Harvard. The database is already at Temple."
 With some 300 universities offering departments or programs in black studies, there are certainly any number of other approaches.
 Manning Marable, the distinguished historian at Columbia University, said that while Harvard is geared toward political and media elites from the White House to The New Yorker, and Temple is focused on a fairly small pool of Afrocentric scholars, neither is in touch with the black mainstream, including black students at historically black universities.
 "If we are really going to change the black community, we must educate those institutions which are educating black students. And that is what Harvard does not do," he said. "Harvard has an extraordinary group of scholars, but Wilson's concern is to influence the Democratic Party and President Clinton. My concern is to influence the Congressional Black Caucus and the N.A.A.C.P."
 To that end, Columbia's Institute for Research in African-American Studies recently sponsored a conference on African-American studies, bringing together participants from historically black and historically white institutions. Mr. Marable said he also writes a column for 250 black newspapers and his institute is surveying black households around the country to document the views of mainstream African-Americans, something that neither Harvard nor Temple is likely to do.
 "Black studies is about a commitment to academic excellence, but it also has to be socially responsible -- that's really the model Du Bois had in mind," he said. "It only has vibrancy and meaning if it illuminates problems in the daily life of black people and its historical roots. There's a profound crisis out there, and I don't think as a whole we've done a very good job of addressing it."
 Still, if some other departments think Harvard may get -- or claim -- too much attention, more common is a recognition that just as Harvard sets the pace for so much in academia, it's full-bore embrace of African-American studies and the high-powered team it is putting in place ultimately has to help the field overall.
 "I think the only bad publicity is no publicity," said Frank Matthews, publisher of Black Issues in Higher Education. "Given the caliber of the intellectuals there, it bodes well for all the black studies programs around the country. We tend to overlook other programs, but that is not Harvard's fault. That is just the nature of being the No. 1 institution."
 And Mr. West adds that the trick is not to be seduced by the perquisites of celebrity and status at Harvard, but to use it in positive ways.
 "You can use anything for good," he said. "You can let celebrity status go to your head, which is stupid, because you're up one day, down the next, or you can use it to highlight issues that end up not being highlighted, issues of working people, poor people, the legacy of white supremacy. Clinton and Dole aren't talking about it. If you have visibility, whether deserved or not, you need to use it to connect to a cause bigger than you. I think that's what we're trying to do here."

HEADLINE: Courses at Your Convenience

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN; Maria Newman is an editor at The New York Times.

 BODY:
A student in Tisha Bender's Reading for Writing class at the New School for Social Research in New York City wanted to contribute to an ongoing class discussion.
 "Now that I have cleaned up from dinner, cleaned out the potty, put away the laundry and congratulated my friend on giving birth, I will hope to tap into the 'collegiate' side of my brain," wrote Stacy Moskowitz, the student. 
 Like all her classmates -- and the professor -- this student was not in a classroom. She was at home in Hillsdale, N.J., tapping into the class through cyberspace.
 The class is among the fast-growing number of continuing education courses that colleges and universities around the country have begun offering to anyone with access to a computer, a modem and an Internet address.
 The trend is an outgrowth of colleges making more frequent use of computer technology in undergraduate degree-granting programs or to earn master's degrees in business administration or in engineering at schools like Harvard and Duke. Some colleges are offering classes that are a combination of on-line dialogues, videotaped lectures and in-class work that, of course, require being on campus.
 But now students who are not enrolled full-time in such universities, and those who live far away from a particular university, can take their pick of a plethora of courses without ever setting foot on those campuses, if they have access to the Internet or the World Wide Web. No one knows how many on-line classes are being offered, but a search of the Web indicates that new ones are being added almost daily.
 The selection of courses is mind-boggling. They range from "How to Open a Beer Bar or Brew Pub" (New School), to "Faces of Ancient Egypt" (University of Chicago), and "Shamans and Healing: the Anthropology of Traditional Medicine" (University of California at Los Angeles Extension).
 With on-line classes, if a student prefers to work in the wee hours of the night, he or she can access a professor's lectures and even a class discussion at any time.
 Students usually enroll on line, pay their tuition on line via credit card -- fees for on-line courses are generally comparable to that of on-campus classes -- and then receive a password that will give them access to a world of learning.
 Lectures are presented on line, and professors may pose questions to begin the on-line discussions. In a physical classroom, a lecture can last an hour and a half. In the virtual classroom, it can last for weeks.
 Sometimes students meet with their professors in "chat rooms" with catchy names like the Patsy Room at the Blue Moon Cafe, a place in the virtual class "Parent-Child Relationships" taught by Charles Smith, a professor at Kansas State University.
 Students can retreat to the privacy of E-mail to consult with their professors, and the required writing assignments or exams are graded via E-mail.
 Some professors grouse about not having one-on-one contact: Students cannot hear the inflection in a professor's voice when he or she is trying to make a point.
 "Sarcasm, for example, is very difficult to convey in this medium," said Andrew Shaindlin, who was the director of Bruin, an on-line program of courses offered by the alumni office of Brown University. But Mr. Shaindlin, who pioneered on-line alumni education at Brown, said that an advantage to on-line education is that students and professors have a written record of what everyone in the class says during discussions.
 "In the written format, you can still interpret what people are saying, but you can cut and paste exactly what they wrote when you respond to them," Mr. Shaindlin said.
 The new technology has spawned a new language in academia, with professors tossing around phrases like "asynchronous learning network" -- a term used to describe a conversation between professors and their students that doesn't take place all at once, but rather as students log on and retrieve or send messages. They talk about "lurkers" -- those students who enroll in class and observe all the conversations, but who choose not to contribute.
 Universities are conducting seminars to discuss the implications of these new tools on learning, like a workshop this month at Virginia Tech, in Blacksburg, Va., with panel discussions entitled "E-literacy: Renegotiating Pedagogy in Electronic Environments," or "The Computer Is Down -- and So Am I," and finally, "Muse Meets Mouse."
 The explosion of on-line learning has also led many scholars to worry over the future of traditional classroom learning. Kathy McGuire, the director of Distance Learning at the U.C.L.A. Extension, a continuing education program affiliated with the University of California in Los Angeles, said scholars should be looking at the new technology as a way to reach older students, who every year make up a larger proportion of college populations nationwide.
 "They're not going to stop learning, but they're not going to want to drive all over the place to do it," she said.
 A peek at some on-line classes shows that serious discussions are taking place in a format that requires students to carefully articulate their thoughts as they write them into cyberspace for classmates to see. Some of the discussions are also amusing.
 In a class entitled "The History of Western Civilization" offered at Boise State University in Utah, in between wide-ranging dialogue about whether the Roman Emperor Augustus truly believed in "The Republic," one student breaks in: "Hey ya'll get off the Web and turn on old-fashioned cable TV. The movie Cleopatra is on all night tonight on AMC. 1934, but looks like it's been color-enhanced. Pass the popcorn!"
 "Election96" offered by the New School, Professor Herbert Greenhut described the course to students and then proposed several questions to guide a discussion on the role of the Federal Government in issues of concern to voters during the Presidential election. The students, who ranged from a doctor in New York to a retiree in New Mexico and another student from Canada, sounded off on the topics in a discussion that went from an analysis of free public schools to the widening disparity of wealth in America.

HEADLINE: ON LANGUAGE;
Just Driving By

BYLINE: By William Safire 

 BODY:
IT BEGAN WITH A SLIP of the tongue by President Clinton. At a campaign visit to a Rhode Island hospital, he joined the criticism of limiting maternity stays to 24 hours. But instead of reading his derogation of drive-by deliveries, a phrase first directed in print last year at hurry-up hospitals by Carol M. Ostrom of The Seattle Times, Mr. Clinton mistakenly used the term drive-by pregnancies, a quite different, not unknown but hitherto unlabeled problem. A Dole-Kemp news release called attention to this minor gaffe under the headline "Much More Fun Than a Drive-In Movie."
This focused the attention of lexicographers on the adoption of a compound adjective by speakers who like to be on the cusp of English usage: drive-by. 
 "Two men were shot to death on Hollywood streets in separate 'drive-by' incidents" was the lead of an Associated Press article from Los Angeles on Feb. 12, 1981, in the first citation I can find of the term; its use within quotation marks indicates it had been in spoken use earlier. From its first, literal meaning -- "gunfire from a vehicle driving past the target" -- drive-by shooting soon assumed the meaning of "random, senseless violence aimed not at a particular victim but at any individual nearby."
Drive-by delivery was preceded by drive-through delivery, first cited in June 1995 in The Chicago Tribune, and defined as "shortened hospital stay for childbirth" by John and Adele Algeo in their Among the New Words feature in the Spring 1996 American Speech quarterly. Drive-through began with fast-food chains (based on drive-in, coined in 1933 by a New Jersey movie theater operator) and was picked up by banks (which also use drive-up), both serving customers who never had to leave their cars.
But it is drive-by, not drive-through, that is getting metaphorical extension in the language. In a January 1994 article on "squeegee men," Newsweek reported on a "a new fad -- drive-by haranguings." A year later, Anne H. Soukhanov reported in The Atlantic Monthly Michael G. Gartner's use of drive-by hatred, which she defined as "seemingly motiveless acts of loathing directed at a victim not personally known to the perpetrator." Margaret Carlson of Time later that year wrote of "liberal baby-boomers, who thought drive-by sex and drugs were fine for them but want limits for their offspring."
As it is used more often, the compound adjective is losing its frightening quality and is accentuating its random or casual sense: "You can hear," wrote The Washington Post of Jack Kemp's debate performance, "an increasing volume of drive-by criticism like this on the Republican side."

Hole Card
 
 Tom Brokaw of NBC called to ask me about Vice President Al Gore's charge that the Dole-Kemp suggestion to cut Federal income tax rates by 15 percent would "blow a hole in the deficit."
Because that charge was repeated by Clinton surrogates, it is safe to assume that Democrats carefully considered that phrase. But the figure of speech is off key: to blow a hole in means "to destroy" or at least "to diminish"; the image is that of a torpedo striking a ship below its Plimsoll line.
However, to blow a hole in the deficit is to reduce the deficit, a consummation devoutly to be wished by just about everyone in politics. The meaning Mr. Gore intended was that the Dole tax-cutting idea would increase, balloon or even skyrocket the deficit -- thereby to blow a hole in hopes of balancing the budget.
Mr. Brokaw's observation was sound, and he was right to torpedo the overblown rhetoric. This did not stop the House majority leader Dick Armey, from subsequently telling David Brinkley of ABC, perhaps tongue in cheek, that the Clinton agenda was "likely to blow a big hole in the deficit and result in the need for massive tax increases."

The Scheme Plan

 Democratic campaigners adopted a two-track approach: Vice President Gore employed a railroad track in "It would knock our economy off track," and then switched to a hunting trope in deriding the Government shutdown: "President Clinton stopped them dead in their tracks."
Bob Dole tried to sidetrack the deft Democratic response to the Dole tax package. Mr. Clinton called his own proposal a "targeted plan," while characterizing the Dole proposal as a "risky scheme."
His use of scheme riled Dole. "I'm a little offended by this word scheme," he said in their second joint appearance. "Last time, you talked about a 'risky scheme,' and then Vice President Gore repeated it about 10 times."
Is the noun scheme pejorative, as the verb to scheme is? Fred Mish at Merriam-Webster says it is, and Prof. Randolph Quirk of University College in London agrees: "Used to designate a plan," says Quirk, "scheme has a negative connotation." But David Crystal, editor of The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language, differs: "The noun has come down to us as a neutral term. I think of its connotation as quite positive." (He probably benefits from his insurance scheme.)
My judgment is that the noun scheme in British usage can be either positive or negative, but in American usage, the word is always negative. Here, a plan is a "design," which is good, while a scheme is more of a "plot," which is bad. A man with a plan is to be admired, but a schemer is to be distrusted. No wonder Dole took offense.
The G.O.P. Vice Presidential candidate, Jack Kemp, used a football metaphor skillfully: "We cannot just run the clock out on the 20th century." However, he missed the extra point on the classics with "Clearly, the Gordian knot needs to be broken in one fell swoop."
The difficult knot was tied by Gordius, king of Phrygia, who decreed that it would be untied only by the future ruler of all Asia; Alexander the Great crossed him up by cutting the knot with his sword. Thus, a Gordian knot can be untied or cut, but not -- as Kemp suggested -- broken, even in one fell swoop (in which fell means "fierce, cruel," evoking the image of a hawk dropping suddenly on its prey, and has the same root as felon).

HEADLINE: Adventures of a Republican Revolutionary

BYLINE: By Jeffrey Goldberg; Jeffrey Goldberg is a contributing writer for the Magazine. His last article, about the F.D.A.'s war on tobacco, appeared in August.

 BODY:
Mark W. Neumann, A FRESHMAN REPUBLICAN Congressman from Janesville, Wis., is a sometimes-mutinous soldier in the army of Newt Gingrich who believes that extremism in the pursuit of deficit reduction is no vice. He also has a tendency to yell at his constituents, which is inadvisable, considering that he rather desperately needs their votes on Tuesday. This penchant of Neumann's is on display during a recent campaign stop at the Sons of Norway lodge in downtown Janesville, a monochromatic American everywhere of a city an hour and a half west of Milwaukee.
The Golden K Kiwanis club is holding its monthly breakfast meeting here, and Neumann waits impatiently as the Kiwanians sing Kiwanis songs and the club president tells the ritual "Lars and Sven" joke. Neumann, a 6-foot-2, straw-thin 42-year-old, is wired this morning on caffeine and righteous anger, and when his turn finally comes he careers into his presentation. A former math teacher, he always brings along a dozen charts and an overhead projector. His theme is simple: Washington is choking America with debt. The subtext is also simple: he is ready to rescue America from Washington. 
 He unleashes a river of numbers: Medicare numbers, deficit numbers, Social Security numbers. It is too early in the morning for debt charts, but the Kiwanians are facing the unthinkable -- a math teacher with actual power -- and they are cowed into listening. "This debt can crush us," Neumann says. "Do I have a great deal of confidence that the budget will really be balanced by 2002? I know I'm a Republican and I know what I'm supposed to say, but I think that if the Republicans are in power, our chances are about 50-50, and if the Democrats are in power, it'd be about 50-50 too. We're going to have to get over this Democrat-Republican stuff if we're to get over this problem."
The lodge is filled with Republicans who appear bewildered by Neumann's attack on his own party. They grow more confused when Neumann answers a question about the Dole-Kemp tax-cut proposal this way: "It looks like a good plan on paper, but if you hear skepticism in my voice, it's because in Washington, it's not unusual to do the easy thing and not do the hard part. The easy thing would be to cut taxes. The hard part is to do deficit reduction, which means spending cuts. You will not see me vote for a tax cut if Medicare is hurt, Social Security or veterans' benefits are hurt or if the deficit goes up."
The next question lights Neumann's fuse. "Isn't it true," an elderly man asks, "that it was when Reagan was President and Dole was in the Senate that the debt went up?"
Boom.
"This debate is exactly what's leading our country down the path to destruction!" Neumann yells. "Reagan and Dole did it, and the Democrats did it! People on both sides of the aisle are willing to do anything to get power in this country, even if means the destruction of our country!"
His questioner is stunned into silence. Neumann's face is tomato red. "I've got to get my blood pressure down!" he shouts. He gathers himself. "I'm sorry I answered so strong," he tells the Kiwanians a moment later. "This Republican-Democrat thing -- it's just so destructive. If the Democrats want to take credit, I don't care. They raised taxes in 1993 and it brought in more revenue and so the deficit is going down."
After the breakfast, I ask Neumann if he can afford to yell at his constituents. In November 1994 he won his seat by 1,120 votes, the smallest margin of victory of the 73 Republican freshmen elected two years ago nationwide. The First District of Wisconsin, home to massive General Motors and Chrysler plants, is a stronghold of the avowedly anti-Republican United Auto Workers. And while its geographical center, Walworth County, is agricultural and solidly Republican, the Democrats are used to being in charge here -- the late Democratic powerhouse Les Aspin represented the First District for 22 years. Four years ago, President Clinton took this district; even Michael Dukakis won here.
"Yeah, I guess I shouldn't do that," Neumann says of his yelling. "I just get so frustrated sometimes. People have to understand that this country is heading toward disaster. We're spending our children's money. The people need to know."
Neumann and his Congressional classmates, the horsemen of the so-called Gingrich revolution, have become famous for their ideological purity and moral surety, and no freshman is more convinced of his own rightness than Mark Neumann. He is a leader of the rejectionist faction, the 15 or 20 chain saws who most typify the class's public image: contemptuous of compromise, scornful of career legislators, suspicious of party leadership. It doesn't matter, Neumann says, that he has already driven to distraction everyone around him -- the consensus-builders, comity-seekers and pork-barrelers, the more moderate freshmen and the Speaker of the House. "I'm not in this for fun," he says. "I'd rather lose than change."
Changing isn't a possibility, then, but losing is. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has poured tens of thousands of dollars worth of negative TV advertising into the district, which works to the benefit of his Democratic opponent, Lydia Spottswood, a 45-year-old former nurse who is an alderman in one of the district's largest cities, Kenosha. Neumann does have the advantages of incumbency, with five times more cash on hand than Spottswood. He needs it. Charles E. Cook Jr., the political analyst and handicapper, says of the race: "Neumann's a pretty strong swimmer but there's a pretty strong undertow out there." Cook calls Neumann vulnerable, giving him a 55-45 chance of returning to Congress.
What is certain is that the race between Neumann and Spottswood has become as mean as any Congressional race in the country. Although both candidates address the issues that drive voters -- Medicare, Social Security, pension protection -- neither is reluctant to trash-talk the other. Neumann, who is a millionaire, bashes Spottswood for being a millionaire (her husband is a wealthy physician): "She claims to speak for the working class, but that's a fraud." He says that she has no vision for a fiscally sound future and that she drives foreign cars, a death charge in this district. (Her family does own a Toyota 4Runner, but not a Mercedes, as he had claimed.) Neumann also says a dead raccoon stuffed into his home mailbox was the work of radical anti-Republican environmentalists; his neighbors now watch over his house with shotguns.
Spottswood's strategy is to portray Neumann as someone who likes numbers more than people, and to tar him with every nasty thing ever said about the freshman class. "He is a total extremist, a one-issue candidate," she told me as we toured the 4-H exhibition at the Kenosha County Fair one evening this past summer. "I'm for balancing the budget, too, but I'm for keeping balance within the budget." She has also referred to him as "Alfred E." Neumann.
Though Neumann has his moments of ease, Spottswood is the warmer of the two. She is voluble and bright-faced, with kind words for the voters she meets at the fair, their children, the animals in the 4-H exhibition -- for everyone but Neumann. "I mean, he's a creep," she says, stopping by a pigpen. "He gives me the willies. This is a man who doesn't like serving his constituents. He doesn't even like his job. Have you ever seen a more rigid person than Mark Neumann? He is an angry white male who got his and now wants to pull up the ladder behind him."
 ON TUESDAY, DEMOCRATS SAY, THE AMERICAN voter will exact her revenge on the angry white males who rode into Congress on an illusory crest of anti-Government, anti-Clinton sentiment. Republicans, of course, hope Tuesday is the day that the two-year-old revolution will be permanently ratified. It wasn't that long ago when the freshmen were celebrated as the vanguard of the revolution that made Newt Gingrich king and forced President Clinton to defend his relevancy. They came waving the Contract With America over their heads and promising a purification of Congress: Out with calcified tradition! In with term limits and a balanced budget! And don't drink the water; it'll give you Potomac Fever. They had ousted the princes of the Democratic Party -- Tom Foley, Dan Glickman, Jack Brooks -- and they descended upon the Capitol in a storm cloud of righteousness.
But in their triumph, they overreached. The new Speaker tripped on his personality. The President outsmarted the House leadership in budget negotiations and pickpocketed one Republican message after the other. The freshmen began to look childish instead of revolutionary, this one going weak for the militia movement, that one trying to gut environmental regulations with all the subtlety of Agent Orange.
Through it all, the freshmen, the ones who weren't self-destructing or worming their way into the system, found themselves battling their own leadership. For them, issues like deficit reduction were hard principle, and they turned against veteran lawmakers who were too easy to compromise. Some of these freshmen realized that they owed their victories as much to Perot voters disgusted with split-the-difference cynicism as to Republican regulars, and did not dare give in on things like the deficit.
Neumann, in whose district Perot received 23 percent of the vote in 1992, became a leader of this freshman camp. Not a leader in the cheerleading, vote-counting sense -- he is too obstreperous for that. But many of Neumann's classmates look to him for guidance, not only on fiscal matters but on ways to resist pressure to conform. Steve Largent, the former N.F.L. all-pro wide receiver for the Seattle Seahawks and now a Republican freshman from Oklahoma, refers to Neumann as a "real William Wallace" -- a reference to the 13th-century Scottish rebel who battled both the oppressive English crown and the duplicitous Scottish nobility. (Wallace was lionized in Mel Gibson's "Braveheart," a film that has become to the conservative wing of the Republican Party what "Patton" was to Nixon.)
Within his first three months in Washington, Neumann wrote his own budget plan, which he says would have led to a balanced budget by 1999. It ended so-called corporate welfare -- tax breaks and subsidies for big business -- and froze defense spending. As a sop to the freshman class, the House leadership allowed Neumann's plan to come to a vote. Only 89 members supported it, the vast majority of them Republican freshmen. The leadership had assumed, rightly, that the plan was too radical to go anywhere.
Neumann says, "There was a lot of misinformation put out about the plan," suggesting that it wasn't only Democrats putting out the misinformation. "It was the famous cloakroom stuff. It was one of my first lessons in how Washington works."

A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A KAMIKAZE FRESHMAN
"Stupid, stupid, stupid," Neumann is saying. "It's just so stupid."
A muggy June morning, not a notable day in Washington except that it is Neumann's worst day in Congress yet. He is leaving a meeting of the House Appropriations Committee, where he has just proposed cutting every appropriations outlay by 1.9 percent. He withdrew the idea when exactly none of the other 50 or so Representatives in the room would agree to it. Now he is moving briskly toward the basement cafeteria of the Longworth House Office Building. He is dressed on this hot day, as he is most days, in the style of a Mormon missionary: a white, short-sleeved shirt, muted red tie and blue slacks.
I ask him if he will be going to the Republican National Convention.
"Do you really think they want me at the Republican convention?"
He bumps into Phil English, a fellow Republican freshman, an affable, working-stiff type from Erie, Pa.
Neumann stammers out a greeting: "Hey Phil, sorry about going at you like that last night."
"That's all right, Mark," English says soothingly, "that's all right."
A little later, as we are leaving the cafeteria, I ask Neumann, "What did you say to English last night?"
"Nothing. Just that he was destroying the country."
He pauses, and then elaborates. "Phil's a real good guy. The freshmen are good people. It's just that there's pressures, you know?"
Here is the issue that upset Neumann so violently: the night before, the House and the Senate agreed on a budget resolution, a key step toward a final budget. The vote largely went along party lines, except that Neumann and a small band of Republicans, mostly freshmen, joined Democrats in voting no.
Neumann voted against the plan, he said, because it contained spending that would temporarily spike the deficit. The Republican leadership had promised that the deficit would drop precipitously, only not right away. Neumann wasn't buying it.
"Let me ask you a question," he says. "Five years from now, if the Republicans had a choice, do you think they would rather remain in control of Congress or have balanced the budget and brought the deficit down?"
It is, I gather, a rhetorical question.
"They will do anything to remain in power," he says. "People in Washington will do anything to remain in power. Anything."
No, I don't suppose they want him at the Republican National Convention.
Neumann did not simply vote against the budget resolution; he violated House mores by "whipping" -- trying fiercely to enlist additional votes for his dissident cause. Along with a few other freshmen, he spent the evening barricaded in his cramped office, lobbying his classmates by telephone to stay pure in the face of party pressure. Few did.
There is no punishment in store for Neumann -- this time. The Republican leadership had punished him before, most notably in the summer of 1995, when he was booted from the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee for trying to block funding for the United States intervention in Bosnia. When his classmates found out that he was sacked, they revolted and forced the leadership to give Neumann a seat on the Budget Committee.
Neumann seems untroubled by the thought of being disciplined -- he rages against his party's leadership, all the way back to his office. "What do Republicans stand for?" he asks. "Balancing the budget and deficit reduction. That's why we were elected. It's just so stupid what they did last night." He stops for breath. "My blood pressure's going up -- I have to count to 10."
When he gets upset, Neumann silently counts to 10.
"I don't know what we're going to do," he says, as we sit in his office. "They're just loading up those appropriations bills with pork." The "they" are his Republican elders.
Neumann soon dashes out of his office to his apartment, a studio three blocks away, to gather some papers for an afternoon news conference.
He is so down that I find myself unwittingly trying to buck him up. I suggest that the day isn't a complete disaster, what with the big news conference coming up. Today, he is unveiling his Social Security Preservation Act, which, if passed into law, would stop the Treasury from dipping into the Social Security trust fund to pay for Government operations. The bill already has 62 co-sponsors, nearly all Republican freshmen, and has been widely touted in deficit-hawk circles.
So, I say, things aren't so bad after all.
"They're gonna bury us," he says.
Oh.
"Who's gonna bury you?"
"Who? The leadership, that's who."
"Why?"
"If you were running for re-election, would you want to tell the American people that the deficit is really $65 billion higher than we've told you before, because what we've been doing is raiding the Social Security trust fund to make up the budget shortfall, and depositing I.O.U.'s into the fund, which is supposed to be there for people's Social Security? Would you?"
"But you're running for re-election," I say.
He stares blades into me.
"I'm not going to betray my principles to get re-elected," he declares. "I'd sooner quit."
Neumann plunges on, to the Capitol. A security guard asks him for identification. "Umm, sorry, I'm a member," he says. It is customary for members of Congress to wear a lapel pin that exempts them from security checks. Neumann isn't wearing his, and I ask him why.
"Oh, you mean the 'Treat me like God' pin?" he says, grimacing. "Yeah, whatever."
The news conference, held in a basement room in the Capitol, draws a crowd of reporters. Also on hand, to Neumann's relief, is a good slice of the freshman class, including David McIntosh of Indiana, an ambitious Dan Quayle protege who would be voted, if such a vote were held, the freshman most likely to be Speaker, and Wes Cooley of Oregon, who will not be a candidate for anything -- like the ill-starred Enid Greene (formerly Waldholtz) of Utah, scandal (financial and ethical) is forcing his early retirement from the House.
"This is about honesty," Neumann tells the reporters, "which we haven't been real good at in Washington. We've been using the Social Security trust fund money to mask the true size of the federal deficit. We're fooling the American people into thinking the deficit is smaller than it is."
His fellow freshmen applaud, but the initiative fails to overwhelm the press, or, as Neumann predicted, the House leadership. As the 104th Congress passed into history, the Social Security Preservation Act of 1996 lay dormant in committee.
No one said being a freshman would be easy.

FINDING AN ISSUE IN A MATH CLASS
Mark Neumann is a deeply observant evangelical Lutheran who came to Washington not to fight against abortion and gay rights but to fight for the bottom line. Not to say that his votes on social issues don't hew to the Republican platform -- and his church's. But for Neumann, the fiscal is moral. "He has a strong belief that balancing the books is the ethical position," says his father, Kurt, a retired automobile engineer, who with his wife, Stella, taught Mark and his four siblings fealty to God and respect for General Motors.
Neumann had an aggressively wholesome childhood, as he describes it: sports, farm work and his girlfriend, Sue. They met in fourth-grade Sunday school, and married the year after they graduated from high school. When he graduated from college, Neumann began teaching high-school math, which is when, searching for real-life problems to teach his students, he stumbled upon the deficit.
Teaching was his calling, he says, but by the time he and Sue had three children, they were skirting poverty. "I remember one time we were in the supermarket and we had to put the cheese back on the shelf because we didn't have enough money," he says. "We were running $200 behind a week."
So he decided to mortgage himself to the entrepreneurial dream. He took work as a real-estate agent, and three years later was running his own construction company. "We almost lost our shirts the first year," he says, "but we learned how to budget, and by the fourth year, we were putting up 120 homes." Today, he is a coupon-cutting millionaire who has contempt for people who live off the taxpayers.
Neumann is all unsheathed edge; he is more intense, as Garrison Keillor might say, than the average Lutheran. He is a difficult boss, a taskmaster and a prude who discourages "cussing" in his office. He is also pathologically unable to keep his mouth shut. Even when he aims for diplomacy, he stumbles. I once asked him if he was bothered, as a Christian, that Gingrich and Bob Dole divorced their first wives under questionable circumstances. "Thank goodness you can't force me to answer that one if I don't want to," he said, answering anyway.
Like other millionaires who spend fortunes to gain elective office, Neumann is possessed of a certain messianic quality that precludes easy compromise, and keeps him focused obsessively on questions of debt. It is the singularity of his interest that sometimes leaves him ill at ease in his party, even within its most conservative wing. This became apparent to me one afternoon last summer during a weekly Washington lunch held by Paul Weyrich -- the godfather of conservative activism -- for right-wing lobbyists and Congressmen. Weyrich's is an alternate Republican universe in which Gingrich is demonized not as a right-wing extremist but as a spineless leftist. The group was upset on this day by the Speaker's treatment of Bob Dornan; Dornan, the famously unglued California Representative, had drawn Gingrich's wrath by endorsing a pro-life insurgent over a sitting Republican Congresswoman.
Neumann, a Weyrich regular, addressed the group on the relative merits of loyalty to Gingrich and the party. "To me," he said, "the most important thing is God, morals and ethics first. Then comes family. Then comes your constituents. Fourth would be the party."
The meeting was interrupted by the sudden appearance of Dornan himself, who rushed the podium. Before he could launch his attack, he was told that a reporter was present. He pointed at me and declaimed: "You have penetrated the inner sanctum of the revolution! We are the bravehearts and they are the nobles!" He denounced the Republican leadership, and then excoriated Steve Gunderson, the gay Republican representative from Wisconsin. Not long before, Dornan had outed Gunderson on the House floor; now he condemned him for letting his partner ("wife," in Dornan's locution) support Dornan's Democratic opponent.
All the while, Neumann sat quietly, staring at his hands.
"That wasn't normal," is all he would say afterward. It is not that he hides his position on homosexuality: "If I was elected God for a day," he says, "homosexuality wouldn't be permitted, but nobody's electing me God."
The meeting underlined Neumann's predicament: while he came to Washington to battle the deficit, he found his fellow fiscal conservatives distracted by issues like gay rights, abortion and affirmative action. While he certainly votes the Republican social platform -- he has a 100 percent Christian Coalition rating -- he argues that the 104th Congress has lost sight of the mandate of 1994. "When we had freshmen orientation, we didn't agree on very much," he says. "We didn't agree on social issues, even regulatory issues. The whole freshman revolution was about three things -- the line-item veto, term limits and balancing the budget. That's it. But people lost focus. All sorts of social issues. Personal promotion in their districts. Ambition in Washington. If we don't refocus on the central issues of '94, we're going to be taken out.
"People don't understand. It wasn't a Republican revolution. It was a common-sense revolution."

NEUMANN, NEWT AND THE LESSONS OF SCOTTISH HISTORY
The question on the table is, Did the freshmen fail?
"In the real world of real power, we've won," Newt Gingrich answers. "The Clinton welfare bill was $10 billion in more spending and it centralized power in the Washington bureaucracy. The bill he's now going to sign is $55 billion in savings, and it returns power to state and local government and to charities. So you tell me, did the freshmen win?"
Gingrich is sitting in his office under a framed photograph of Martin Luther King Jr. It is a few hours after President Clinton announced that he would sign the Republican welfare bill, ending the Federal guarantee of aid to poor people first made by Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
The Speaker, shoeless and content, flashes a benevolent smile. He has a point, of course. There would have been no need for a Dick Morris to push the President rightward had there not been the stunning Republican victories of 1994. The freshmen make up one-third of what Gingrich calls his "manuever element," and they are the most stouthearted third. But it is the freshmen, too, whose inability to compromise has helped sink Gingrich's approval ratings, and prompted the Dole campaign to distance itself from the Congress and the Contract.
Because the welfare victory is so fresh, today is not the best day to ask Gingrich to analyze the weaknesses of the revolution. He loves the freshmen today, even the ones who occasionally make him miserable. These are the ones, in fact, who interest Gingrich the most. "There's a wonderful scene in 'True Grit,' " he says, "where Wayne is going across the river in a boat and the girl jumps in the river with her horse after she's told she can't go. And Wayne says, 'That girl reminds me of me.' The freshmen remind me a lot of the 1979 me."
These are the same freshmen who defied Gingrich by opposing the budget resolution in June and who voted to keep the Government closed last January; choosing his words carefully, Gingrich calls them "prophetic." "They start from the premise that they know what they're doing and they know what is right," he says. "Now, do I want 235 fellow prophets? No. Do I want 10 or 15? Yes."
If there are only 10 or 15 of these prophets afoot in Congress, then why does the public seem to think that the 73 freshmen are uniformly radical?
"They were using you guys," Gingrich says with a laugh, referring to the press. "They got together, and said, 'If we stand together and chant, the press will cover us as if we're actually powerful, and if we're really powerful, we'll get a lot done.' "
What they seem to have done is let their rigidity alienate the electorate. I ask Gingrich to name his worst mistake in handling them.
"Why would you assume I made a mistake in handling the freshmen?" Gingrich asks, baring his teeth.
"Everybody's fallible."
"I'm sure I am," Gingrich says, "but I haven't worried much about that part of it."
Though most freshmen came to Washington worshiping Gingrich, and still praise him -- "He's the most brilliant man I've ever met," Neumann says -- many now see him as a typically untrustworthy Washington politician. I tell Gingrich that some freshmen, pointing to his eventual compromise in the budget battles, have likened him not to William Wallace but to Robert the Bruce, the leader of the Scottish nobles, who through most of "Braveheart" is portrayed as weak and indecisive (but who, in actual history, led the Scots to victory over England).
"I plead guilty to being Robert the Bruce," Gingrich says. "The Wallace is a great figure. But the Wallace is to the Bruce as Goldwater is to Reagan, the great romantic, idealistic leader who creates the movement but can't manage it.
"I think it's wonderful to have freshmen who are gallantly courageous and willing to rush onto the field and fight for the cause they believe in," he continues. "But I would like some of them to have a longer view."
I ask Gingrich to describe Neumann's performance in Congress. "He's an absolute prophet of balancing the budget, brilliant and idealistic," he says. "Every once in a while, he has his moments. It's really a matter of drawing distinctions." And then, as if addressing Neumann's rejectionist faction itself, Gingrich says: "If it's a matter of conscience, you should never give in. . . . But there are a lot of times, frankly, when you just get to be a pain in the neck."

HOW TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE LEADERSHIP (AND THE COPS)
Neumann's independent streak surfaced early. Just two months after arriving in Washington, he had his first run-in on the Defense Appropriations subcommittee.
"I'm brand-new at this point," he recalls. "I'm sitting at a little added-on table at the end of the big table -- like a kid's table. An emergency spending bill came up. It was $3.2 billion in additional spending and we had $1.8 billion in spending cuts. So I asked where the balance was coming from, the $1.4 billion. They looked at me like I was from another planet. I understood they were adding another $1.4 billion to the deficit, but I wanted to hear them say that. I said I wouldn't vote for it. Gingrich called me in and said I had to vote for it. It was like a threat.
"They said I had signed a pledge not to oppose the leadership," he continues. "Some staffer told me this, and I told him to stuff it, that I would never sign a pledge like that. I was in the housing business, so I read everything that I sign."
It turned out that Neumann was never asked to sign the pledge, and he opposed the spending bill to the end. (It passed without his vote.) His next confrontation with the Speaker was the one that launched the freshman revolt. In September 1995, Neumann proposed an amendment to a Defense Appropriations bill, stating that troops couldn't be sent to Bosnia without Congressional approval. "They took my amendment out," he says, "and this time the bill was defeated, and I was blamed because I was on the committee." Neumann immediately heard from Bob Livingston, the Appropriations chairman. "He called me into his office and started screaming at me. It got so bad that two Capitol police officers came to the door to see if anything was wrong."
Neumann went home for the weekend, and soon received a call from the Governor of Wisconsin, Tommy G. Thompson. "He just wanted to tell me that I was doing a great job," Neumann says. "I thought that was nice, the Governor and all, but Sue said 'Something's wrong.' She's got radar."
As soon as he returned to Washington, Neumann was told he no longer sat on the Defense subcommittee. The Speaker summoned him. "Newt was very cool and collected," he recalls. "He said I had a great first year, that I should claim victory and move on. I didn't know what to say. I had never been kicked out of anything before. What I remember most is the Speaker's balcony. It's like sitting on Lake Beulah, where I grew up. The esthetic patriotic value of that scenery, the Washington Monument, is somewhat overwhelming."
When Neumann's class learned of his punishment, says David McIntosh, the Indiana freshman, "you could see a wave going across the House floor. Every single freshman said that that is outrageous. It was a defining moment for us."
A delegation of freshmen demanded a meeting with Gingrich. "We let him know that he would have a riot if he tried to punish Mark for standing up for what he believes in," McIntosh says.
To avert the politically disastrous spectacle of rampaging freshmen, Gingrich and Livingston struck a deal with Neumann's allies. "Everybody in the class sees Mark as a future Budget Committee chairman," McIntosh says, "so someone proposed that Mark take a slot on Budget, and stay on Appropriations, but not the Defense subcommittee. The person who was not in the room who Livingston kind of stuck it to was John Kasich." (Kasich, an Ohio Republican, is the deficit hawk who is chairman of the Budget Committee.) "But Mark made a real effort to say to John, 'I'm not going to ruin your committee.' John realizes that Mark is like he was 10 years ago."
Neumann, who is now the only freshman to sit on both Budget and Appropriations -- his only punishment, in the end, was to bounced off the powerful Defense subcommittee of Appropriations while remaining on two less-mighty subcommittees -- remains nonplussed by the sudden fame his obstinancy brought him. "Washington is the only place," he says, "where you get attention from doing what you say you're going to do."

THE ROAD TO WASHINGTON, WHICH HE HATES
Like most Republican freshmen, Neumann does not hide his hatred of Washington. He chose not to move his family there, but to keep them in Wisconsin; in a famous incident, he returned home early one week, missing several important votes, to take his son hunting. Wisconsin Democrats ripped him for that, but they misjudged the reaction in their state, where deficit reduction is important, just not as important as killing deer with a loved one.
No Georgetown dinner party has ever been graced by Neumann's presence; he has never heard of Ben and Sally, and, like most freshmen, the significance of Embassy Row escapes him. Pat Schroeder, the retiring Democratic Congresswoman who is particularly acid on the subject of the Republican freshmen, says: "They don't have any desire to deal with anything outside America. And they don't have any desire to deal with Washington. All you hear is that Washington is a pit, Washington is going to poison them, yap, yap, yap."
Neumann himself has a neutron-bomb view of Washington -- the people he could live without, but the buildings he loves. It is the buildings, in fact, that inspired him, he says, to enter politics.
"We hadn't traveled much when we first visited Washington," Neumann recalls, describing his family's fateful vacation to the capital. He is telling me the story of his family's 1989 trip as we drive from Janesville, in the western part of his district, to Racine, on Lake Michigan, for a Fourth of July parade. We're accompanied by Sue Neumann, dressed in patriotic colors, and Tricia, the Neumanns' 18-year-old daughter. Their two sons, Andy, 20, and Matt, 14, make up his advance team, and are already in Racine.
As we pass signs advertising "Fireworks -- Cheese," Neumann becomes preoccupied. "Last year, we had a bad scene at the parade," he says. "They threw cherry bombs at us, little firecrackers. Then some guy grabbed me into the crowd and wouldn't let me go."
He returns to his story. "We were only planning on staying in Washington three days, but it turned into a week," he says. "We saw all the monuments. We went to the Jefferson and to the Lincoln --."
"You walk up the stairs to the Lincoln Memorial," Sue Neumann interrupts, "and read the words on the walls --."
"And you realize that the country is going in the exact opposite direction of what it says," her husband says.
"Which words?" I ask -- the Gettysburg Address, the second Inaugural address?
"All the words," Sue says.
"Then we went to Arlington National Cemetery," she continues, "and to see row after row of men who gave everything for their country, it's just --."
"We just realized that the country was going down, and we had to do something," Neumann says.
I ask, "So reading the inscriptions on the Lincoln Memorial is what got you into politics?"
"Yes," he says.
Mr. Smith in the flesh, it seems.
The Neumanns decided that Mark would run for Congress. The only problem: the First District seat was occupied by Les Aspin, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. In 1992, the Neumanns spent $1 million of their own money trying to defeat Aspin. They hired political consultants and attacked Aspin's free-spending ways -- Mr. Smith goes negative.
Aspin won with 58 percent of the vote, but then President Clinton appointed him Secretary of Defense, and a special election was called for 1993. Neumann ran again, this time against Peter Barca, a state representative from Kenosha. This time, a squeaker: Barca won on a recount.
Neumann, who spent $250,000 of his own in 1993, announced the end of his political career. But six months later, according to Neumann, Governor Thompson summoned him to Madison and asked him to make one last try.
"I decided to do it myself this time -- no consultants," Neumann says. "The problem with consultants is that they come from Washington. Once they get their hooks into you, you're owned by them."
In 1994, Neumann and Barca both ran negative campaigns, filled with accusations of "push-polling" -- planting negative notions about your opponent in the course of a telephone "poll" -- and other deceits. Neumann won, squeezing into Congress with just less than 50 percent of the vote.
"It was an insult that we lost this district," says Douglas Frazier, the retired president of the United Auto Workers union, who was recently in Wisconsin to endorse Spottswood. The district's Democrats are still shocked by Neumann's 1994 win, but Wisconsin voters are famous for ticket-splitting heterodoxy. As Roy Cohn wrote in his biography of Joe McCarthy, the state's most famous contribution to the Republican Party, "Many have pointed out that Wisconsin is not an easy state to analyze politically." Wisconsin, with its deep progressive tradition, is a fundamentally conservative, churchgoing state with an openly gay Republican Congressman and two Democratic Jewish Senators.
Russell Feingold, the state's junior Democratic Senator and something of a maverick himself ("some people call mine a Mr. Smith approach," he told me), maintains that Neumann snuck into office by masking his true intent. "I think when he was elected," Feingold says, "the people of this district did not realize how extreme his politics are. There is deep suspicion of extremism in this state. There are two kind of Republicans here. One is the Rotary type, the economic type. They don't have the extremist moral agenda. Then there's the new kind of Republican, the extremists Neumann is associated with, the ones who are heavily moralistic in approach."
Feingold admits that Neumann's economic message does resonate with Wisconsin voters, who are proud of their state's reputation for parsimony. The state receives fewer Federal dollars per capita than almost any other, and its most popular politician of recent years was Senator William Proxmire, the Democrat, now retired, known for his "Golden Fleece" award for wasteful Government projects. But fiscal conservatism, Feingold says, hardly equals Gingrich extremism. "There was no Republican revolution in Wisconsin," Feingold says. "Neumann is out of step with Wisconsin voters."
Neumann would certainly seem to be out of step in Racine, which is why he's expecting trouble at the parade. This is a Democratic town, and Neumann is seen as not just any Republican, but a Gingrich Republican, a freshman Republican, an extremist. As we drive into town, he's searching for his place in the parade lineup. "I think we have to go down one of these," he says, driving past side streets blocked by police officers.
"Why don't you tell them you're the Congressman?" I suggest. "They'll let you through."
"Oh yeah, right, what do you think this is, Washington?"
He finally finds his place, in front of a convertible carrying Miss Racine. She is dressed in a blue, sequined dress that reflects the morning sun, as do the freshly scrubbed fire trucks and the gigantic construction machinery. The crowd is five-deep along the sidewalk.
"America," Neumann explains to me, his foreign guest.
He walks over to Miss Racine to congratulate her, but steps aside when a photographer appears. "No, Mr. Neumann," the photographer says. "I want you in the picture."
"Oh. Me?"
The parade steps off, and the Neumanns brace themselves for the unknown. But no one boos. As the Congressman walks Racine's main streets, he does hear the occasional admonition -- "Don't touch my Medicare!" one woman shouts. But he also hears bursts of enthusiastic applause, and shouts of encouragement: "You give it to 'em, Mark," and "Stick it to 'em, Mark."
Word has got back to Racine that its Congressman is giving Washington a hard time.

FEAR AND LOATHING (AND TEARS) ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL
"It's all a sham," says Lydia Spottswood. We are talking just after the grand opening of the Walworth County Democratic campaign headquarters, where an hour's worth of envelope stuffing gets you in a photograph with cardboard cutouts of Bill and Hillary Clinton. All of this guff about Neumann's vaunted independence, Spottswood is telling me, is Republican propaganda, designed to throw voters off the scent of a true Gingrichite.
She has a case -- and doesn't have a case -- because Neumann is both a party loyalist and a party defector. He is committed to the Republican social agenda; he is anti-gun-control, anti-affirmative-action and anti-United Nations. He supports Constitutional amendments to balance the budget, to ban flag burning and to outlaw abortion.
But his idea of party loyalty is idiosyncratic, which seems to confuse Spottswood.
"You know, the Republicans don't like him," she tells me.
"Isn't that a compliment, coming from a Democrat?"
"He'd like to think so," she says, dropping the subject.
It is not entirely true that Republicans don't like Neumann. And even those who don't like him do need him to win on Tuesday. That might be why Bob Livingston, who threw Neumann off the Appropriations Defense subcommittee, recently held a fund-raising breakfast for him, and donated $1,000 from his own campaign fund to Neumann's.
I asked Neumann why Livingston has become so friendly. "Bob wants to be chairman next year, too," he replied. In other words, a Republican majority, even if made up off recalcitrant ideologues like Neumann, returns people like Living ston to power and a House full of Lydia Spottswoods does not. Neumann has also received support from his other chairman, John Kasich, who has campaigned for him in Wisconsin, and from Governor Thompson.
When I asked Neumann if he would like Bob Dole to campaign for him, he said, "Elizabeth Dole." When I repeated "Bob Dole," he repeated, "Elizabeth Dole."
Spottswood also takes the unusual step of attacking Neumann for votes she herself would have made, for example, his vote in favor of the minimum wage increase. She says that Neumann violated his own principles in order to win votes. "Why would this rich businessman vote for that?" she asks. "It goes against his whole platform."
Neumann disagrees. "The minimum wage isn't one of my core issues," he says. "My vote didn't raise the deficit, and so if my constituents want the minimum wage increased, I'll vote for it."
Spottswood also attacks him for being one of only 37 Republicans to vote against the spending bill that will finance President Clinton's anti-terrorism and anti-drug programs. Neumann's response? "They only gave us two hours to read a 15-inch stack of documents. I have to know what I'm voting for before I vote."
Spottswood: "Here's a guy who doesn't trust the committee system and the House leadership." She doesn't immediately realize that she has accused Neumann of distrusting Newt Gingrich.
For the most part, Spottswood is running what might be called a cultural campaign, suggesting to reporters and voters that Neumann and his belief system -- his fundamentalist Christianity, his anti-government rhetoric -- are alien to politically progressive Wisconsin. She regularly attacks Neumann's character: she told me stories, all apparently baseless, that call into question Neumann's business ethics, even his parenting skills.
When I comment on the nastiness of the race, she begins to cry. "When you say that you're expecting both of us to be nasty, that's so contrary to who I am," she says, wiping away tears. "I look at this as public service. Politics has become a blood sport."
Neumann harbors no Mr. Smith-like illusions that politics, even in a supposedly genteel state like Wisconsin, should be anything but rough. "Campaigns are like war," he says, "just without blood."

THE SOUL OF AN ANTIPOLITICIAN
 Mark Neumann has set a deadline for himself: six terms in Congress, and out. But what happens in his 12th year if he's suddenly offered the chairmanship of the Budget Committee, his dream assignment?
"No hesitation," he says. "I'm out. Twelve years and out, no matter what. I gave my word to the people of the First District." He's getting angry at me now. "And I'm not going to break my word!"
If only Spottswood Continued on page 88
could find an example of Neumann's breaking his word, perhaps she could break Neumann. What she says she has found, however, is quite the opposite: countless examples of Neumann serving abstract principle at the expense of his constituents. "This is a Congressman who doesn't understand that you want to bring money home," she says.
Neumann is unremittingly opposed to all pork-barrel projects, even when the Federal funds would be headed to his district. His job, he says, is to protect the taxpayer from his greedy Congressional colleagues. Along with several other freshmen, he has agitated for a revamping of the entire House committee system, in order to break the hegemony of the Appropriations, Commerce and Ways and Means Committees. It is a movement that, so far, has not moved an inch.
Spottswood charges that Neumann opposes pork not out of principle, but because he can't get any for his district. "Maybe he's afraid of failure," she says. "Maybe he knows he doesn't have friends on either side of the aisle, and therefore he can't deliver."
That's not quite right. Neumann was placed on Appropriations because he won election so narrowly, and the leadership hoped he would use his place at the trough to strengthen his hold on the district. It hasn't worked out that way.
Such is the case with the sewer commission of Walworth County. This summer, a county delegation requested financing from Neumann for a new sewer system for an unincorporated area around Lake Como. The area's residents are mainly poor senior citizens, and it was widely agreed that the project was worthy of government aid.
That is where Neumann came in. After losing his place on the Appropriations defense subcommittee, he remained on the subcommittee that appropriates money to the Housing and Urban Development Department and to Veterans Affairs. "HUD-V.A. has a revolving fund where money is allocated to states on a formula," Neumann explains. "The states decide where they need it the most and then allocate."
Many of those allocations, like the allocations of any appropriations subcommittee, go to the pork-barrel projects of connected Congressmen. "We went to Mark and said that these Congressmen are stealing our [expletive] money," says Patrick J. Moore, a Walworth County sewer commissioner. "We said we want our share of it and we want it now. Then Neumann gets verbally violent with us. He starts yelling about treason and the Constitution and our grandchildren's money and all this stuff."
Neumann: "They asked me to put in a pork project and I said no. There's two ways of doing things here. One is called pork-barrel spending and one is called the proper procedure."
"But," I asked him, "didn't the leadership assign you to Appropriations because --."
"What? Because I only won by 1,120 votes, so I should pork to get re-elected? That may be why they put me on the committee, but I'm not porking. These people in Lake Como would have had their money if other members hadn't porked all the money."
After a three-hour meeting between Neumann and the county delegation, it was agreed that Neumann's office would support the commissioners through the state allocation procedure. "It's a sound project," Neumann now says, "but the best thing I can do for them is make sure that pork doesn't get through next year so there's money left for legitimate projects."
"That's not going to make you too popular on Appropriations," I say.
"I don't care about that."
"Why?"
"I'm at peace with myself," he says. "I know that everything's just temporary. I have everlasting life through Jesus Christ. So if I'm here in Wisconsin only temporarily, I'm in Washington really temporarily."
Neumann pauses. "I can get them pork," he says. "But if I start putting in pork projects, I can't go tell anyone else to stop putting in pork. I couldn't do it. I would have to resign."
Mark Neumann, with two years in Congress, has not lost his fervor; he has not been, to use a word favored by his rejectionist colleagues, "housebroken."
There is much that is troubling about Neumann's record: his annoyance with the democratic process and his unthinking isolationism, to name just two. And there is a meanness that sometimes sneaks into his voice when he talks about cutting Government. "Fourteen people lost their jobs, and we're not sending them to job-retraining," he gloated to supporters one day, describing the freshman-driven campaign to end ice delivery to Congressional offices.
In his excesses, he may be typical of his freshman class; in his willingness to challenge authority, he is in a surprisingly small minority. This may turn out to be Neumann's most rewarding role -- the proud heretic banging on the oak doors of power, condemning the status quo. "In Washington," he likes to say, "both party structures are equally morally bankrupt."
Only a Congressman so devoted to his own vision -- in this case, an especially flinty vision of a debt-free, shrunken Government -- would be so uninterested in currying the approval of his elders. And though he recognizes that deficit spending is not quite the equivalent of human bondage, he sees the fight for a balanced budget as a modern-day analogue to Lincoln's fight against slavery. "We're enslaving our future generations with debt," he says. "I'm not equating the debt to actual slavery, but Lincoln saw slavery as morally and ethically unacceptable and the debt and the deficit are morally and ethically unacceptable, too."
One day, sitting in a Cracker Barrel restaurant in Janesville, he handed me some of his campaign literature. It was treacly, and ostentatiously patriotic. One brochure in particular caught my eye. Its cover read, "Values -- Principles -- Integrity -- Vote Mark Neumann U.S. Congress." But instead of Neumann's face, the cover featured a photograph of the Lincoln Memorial.
"Getting a little bit sold on yourself?" I asked him.
He picked up the pamphlet and looked at Lincoln.
"He was a weird guy, too," he said, "don't you think?"

HEADLINE: THE BIG CITY;
A Kick for the Economy

BYLINE: By John Tierney 

 BODY:
FOR NEW YORKers, the Presidential campaign has been a depressing reminder of how happy our fellow Americans are. We keep hearing about an economic boom that has created millions of jobs, but New York still hasn't recovered all those lost during the last recession. Other cities have labor shortages; New York's unemployment rate remains one of the highest in the country. What are we doing wrong?
Free-market zealots mistakenly blame City Hall. They think New York's distinctively weak economy is somehow related to its distinctively strong government. It's true that the economy is more heavily regulated than any other city's, a fact that companies like to point out when they leave town. But as everyone must know by now, New York City imposes all these regulations because it is determined to help business. Whenever private businesses blunder, the City Council can be counted on to hold a public hearing to devise a rescue plan. Officials in other cities struggle just to take care of basic responsibilities like streets and schools, but New York's have found time to advise the rest of us how to do our jobs. 
 These public servants turned management consultants have been so productive that businesses have a hard time keeping up with their recommendations. That's the real problem. The expertise of city officials is being squandered. New York's best entrepreneurial minds are trapped in public service. What would happen if their talents were unleashed on private businesses? Their departure from government would be a great loss (as the officials have explained to us during the current debate about the term-limits referendum). Still, applying their talents privately could absolutely invigorate the economy. Consider a few of the enterprises they could start:
Pure Peter's Pub. If restaurateurs knew their customers as well as City Council President Peter F. Vallone does, they might not be complaining about losing business because of his anti-smoking ordinance. They've argued that it's an unnecessary intrusion on private business -- people were always free to patronize nonsmoking restaurants -- but they don't understand their patrons' devotion to health. In his own establishment, Vallone would be free to introduce other life-saving innovations. Would Pure Peter's be alcohol-free, too? Fat-free? Make your reservations early.
Fort Eldridge: The Safe Savings and Loan. After Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge was mugged at a cash machine in 1991, she championed the nation's first law requiring security measures at A.T.M. parlors. Bankers, who noted that their facilities already had better security systems than the sidewalks outside, claimed that the measures would force them to spend $120 million per year, close parlors and raise fees. Some experts believed that the total cost to consumers might be more than what Eldridge lost in the robbery.
The Council's investigation never resolved the mystery of why banks, which spend so much money competing for customers, would endanger their reputations by skimping on security measures. One possible, though undocumented, explanation: Market researchers discovered that customers are more likely to put their money into an institution known for frequent muggings, because it's a sign that the bank keeps its machines well stocked with cash -- why else would the muggers be hanging around?
Despite the law's passage, muggings have occurred at cash machines --and one mugging is one too many, as Eldridge knows. If she opened a bank, its fortified A.T.M. bunkers could set a new industry standard.
The Dapper Donna. When Pathmark was seeking approval to open a supermarket in her Queens district last year, Councilwoman Juanita E. Watkins convinced the company to "donate" $400,000, to be distributed to "the community" under her supervision. Watkins was forced to cancel the deal, but her efforts wouldn't be lost in the private sector. Her skill could revive a New York industry weakened by the loss of John Gotti.
Green's Greens. In 1990, Mark Green sent undercover investigators from the Department of Consumer Affairs into the city's salad bars. They caught the owners charging for salads without deducting the weight of the plastic containers. Green announced that the fraud, which amounted to a few pennies per salad, cost consumers a total of $12 million annually. Apologists for salad bars argued that the owners should be free to determine prices however they wanted, and that they would just make up the $12 million difference by charging more for salad ingredients. But there's an important principle at stake here. Consumers who care about this issue would welcome Green's establishment with its slogan: "Our lettuce may cost a little more, but the plastic is FREE!"
Koslowitz & Freed Cleaners. Councilwoman Karen Koslowitz is crusading for a law that would, as she says, "persuade" dry cleaners to stop charging more for a woman's shirt than for a man's. At a hearing in September, a spokesman for the dry-cleaning industry claimed that some women's shirts are more expensive to clean than men's because they're too small to fit on the automatic presses and need to be ironed by hand, but Council members knew better than to fall for that line.
A more likely explanation is that the dry-cleaning industry, dominated by immigrants from countries with patriarchal cultures, is engaged in a conspiracy to oppress women. The typical female consumer isn't able to shop around for a better deal, partly because price comparisons require complex mathematical calculations and partly because there's simply no choice in most New York neighborhoods. (Within two blocks of my apartment there are only nine dry cleaners.) Overhauling the industry will require someone with more initiative than the ordinary immigrant -- someone like Councilwoman Kathryn Freed.
At the hearing, when the dry cleaner mentioned the problem with the automatic press, Freed suggested, "Your automatic machine should be a little more adjustable." Eureka! A technological breakthrough that had eluded the industry's best minds! A few more innovations like that and our economy could be booming again.

HEADLINE: THE 1996 CAMPAIGN: The Election: A Voter's Guide To the Issues And Candidates;
In New York, 31 Seats for the United States House of Representatives

 BODY:
Except where noted, candidates are listed in the order in which they appear on the ballot.
 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 
First District Candidates
 
NORA L. BREDES, 46, Democrat. Served on the Suffolk County Legislature for the last four years and is making her first run for Congress.
 
MICHAEL P. FORBES, 44, Republican. Freshman incumbent who in 1994 rode a wave of anti-Clinton sentiment to beat a four-term Democrat.
 
The District
 
The First is the largest Congressional district geographically on Long Island, covering the eastern half of Suffolk County. Economically, it is still recovering from the loss of military jobs at the former Grumman Corporation, now merged into Northrop Grumman and once the Island's largest employer.
 
The Issues
 
Mr. Forbes, an early Newt Gingrich supporter, finds himself defending the Republican Contract With America and his mixed record on environmental issues. Ms. Bredes, a leader in the battle to close the Shoreham nuclear power plant, hopes to capitalize on her history of seeking tough clean-air and water standards.
 
Analysis
 
Though registered Republicans outnumber Democrats by a 3-to-2 ratio in the district, Democrats have held the seat for almost all of the last 35 years. On the coattails of President Clinton, who some polls suggest has a 30 percent lead over Bob Dole on Long Island, Ms. Bredes could return the seat to the Democratic Party.
 
Fourth District Candidates
 
CAROLYN MCCARTHY, 52, Democrat. Nurse whose husband was killed and son wounded three years ago in a shooting on the Long Island Rail Road. Has lobbied for gun control. First run for public office.
 
DANIEL FRISA, 41, Republican. Freshman Congressman and former state assemblyman.
 
ROBERT S. BERKOWITZ, Liberal Party
 
VINCENT P. GARBITELLI, Right to Life Party
 
The District
 
This Long Island district, which covers Nassau County's South Shore, may be a Republican stronghold, but there are Democratic enclaves in the heavily Jewish Five Towns area and among black and Hispanic voters around Hempstead.
 
The Issues
 
Mrs. McCarthy, a Republican until she accepted the Democratic nomination, says she was drawn into the race because of Mr. Frisa's vote against the assault weapons ban. She favors strict gun control, strong environmental regulations, abortion rights and moves to make health care more affordable. Mr. Frisa, who also supports abortion rights, is making a central issue of Mrs. McCarthy's opposition to the death penalty.
 
Analysis
 
Mrs. McCarthy's valor in coping with tragedy brought her national attention and a groundswell of support, particularly among women. Polls by Nassau Democrats show her leading. Mr. Frisa, regarded as vulnerable by officials of both parties, is relying on a direct-mail campaign, and the party organization is working vigorously to bring out Republican voters.
 
19th District Candidates
 
RICHARD S. KLEIN, 59, Democrat. Physician who gave up private practice to make his first bid for elected office. A resident of Chappaqua, has a long history of volunteerism.
 
SUE W. KELLY, 59, Republican. Had never held office before being elected to the House in 1994. A resident of the Westchester village of Bedford, had been a Republican fund-raiser, real estate broker, advocate for women's health issues and junior high school teacher.
 
JOSEPH J. DIOGUARDI, Conservative and Right to Life Party
 
WILLIAM E. HAASE, Independence Party
 
The District
 
This is a predominantly Republican district covering part of White Plains and all of Westchester north of White Plains, as well as Putnam County and parts of Orange and Dutchess counties. The district has traditionally sent Republicans to Congress, including Hamilton Fish Jr., who held the seat for more than two decades.
 
The Issues
 
As in other Congressional districts, the race here has become something of a referendum on Newt Gingrich's Contract With America. Mr. Klein has criticized Ms. Kelly for joining the Congressional Republicans in what he describes as attacks on the environment, Medicare and student-loan programs. She is also being criticized as a closet liberal by Mr. DioGuardi, a former two-term representative who waged a bitter campaign against her and lost in the Republican primary. But Ms. Kelly has not disavowed her ties to the House leadership, instead casting herself as a social and fiscal moderate who supports abortion rights, tax cuts and a balanced budget. She has also sought to portray her opponents as extremists who are out of touch with the district's largely moderate voters.
 
Analysis
 
Though many incumbents in other races are more entrenched, Ms. Kelly's political future is far less certain. Mr. Klein could benefit greatly from Mr. DioGuardi's campaign criticizing the first-term Republican as a "Democrat in disguise" with liberal views on abortion and gay rights. Widely considered an underdog, Mr. Klein is counting on Mr. DioGuardi to take votes away from Ms. Kelly.
 
26th District Candidates
 
MAURICE D. HINCHEY, 58, Democrat. Two-term incumbent from Saugerties in Ulster County. In 1974, became the first Democrat elected to the Assembly from his district in 61 years and held the seat for 18 years. In both his races for Congress, won by 3 percentage points or less over the Republican, Bob Moppert.
 
SUE WITTIG, 41, Republican. Owns and runs a wallpaper store in the town of Ulster. Has never run for office before but is president of the local Republican Club and has worked on Assembly races and Mr. Moppert's campaigns. Also a resident of Saugerties, has been active in the National Rifle Association and the property rights movement.
 
DOUGLAS W. DRAZEN, Independence Party
 
The District
 
Stretching across eight counties, from the Hudson River town of Beacon to Ithaca on Cayuga Lake, the 26th is a classic swing district, politically diverse and notoriously fickle. It voted for George Bush in 1988, Bill Clinton in 1992. Binghamton, its largest city, is marginally Democratic but has a Republican mayor and Council. And though Republicans slightly outnumber Democrats, it has nevertheless elected a Democrat to the House for years. Mr. Hinchey would seem too left-leaning for this largely rural conservative region but has managed to win by carrying liberal Ithaca while splitting the rest of the district.
 
The Issues
 
The candidates differ sharply on most things. They agree that the economy is the main issue, but Mr. Hinchey says he would use targeted tax incentives and grant programs to spur growth while Ms. Wittig would cut a range of taxes and eliminate government regulations. Ms. Wittig is staunchly anti-abortion; Mr. Hinchey defends abortion rights. She supports a balanced-budget constitutional amendment; he opposes it. She contends environmental policies have infringed on property owners' rights; he has been a strong advocate of tough environmental regulations.
 
Analysis
 
The Right to Life Party candidate won almost 5,000 votes here in 1994, quadruple Mr. Hinchey's margin of victory. So Ms. Wittig contends that she will win because she has the Right to Life, Conservative and Republican Party lines. But just as Mr. Hinchey's liberal positions almost cost him the race in 1994, she may have positioned herself too far on the right to win in 1996, when many New Yorkers are expressing dismay with conservative Republicanism. Moreover, since Mr. Hinchey survived the 1994 Republican tide, analysts say he will be much harder to beat in 1996, when polls indicate that President Clinton will win the state by a comfortable margin. In a close race, Mr. Drazen, scion of a well-known Binghamton family who lost the Republican primary, could siphon anti-incumbent votes away from Ms. Wittig.

PROPOSITIONS
 
Proposal 1
 
The Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act authorizes the state to borrow $1.75 billion over the coming 35 years to pay for projects that reduce water and air pollution, protect drinking water supplies, close landfills, encourage recycling and clean up abandoned industrial sites. Interest payments on the bonds will bring the total cost to taxpayers to more than $3 billion.
 
The Issues
 
Proponents say that unless the proposition is approved, essential environmental projects will be postponed for years. They also say that many of the projects are required under state and Federal laws, and that the state can lighten the burden on local taxpayers by issuing long-term bonds. The total cost, they say, will be less than $4 a person per year and will not require a tax increase.
 
Critics, including some Democratic legislators, antitax groups and property-rights activists, say New York already has more debt than any other state, is facing a $3 billion projected budget shortfall next year and has one of the lowest bond ratings in the nation, largely because of its heavy debt load. Though many opponents say they support the bond act's objectives, they say many of the projects are politically motivated and unessential. Critics want the state to pay for environmental projects out of its annual budget rather than incurring additional long-term debt that they contend could someday force the Legislature to raise taxes.
 
Analysis
 
Voters have demonstrated growing anxiety about the state's huge, ever-expanding debt -- now more than $30 billion -- by rejecting the last two bond acts, including a 1990 proposal to finance environmental projects.
 
But this year could be different. The economy is stronger, which could allay fears about state borrowing; the proposition is promoted by Gov. George E. Pataki, whose standing as a fiscal conservative could win over Republican voters who tend to oppose bond acts, and President Clinton's lead in the polls could depress turnout among Republicans, who are more likely to vote against the bond act.
 
Finally, supporters have built a larger vote-pulling operation than opponents, who are relying almost exclusively on television advertisements.
 
Proposal 2
 
This city proposal -- entitled "A local law to amend the New York City Charter, in relation to terms limits and staggered terms" -- would change the existing term-limits law that now allows city officials to stay in office for no more than eight years. Instead, officials, including the mayor, comptroller, public advocate, borough presidents and City Council members, could serve up to three consecutive terms, or 12 years. The law would affect anyone who has been in office since Jan. 1, 1994.
 
The Issues
 
Voters approved term limits for all city elected officials in 1993. A yes vote for this new referendum would extend the existing limit. Council leaders, the main proponents, argue that unless the law is changed, virtually all officials would have to leave office at once in 2001 and then every eight years after that. They contend that the longer limit would allow a smoother turnover and more experienced Council members. Opponents urge a no vote, saying that the proposal would overturn the voters' will as expressed in 1993 and would only buy more time in office for politicians.
 
Analysis
 
Urging New Yorkers to keep term limits as they are, opponents have tapped into the same voter discontent over career politicians that prompted passage of limits three years ago. They have also exploited the fact that the Council is trying to undo the earlier referendum. But voters may be swayed by the Council's argument that the new referendum would not eliminate term limits, just extend them into a more workable form. Council leaders have also questioned the motives of Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics heir who is spending about $2 million on commercials to try to defeat the proposal. Mr. Lauder, who critics say is trying to push his own political career, spent more than $2 million on the 1993 limits campaign.

HEADLINE: An Economics Lesson: The Candidates' Plans for Education

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL; Peter Passell writes about economics for The New York Times.

 BODY:
In an era of widespread dissatisfaction with public schools, it's no surprise that education issues have been as important a part of the Presidential campaign as foreign policy or defense for candidate Bob Dole. Nor is it surprising that Bill Clinton has countered with a potpourri of proposals designed to show that Americans already have an education President.
 What may come as a surprise, though, in light of the candidates' enthusiasm for classroom initiatives, is that Uncle Sam is really only a minor player in the big battles over education. Nor is the Federal Government likely to become a major player, because the deficit-riddled budget offers little room for experimentation. 
 "The Federal Government has a tiny role in education, and little financial leverage over states or local school districts," says Caroline Hoxby, an economist at Harvard University.
 But political symbols matter, too, particularly when they come from the bully pulpit of the White House. And both candidates are trying to make waves with proposals that emphasize their ideological differences.
 Bob Dole wants to encourage states to adopt tuition-voucher plans that, he argues, would break the hold of government bureaucrats (and teachers' unions) on publicly funded primary and secondary education. Bill Clinton wants to remove the remaining financial obstacles to state-supported post-secondary education at a time when virtually all the fruits of economic growth are going to Americans with college degrees. And while both initiatives have enthusiastic audiences, they raise as many questions as they answer on subjects that deeply divide educators and economists.
 Some basics.
 Eric Hanushek, an economist at the University of Rochester, notes that the Federal Government covers only 6 percent of the nation's $200 billion-plus budget for public primary and secondary schools. Local property taxpayers bear the lion's share of the financial burden in most places, with a substantial chunk coming from the states and directed toward reducing spending disparities between school districts.
 Leaving aside subsidies for university-based research, Washington's reach into higher education is longer than in public primary and secondary schools education though not by much. Of the roughly $50 billion spent by colleges this year, just $12 billion to 13 billion will come from Uncle Sam.
 But the Federal Government's limited role hasn't stopped either Presidential candidate from promising additional goodies. Along with abolishing the Department of Education -- a move he argues would save money without cutting substantive programs -- Mr. Dole would make interest on student loans deductible from income taxes, permit families to set up education-investment accounts that allow tax-sheltered withdrawals for college tuition and give employer-financed education permanent tax-free status.
 Mr. Clinton would offer $5 billion to reduce the local interest burden for school construction bonds, expand financing for Head Start, help to fund state plans for improving technology education and provide $1,000 merit scholarships for the top 5 percent of the nation's high school graduates.
 But each candidate is reserving most of his political powder for tax-based proposals that accent differences in what they see as the proper role of the Federal Government. For Mr. Clinton, it's accessibility to higher education; for Mr. Dole, it's vouchers.
 Start with the former. President Clinton's "Hope Scholarship Tax Cut" would give all high school graduates a $1,500 tax credit (payable in cash if students or their families had less than $1,500 in tax liability) to cover tuition for a first year of college. Students who maintained a B average, provided they weren't convicted of a drug felony, would be eligible for another $1,500 credit for a second year of higher education. Those who did not take advantage of the Hope Scholarship would be allowed to deduct a total up to $10,000 in tuition for higher education, provided their incomes were below $100,000.
 Mr. Clinton proposes offsetting the projected losses in Federal revenues with fees on international airport departures, sales of airwave rights and restructure taxation of profits made by multinational corporations.
 The appeal is straightforward. In the words of the Department of Education's press release, it would "make 14 years of education -- at least two years of college -- the standard for all Americans."
 So is the economic rationale. Although wages for those with college educations have risen substantially in the last two decades, workers without post-secondary training are, at best, running in place. In 1979, for example, the average college-educated worker earned 47 percent more than the average high school graduate. By 1993, the gap had risen to 81 percent. That fact has not been lost on America's youth, noted Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard and former aide to Robert Reich, the former Secretary of Labor: in 1980, 26 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 were in school. By 1994 the figure had risen to 35 percent.
 The catch, Mr. Katz says, is that all of the increased college attendance in those 14 years has been among middle- and upper-income families. The proportion attending college from families in the bottom quarter of the income distribution is stuck at very low levels. "Poor kids are being hit twice," he concludes, because rising tuition has made college less affordable, even as the financial payoff to higher education has risen.
 "Clinton's college tuition subsidies," he adds, "would ease the pain."
 The Hope Scholarship program is loosely modeled after one in Georgia that is financed by a state lottery. The Georgia program offers a free education to residents who maintain a B-average and attend a public university. Those who choose a private college can receive partial scholarships.
 But some, including James Heckman, an economist at the University of Chicago, question the underlying premise of both the Georgia program and the Clinton plan. Colleges, he says, already work hard to recruit low-income students.
 "Long-term environmental factors that leave these students poorly motivated and poorly prepared are far more important than financial constraints" in limiting college attendance, Heckman says.
 Others, who do accept the idea that money has a lot to do with who goes to college, worry that the Clinton approach will not yield the maximum bang for a buck.
 Lawrence Gladieux, executive director for policy analysis at the College Board, notes that most of the $43 billion in tax revenue sacrificed over seven years for the tuition tax credits and the $10,000 tuition deduction would be pocketed by families of students who would go to college without added Federal help.
 "For them, it would be a windfall," he says -- one the country can ill-afford in an era of lean Federal budgets.
 Thomas Kane, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, is skeptical that Hope Scholarships will have the desired impact, even for low-income students. Some community colleges charge less than $1,500 tuition, he argues, and would almost certainly raise their fees rather than leave the money on the table. Others, with tuition in the $2,000 to $3,000 range, would presumably also be tempted to raise tuition. And while it is possible that the extra revenue would be used by states to augment education, it is also possible that the money would end up funding state roads or public employees' salaries -- or, for that matter, state tax cuts.
 A far more efficient approach, Mr. Gladieux argues, would be to use the money to beef up Pell Grants, the need-based Federal scholarship program. Spent directly, the $43 billion in lost revenue would be enough to double the funding for this time-tested program. And because the money would be narrowly targeted, it would be less likely to induce colleges to raise tuition, he says.
 But there are two big political disadvantages to this route, which have plainly not escaped the attention of White House campaign operatives.
 Unlike tax credits and deductions, Pell Grants add to Federal spending -- a no-no in the smaller-government-is-better 1990's. Perhaps more important, the voters considered likely to decide the outcome of this election are middle-class suburbanites, who are not likely to give President Clinton much credit for making it easier for only the poor to attend college.
 Tuition vouchers, Mr. Dole's high-profile education initiative, if enacted, would no doubt generate greater public passion, both pro and con, than the Clinton college scholarships.
 The Republican candidate proposes a four-year, $12 billion demonstration program providing "opportunity scholarships" of up to $500 a year for primary school students and $750 a year for high school students to attend any school of their choice. States (initially, up to 15 of them) would be obliged to match the scholarships at least dollar-for-dollar. In return, the states would have considerable discretion in setting eligibility criteria. But the Dole proposal does specify that recipients must come from "low and middle-income families" and that the scholarships can be spent on "any accredited school -- public, private or religious -- that chooses to participate."
 There is certainly a receptive audience for tuition vouchers, with free market-oriented economists in the forefront. The appeal is simple, they argue: public school authorities effectively have a monopoly on affordable primary and secondary education. By giving "consumers" a choice, vouchers would force public schools to compete for students the way pizza chains compete for pepperoni lovers. And the resulting competition, it is claimed, would create a win-win situation in which parents could opt for private education alternatives tailored to their tastes and needs.
 If vouchers are put in place, Ms. Hoxby of Harvard expects the big winners to be the urban poor.
 "People in central cities now have very few options," she points out, even when communities technically permit students to choose schools outside their neighborhoods. And while other experts disagree sharply on this point, Ms. Hoxby is supportive of recent research that she feels demonstrates "private school competition improves achievement levels in the inner city."
 More surprising, perhaps, Ms. Hoxby sees vouchers as an aid to heading off a greater financial crisis in public education. The school-age population is now rising: the Department of Education expects that enrollment will rise from 51 million this year to 54 million in 2006. "There is no way spending will keep up," she says. Hence, in her view, public schools are going to have to learn how to use resources more efficiently and voucher-driven competition could be the catalyst.
 The voucher proposal also offers a political bonus to the Dole campaign in focusing attention on the influence of teachers' unions within the Democratic Party. The National Education Association, a major donor of cash and workers to the Democrats, is adamantly opposed to vouchers, and Mr. Dole is making the most of it.
 "You cannot reform our schools and at the same time reap generous campaign contributions from the very groups who have run our public schools into the ground," Dole argued in a speech on July 17.
 But there is also plenty of non-partisan criticism for vouchers. Some educators worry that private and religious schools will cream off the students who can be educated at least expense, leaving demoralized public schools to cope with the tough cases. And they argue that parents are ill-informed about what educational techniques produce the best results, and will thus be prone to fads.
 What's more, even fans of vouchers raise questions about the Dole plan. The most prominent drawback, they say, is the limited amount of money: $500 to $750 per student from Uncle Sam is peanuts compared with tuition at nonsectarian private schools.
 The aid, especially after it is matched by states, would make more of a dent in the fees typically charged by religious schools. In New York, Mr. Dole has pointed out, Catholic elementary school tuition averages $2,500. But the low tuition is misleading because religious schools usually depend on contributions (cash and kind) from their congregations to cover the bills. Thus, were enrollment to expand substantially, nontuition support would be diluted and religious schools would almost certainly be forced to raise their fees.
 "Mr. Dole is proposing vouchers on the cheap," concludes Mr. Hanushek of Rochester.
 By the same token, there is concern that the money would be poorly targeted. While the Dole proposal does call for a family income cut-off for eligibility, the states would not be obliged to give priority to poor, inner-city residents. And even at just $500 to 750 per student, $3 billion a year would only cover a modest fraction of the school-age population.
 A very different criticism is that ideologically pure voucher-based education could undermine more pragmatic approaches to school reform.
 With grudging support from teachers' unions, charter schools -- schools licensed and financed by government but independently operated -- have been mandated by state legislatures in some two dozen states. And, as President Clinton argues, if they are given adequate room to experiment, they could provide the competition that critics of public school monopolies see as the primary benefit from vouchers. Indeed, Mr. Kane suggests that successful innovation bred in charter schools might flow more quickly to public schools "because charter schools pose less of a perceived threat" to vested interests.
 Will politicians' calls for vouchers and community college scholarships fade after the voters cast their ballots this week? It may be naive to assume that, once safely installed in the White House, Bob Dole or Bill Clinton would give education more attention than the traditional issues of war, peace and pork. But as they have been framed in the election campaign, either issue offers the next President a golden opportunity to scratch where Americans are really itching.
 "And in the era of just say no to Federal spending," Mr. Hanushek says, "such issues do not come along every day."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Philadelphia;
18-Story Building Makeover, With a 9-Floor Garage

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
AFTER a three-year downtown hiatus, construction cranes for office buildings are expected to rise again next spring when a mothballed 40-year-old building is renovated as the new headquarters for Morgan Lewis & Bockius, the nation's third-largest law firm, with 825 lawyers in 14 offices worldwide.
The firm, which is negotiating a 15-year lease, tentatively plans to move into 200,000 square feet of office space at Six Penn Center in mid-1998. The Rubin Organization, which jointly owns the 18-story building at Market and 17th Streets with Equitable Real Estate Investment Management, plans to gut it and use floors 2 through 10 for 490 parking spaces, with ramps built in a separate adjacent structure. Offices will occupy the 11th through 18th floors. If more office space is needed, a parking deck can be converted within a few months, said Joseph Coradino, Rubin's executive vice president. 
 "It's very flexible and may be the only transaction of its kind in the country," Mr. Coradino added. "When Conrail moved out of the building in January 1993 it remained the premier location in Philadelphia, but there weren't a lot of tenants who wanted 400,000 square feet of space."
Several law firms, insurance companies and the Federal Environmental Protection Agency are shopping for 150,000 to 300,000 square feet of office space downtown. But only a half dozen downtown buildings have that much space available.
A decade ago, said Mark Dichter, the managing partner of the Philadelphia office of Morgan Lewis & Bockius, tenants calling for 200,000 square feet of space were large enough to induce a developer to put up a new building. But these days, he added, tighter financing has meant that developers are loath to go further than than a significant renovation.
"With new construction you end up at numbers that are unacceptable for service firms, given what's going on with the revenue side of the equation," Mr. Coradino said. "In a renovation you have to be consistent with those rental figures and the premium is what you can gain in efficiency over time."
Rents for prestigious downtown buildings have stagnated in the last few years, hovering in the mid-$20's per square foot. Although Mr. Coradino would not discuss the rents being asked at Six Penn Center, nor the cost of the renovation. But brokers and developers familiar with the project estimated that the office space alone would cost at least $20 million. No one would venture an estimate on the cost of the parking garage and ramp structure.
PLANS drawn up by Kohn Pedersen Fox, the Chicago architectural firm, move the building's entrance to Market Street from 17th Street and give the ramp structure escalators and elevators in a building between Six Penn Center and the Mellon Bank Center, a 54-story, 1.3-million-square-foot building completed by Rubin in 1990. A courtyard sits between the ramp structure and the Mellon tower.
A new temperature-control system, new elevators and upgraded plumbing are among the operational improvements. And the current limestone facade that resembles old computer punch cards with its square, dark windows will be redesigned with bands of windows.
Moving from the triangular floors of its 200,000-square-foot current offices at One Logan Square in the West Market Street area to the rectangular Six Penn Center will mean "significantly" more usable space, said Mr. Dichter. Desktop computers linked to various data bases have obviated the need for a large central library in the new offices, where there will be more conference rooms for lawyers to work in teams.
"We were looking at other buildings or staying here and refitting the existing space. It would be more costly to renovate this space to our needs than to fit out new space," Mr. Dichter said. "It was the efficiency and productivity factor that motivated us. It's unusual because we can't predict the amount of space we'll need."
The firm, founded in Philadelphia in 1873, is the city's largest law partnership with 215 lawyers in a total of 425 employees. In 1983, Morgan Lewis & Bockius was among the first law firms to move from Broad Street to the West Market Street area. And its next move to Six Penn Center may be the early indicator of a revival in prime downtown office rentals.
Broad Street, on the city's north-south artery within a few streets of City Hall, had long been the backbone of Philadelphia's financial and service companies, But with the construction of new office buildings in the 50's and 80's the east-west Market Street has become the premier business location. And Six Penn Center at 17th and Market Streets is widely considered a pre-eminent location for its convenience to highways, commuter rail stations and most of the city's major employers or government offices.
Downtown Philadelphia has 14 buildings with 4 million square feet of space in mothballs -- meaning they are shut down and no longer marketed -- and as much as 900,000 square feet of space available for sublet, said Michael Kennedy, senior vice president at Jackson-Cross/Oncor International. Even top-tier buildings are losing tenants, or could, because of mergers, acquisitions or shifts of workers to surrounding suburbs.
"Companies no longer feel compelled to pay absolutely top dollar for first-class space for what is essentially a back-office operation," he said. "The nature of what's happened in Philadelphia's economy is that everyone has taken it on the chin. A lot of companies are looking to move upward into nicer space at money that is comparable, if not equal to, what they paid in the past for where they are."
The Six Penn Center lease is unusual in that few companies could take 200,000 square feet of space to be the sole or primary tenant or owner, Mr. Kennedy said. Those who do occupy entire buildings here include Sun Oil, Independence Blue Cross and Bell Atlantic.
"There's always the uncertainty with the central business districts that you'll get hammered with a negative event, like the Conrail-CSX merger announcement," said Al Schwacke, executive vice president of the Legg Mason Realty Group. "Something's going to happen and I don't think the destination is a teardown." There may be conversions to residential use or interim conversions to retail stores at street level, Mr. Schwacke said, "to carry certain buildings since the prices have come down so dramatically."
OTHER Philadelphia law firms have cut their operating overhead and pursued suburban clients by creating satellite regional offices in corporate campuses in such places as Malvern, Pa., or Cherry Hill, N.J. That strategy did not appeal to Morgan Lewis & Bockius, said Howard Meyers, the firm's managing partner.
But, he said, it was the firm's decision to retain its legal and back-office employees in one building to provide greater efficiency.
"We hope to construct a state-of-the-art conference center and a moot courtroom with a three-judge bench and jury box and lawyer's tables," he said. "Ideally, you'd have a room like that to prepare lawyers and witnesses. And a room with a camera to play that presentation back and review it."
Mr. Meyers, who manages the firm's 14 offices from Philadelphia, has overseen expansion projects from New York to Indonesia. The firm, which has offices in Princeton, N.J.; Pittsburgh, Jakarta, Indonesia, and Singapore, has relocated to new space in Frankfurt, Germany, and Tokyo within the last three years. The New York office has doubled the number of employees since 1994 and the Washington office will soon occupy a renovated building on Pennsylvania Avenue.

HEADLINE: To Whitman, Signs of Fiscal Gains

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

 BODY:
Local property tax revenues rose by 3.6 percent across New Jersey this year, a relatively modest increase that is surely welcome news to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's administration. It would seem to bolster her contention that her state income tax cut and a freeze in state aid had not -- despite Democrats' dire warnings -- led to sharply higher local taxes.
But a closer examination of the property taxes in 8 of New Jersey's 21 counties shows that there are exceptions, towns where local taxes jumped by double and triple the percentage increase in their county, in some instances by 10 percent or more. These towns generally fall into two categories: older, blue-collar towns that suffer from a shrinking number of commercial and industrial taxpayers or a declining value of business properties, and rapidly growing towns struggling to keep up with rising school populations. 
 The local property tax bills in these towns rose anywhere from $400 to $800 this year, a painful slice from the household budgets of thousands of aging pensioners and young families just settling into their first homes in new developments.
The towns that had property tax increases at or below the percentage increase in their county were generally established middle- and upper-middle-class suburbs that already have relatively high property taxes.
Governor Whitman -- who is to discuss property taxes at a news conference today in Trenton -- was swept into office in 1993 in large part because of her promise to cut state income taxes. Others politicians, from Gov. George E. Pataki of New York to the Republican Presidential candidate, Bob Dole, have recognized the advantages of such promises, and offered their own tax-cut plans. But to date, there has been little evidence that tax cuts at one level of government necessarily translate into tax increases at a lower level of government.
But freezes in state aid and basic inflationary increases in local operating costs forced towns to control their expenses more aggressively and in some cases, as in the township of Dover in Ocean County, use surplus funds from previous budget years to prevent major tax increases.
Statewide, the increase in property tax revenues, to about $12.1 billion from $11.7 billion in 1995, is one of the smallest this decade and a far cry from the annual increases of 12 and 13 percent of the last half of the 1980's. The overall figures provide the Governor and her budget aides a measure of exoneration. When she started phasing in her state income tax cuts three years ago, Democrats warned of deep cuts in state aid to towns and schools and of skyrocketing property taxes in the state.
Governor Whitman's response was that she did not levy local taxes, but that local officials would do well to follow her lead and cut wasteful spending as well as share some services with neighboring towns.
At the same time, the Whitman administration has curbed spending in local school districts by imposing limits on their budgets. For the last two years, these caps have ranged from 3.6 percent to 4.8 percent in all but the poorest urban districts, down from 14.7 percent in the 1990-91 school year. Correspondingly, negotiated pay increases for teachers statewide averaged 4.9 percent last year, down from about 9 percent in 1990-91, according to the New Jersey School Boards Association. Teacher contracts settled last spring reduced annual pay increases to below 4 percent.
Traditionally, teachers' pay is the biggest single expense paid by taxpayers.
But the Whitman administration's three-year freeze on state school aid at $4 billion has helped force taxes up in districts with new housing and rapidly increasing enrollments. Aid to these districts is not pegged to their full enrollment growth.
The Governor, in response to a State Supreme Court demand to equalize school spending between rich and poor districts, has proposed a state ceiling on spending for each student and requiring voters to approve any local spending above the maximum. If enacted by the Legislature, this plan would absolve the state from blame for future increases in school taxes.
Some analysts, like Neil Upmeyer, head of the Center for Analysis of Public Issues in Princeton, say the combination of inflation and flat or reduced state aid will inevitably lead to sharper property tax increases in coming years.
"It will happen," he said. "it just takes time to play out."
In Lyndhurst, all the talk about fiscal and tax policy is arcane and hollow for Jose Pazos, 68, a retired forklift operator. He moved here in 1987 and paid $2,300 in property taxes then. "Now it's $4,000 and something," Mr. Pazos said outside a supermarket. "So it's up more than 100 percent in nine years. It's incredible. They say it's the schools, it's this, it's that. All I know is I pay more taxes and am making less money."
Eleanor O'Neil, 75, complained about a $400 increase in her property taxes this year. She and her husband, James, 80, live on pensions and Social Security and are worried that ever-increasing taxes will drive them from the home they bought here in 1950. "It's terrible," she said.
Mr. Pazos and Mrs. O'Neil both grumbled about local spending and said the Governor's income tax cut was meaningless to them.
Lyndhurst's overall tax bill for local government and schools and county government rose about 5 percent this year, said the town treasurer, Deborah Ferrato. But the local government share was up about 13 percent, she said. The big culprit was successful tax appeals by office buildings near Giants Stadium. Those rulings, by the New Jersey Tax Court, cut about $200 million from the town's $1.6 billion tax base and shifted the taxes the buildings had paid to homeowners. In addition, the tax court ordered Lyndhurst to refund about $5 million in tax overpayments to the building owners.
Mrs. Ferrato, whose property taxes rose by $823, said, "Unfortunately, the people who really get hurt are the little residential people, especially the retired ones."
As in Lyndhurst, taxes in some other older blue-collar communities in southern Bergen County exceeded the statewide increase, including Fairview, up 18.1 percent. Fairview suffered in part because town officials used $1.6 million in budget surplus the last two years to stabilize taxes and had no more extra money this year, leaving property owners with an $800,000 bill, said the town's lawyer, John Schettino. Another problem, he said, is a $1 million cut in state aid for schools and municipal government since 1991.
Taxes in another small blue-collar town with a stagnant tax base, Jamesburg in Middlesex County, rose by 12.4 percent, primarily to meet the first payment on a $6 million, 25-year bond for expansion of one of its two schools, said Vincent Olivo, the business administrator.
And in Sayreville, an older industrial town in Middlesex County, the total tax bill rose 16.2 percent, or about $420 on the average home, the treasurer, Wayne Kronowski, said. The biggest culprit was a $4.5 million increase, nearly 77 percent, for the municipal budget. Last year, he said, Sayreville officials used $3.3 million in surplus to stabilize taxes. This year, only $1 million was available. In addition, general expenses rose $1.3 million, Mr. Kronowski said.
In parts of central New Jersey, a boom in housing developments has pushed property taxes up, most notably in the once-rural towns of West Windsor (up 10.6 percent) and Montgomery (up 18.1 percent) north of Trenton. School enrollments in each are soaring, so much so that new schools now being built are already too small for all the new students expected in the near future.
Montgomery's enrollment is about 2,500 students, up 58 percent in four years, said the Superintendent, Jamie Savedoff. Taxpayers have started repaying $32 million in school expansion bonds and are preparing to vote in February on $30 million more to build a new elementary school, expand another and provide for a second floor for a middle school scheduled to open next September.
The story is about the same in the nearby West Windsor-Plainsboro regional school district.
"Our growth is the equivalent of one small school a year," said the district's business administrator, Richard Guellnitz. Its enrollment is now 8,000, up from about 3,000 in 1980, he said, and 2,000 more students are expected in coming years.
A new high school for 750 students is to open next fall, and the district is already planning to expand it for 750 more students and to build a middle school and an elementary school. To pay for all this, voters approved a $58 million bond issue on Oct. 1, guaranteeing higher taxes for years.
The state has not helped much, Mr. Guellnitz said.
"Our state aid has been flat for the last four years," he said.

Opportunities Missed

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Bob Dole never had much of a chance. Voters like sunny personalities and his is too easily associated with gloom. But any slender chance the former Senate majority leader had of winning the Presidency was squandered. He was dealt a lousy hand by his party, and he played it about as poorly as you can.
Mr. Dole began the campaign as the standard-bearer of a party that misconstrued its mandate of 1994. The G.O.P. came to be seen as the party of the National Rifle Association, assault weapons and the militia movement. It was widely perceived as a slash-and-burn party dominated by ideologues who wanted to squeeze money out of popular programs like Medicare so they could give tax cuts to the very wealthy. Most egregiously, it was the party of that ubiquitous political hobgoblin Newt Gingrich and his fanatical, irresponsible followers, a wild and crazy group that would go so far as to shut down the Government in fits of childish pique. 
 Many voters, especially women, looked on in horror.
Daniel Yankelovich, the president of Public Agenda, a nonpartisan research organization that closely monitors public opinion, said: "One of the biggest leaps of the gender gap occurred when the Republicans insisted on staying with the plan to modify Medicare and give a tax cut to well-to-do people at the same time. That was not Dole's doing, but the leap in the gender gap among older women was phenomenal."
Mr. Dole did little to repair the damage. His idea of appealing to women was to note that he hadn't read the G.O.P. platform (with its strong anti-abortion plank) and to invite Representative Susan Molinari of Staten Island to deliver the keynote address at the Republican Convention in San Diego.
Meanwhile, Bill Clinton was playing his cards judiciously and well. An accomplished waffler, the President had already stolen everything that was politically useful from the Republicans, and denounced the rest as extreme. By signing the Republican welfare bill, Mr. Clinton had bolstered his poll numbers and thwarted the race-baiters so essential to Republican campaigns. (The cost, as Mr. Clinton saw it, was relatively minor -- a million or so additional kids in poverty.)
A logical strategy for Mr. Dole would have been to present himself as the steadfast and sober alternative to Mr. Gingrich's revolutionary rantings, and to Mr. Clinton's persistent waffling. Bob Dole needed to be the grown-up. Instead, he resigned from the Senate and donned the disguise of the outsider -- a bright blue blazer. (It fooled nobody.) And then he unveiled as the centerpiece of his campaign the very kind of supply-side tax-cut fantasy he had spent the better part of two decades ridiculing.
"He became a waffler himself," said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute of Public Opinion. "He was moving from Senator Dole to citizen Dole, from a fiscal conservative to a tax cutter. There was a lot of that."
When the tax-cut idea fizzled, Mr. Dole decided on a full frontal assault on Mr. Clinton's character. He went at it relentlessly. It was as if he were saying to himself: This ought to work. This ought to work. He hadn't learned the lesson of 1992 -- that it wouldn't work. Mr. Dole's frustration was palpable. "Where's the outrage?" he asked his audiences. "Where's the outrage?"
Mr. Miringoff could have told him that the character strategy was doomed. Marist pollsters asked potential voters, "If you had to choose what you feel is more important in a President, would you pick someone who has the highest personal character or someone who agrees with you on issues?"
The results weren't even close. By 71 to 29, the respondents preferred someone with whom they agreed on the issues.
Neither candidate seriously addressed the tough issues -- the future of entitlements like Medicare and Social Security, continuing economic inequality, the enormous number of Americans who still lack health coverage, the plight of the inner cities, the sorry state of public education, race relations, campaign finance reform. That would have required political courage and leadership.
Maybe next time. Perhaps in four years, on Election Day 2000, we'll have a better choice, at the end of a better campaign.

HEADLINE: U.S. Entrepreneur Is Gunned Down in Moscow

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 4

 BODY:
An American businessman involved in a long dispute over control of one of Moscow's best-known hotels was shot to death today by an unknown assailant with a machine gun.
The businessman, Paul E. Tatum, 39, a native of Edmond, Okla., and a former fund-raiser for the Oklahoma Republican Party, was killed near the entrance to the Kievsky metro station in downtown Moscow, a police spokesman said. The station is located near the Radisson-Slavyanskaya hotel, where Mr. Tatum had his office. 
 The police spokesman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the shooting had occurred at 5:10 P.M. and that top-level police officials were investigating the case.
Russian businessmen have frequently been killed since the collapse of Communism, although the slaying of foreign businessmen has been relatively rare. Many of the murders are contract killings and remain unsolved.
Mr. Tatum, a founding partner of the riverfront hotel, was involved in a long power struggle with the management of the joint venture that administers the property. Courts in Moscow and the United States have been looking into the dispute.
The struggle came to a head in 1994, when Mr. Tatum tried to oust the joint venture's director, reportedly going as far as to cut off his phone lines. In response, guards were posted at the hotel entrance to keep Mr. Tatum out.
The dispute is said to involve the Moscow city government and the Radisson Hotel Company, the Minnesota-based company that is Mr. Tatum's American partner.
Matt Seward, former chairman of the Oklahoma Republican Party, said his longtime friend refused to be intimidated. Mr. Tatum told him a few weeks ago that he expected a decision in the dispute soon. "And he was 95 percent sure he had won," Mr. Seward said.
Mr. Seward described Mr. Tatum as the "quintessential entrepreneur" who became fascinated by the business potential in Russia in the decade before the break-up of the Soviet Union.
"Paul's a risk-taker -- he wouldn't have built a hotel in Moscow if he wasn't a risk-taker," Mr. Seward said.
The Radisson-Slavyanskaya houses a string of shops and Western offices, including those of large broadcast media companies, and serves as the home in Moscow for dozens of expatriates. President Clinton has been staying at the hotel during his trips to Moscow.
Mr. Tatum had vowed to continue doing business in Russia despite the hotel struggle.
"This is entrepreneurs' heaven," he said in a 1994 interview. "There's no telling how quickly this country could develop and how much it could look like the United States in a very short period of time."
Officials at the hotel refused to answer questions today, and phone calls to hotel management in the United States went unanswered.
The American Embassy in Moscow had no immediate comment, apart from a terse statement saying: "We deplore the murder of any U.S. citizen."

HEADLINE: Eleanor L. Dulles of State Dept. Dies at 101

 BODY:
Eleanor Lansing Dulles, an economic specialist for the State Department who played a major part in planning the reconstruction of West Berlin in the 1950's, died on Wednesday in the Knollwood military retirement home in Washington. She was 101.
Her death was reported by The Associated Press on Friday. 
 Mrs. Dulles, who was sometimes called "the Mother of Berlin" for her enthusiastic efforts to revitalize the economy and culture of that battered capital as it recovered from World War II, managed to carve for herself a formidable reputation even though her two brothers, John Foster Dulles and Allen Welsh Dulles, held much higher rank in the American Government.
She was offered the State Department's Berlin desk in 1952, just before Foster Dulles was named Secretary of State.
She quickly saw trouble coming, she said in a memoir published in 1980, because Foster had been criticized for using his influence to get Allen the top job in the C.I.A. and wanted to avoid further accusations of nepotism. She was already a career diplomat, and her West Berlin position came through before Mr. Dulles's appointment, yet once he was in office, he tried to force her out. He did not succeed, she noted with some satisfaction.
Mrs. Dulles said it was difficult for a woman to serve in the State Department in that era.
"This place is a real man's world if ever there was one," she said in 1958. "It's riddled with prejudices. If you are a woman in Government service you just have to work 10 times as hard -- and even then it takes much skill to paddle around the various taboos. But it is fun to see how far you can get in spite of being a woman."
Mrs. Dulles was born in Watertown, N.Y., one of five children of a Presbyterian minister and his wife. One ancestor, John Welsh, served as envoy to Britain in Rutherford B. Hayes's Administration, and her grandfather John W. Foster and an uncle, Robert Lansing, each served as Secretary of State, under Presidents Benjamin Harrison and Woodrow Wilson, respectively.
She graduated from Bryn Mawr College with a major in social sciences, worked in refugee rehabilitation and reconstruction projects in France after World War I and returned to Bryn Mawr to earn a master's degree in labor and industrial economics.
She took odd jobs in the early 1920's -- running a punch press at the American Tube & Stamping Company in Bridgeport, Conn., and working as payroll clerk for a hair net company in Long Island City, Queens.
She also traveled extensively in Europe, studied at the London School of Economics, investigated industrial methods in 75 British firms and received a master's degree from Radcliffe College and a doctorate in economics from Harvard.
In the 1930's she studied and taught economics and finance in Paris, Geneva, Basel, Boston, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Bryn Mawr. She produced scholarly books including "The French Franc, 1914-1928," "The Facts and Their Interpretation" and "The Bank for International Settlements at Work." She wrote more than a dozen books in all.
When she was 30 she met David Simon Blondheim, a philologist who, as an Orthodox Jew, was not regarded by her family as marriage material, she indicated in her memoir. She married him anyway, in 1932. In 1934, not long before the birth of their son, Dr. Blondheim committed suicide.
Mrs. Dulles, who used her maiden surname, entered Government service in 1936 as director of financial research for the Social Security Board. In 1942 she moved on to the State Department. At the Bretton Woods international monetary conference in New Hampshire in 1944, she was a prominent member of the American delegation.
The next year, she went to Vienna as the State Department's financial attache. She demonstrated keen bargaining powers -- helping to feed starving Austrians by arranging the barter of horses for German cabbages and potatoes.
Later, as special assistant to the director of the State Department's office of German affairs, Mrs. Dulles was credited with "working miracles," as one biographer put it. She helped to reduce West German unemployment and increase production.
To hasten those developments, she said, she would "send requests from Berlin for money and rush back to Washington in time to compose favorable answers." She wangled more than $1 billion for West Berlin, adorning it with the now-famous Congress Hall, which Berliners for many years fondly referred to as the "Dulleseum" and "Frau Dulles's Hut," as well as a hospital and educational centers.
Beginning in 1959, Mrs. Dulles was assigned to studying foreign aid programs and visited 60 countries on behalf of the State Department's office of intelligence and research.
She left the State Department in 1962, after her brother Allen had been dismissed from the C.I.A. in the wake of the Bay of Pigs catastrophe. Leonard Mosley wrote in his 1978 book "Dulles" that early in 1962, during the Kennedy Administration, Secretary of State Dean Rusk summoned her and said, "The White House has asked me to get rid of you."
Mrs. Dulles, in her memoirs, "Eleanor Lansing Dulles: Chances of a Lifetime," published in 1980, wrote affectionately of her older brothers but did not hesitate to say that since childhood there were frictions among the siblings. She also admitted that her strong personality won her her share of enemies.
She suffered from poor eyesight since childhood and developed deafness but remained active well into her old age.
Her survivors include her son, David, of Washington, and her daughter, Ann Dulles Joor, of Manlius, N.Y., and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: New York's Looming Welfare Burden

 BODY:
The new welfare law threatens to impose huge costs on New York City taxpayers. The city's nonpartisan Independent Budget Office, created earlier this year as part of the city's Charter reform, estimates that Federal cutbacks and requirements to put welfare recipients to work could cost the city as much as $4.3 billion over the next six years.
The 1996 law strips disability insurance and food stamps from all legal immigrants, and other forms of public assistance from new immigrants for at least five years. It will knock many children off disability rolls and limit families to five years of Federal cash assistance. The budget office expects about a third of welfare recipients to hit the five-year ceiling. 
 The budget office's estimates vary widely because it cannot predict future events and policies. Will poor families who lose Federal benefits be added to the state welfare program, Home Relief, which is paid for entirely by state and local taxpayers? The State Constitution would seem to require such a course. Will the state comply with the Federal mandate to put recipients to work within two years -- at $2,200 per placement -- even though noncompliance carries no sanction? Will the economy grow quickly or slowly?
Much also depends on whether Albany, which now splits the cost of taking care of the poor with the city, lowers its share. Any effort by the state to do so should be fiercely opposed, because local governments that pay to place most of their recipients in long-term jobs risk driving taxpayers into less-ambitious, lower-tax jurisdictions.
Depending on how these questions are answered, the budget office estimates that welfare reform could cost the city between $200 million and $4.3 billion over six years. In 2002 alone, when the city will be spending about $25 billion of its own money on all public programs, welfare reform will cost it as much as $1.2 billion. Costs will rise even higher if New York State's constitutionally guaranteed welfare system encourages migration by poor families from nearby states.
There are circumstances under which the budget projections could prove unduly pessimistic. The Republican sponsors of the Federal law say that it will radically alter the culture of the poor, prodding them into jobs and off welfare. This is possible but improbable. For more than two decades, states have steadily driven down the value of welfare payments by 30 percent or more, yet welfare rolls remain persistently high.
The cost estimates could prove too high for a second reason: Welfare recipients who reach the five-year time limit might find jobs more quickly than the budget office expects. American labor markets have proved remarkably resilient -- absorbing millions of women into the work force since the early 1970's without rising unemployment rates.
The conscientious work of the budget office proves the value of expert, nonpartisan analysis for policy makers reviewing complex options. While the office's six-year projections are full of guesswork, they provide strong evidence that life for the city under the welfare law could prove mightily unpleasant for recipient and taxpayer. Congress put the welfare burden exactly where it does not belong -- on state and local government. If the cost estimates are anywhere close to the truth, the city will face an unenviable choice between coarsening its treatment of the poor and starving its schools and other public programs of desperately needed cash.

HEADLINE: The Network Computer As the PC's Evil Twin

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The so-called network computer is an unproven product chasing a market that does not yet exist. Yet the concept of the network computer, promoted as a low-cost alternative to the personal computer, is already stirring waves of interest in corporate America.
Last week, Sun Microsystems Inc. introduced its Java station model, joining I.B.M., Oracle and a few other companies that are just beginning to market these stripped-down computers. The no-frills desktop machines typically sell for less than $1,000, including a keyboard and monitor. 
 The network computer is appealing both economically and as a management tool. It promises to reduce the costs of equipping workers with computers and it also promises to give companies more control of how their workers use information technology.
Emphasize the cost reduction and the network computer is simply bringing the benefits of modern technology to a larger audience, almost as Henry Ford did with the Model T. Emphasize the opportunities for information control and the network computer can be seen as a potential tool of tyranny, as if plucked from George Orwell's novel "1984."
"The line between these network computers being used as really effective corporate tools and being used as mind-control tiger cages is a fine one," said Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future, a research firm in Menlo Park, Calif. "There will be a real temptation for corporate managers to go too far in the direction of control."
It is only prudent to be skeptical about how a technology innovation like the network computer will be used, according to Shoshana Zuboff, a professor at the Harvard Business School, who is a social psychologist. Ms. Zuboff is the author of a landmark book on technology and work patterns, "In the Age of the Smart Machine," published in 1988.
In that book, Ms. Zuboff asserted that computer-based information technology held out the possibility of transforming the nature of work, breaking down old hierarchies as information and power were shared widely within corporations.
Since then, Ms. Zuboff has continued with her case studies of how information technology is employed. She is working on a new book on the subject, and she has become increasingly pessimistic. "The paradise of shared knowledge and a more egalitarian working environment just isn't happening," she said. "Knowledge isn't really shared because management doesn't want to share authority and power."
In many ways, the network computer seems to be a manager's dream: a closed box, no slots for inserting floppy disks or CD-ROM's. The messy, often costly, individualism of the personal computer environment can be jettisoned for greater efficiency.
No more workers installing their favorite software on an office PC. Sure, some of it may be harmless, but corporate managers recognize that that kind of openness also means vulnerability to computer viruses, hackers and high-tech thieves.
With a network computer, employees can send E-mail, write memos, schedule meetings and even browse the Web. But access to those technology resources is rationed by the managers who control the corporate computer network. For any company so inclined, it would be easy to prevent employees from tapping into Web sites that distribute information not deemed work related, from sports scores and soft porn to news and political commentary.
That kind of central control has its appeal, and it is part of the sales pitch for the network computer. Scott McNealy, the chairman of Sun Microsystems, contrasts the efficient purity of the network setting with the world of the personal computer, which he characterizes as a chaotic, costly haven for time-wasters.
To give a worker a personal computer, he says, is to invite trouble. "What's a floppy disk?" Mr. McNealy asked rhetorically. "It's a way to steal company secrets."
Personal computers, he added, are loaded with unnecessary frills that become distractions from real work as employees spend countless hours fiddling with the fonts, typefaces and other fancy features in today's multi-megabyte software.
At Sun, Mr. McNealy went so far as to ban one or two popular personal computer programs earlier this year. There may have been some initial grumbling, but Mr. McNealy explained: "I'm sorry, but who owns the computer? At my company, that's not up for debate."
To personal computer zealots, Mr. McNealy's comments are heresy, an authoritarian throwback to the bygone era of the mainframe, the high tide of centralized control in computing. The PC purists regard the personal computer as not just a product but also a movement, an instrument for advancing individual freedom and empowerment.
The personal computer has many fans among the 200 million or so people worldwide who use one. Its foremost fan has been known to run his lucrative fief in Redmond, Wash., with an autocratic hand on occasion, but he is eloquent in his defense of the empowering nature of the personal computer and of the rights of the modern knowledge worker.
"The key question is do you want to take away the individual flexibility and freedom that the personal computer provides," said William H. Gates, the chairman and cofounder of the Microsoft Corporation.
Mr. Gates accuses the champions of the network computer, led by Mr. McNealy and Larry Ellison of Oracle, of trying to portray "PC's as evil" as a marketing gimmick in an effort to sell their own products.
The campaign against PC's espouses what he calls "grinch management," a short-sighted effort to take tools away from workers and control their behavior.
"People do play computer games at work, but they also doodle with pencils," Mr. Gates said. "Do you take away their pencils? And the notion of telling workers they can go to this Web site, but not that one is silly. That's not the way a modern work force is managed. You've got to trust people."
Still, even Mr. Gates concedes that his industry must reduce the expense of owning personal computers by making them easier to use and run in corporate networks.
The total cost of a personal computer in an office network is about $13,000 a year, estimates the Gartner Group, a research firm in Stamford, Conn. The initial hardware and software costs represent less than 20 percent of the total, with the rest coming from the time spent on maintenance, training, support and users futzing with their machines.
The companies marketing network computers say their machines linked to hub computers and software, called servers, can reduce the total cost per desktop by 60 percent or more, compared with PC's.
Gartner is now conducting a cost-of-ownership study of the network computer. The results are not yet in, but William Kirwin, a research director at Gartner, says the estimated cost savings are typically far less than the network computer makers claim, probably in the 25-to-30-percent range. In addition, Mr. Kirwin noted, the estimated savings from network computers result from comparison with a poorly managed network of personal computers.
Whether the problem is workers wasting time or costly computing, the answer, it seems, is as much a management issue as a technology issue.
The corporate pilot testers of network computers agree. The CSX Corporation, a big railway and transportation company, has been experimenting with a dozen Sun Microsystem network computers for a few months. John Andrews, president of CSX Technology, the company's information technology unit, is encouraged by the early results.
"But unless you manage it properly, you can spend as much or more on network computers and expensive servers as you do on a personal computer network," Mr. Andrews said. "And you can be just as unproductive with network computers as you are with personal computers."
Mr. Andrews, in fact, has no intention of ripping out the 10,000 personal computers at CSX and replacing them with network computers. Instead, he views the network computer mainly as a gradual replacement for the company's 15,000 "dumb terminals." These are little more than monitors and keyboards linked to a mainframe or minicomputer, used for data entry, claims processing and other routine chores.
There are as many as 50 million workers worldwide using dumb terminals, still captive to the mainframe era. For them, even a stripped-down model like the network computer would seem a big step forward technologically.
For the network computer makers, the dumb-terminal replacement business is a sizable market, though far less glamorous than trying to unseat the personal computer.
Yet the terminal-replacement market has also attracted the attention of Mr. Gates. Last week, Microsoft and Intel, the dominant suppliers of personal computer technology, announced a set of specifications for their own stripped-down machine, called the NetPC. It was their answer to the network computer.
"We think we can go after the dumb-terminal market, too," Mr. Gates said.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DEMOCRAT;
Clinton and 2 Senators Support Torricelli

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Nov. 3

 BODY:
In two black churches, at a labor breakfast and at a big rally in a hotel here in New Jersey's largest city, Representative Robert G. Torricelli spent the next-to-last day of his campaign for the United States Senate visiting traditional Democratic strongholds to appeal passionately for help on Election Day.
Mr. Torricelli then joined President Clinton at a rally outside City Hall in Union in the late afternoon, where both the President and New Jersey's two current Senators, Frank R. Lautenberg and Bill Bradley, urged the state's undecided voters to select Mr. Torricelli in the very tight race. 
 Mr. Bradley, who is retiring after 18 years in the Senate, passed a symbolic paper torch to Mr. Torricelli as a crowd of more than 5,000 applauded.
At his earlier appearances, Mr. Torricelli, a Democrat, tried to sum up his campaign.
"My friends, I stand before you today like a young lawyer in front of a jury of millions," he said to an enthusiastic crowd of nearly 1,000 at a breakfast rally organized by Newark's Mayor, Sharpe James, at the Robert Treat Hotel. "I've made my case. I've explained who I am and what I represent. I've put my life and all that I believe before you."
At each appearance before core Democratic supporters here, in Jersey City and in Garfield in southern Bergen County, Mr. Torricelli talked of his support for an array of Federal initiatives intended to help city dwellers.
He mentioned the television commercial produced by his opponent, Representative Richard A. Zimmer, that showed Mr. Zimmer and his wife, Marfy Goodspeed, feeding the sheep on their farm in rural Hunterdon County.
"I don't know from sheep," Mr. Torricelli said. "But I know the city of Newark."
Turnout by traditional Democrats in New Jersey's cities will be important for Mr. Torricelli on Tuesday, but so too will be the votes cast by tens of thousands of undecided voters, most of whom live in the state's sprawling suburbs.
Mr. Torricelli courted those votes today when he joined President Clinton at the Union City Hall. Union is among the vital areas in the center of the state, along a corridor between Newark and Trenton -- through Union, Middlesex and Mercer Counties -- where independent and undecided voters are likely to be critical to the outcome of the race. Polls continue to show the contest as virtually even.
"I've tried to make my case for a continuation of the moderate, bipartisan tradition in New Jersey," Mr. Torricelli said. He spoke of his support for gun control, education, environmental protection, Medicare and other matters important to middle-class voters. He also cited Mr. Zimmer's support for the conservative agenda of the House Republican leadership, mentioning in particular the fact that the Government had been shut down twice because of budget battles in Washington.
"Dick Zimmer said it was necessary," he said. "I said it was a disgrace."
Earlier in the day, Mr. Torricelli dashed from a black Baptist church in Jersey City to Mr. James's breakfast rally in Newark, and then back to breakfast in a Jersey City hotel as a guest of the Hudson County Central Labor Council, before completing his morning at another black Baptist church in Garfield. At each stop, he sought to differentiate himself from Mr. Zimmer by highlighting his support for new Federal money for mass transportation, for Federal tax credits for corporations that invest in low-income housing and for additional Federal educational aid for teaching math and science.
Mr. Torricelli said he had voted for each of these initiatives, which would bring particular benefits to urban residents. "And Dick Zimmer voted against every dollar," he said.
"These are the choices that govern our lives," he told the large crowd in the Newark hotel ballroom. Mr. Torricelli cited, too, as he has throughout the general election campaign, his votes to protect Medicare for the environment and for gun control.
He tried to link city dwellers with the mostly suburban residents of his own Congressional district, which includes parts of Bergen and Hudson Counties. He contended that affluent suburbanites would also benefit if poor children in the cities received first-rate educations and if cities experienced significant economic growth.
"I represent the people of the state because we've heard enough division," he said. "We have a common future. One future for one people."
But Mr. Torricelli was concerned primarily today with moving his core supporters to action on Election Day, to help get out the vote. "This election soon passes from me to you," he told about 400 labor union members at the Quality Inn in Jersey City. "The decision is yours. Bring home a victory on Election Day that we'll all be proud of."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
Free TV Time? Zimmer Makes the Most of It

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

DATELINE: WOODBRIDGE, N.J., Nov. 3

 BODY:
With only two days left to campaign in a Senate race that is one of the tightest in the country, Representative Richard A. Zimmer took advantage of 20 minutes of free television time today to lay out his philosophy of "Christie Whitman Republicanism" and to take a few swipes at his Democratic opponent.
During his appearance on WNBC-TV's "News Forum" and later in a visit to the Elks lodge here, Mr. Zimmer also showed a growing confidence. 
 "The undecideds are breaking in my direction because they see me as the candidate who stands for Christie Whitman Republicanism -- smaller government, more freedom, more economic growth, more opportunity," he said on the program.
He later expanded on that, saying to the 150 Republicans gathered at the Elks lodge that he was heartened when he picked up the morning's newspapers and saw that he was neck and neck with Representative Robert G. Torricelli, his Democratic opponent, in the latest poll conducted by the Eagleton Institute of Politics and The Star-Ledger.
"Eagleton had Christie down by 12 points" when she was running for governor three years ago, he noted. "Eagleton has me down by just one point." Then, he boasted, "I'm ahead."
The poll, completed Saturday, showed Mr. Zimmer with 41 percent support, Mr. Torricelli with 42 percent and 15 percent still undecided. The margin of error in the poll was 4.5 percentage points, which means that the race is statistically a tie. Because New Jersey's voters are known to be fickle, polls this late in a race often turn out to be off. And that's what Mr. Zimmer seemed to be referring to today.
He also had the advantage of being the only New Jersey Senate candidate on the WNBC program today because Mr. Torricelli declined the invitation. A spokesman for Mr. Torricelli, Josh Isay, said that Mr. Torricelli could not fit the 1 P.M. show, whose host is Gabe Pressman, into a long-planned schedule that included an appearance with President Clinton.
"Bob Torricelli and Dick Zimmer agreed to two debates," Mr. Isay said, "and we had two debates."
Mr. Zimmer referred a couple of times in his television appearance to Mr. Torricelli's absence, saying, "In a campaign that has been defined by 30-second ads, it's an unusual opportunity to sit on a couch together and debate the issues."
With Mr. Torricelli not present to defend his record, Mr. Zimmer described himself as the "most fiscally responsible member in the entire Congress" and his opponent as one of the biggest spenders of Federal money in the House.
Asked about Mr. Torricelli's criticism of his votes on Medicare, he said he had not voted to cut Medicare, but instead had voted against expanding Medicare. "It will be broke in five years unless we take measures to deal with it," he said.
He then criticized Mr. Torricelli for votes that made it easier for inmates on death row to appeal, saying, "You can't spend years and years abusing the court system when it's quite clear that you are guilty and you deserve to be executed."
While Mr. Zimmer often mentioned his similarities to Governor Whitman in the interview, he talked about Bob Dole, the Republican Presidential candidate, only when he was asked to. And he frequently distanced himself from Newt Gingrich, the unpopular Republican House Speaker, saying he was the most independent of the 235 Republicans in the House.
"I vote with the interest of our state and with the interest of my own conscience," he said. "I believe that is in the grand tradition of New Jersey Republicanism."
Later, in a warm room at the Elks lodge, Mr. Zimmer urged a raucous crowd of Republicans to elect him "to keep the liberals from rolling back the progress that we made this year." After that gathering, Mr. Zimmer, his wife, Marfy Goodspeed, and their two grown sons headed to a private fund-raising event.
As he has throughout the Senate campaign, Mr. Zimmer planned a minimal schedule of public events for Monday.
Both Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Torricelli have relied almost solely on television advertising to sway voters. This weekend, Mr. Zimmer began broadcasting a slightly different version of a commercial that has been on major Philadelphia and New York stations for weeks that calls Mr. Torricelli "foolishly liberal." The new version, which was broadcast during sporting events today and will appear during Monday night football, is a takeoff on a beer commercial in which frogs croak, "Bud-wei-ser." The frogs in Mr. Zimmer's ad, however, croak, "Lib-er-al" as they gaze at Mr. Torricelli.
"Everyone who has seen it has laughed, but they get the point," said Larry Weitzner, Mr. Zimmer's campaign consultant.

HEADLINE: An Old Friend Called Giuliani, and New York's Cable Clash Was On

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
It began with a phone call to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani on Sept. 20, an entreaty that would soon mire City Hall in a feud between two media conglomerates. On the line was an old friend of the Mayor, Roger Ailes, a former Republican political consultant who is now chairman of the 24-hour news channel started by Rupert Murdoch.
Mr. Ailes was blunt: Time Warner was refusing to transmit the new channel to its 1.1 million cable customers in New York City. Would Mr. Giuliani try to get the company to reverse its decision? 
 Recently disclosed court records show the phone call from Mr. Ailes was the opening maneuver in an aggressive effort by Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation to gain the Mayor's support in the clash with Time Warner, a burst of lobbying that led to an unusual alliance between government and a major corporation.
In all, Mr. Murdoch's lieutenants have held more than 25 conversations and at least 2 private meetings with senior Giuliani administration officials since Sept. 20, often to coordinate strategy as the Mayor battled Time Warner on behalf of Mr. Murdoch, according to the records and interviews.
The contacts are documented in thousands of pages of court papers in a lawsuit that Time Warner has filed against the administration. Time Warner wants a Federal District Judge, Denise Cote, to continue to bar Mr. Giuliani from transmitting Mr. Murdoch's Fox News Channel on one of the five stations that the city controls on Time Warner's cable systems. A ruling could come as early as today.
The basic conflict between the two companies is over Time Warner's refusal in the middle of September to accept the Fox News Channel. Time Warner said at the time that there was no space on its cable systems, and that more than 30 other programmers were also waiting for slots.
Mr. Murdoch and his aides labeled that explanation ludicrous, saying that Time Warner was engaging in anticompetitive behavior to protect its own news channel, CNN, which it acquired recently in a merger with Turner Broadcasting.
It was less than three days after Mr. Murdoch learned of Time Warner's rejection of the channel that Mr. Ailes called Mr. Giuliani, court papers show.
The Mayor and his aides defend their conversations with the News Corporation, stressing that they want the Manhattan-based Fox News Channel to succeed to protect local jobs. Time Warner executives contend that the contacts demonstrate that Mr. Murdoch, a prominent conservative who also owns The New York Post, wields excessive influence over the Mayor.
News Corporation executives had previously described in interviews how they had received promises of help from a trio of powerful Republicans -- Mr. Giuliani, Gov. George E. Pataki and Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco -- after lobbying them at a party that Mr. Murdoch threw in Manhattan on Oct. 1 to celebrate the debut of his channel. Though that event seems to have been the only instance when Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Murdoch talked in person about the dispute, their chat led in part to the Mayor's decision a week later to try to transmit the Fox News Channel on the city-run Crosswalks cable station, administration officials said.
But sworn depositions and affidavits in the court papers show how executives at the News Corporation began reaching out to the Mayor and his top aides before the party -- and how they received a swift response.
For example, after the conversation with Mr. Ailes on Sept. 20, the Mayor called Fran Reiter, his Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, Ms. Reiter said in a deposition.
The Mayor told her to look into the matter immediately, so that day she called Mr. Ailes and Arthur M. Siskind, Mr. Murdoch's chief counsel.
Mr. Siskind and a senior vice president at the News Corporation, Bill Squadron, then met with several senior administration officials on Sept. 26. Among those present were Ms. Reiter and Paul A. Crotty, the city's corporation counsel.
Mr. Siskind and Mr. Squadron urged Ms. Reiter to call the chairman of Time Warner, Gerald M. Levin, to persuade him to reconsider the company's refusal. She asked the News Corporation executives to put their complaints in writing.
The next day, Mr. Siskind sent her a three-page letter urging the administration to "take whatever steps are necessary" to punish Time Warner.
Ms. Reiter said in her deposition that over that weekend -- Sept. 28 and Sept. 29 -- she and her aides repeatedly tried to find a home number for Mr. Levin or Time Warner's president, Richard D. Parsons, so she could call them. She said she finally located another executive at Time Warner, Derek Johnson, at his home. She told Mr. Johnson that it was very important for her to speak with Mr. Levin or Mr. Parsons.
"I said that if it were convenient for them, that I would be happy to get on a plane and make myself available to them someplace other than New York," she said in her deposition, "but that I thought these were very serious issues and that if the city could help in facilitating a solution, we very much wanted to do that."
According to the court records, a few days later, after Ms. Reiter had still not spoken to Mr. Levin, Mr. Siskind left a message for Ms. Reiter's chief of staff, David Klasfeld. "Arthur's understanding," the message said, "is that Mr. Levin will be in town through Wednesday and then going out to the West Coast."
Administration officials had such close ties to the News Corporation that in August and September, Mr. Klasfeld handled some of the arrangements for Mr. Murdoch's party on Oct. 1, according to the court documents. After at least three conversations with Mr. Squadron, Mr. Klasfeld helped the News Corporation obtain permission to put up a tent and block off part of 48th Street for the event. Those duties are usually handled by lower-ranking officials.
Mr. Giuliani and his aides acknowledged that they had many conversations with News Corporation executives, but they said there was nothing inappropriate about them. They said some of the contacts were little more than 30-second exchanges of information.
They pointed out that they typically have dozens of discussions a week with big local companies about economic development issues, so it was not unusual for them to talk to the News Corporation. The Mayor has repeatedly said that if the Manhattan-based Fox News Channel is not shown in much of the city, the nation's largest media market, it would not be successful, threatening hundreds of local jobs.
"You know, excuse me if, as the Mayor of the City of New York, I don't feel like it's my obligation to fight for them," Mr. Giuliani said on his radio show last month.
The Mayor has declined to describe his contacts with executives from the News Corporation, saying only that he may have spoken to Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Ailes three or four times. Pressed by reporters to provide more details, he replied, "I am not going to allow you to interrogate me. That is just absurd."
Asked about the contacts with the News Corporation, Mr. Klasfeld, Deputy Mayor Reiter's chief of staff, said, "During the period of time in question that you are talking about, our office had at least as many conversations with officials and representatives of Time Warner as we did with officials and representatives of the News Corporation."
Mr. Murdoch has declined requests for interviews, referring questions to Mr. Siskind.
The court records show that Mr. Siskind alone had more than a dozen conversations with the administration. He said in an interview that he could not recall how many times he had spoken to administration officials, but he said he did not tell them what to do. "We were very pleased that they were responsive," Mr. Siskind said. "That is what mayors and governors are supposed to do, look out for the economic welfare of their constituencies."
But Time Warner executives accused the Mayor of going out of his way to aid Mr. Murdoch because he is a powerful conservative who owns two important media outlets in the city, The Post and WNYW, Channel 5, where Mr. Giuliani's wife, Donna Hanover Giuliani, works.
"The extent that this was done shows that they were aware how much political power they have over the administration, and they are willing to use it," said Richard Aurelio, president of Time Warner's cable subsidiary in the city. "This was a really incredible exercise of political power. And it is the way that the Giuliani officials responded that is really more alarming, the ferocious nature of it."
The Giuliani administration has denied accusations the Mayor is influenced by the News Corporation because of his wife's job, and Mr. Squadron, the News Corporation senior vice president, scoffed at Time Warner's complaints.
"It is incredibly disingenuous for Time Warner, which has a huge and sophisticated lobbying operation, to criticize another company for raising concerns with public officials," Mr. Squadron said. "We wouldn't question their fundamental right to petition government, nor would we expect them to question ours."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE VOTERS;
Campaigns Fail To Stir Passion Among Voters

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Nov. 3

 BODY:
Bill Clinton and Bob Dole have crisscrossed the land for months, even years, to inspire voters. Businesses, unions and parties have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to drill home differences between the candidates. Ominous accusations have been traded. The reputations of political consultants have shot to glittering heights, then burst spectacularly.
And all of it has left Larry Edwards merely wistful, longing for the passion of a movie about politics he once saw on television. 
 "It would be great if that's what things were really like," Mr. Edwards said about the movie, "Speechless," in which two speechwriters vie on behalf of their candidates and fall in love. "But this is the real world, and there's nothing that exciting. I would love to get excited about a candidate and donate my time and walk the streets for him, but, gosh, I just can't."
The Presidential campaign and the electorate this year are strangely wan, according to pollsters, television ratings and even Mr. Dole. Mr. Edwards settled on perhaps the least exalted of reasons to vote for President Clinton, in an absentee ballot he had already sent to Montana, where he lived until recently.
"It's a question of who can hurt us the least," said Mr. Edwards, a 43-year-old power systems dispatcher for the Department of Energy here. "I don't think Clinton's going to hurt us, because he's got too many other things to worry about."
The candidates may be fighting hard for Arizona, but their passion is not widely reciprocated here, judging from lengthy interviews with more than three dozen residents in the last two days. For all the millions of carefully chosen words delivered this year, Marisela Munoz, who became a citizen last November after 23 years here, heard nothing to move her to register to vote, despite the registration booth at the company where she is an account representative.
Some who pay attention to politics, the ones who speak longingly of men like Hubert H. Humphrey and Barry Goldwater, said the candidates dumbed their campaigns down, aggravating voters' cynicism by repeating mindless messages in endless loops.
"This is not 'War and Peace,' " said Jill Gering, sitting in her courtyard in the historic Willo district here Saturday evening. "It's more like a Harlequin romance." She explained: "The hero has dark hair or light hair, but the stories are the same. The writing is light, but with no substance."
Her voice rose with indignation as Mrs. Gering, a housewife and Clinton supporter, described the "Chinese water torture" of Mr. Clinton's bridge to the 21st century.
"Sometimes you feel like strangling them more than voting for them," she said. "How stupid do they think we are?"
While the repetition may have offended those who pay attention, it has not been enough to break through to some who do not. Despite all the advertisements, Tim Gitch, an electrician, did not know about Mr. Dole's proposed tax cut until a reporter told him. Nor, once told, did he much care. "I just got tired of listening to all of their stories," he said of politicians.
Each voter, here and across the country, has his or her own reason for tuning out, or in. Aggregated, the reasons can form clumps big enough to support any interpretation for the stasis of the 1996 campaign -- for the fact that Mr. Clinton's lead in the polls has scarcely budged for a year, while voters, yawning, channel-surfed away from the conventions and debates.
Some say the economy's strength explains it; others blame the press, excessive polling, or advertising; still others say the candidates stuck to bland topics.
But the exasperation of voters like Mrs. Gering is still far from indifference. For all the talk about picking the lesser of two evils, or voting against a candidate rather than for one, many here said they were still following the campaign, if less closely than campaigns past. Some are enthusiastically committed to their candidate.
Told of Mrs. Munoz and Mr. Gitch, David Flint, a volunteer manning the Dole headquarters alone at 10:30 Friday night, just shook his head. "There has been a lot of interest on both sides in this campaign," he said doggedly, "at least among people who care."
While Mr. Gitch may have stopped listening, in the cinder-block ranch house right next door in the suburb of Chandler, Brian Shaw likes to watch "Meet the Press" on Sunday mornings with a Republican friend and debate Mr. Clinton's character. And Mr. Shaw, a loan officer, has plenty of other matters to worry about, including four sons, three of them triplets 2 1/2 years old.
Earl de Berge, who edits the independent Rocky Mountain poll here, said voters might mouth cynicism learned from the media, but ultimately vote with hope. "Does the voter really go in and vote 'no'?" he said. "I don't think so. I think the voter goes in and votes for their aspirations for the country."
If voters are excited about the campaign anywhere, they should be excited here. Arizona has been fiercely contested, with both candidates paying late-campaign visits. If he wins Arizona, Mr. Clinton would be the first Democrat to do so since 1948. A poll in today's Arizona Republic put Mr. Clinton ahead by 12 points.
The economy is booming here. The White House is only too pleased to supply statistics showing a gain of 336,100 jobs over the last four years, with home building rising 16 percent a year. Senator John McCain, a Republican, said such growth helps explain the absence of political ferment. "People are generally satisfied with their lives," he said. "There is just not a lot of the fervor that there was in 1994. But even in 1994 there was not the fervor that there was in other parts of the country."
Mr. McCain predicted on Friday that his former colleague would carry Arizona, but many voters said that with the economy strong Mr. Dole had not proved a convincing alternative.
"What race?" asked Beryl Shears over his back fence, when asked what he made of the Presidential contest. Mr. Shears, who owns a small aerial firefighting business and supports Mr. Dole, said he nevertheless considered the contest over when Mr. Dole won the nomination. "I didn't think he had the dynamics to compete with Clinton," he said. "I don't think he's dynamic or eloquent enough to get his points across."
That conclusion has been reflected in national polls for months, a key difference between this race and the one in 1992. As early as July, 71 percent of voters nationally had concluded Mr. Clinton would win, said Andrew Kohut, the pollster who directs the Pew Research Center.
"It's how voters size up Dole," Mr. Kohut said. "They sized him up as not much of a threat to Clinton's re-election, and they did it early."
That kind of talk drives some crazy. "I've been waiting for somebody to ask me questions for years," said a delighted Eric Scott Bloom, pausing as he pushed his son, Kyle, in a stroller past the shops of downtown Tempe. Mr. Bloom, an artist, said he disbelieved polls because he knew no one who had been questioned. "The polls are horsehockey," he said.
Some voters said the polls seemed to reflect the bias of the press, which they said helped lock in Mr. Clinton's lead. "They always show Dole on the balcony of his condo, like he's not doing anything," said Fay Harris, as her bulldog, Jezebel, snuffled about her Willo district living room. "They always show Clinton out there smiling and shaking hands."
But up the aisle of palm trees along her street, Palm Lane, a television news producer reflected not bias, but indifference toward the race. "I have about no interest in it, except what I put on my show," said Corey Lewis, the producer of the KTVK weekend morning program. Mr. Lewis is not voting this year.
Some said news reports blunted the public appetite, not by slanted coverage, but by focusing on strategy. Bob Connelly, a Clinton supporter, angrily recalled an Arizona Republic headline after Mr. Clinton's visit here Thursday: "Clinton Plays It Safe."
"It was a strategy headline rather than an issues headline," he said, sounding like as much an editor as the fire captain he is. "That doesn't tell me anything about what he said." He said coverage of Mr. Dole's campaign marathon boiled down to: "Will the old goat make it?"
No voter cited the advertisements bombarding them as an influence on their thinking, except as a negative. But the campaigns do not believe that. Playing to cynicism about politics, or at least about Bob Dole, the Clinton campaign has a radio advertisement here that asks: "When's the last time you heard Bob Dole say something that would actually help solve a problem?"
Such commercials are influencing at least one family. Trish Karpurk plans to vote for Mr. Dole. But her son, Christopher, who is 8 years old, backs Mr. Clinton.
Christopher allowed that he hoped Mr. Clinton would lower taxes. But he also offered a unique reason for throwing his support behind the President, one that had nothing to do with choosing the lesser of two evils: "I like Socks," he said.

HEADLINE: Casino Jobs in Indiana Attract People Who Want a New Life

BYLINE: By DANIEL I. DORFMAN 

DATELINE: EAST CHICAGO, Ind., Nov. 2

 BODY:
Irene Moore, who has lost so many times before, stood among the hopefuls looking to come out as winners of jobs at a new casino here.
"I like the atmosphere," said Ms. Moore, a 45-year-old unemployed woman from nearby Gary, explaining the attraction of casino work. "It puts you into a fantasy world. This is especially true when you live in Gary and you look at the obituaries to see who got shot the night before. This is a chance to forget all your troubles." 
 Ms. Moore, who is on disability and spends most of her time caring for her mother, who has Alzheimer's disease, was one of about 300 applicants seeking jobs at the Showboat Mardi Gras riverboat casino, which is scheduled to open next April. For practical reasons like job security, or simply in the hope of adding a thrill to their lives, people of all income levels gathered at a local high school for initial interviews, hoping to become dealers in games of blackjack or poker or to preside over a roulette table. The prize: $4.50 an hour, plus tips that can add $10 an hour more.
Kathy Bravo, 42, who also lives in Gary, is not interested in a job for the electric casino atmosphere. Her motivation is cold cash.
Mrs. Bravo is a safety director for a trucking company that is on shaky financial ground. With her only son in college, she wants an income that is certain. She said she was tired of worrying whether her paycheck would clear: "I've had one check bounce already."
East Chicago, a town of 34,000 people about 20 miles southeast of Chicago, reached its heyday a generation ago with a robust economy based in oil refining and steel. Now, as those industries have employed fewer and fewer people, the city is punctuated with empty lots and abandoned buildings.
"When you graduated from high school, all you had to do was show up the next Monday and your job was waiting for you at the steel mill," said Edward Williams, a lifelong resident.
Mr. Williams is now the director of education and development for Showboat, the company that will operate the riverboat. It is the first to be developed in East Chicago, and the fourth in northwest Indiana, since riverboat gambling was approved by the state in 1993.
East Chicago, which is 42 percent Hispanic and 32 percent black, has a per capita income of just over $9,000 a year. Unemployment approaches 40 percent among members of minority groups in the area.
In an effort to turn those dreary statistics around, East Chicago allowed Showboat to come in, with the promise of 1,800 jobs, including 500 dealer positions. First priority for the jobs will go to East Chicago residents, with second priority to other northwest Indiana residents.
On this cold morning, not just the disadvantaged showed up with the hope of gaining a dealer job. Arthur Leeds, 47, a financial investment researcher from the affluent Chicago suburb of Glenview, made the trip. Mr. Leeds, who estimated his income at $50,000 a year, said seeing new faces was motivation for wanting to revive a career he had in Las Vegas 20 years ago. "Right now," he said, "I spend a lot of my time alone. With this job, you meet people, you get to know regular customers, and you build up a rapport with some of the people."
Scott Jones, 24, of Merrillville, Ind., has visions of being a blackjack dealer for a combination of reasons. The first is financial, as he was furloughed on Friday from his $12.40-an-hour job as a track laborer at a local railroad company.
But Mr. Jones was also attracted by the bells and whistles of a casino. "I know the railroad job will eventually turn into a nice job from which I'll be able to retire," he said. "But this is a more exciting environment than pulling railroad tracks."
Those offered jobs who have never worked in a casino before will have to go through a training program. But even those with no casino experience may find that certain skills picked up in other jobs are useful.
Ms. Bravo was asked in her interview how would she handle a customer who used foul language. "I've worked at a trucking company," she said she told the interviewer. "Foul language is not a problem."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Shows Election Jitters; Pound Reaches Another High

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell to another low against the British pound yesterday and ended mostly weaker against other currencies, hurt by traders selling the dollar ahead of the elections. Although a victory today by President Clinton has been factored into the market, traders said a fear of strong Democratic gains in House and Senate races was putting pressure on the dollar.
The Democrats are perceived by some traders to be more willing than Republicans to increase the budget deficit, which would increase the risk of inflation and, to some, undermine the confidence of investors in dollar-denominated assets. 
 "I think there's some apprehension if the Democrats retake Congress," said Robert Katz, a trader at the MTB Bank Corporation in New York. "We might have seen some people getting out of the dollar because of that."
Tom Hoge, a vice president for corporate foreign exchange at the Bank of New York, added: "You've got concern that the Democrats could come away with more than just a Presidential win. That would be a pretty resounding negative for the dollar."
Late in New York yesterday, the German mark traded at 1.5104 to the dollar, down from 1.5145 on Friday. The pound was up to $1.6449, from $1.6370, its highest level since March 1995.
Against the yen, the dollar ended a little higher at 113.75, up from 113.31 on Friday. Traders attributed that partly to widespread weakness in the yen, particularly against the pound. The dollar briefly dipped against the yen early in the afternoon in the United States, after Toyoo Gyohten, a former top Japanese finance official whose views are considered influential, said the yen was too weak and should trade at 110 or less to the dollar. But the dollar began to recover shortly afterward.
The pound sterling has been rising for the last few weeks. British interest rates have increased, and with that, the attractiveness of pound-denominated assets.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those late Friday included: 1.2662 Swiss francs, down from 1.2690; 5.1090 French francs, down from 5.1200, and 1,517.50 Italian lire, up from 1,515.50. The Canadian dollar sold for 74.85 cents, compared with 74.97 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Construction Spending Up In September

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4

 BODY:
Construction spending rose unexpectedly in September, led by the biggest jump in government-financed building projects in more than five and a half years, the Commerce Department said today.
Total spending on new construction rose 1.9 percent, to a record annual rate of $573.4 billion in September, the department said. It was the biggest increase since a 2.3 percent gain in March and stood in contrast to economists' forecasts of a one-tenth of 1 percent decline. 
 Analysts said stronger government spending was taking up the slack from sluggish private-sector spending after a strong first half in which new housing construction surged.
Spending on privately financed and public projects rose in September, but by far the largest part of the increase came in government spending, which jumped 6.4 percent, to a $147 billion rate, after falling 1.4 percent in August.
There were big gains in spending to improve highways and streets and smaller increases for housing and redevelopment, schools and hospitals and for water treatment plants.
Spending edged up four-tenths of 1 percent, to $426.4 billion, on private projects after rising 1.4 percent in August.
"Pubic outlays are essentially supporting the construction industry," said Marilyn Schaja, economist for the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation in New York.
The department said spending on construction of single-family homes fell to $155.9 billion in September from $157.3 billion in August.
"Residential construction spending is slipping, but not by very much," said Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI/McGraw Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass.
The department said last month that construction starts on new homes and apartments fell 6 percent in September after a 4 percent gain in August.
Ms. Latta noted there were signs that office-building could pick up since shortages of space in many cities were pushing commercial rents higher.
"I think we can look forward to some recovery on the commercial side over the next year," she said.
During September, spending on new nonresidential buildings like offices and industrial parks jumped to a $142.3 billion rate from $140.3 billion in August.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Am I Better Off?

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Am I better off than I was four years ago?
No. In a way important to me I am not only worse off than in 1992 but worse than ever before in my adult life. I have been cheated of the opportunity to make a decision satisfactory to me in the choice of a President, the single most important privilege of citizenship. 
 When politicians running for office put that question, somehow it is taken for granted that the question and the answer both mean economically.
I have been poor. I did not care for it and do not intend to be poor again. I never will have a lot of money, not even a little lot.
My most important assets are political and they make me and my fellow Americans richer and happier than most of the people on earth. I plan to look after them like the money in the bank and annuity they are. When I feel my pocket being picked I will shout my head off.
That is not sentimentality but the essence of realism in a democratic society. The combination of a constitutional right and the understood privilege of being able to exercise it with whatever intelligence and judgment a citizen can muster is the essence of a functioning democracy. Without the privilege, the right withers until all that is left on the political branch is cynicism, a foul fruit.
For the first time in my voting life, neither major party has offered us a choice that pays suitable honor to our intelligence and citizenship. (What Ross Perot showed in 1992 about his lack of personal stability disqualifies him from the Presidency).
Bob Dole's problem was not that he did not want the Presidency enough, as some of his critics and friends say, but that he wanted it too much. He wanted it so much that he would not tell himself the truth. He was equipped to be a senator but not leader of the nation. No shame in that, unless you refuse to face it.
He showed little intellectual range and no intellectual clarity. They are the minimum requirements to win a change in leadership -- the ability of a challenger to display his hopes and mind so clearly that the voters consider him at least the inspirational equal of the incumbent they have come to know for four years.
Mr. Dole could not do that. He not only did not speak or think clearly -- much of the time he was unintelligible.
And whatever the campaign or his Senate career showed, it was not the ability to make a decision effectively -- consult or inform those who had to be, operate candidly at least with his own staff. The thought of him mumbling and ducking through a national security crisis quickly moved from amusing to terrifying.
And then, the major mistake -- he acted as the party's prisoner, not its chief. He ran on positions he knew were unacceptable to most people.
Mr. Dole told David Brinkley his basic slogan is "I keep my word." Maybe -- but in his case a frightening thought. That means he would keep his word to fight the right of abortion, keep a cuckoo-land position that tobacco was not really addictive, keep fighting gun control, keep struggling for a deficit-boosting tax policy he once said was like playing football without a helmet, keep an anti-immigrant line so nasty that he would throw little kids out of school unless their parents had the right immigration papers. This man would make breaking his word a gift to the nation.
That brings us to President Clinton. When he breaks his word he does it big. At home, he broke it about his much-proclaimed love for the poor, about immigration and about all his promises to run an ethical Administration.
Abroad he broke it even bigger -- by sacrificing the human rights of the Chinese people in favor of kowtowing to the Chinese Communists, a historical disgrace for him and the U.S. He seems about to break his word to keep U.S. forces in Bosnia no more than a year. He allowed Islamist militancy to establish its first European beachhead by permitting Iran to send arms to Bosnia's Muslims. When Saddam Hussein attacked the Kurds in northern Iraq, Mr. Clinton ordered a few futile missile attacks in the south. That's how he kept his word to contain Iraq.
Neither man is a satisfactory choice. But not voting is a civic dereliction. So I will go to the booth to choose one but will keep shouting that my pocket has been picked.

HEADLINE: Blue-Chip Stocks Edge Upward, With Dow Climbing by 19.75

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks edged up yesterday in cautious trading before today's elections.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.75 points, to 6,041.68, struggling past a 10-point morning deficit as interest rates edged lower in the bond market. Broader measures were mixed, with blue-chip and other big companies outperforming speculative issues, even in the volatile technology sector, where established names gained ground and smaller companies edged lower. 
 "If you had some money burning a hole in your pocket, you put it in liquid names with a degree of comfort where nobody can yell at you tomorrow," said Charles G. Crane, director of research at the investment firm Spears, Benzak, Salomon & Farrell.
Stocks drew some support from the bond market, where the yield on the 30-year Treasury -- a key determinant of corporate and consumer borrowing costs -- fell to 6.66 percent, from 6.68 percent on Friday.
But many traders continued to limit their exposure to any potential jolts from the elections. Analysts have expressed concern about inflationary government spending if the Democrats take control of Congress in addition to the White House.
The highlight of the lackluster session was British Telecommunications' proposed $22 billion acquisition of MCI Communications, which was announced on Sunday after a flurry of rumors on Friday that prompted MCI to confirm that talks were under way. MCI shares, which jumped 5 1/8 on Friday, gained an additional 1/2, to 30 3/4, as the Nasdaq's most active issue yesterday. British Telecom's American depository receipts -- each representing 10 ordinary shares -- soared 6 1/8, to 61 5/8, in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange. But AT&T slumped 5/8, to 33 3/4, and Sprint fell 1 5/8, to 41 7/8, amid concerns about tough competition from their big new rival. In a separate deal that added some spark to yesterday's lackluster trading, J. C. Penney announced Sunday that it was expanding its drugstore business by acquiring Eckerd for about $3.3 billion in cash, stock and assumed debt. Eckerd jumped 4 3/8, to 33 1/4, while Penney fell 1 7/8, to 51 1/8.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.96 points, to 706.73, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.39, to 375.07.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.30, to 1,220.48, cushioned by some gains in technology bellwethers such as Intel, up 1 5/8, to 110 3/8, and Cisco Systems, up 3/8, to 110 3/8.
Shares of General Motors rose 1 5/8, to 55 5/8, as workers at an important metal stamping plant in Indianapolis returned to work.

HEADLINE: Empty Buildings, Precious Space;
Long Island Debates Future of Psychiatric Hospitals

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: CENTRAL ISLIP, L.I.

 BODY:
More than a century ago, Manhattan's insane asylum, as it was called then, opened an experimental farm colony on 1,000 acres of wild countryside here. The property cost $25 an acre.
Inmates cleared the land, constructed buildings, made the furniture and mattresses, sewed their clothing, grew crops and raised dairy cattle, pigs and chickens. 
 The idea of a self-contained community quickly caught on with the state's Commission on Lunacy. Before long, western Suffolk County, with an abundance of cheap land and a steady supply of patients from New York City, became the global capital of psychiatric hospitals.
At its peak, in the 1950's, the system of state institutions housed 33,000 patients.
"I remember reading in the Guinness Book of Records in the 1970's that the three biggest mental hospitals in the world were, in order, Pilgrim State, Central Islip and King's Park -- all of them right here," said Suffolk's planning director, Stephen M. Jones. In addition, the system included an institution for the retarded, the Long Island Developmental Center.
Today, everything has changed. The hospitals are closing, prompting intense debate over the future use of the properties, which include about 270 buildings.
Suggestions ranging from nature preserves to casinos reflect the conflicting desires to preserve a low-density suburban style but also foster development for property-tax relief and new jobs for Long Island's struggling economy.
The debates echo across the nation as more psychiatric hospitals close their doors.
Decades of deinstitutionalization have emptied nearly all the Suffolk institutions. The Developmental Center closed in 1993. This month, its small residual operation at Central Islip Psychiatric Center will move out. Next month, Kings Park will shut down. About 1,300 patients will be consolidated in a small, renovated part of Pilgrim that will be the token survivor of the old system.
As the hospitals have faded away, relentless suburban sprawl has enveloped them, with more than a million people now living within several miles of the four sites. And the old hospital properties, once so cheap, are among the largest and most valuable tracts left here.
The state is eager to sell them to raise cash. To attract bidders, officials are considering selling the land -- totaling nearly 2,000 acres, or more than twice the size of Central Park -- all at once.
But what is to be done with the sites?
"These are tremendous assets and opportunities, and we don't want to blow it by letting them fall into wrack and ruin or by developing them improperly," Mr. Jones said.
A delicate issue arose over the all-but-forgotten cemeteries at three hospitals. About 24,000 indigent patients are buried there, most without visible markers.
"I suggested one cemetery for more active use like a soccer field or picnic area, but people were just offended," Mr. Jones said. When he proposed moving another cemetery to make way for a courthouse, "everybody was horrified," he said. "So now we're treating it as inviolate open space."
To date, the most striking proposal calls for a commercial recreation "sportsplex," like the Chelsea Piers in Manhattan, on 100 acres at Pilgrim. Planners say it would cost $157 million, create 2,150 jobs and generate $147 million a year in business.
A proposal from State Senator Owen Johnson would add a 7,000-seat minor league baseball park on 35 acres at Pilgrim. Other plans include housing, golf courses, parks, schools, retail stores, offices and light industry.
Critics contend that in its eagerness to profit from the sites, the state has forgotten the hospitals' purpose and should earmark the proceeds for psychiatric services. D. J. Jaffe, a spokesman for the Alliance for the Mentally Ill, a patients' rights group, said, "These properties are a legacy that should be used to benefit the mentally ill."
Nationwide, the rising pace of closings is setting off debates that parallel Suffolk's. From 1970 to 1990, 14 psychiatric hospitals closed, according to the National Association of State Mental Hygiene Program Directors. But since 1990, 32 have closed and 10 more are to shut down soon.
In Connecticut, the closing of a hospital in Norwich last month left the state with just one psychiatric hospital. The fate of the 800-acre Norwich campus is undecided. Local officials favor using it for a community college, but there is speculation that Gov. John G. Rowland will sell it to a developer.
Suffolk's hospitals have been a minefield for politicians. Gov. Hugh L. Carey angered Brentwood residents when he converted part of Pilgrim into a prison in 1982. Campaigning to succeed him, Mario M. Cuomo promised to close it, and did. But in the 1990's, he angered the neighbors of the Long Island Developmental Center in Melville by trying to use 50 acres for a headquarters for Olympus America, the camera company. Opponents blocked it in court.
Chastened by such backlash, Gov. George E. Pataki's administration devised an elaborate process to decide what to do with the land. The Empire State Development Corporation, a state agency designed to bring business to New York, and a state interagency group are working with consultants, county and town officials and a citizens' advisory panel at each site.
No one is sure why the hospitals were clustered here, besides the obvious factors of open space and access via the Long Island Rail Road.
The original idea was to give patients fresh air, refuge from urban stress and work that allowed exercise, therapy and job training. But critics say that banishment undoubtedly played a role. Many patients spent their lives here without ever being visited by a friend or relative.
Central Islip opened in 1889. The next year came Kings Park, an offshoot of the Kings County asylum in Brooklyn. Pilgrim joined the system about 1930. The Long Island Developmental Center opened in 1965.
The hospitals built their own roads, water supply, sewers and heating and power plants. Until the 1950's, patients grew fruits and vegetables and ran printing presses, shoe shops, dairy plants, slaughterhouses, bakeries and laundries. They did plumbing, carpentry, cleaning, and cooking. They formed a marching band and symphony orchestra, staged variety shows and made toys and dolls to sell.
For decades, western Suffolk's landscape was dominated by the hospitals' drab red-brick towers, topped by green copper roofs. With 15,000 employees, the hospitals also dominated the economy.
"This was the Grumman of Suffolk," said Desmond Ryan, who became the fourth generation of his family to work at Kings Park as a ward attendant. Now he is the director of the Association for a Better Long Island, a developers' group.
Change began with the advent of psychotropic drugs in the 1950's. They enabled many patients to function more normally and move into apartments and group homes. Scandals over dismal conditions -- not a charge lodged against Suffolk's hospitals -- accelerated the trend.
Now the empty buildings, with their barred windows, pose problems. Some are adaptable, but others are not. Neglect, vandalism and fire have taken a toll. Even demolition would be costly, with complications like asbestos removal.
Each site has unique features that shape the planning debate.
Unlike the others, Central Islip has already spun off most of its more than 1,000 acres, leaving only 87 to be developed.
"The hospitals kept these towns humming, and Central Islip went into a tailspin" when downsizing hit, said Mr. Jones, the planner. Desperate for new jobs, Islip officials enticed the New York Institute of Technology to the site in 1982. It was a good fit, right down to keeping a street name, Admissions Drive.
Other developments followed: a golf course, a park, several hundred homes, light industry and a complex of state and county courts. Now under construction is a $212 million Federal building to house 1,300 workers. For the remainder, planners recommend 300,000 square feet of business offices and a 130,000 square-foot shopping center.
Of the sites, Pilgrim has the best highway access. Years ago, large chunks were parceled off: 207 acres for Suffolk Community College and other pieces for industry, a preserve and youth detention center. But 840 acres remain, only 60 of which are needed for the hospital. Besides the sportsplex, plans call for 500 or more homes, stores and light industry.
Brentwood's leaders support development because "commercial property is desperately needed for revenue," said the school board president, Anthony F. Felicio. But people in nearby Dix Hills complain that they will get no revenue and will bear the brunt of the traffic and noise.
Another disagreement emerged over the Long Island Developmental Center, which has 1.3 million square feet of buildings on 467 acres. Planners are calling for about 1,500 new homes, mostly for the elderly. Some local leaders want to include a village green and community center. But others fear that would attract too many families with children, burdening the schools, so they want a golf course instead. The plan offers both options, with no final decision.
Kings Park's great asset is scenery. The grounds cover about 600 acres of woods on the Nissequogue River, two marinas and vistas of Long Island Sound.
"Here's the million-dollar view," said the hospital's chief executive, Alan M. Weinstock, as he stood on a bluff overlooking the river and Sound. "Everybody comes here and drools and says we've got to do something with it, but no one has figured what."
Because Kings Park is far from the Long Island Expressway and Suffolk's commercial core, planners say it is best suited for residential use. They have proposed 1,319 units, from single-family homes on two-acre lots to apartments, plus a shopping center and village center.
Kings Park's plans seem the most tentative, which some experts welcome.
"This is one of the few places where the government owns the views and access to the water, so let's keep it," said Smithtown's planning director, Frank De Rubeis. "I think the decision on what to do will linger, or fester, depending on your point of view, for some time."

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
Justices Refuse Case on Whether Health Care Networks Must Be Open to All Doctors

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4

 BODY:
Bypassing a growing legal dispute over the organization of managed care health plans, the Supreme Court today refused to hear a case on whether states can insist that health care networks open their doors to any doctor who wants to practice with the group.
The debate over these laws, now on the books in about half the states, pits doctors, who want access to the networks, against insurance companies and sponsors of employee benefit plans, which save money on health care by negotiating for medical coverage at what is essentially a volume discount. 
 These plans, often called preferred provider organizations, meet their cost-saving goals only if each doctor can maintain the high patient load needed to make the reduced per-patient fees economically attractive. The ability to limit the number of doctors in the group in turn gives leverage to insurance companies and plan sponsors, because a doctor who does not cooperate in holding costs down can face expulsion from the network.
The case before the Court was an appeal by the State of Louisiana, which enacted a law in 1984 to authorize groups of doctors and employers to contract with one another for medical services. The law contained a guarantee that "no licensed provider who agrees to the terms and conditions of the preferred provider contract shall be denied the right to become a preferred provider." Guarantees of this type are known as "any willing provider" laws.
Earlier this year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, overturned the Louisiana provision on the ground that it was pre-empted by the Federal law that governs employee benefit plans, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
This law, E.R.I.S.A., essentially displaces state laws or regulations that "relate to any employee benefit plan." The appeals court, ruling in a lawsuit brought by Cigna Health Plan and its subsidiary, the Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, held that the Louisiana law did "relate to" employee benefit plans because it limited the structure of the provider networks that a plan might choose for its members.
Although Cigna and the insurance company won their lawsuit, they agreed with the state that the Supreme Court should resolve the issue. The National Association of Manufacturers, which also supported the appeals court's decision, also urged the Justices to hear the case.
There have been conflicting decisions on the issue from other Federal and state courts, and it is likely that the Court will step in eventually. Earlier this year, the Connecticut Supreme Court held that Connecticut's somewhat different version of an "any willing provider" law did not relate to employee benefit plans and so was not pre-empted.
While all sides in the Louisiana case today were in agreement that the Court should hear the appeal, Louisiana v. Cigna, No. 96-316, they differed sharply in their characterization of the issues. The state, describing the law as an effort to "keep the system fair for patients and health care providers alike," said the appeals court decision "seriously impedes patient choice and a provider's right to earn a living."
By contrast, Cigna and Connecticut General said that "limiting the size of the provider network is key to its success" and warned that employers would drop this method of health care delivery if they lost the ability to control the size.
The purpose of E.R.I.S.A.'s broad pre-emption provision is fairly straightforward: to make sure that employers do not have to navigate a sea of conflicting state regulations. But the provision is also as vague as it is broad, necessitating a constant flow of Supreme Court decisions to apply in various contexts.
Just last week, for example, the Court agreed to hear a case on whether E.R.I.S.A. pre-empts the operation of state community property laws that give spouses an automatic share in each other's pension plans.
This new case, Boggs v. Boggs, No. 96-79, involves the application of Louisiana's community property law to a pension annuity that a retired worker's second wife received after the worker's death. The man's first wife, who had died years before he did, had left most of her estate to their three sons.
The sons are now claiming in a lawsuit in Louisiana State court that they are entitled to the pension because it was part of their late mother's community property that belonged in her estate. The Fifth Circuit rejected the second wife's argument, in a Federal court counter-suit, that E.R.I.S.A. pre-empts any conflicting community property laws and that she was therefore entitled to continue receiving the pension. The Justices will hear her appeal.
There were these other developments at the Court today.

School Prayer
Also without comment, the Court turned down an appeal by the State of Mississippi from a ruling by the Fifth Circuit blocking enforcement of a law to permit students to lead voluntary prayers at various public school events.
The Mississippi Legislature passed the School Prayer Statute in 1994 in response to a public uproar after a high school principal had been disciplined for permitting students to lead prayers over the public address system. The law permits "non-proselytizing, student-initiated voluntary prayer" at assemblies, sports events, graduations, and other official functions.
The law has not taken effect because the Federal District Court in Jackson granted an injunction soon after its passage. Under the terms of that 1994 ruling, which the Fifth Circuit upheld, the only permissible student-led prayers are those at graduation ceremonies. The Supreme Court has ruled that graduation prayers led by members of the clergy are unconstitutional, but has not ruled on student-led prayer.
In its appeal, Moore v. Ingebretson, No. 96-331, Mississippi did not address the constitutional merits of the case but argued that the lower courts should not have intervened before the law had a chance to go into effect.

Term Limits
As the result of a stay granted by the Court over the weekend, the ballot in Arkansas on Tuesday will include a voter initiative to instruct members of the state's Congressional delegation to "use all of the powers" of their office to approve a constitutional amendment limiting senators to two terms and representatives to three. The Arkansas measure also provides that, if it passes, members of the delegation who ignore it will have next to their names on future ballots the phrase: "Disregarded voter instruction on term limits."
Last month, the Arkansas Supreme Court declared the measure unconstitutional as an evasion of the requirements for amending the Constitution as specified in Article V of that document: passage by two-thirds of each house of Congress and ratification by three-quarters of the state legislatures, or in a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures. The state court said the Arkansas proposal "clearly" violated the requirement that constitutional amendments "must come either from Congress or state legislature -- not from the people."
The stay of that decision -- permitting the measure to appear on the ballot -- will remain in effect until the Justices can decide some weeks from now whether to hear a full appeal in the case, Arkansas Term Limits v. Arkansas, No. A-310. Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented from the decision to issue the stay.

HEADLINE: Some Owners Consider Altering the Labor Deal

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
As baseball's club owners approach a critical meeting tomorrow, a move was afoot yesterday to maneuver the responsibility of killing the pending labor agreement from the owners to the players.
The owners will meet in Chicago ostensibly to vote on ratification of the agreement that was negotiated mostly in August, then concluded Oct. 24. However, some owners talked of the possibility of making a change in the agreement -- most likely removing the players' option for a sixth year -- and sending it back to the union for its approval. 
 The owners would expect the union to reject an altered agreement, but then it would appear that the players and not the owners were undermining labor peace. One person on the owners' side branded the idea "a cheap publicity stunt."
Donald Fehr, the union chief, was in London for a speech, but a person on the players' side said of the possible switch, "That would be a thinly veiled attempt to shift responsibility but a clear rejection of what was negotiated by the negotiators." Another person said, referring to Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, "Bud can't get this monkey off his back no matter what he does."
An owner familiar with Selig's thinking said he plans to have a discussion on the pending agreement, then take a yes-or-no vote on it. Selig has said he will not state his position on the agreement, preferring to let the owners vote without his possible influence. Yet it has become the prevailing view on both sides that without Selig's endorsement, the deal would be rejected.
"No" votes by eight clubs would block ratification. The two Chicago teams, Florida, Kansas City, Montreal and Boston have been counted among the opposition. Yesterday, a person keeping a loose tally said the Cleveland Indians also were leaning toward the "no" column.
If the deal dies, so will the plan for revolutionary revenue sharing among the clubs. According to figures that have been revised upward, that means four teams would lose $5 million or more in revenue-sharing money for 1996 -- Montreal, $5.5 million; Detroit, $5.1 million, and Kansas City and Pittsburgh, $5 million each.
Montreal and Kansas City are two of the teams prepared to reject the new agreement despite the loss they face. Without saying how the Expos would vote, Claude Brochu, their managing partner, explained the club's position on the potential loss of $5.5 million.
"For once in our lives," he said by telephone from Montreal, "we've all got to think about the business, not so much in a short-term and on a selfish basis but long term. We have to address the economic condition of our business. That's first and foremost."
Based on previous comments by Brochu, the Expos apparently believe that the only way to address baseball's economics is with a salary cap, an idea the players rejected two and a half years ago. The heart of the pending five-year agreement is a luxury tax, where teams would be taxed for the portions of payrolls over a designated threshold ($51 million for 1997).
The tax would be in effect for the next three years, then disappear in 2000. No tax would exist either for 2001, which would become a sixth year in the agreement at the players' option. Many owners object to any tax-free years but especially oppose the idea of a second tax-free year.
If the owners alter the pending agreement, one person on their side said, they most likely would eliminate the option year. At this stage, the union would be expected to reject that change.
"This deal was negotiated as a package," said a person on the players' side. "Tremendous concessions were made to get where we are. Three tax years for two no-tax years was a compromise."
If the agreement falls apart, such elements as revenue sharing and interleague play will fall with it despite the belief by some owners that they could still get both. For revenue sharing and interleague play to take effect, the union would have to approve them, and union officials have said they will not approve anything on an isolated basis.
While Montreal and Kansas City oppose the agreement despite the revenue-sharing money they would receive, four of the five clubs that would pay out the most are prepared to vote for the deal.
They are the Yankees, who would pay $5.7 million for 1996, Baltimore ($5.2 million), Atlanta ($3.7 million) and Los Angeles ($3.6 million). Only the Indians ($5.6 million) are leaning toward opposing the agreement.

HEADLINE: In Saudis' Heartland, Unrest Is Aimed at Rulers and U.S.

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: BURAIDA, Saudi Arabia

 BODY:
Far from the palaces of the capital and the Red Sea coast, this is Saudi Arabia's religious heartland, where beards are worn untrimmed and resentment toward those in power is not easily disguised.
It was in Buraida two years ago that Saudi dissent last spilled into the streets, when several thousand people joined a radical cleric in a 36-hour protest. In the clampdown that followed, the authorities arrested the cleric and hundreds of dissidents and have banned political discussion from the country's mosques. 
 But along a main street of shabby shops and Toyota pickup trucks, there were some still willing to divulge to a Western visitor their unhappiness with the monarchy that has ruled Saudi Arabia since it was forged 64 years ago.
"The people are angry, but for now, there's not much we can do," a shopkeeper in his 30's said. "We talk to each other, and we talk to God."
Rocked by two terrorist bombings in year, and facing a potent blend of flat oil revenues, a population boom and a religious militancy that increasingly questions the legitimacy of its rulers, Saudi Arabia is facing evident challenges at home.
They may be most clearly on display here, in this city at the historic heart of the Nejd region where Abdel Aziz al-Saud led a religious brotherhood drawn from local tribes in the conquests that gave him thrall over all of Arabia.
"These guys are under pressure in ways they've never been under pressure before," an American Government official said of the Saudi royal family.
In recent conversations around the country, the vast majority of Saudis assured a visitor of their strong support for the monarchy, while senior Saudi officials insisted that there was no reason for alarm.
"One thing to keep in mind in thinking about dissent in the kingdom is how minor is, and how abhorrent it is to the majority of Saudis, particularly when violent methods are used," said Prince Turki bin Faisal, who heads the country's Department of General Intelligence.
But within the Clinton Administration, American officials say, a gloomier view has been expressed in recent months by the Central Intelligence Agency, with analysts beginning to question how long the monarchy can survive.
An Administration official said several high-level meetings had been held recently in Washington to assess how the United States would be affected if a less friendly regime came to power in Saudi Arabia.
It is virtually impossible to accurately gauge the depth of discontent in a society like Saudi Arabia's, where dissent cannot openly be voiced and people guard their privacy fiercely.
But in Buraida, a hotbed of religious militancy, and even in the poorer neighborhoods of Riyadh, 200 miles to the southeast, what proved notable was the extent to which a number of residents echoed strains of the case against the monarchy advanced by dissidents abroad and militants in this country, many of whom are now in jail.
A significant number spoke also of Saudi Arabia's economic situation and the narrower horizons they now see for themselves and for a country that once seemed blessed with almost limitless wealth.
Saudi Arabia still sits on one-fourth of the world's known oil reserves, and it currently produces eight million barrels of oil a day, more than twice the daily yield of any other country.
But it has had to make amends for years of unrestrained spending, cutting back on the generous subsidies that helped to buy the good will of its citizens and making clear that many of those now entering the job market will have to accept sub-par positions once delegated to foreigners.
Opponents of the Saudi Government, who say the royal family has betrayed its role as custodian of Islam's holiest sites, have also accused its members of having squandered the country's wealth through wastefulness and greed.
And in Buraida, a city of 200,000 where women are seen in public only when shrouded all in black and where the religious police enforce the five-times-daily call to prayer, it was apparent that the attack had found resonance.
"You remember that bomb in Al Khobar?" one young merchant said over tea in the back room of his shop, referring to the car-bomb blast in June that killed 19 American airmen at a base in Dhahran. "I did not like it, but only for one reason: it hit only the Americans, when the target should have been the Government itself."
 
The Religion
Dynasty's Founder Took Title of Imam
Like the father and three brothers who preceded him to the throne, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia relies on the approval of his country's religious leadership, which in turn acts as protector of the Wahabi Muslim principles on which the kingdom was founded.
From the beginning of his rule, King Abdel Aziz -- the founder of the royal family -- assumed the title of imam, or law giver, and his sons have been bestowed that role by the religious leadership, known as the ulema.
But a minority among the followers of King Abdel Aziz never accepted him as their imam, and they rose against their leader in the Ikhwan rebellion of the late 1920's, which ended only when the King put them down by force.
In weathering conservative challenges since then, the Saudi Government has similarly had to face down religious extremists who do not regard its rule as legitimate.
Many people in Saudi Arabia describe the latest challenge, which began to surface in 1992, after the Persian Gulf war, as amounting to another rebellion, but one reinforced by signs that the Government has lost support from elements of the religious establishment, including militant preachers like Sheik Salman al-Awdah, who preached regularly at the Buraida mosque.
Along with Sheik Safar al-Hawali and others, Sheik Awdah applied the unyielding Wahabi tenets, based on a literal reading of the Koran, to describe the conduct of royal family as secular and corrupt. These clerics accused the Sauds of betraying the laws of Islam, in part by permitting infidel Western troops a presence on the Arabian Peninsula, the site of Islam's two holiest sites.
While the clerics never advocated violence, the Wahabi outlook allows little room for rival ways of thought, even among fellow Sunni Muslims. Saudi experts on radical Islamic movements say these attacks -- recorded on cassette tapes that circulated throughout the kingdom -- have helped to fuel deep antipathy to the Saudi Government.
"To the extremists, to declare the Government as illegitimate makes it an infidel government," said Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist. "And the moment they declare a government an infidel government, they believe they have the right to fight against it."
Warned to quiet his attacks, Sheik Awdah instead gathered thousands of followers in the rally here that ended with his arrest and those of Sheik Hawali and at least 400 others around the country. But while both clerics remain in prison, interviews found that support for them remains powerful in Buraida, whose residents proudly describe it as the most conservative place in Saudi Arabia.
Apart from the march two years ago, residents say, the town has demonstrated no outright signs of dissent. But cassettes of Sheik Awdah's sermons still circulate clandestinely, and videotape shot during the demonstration has formed lasting impressions on the minds of American officials whose responsibilities include this country.
Describing scenes that included "at least hundreds of young men running about," one Western diplomat said, "It was all very dramatic, because this is Saudi Arabia, and this never happens."
 
The Economy
Decline in Income Magnifies Discontent
In the last 15 years, per capita annual income in Saudi Arabia has plunged by about two-thirds, to about $6,700, mostly because of a population boom. That has magnified discontent and given new ammunition to those who accuse the royal family of failing to manage the country's resources wisely.
"The people need to eat," a Saudi in his 20's said in an interview in a poorer quarter of Riyadh, whose residents include Saudis and low-paid foreign workers from Pakistan and India. "And as life has become more difficult, we have begun to believe that someone must bear the blame."
For many in Saudi Arabia, the United States is an easy target. Despite evidence to the contrary, most Saudis remain convinced that the American Government profited from the gulf war at the expense of the Saudi treasury.
And religious conservatives, who contend that the presence of some 5,000 United States servicemen here contravenes the Wahabi interpretation of Islamic law, have condemned what they describe as an unwholesome American influence on the country and its rulers.
Both criticisms have attracted new adherents in the last year, a time when Washington's perceived pro-Israeli bias in Middle East peace talks has angered public opinion across the Arab world.
And in the aftermath of the bombings, both have been fanned by Saudi dissidents abroad, including Osama bin Laden, the billionaire exile who in September called on his followers to begin a "holy war" against the United States and its military presence.
"The Americans don't understand that they are not wanted," Khalid bin Abdelrahman al-Fawaz, a close associate of Mr. bin Laden, said in an interview in London. "They only understand the language of violence. It happened in Lebanon: they ran away only after there was major bloodshed. The same thing happened in Somalia. So the Saudi people thought: why don't we give them bloodshed?"
Except in extraordinary circumstances, Muslims are forbidden under Islamic law to kill fellow Muslims, so even Islamic extremists find it far easier to countenance attacks against so-called infidels.
Most American and Saudi experts nevertheless see the bomb attacks of the last year as evidence of opposition to the Saudi Government, whose decision to allow American forces to base themselves in the kingdom to repel Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 found little support within the Saudi population.
But even the most outspoken among the Saudi dissidents in London acknowledge that they have neither the ability nor the intention to challenge the Government with force. And in interviews in Washington and Riyadh, American experts and Western diplomats said they did not believe that the Government faced a near-term threat.
"I don't see any signs that the Al Saud are in any imminent danger whatsoever," a Western diplomat in Riyadh said. "The question is: over the next 5 to 10 years, will they make the changes they need to keep themselves in power, or will they make fatal choices that will undermine their rule?"
 
The Outlook
Rulers More Wary Over Ties With U.S.
If the nightmare scenario for the West is the collapse of the Saudi Government in an Iranian-style revolution, the consensus among Western analysts is that such an outcome remains extraordinarily unlikely. There is no evidence, the analysts say, of any mass inclination to confront the Government by taking to the steets.
But under King Fahd, who suffered a stroke late last year, the Saudi monarchy appears to be treading carefully around public sentiment, perhaps most notably by its refusal this fall to allow the United States to mount its latest round of attacks against Iraq from Saudi bases.
The Saudis have also seemed determined to keep American investigators at arm's length from their investigation of the Dhahran bombing, a stand based either on sovereignty concerns or wariness about allowing outsiders to take stock of their internal difficulties.
A sense of unease also has been apparent in the attention given by Saudi newspapers recently to religious seminars whose consistent theme has been that loyalty to the imam, to the King, is a Muslim virtue. The country's second-ranking religious figure, Sheik Mohammed bin Otheimin, ruled that to criticize the King from within the chamber of the mosque would be to commit an act of heresy.
After bombings that Clinton Administration officials said underscored how much about Saudi Arabia the West still did not know, a puzzle that remains in a society that does not allow dissent is how to weigh the complaints that do surface.
On that subject, a Saudi man who politely turned a visitor away from his office in Buraida stopped first to offer a piece of advice.
"The official point of view," he said, "is that the Americans are our friends -- friends to the gulf in general, and friends to the kingdom. That is the policy of the Government, and if people are asked a question here, that is the way they are expected to answer."

HEADLINE: A Telecom Marriage Made Somewhat Shy of Heaven

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
It was hard to tell from the lofty price tag, the jet-setting management structure or the elegant corporate moniker, but the deal that created Concert was not the first choice of British Telecommunications P.L.C.
BT, as the British company is known, agreed to consider an acquisition of the MCI Communications Corporation only after it failed in its effort buy another British international phone company, Cable and Wireless P.L.C. Though MCI pushed for the deal, it, too, had considered several other potential partners, including the GTE Corporation and at least some of the seven regional Bell companies. 
 These considerations were largely lost in the hoopla of Sunday's announcement that MCI and BT had agreed to merge their operations to create Concert, the world's first trans-Atlantic telephone carrier. But now, as shareholders and regulators place the $23 billion deal under a microscope, questions about its strategic rationale will come to the fore.
"MCI wasn't the first bride they considered," said David Roddy, chief telecommunications economist at the accounting and consulting firm Deloitte & Touche. "This is a consolation prize for British Telecom."
BT negotiated to acquire Cable and Wireless over five months earlier this year after management turmoil left that company open to a new owner. But the talks collapsed in May, largely over disagreements on price.
Mr. Roddy and other experts said Cable and Wireless would have been a more attractive partner for British Telecom than MCI is because it would have enabled BT to fill out its geographic footprint in Asia. The major asset of Cable and Wireless is Hong Kong Telecom, a publicly listed company of which BT owns 58 percent. By contrast, the MCI merger solidifies BT's foothold only in North America -- something that analysts say had already been secured by its 20 percent equity stake in MCI.
Analysts said that Asia -- with a population of about 2.3 billion, explosive economic growth and one phone line for every 96 people -- represents a larger and less tapped opportunity than the American market, which is both mature and beset by regulatory uncertainty.
Executives at British Telecom, however, rejected the notion that acquiring MCI was Plan B after missing out on Cable and Wireless.
"We had a very successful alliance with MCI, but it was only addressing a portion of the market," said John Butler, director of regulatory affairs for BT. "Our discussions with Cable and Wireless were really sort of independent of what we were doing with MCI."
The architects of the deal -- Bert C. Roberts Jr. of MCI and Sir Iain Vallance of BT -- betrayed no second thoughts yesterday as they promoted the deal in television interviews. They plan to meet today with Reed E. Hundt, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, whose support will be critical in order for the deal to clear regulatory hurdles.
Analysts said that concerns about how long it might take to close the deal dampened the performance of MCI's shares, which rose just 50 cents, to $30.75, yesterday in Nasdaq trading, after a gain of $5.125 on Friday, when word of the impending deal became known. BT's shares showed surprising resilience in the London market yesterday, rising 22 pence, to 3.73, or roughly $6.10. The increase in BT's stock price added about $1 billion to the value of the deal.
Though Mr. Roberts, who is the chairman of MCI, said the merger would give his company more artillery to battle for local phone customers and expand its ability to serve global business customers, the combination with BT is an about-face of sorts for MCI, too.
In May 1995, MCI agreed to invest $2 billion in Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation -- on the assumption that it could bridge the worlds of telecommunications and entertainment. MCI also poured $600 million into American Sky Broadcasting, a satellite television service that was to be MCI's vehicle to enter the consumer video market.
Some MCI shareholders viewed the investment as little more than a subsidy of Mr. Murdoch's global ambitions, however, and the BT deal amounted to a repudiation of the strategy. MCI said it would limit its investment in the News Corporation at the current $1.3 billion. It wants to reduce its equity stake in A Sky B to less than 20 percent. And Mr. Murdoch, a director of MCI, will not join the board of Concert.
"People could never understand that deal," said Eric Strumingher, an analyst who follows MCI at the Chicago Corporation, "If this gives MCI a way to back out of it gracefully, that's a good thing."
In a conference call with analysts on Sunday, the otherwise ebullient Mr. Roberts was circumspect about the reasons for the shift.
"We're already going down a path with News Corporation," he said. "We intend to restructure that investment." Executives at the News Corporation declined to comment yesterday.
If MCI is being tight-lipped, however, executives at BT were eager to explain why a merger with MCI was preferable to a deal with Cable and Wireless -- even with a price tag of $23 billion.
Although Hong Kong Telecom has a commanding position in the huge Hong Kong market, Mr. Butler noted that it was vulnerable to political instability, particularly with the coming of Chinese rule of the British colony next July.
Moreover, British Telecom already has a web of smaller alliances with carriers in India, Japan and South Korea. With its expanded size, he said, Concert would be in a stronger position to make strategic deals with Asian telephone companies than either BT or MCI alone would be.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephoneseems destined to be the major target of Concert's affections.
"N.T.T. must rank as an excellent prospective partner," Mr. Butler said of the giant Japanese company. And other BT executives noted that their company's chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield, who will also be the chief executive of Concert, came to BT from a British computer manufacturer, ICL, which happens to be owned by Fujitsu of Japan.
Whether Sir Peter can persuade N.T.T. to become a player in Concert remains, of course, to be seen. And Mr. Butler acknowledged that Cable and Wireless would have given British Telecom an immediate and powerful beachhead in Asia.
Yet he added, "At the end of our discussion, we had too many uncertainties as to the prospects for that company."
For Mr. Roberts and BT's chairman, Sir Iain, the challenge now is to prove that their mammoth merger is less risky than the road not taken.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE FUND-RAISERS;
Indonesian Magnate and Clinton Talked Policy, White House Says

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4

 BODY:
James T. Riady, an Indonesian billionaire with a financial stake in American policy toward Asia, discussed trade policy with President Clinton and perhaps senior aides in some of the more than a dozen visits he made to the White House, Administration officials acknowledged today.
After weeks of declining to provide details of the visits by Mr. Riady, the central figure in the current campaign finance uproar, the White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said that a preliminary internal review showed that Mr. Riady had been a guest at the Executive Mansion at least 15 to 20 times over the last four years. 
 Mr. McCurry said the purpose of the visits was to pay social calls, lobby the Clinton Administration to appoint more Asian-Americans and occasionally discuss policy issues with the President and his advisers. But Mr. McCurry and other Administration officials said they were unable to describe with any level of precision how often Mr. Riady was there, with whom he met, what policies he was advocating and what briefings he received during his visits. The Wall Street Journal today reported that there were at least 14 visits and quoted Mr. McCurry that they were for "outreach to the Asian-American communities."
Mr. McCurry said the review had determined that Mr. Riady had discussed Asian trade policy generally with the President, may have met with Robert E. Rubin, then the head of the National Economic Council, for an unspecified policy meeting and may have had conversations with other advisers as well.
"We have established that he saw a variety of people and that some related to concerns he had on policy matters," Mr. McCurry said in a telephone interview during a campaign stop in Cleveland. "There would be nothing inappropriate about this."
In the closing weeks of the Presidential race, Republicans and Ross Perot have suggested that big campaign donations by people with ties to the Riadys, who control a $12 billion empire of real estate, banking and other holdings, allowed the clan to influence unduly American policy toward Asia, where most of the family's holdings are. When Mr. Riady worked in the late 1970's at an Arkansas bank partly owned by his family, he became friendly with Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Riady and other family members control the Lippo Group, which has its headquarters in Jakarta, and whose holdings include Lippo Bank, a small bank based in California. In the 1990's, the family's senior executive in the United States was John Huang, who left for a trade post at the Commerce Department that the Riadys have said they helped secure in exchange for their political support of Mr. Clinton. Mr. Huang left Government earlier this year to become a senior fund-raiser for the Democrats. He was suspended last month after reports that he had solicited questionable contributions.
Clinton campaign aides have denied the accusations of undue influence, saying Bob Dole's financial patrons received the same kind of access in Republican circles as Mr. Clinton's did at the White House.
But the latest disclosure suggested that Mr. Riady was a more frequent guest than had previously been known. It was also the first official acknowledgment that Mr. Riady was doing more than simply paying social calls on his visits to the Executive Mansion. White House aides had previously disclosed that Mr. Riady met with Mr. Clinton three times at the White House and played down the significance, describing the visits as "brief" and "informal."
Mr. McCurry said the review had not uncovered precisely what policies Mr. Riady had pressed for in his visits, although associates of the Riadys have said that they were interested in American concerns about human rights in East Timor and worker rights more generally in Indonesia. The Riadys have also been interested in the Administration's decision to approve most favored nation status for China, particularly since the family is developing a $1 billion power plant in southern China with the Little Rock unit of the Entergy Corporation.
"From time to time, Riady would talk to the President in a philosophical way about why the United States should be more interested in Asian trade," Mr. McCurry said today.
But Mr. McCurry added that White House records indicated that Mr. Riady had also been interested in discussing particular issues with White House aides, although the subjects remained unknown. On April 19, 1993, for instance, Mr. Riady requested a meeting with the President. He had a brief meeting with Mr. Clinton and a mutual friend from Little Rock, Mark Grobmyer.
That same day, Mr. Riady was referred to Thomas F. McLarty, then the White House chief of staff, who directed Mr. Riady to meet with Mr. Rubin, who was then the head of the National Economic Council and is now the Treasury Secretary.
Howard Schloss, Mr. Rubin's spokesman at the Treasury Department, said that Mr. Rubin had no recollection of seeing Mr. Riady and that he did not know whether a meeting had occurred.
The meetings occurred in six trips Mr. Riady made to Washington. But the White House records do not present a complete picture of discussions between the President and Mr. Riady. Associates of Mr. Riady have said in interviews that he said he had discussed American trade policy toward China and Indonesia with the President, including a discussion earlier this summer in the President's limousine. That visit would not show up on White House logs.
Mr. McCurry said White House aides were continuing to tabulate Mr. Riady's visits and that the approximation of visits was necessary because Mr. Riady, a citizen of Indonesia, used his family's Chinese name on some occasions when he was cleared at the White House.
Mr. McCurry said some of Mr. Riady's visits were with Mark Middleton, a former White House assistant to Mr. McLarty, who knew Mr. Riady from when they both worked in Little Rock. In recent days, Mr. Middleton has denied accusations that he had been involved in efforts to solicit money for the Democrats from a senior official in Taiwan Nationalist Party this year.
Nearly a dozen committees of the Republican-controlled Congress have begun inquiries into the Riady family, Lippo and contributions to the Democrats.
But in recent days, Lippo has had a difficult time finding a lawyer in Washington. Several prominent lawyers have turned the company down because of potential conflicts of interest. The company recently approached Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., the Williams & Connolly partner who became a nationally known figure when he represented Oliver North in the Iran-Contra scandal. Mr. Sullivan reportedly wanted to do the legal work for Lippo but was vetoed by his partners because David Kendall, another Williams & Connolly partner, represents President Clinton.
Other lawyers have said they have had to turn down Lippo because they have White House clients who could become involved in the multiple investigations that have begun in recent weeks at the Justice Department and in Congress.

HEADLINE: When Shoppers Walk Away From Pedestrian Malls;
Downtown Retailing Trend Again Favors a Car Culture

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

DATELINE: KALAMAZOO, Mich.

 BODY:
Sandwiched between Chicago and Detroit, this city of 80,000 people always had one little retail thrill to distinguish itself from its bigger neighbors. It was home to the country's first pedestrian mall, a charming European-style enclave of trees and water fountains built in 1959, lined with shops and restaurants that awaited the strollers who popped in from around the state.
Now, Kalamazoo wants to rip up two of the four blocks of its mall, replace them with streets, and bring back cars, a proposal made by the City Council and a business association that city residents will vote on today. 
 The issue is not an isolated one: in fact, from Sacramento, Calif., to Westhampton Beach, L.I., towns across the country are evaluating what to do with their pedestrian malls. More often than not, they are opting to get rid of them.
Such malls may soon be a relic, a quaint urban planning blip of the late 1960's and early 1970's, when most of the country's pedestrian malls -- streets closed to automotive traffic where pedestrians can walk and shop freely -- were created.
"We were the first ones to have it, and we should have been the first ones to tear it down," said Nancy Arcadipone, the director of business and housing development for Downtown Kalamazoo Inc., a nonprofit business association promoting the initiative.
Kalamazoo hopes to lure back merchants who have abandoned the downtown strip because, they complain, weekends, evenings and snowy afternoons -- of which there are no shortage in western Michigan -- leave the pedestrian mall deserted.
Like dozens of other cities, Kalamazoo also hopes to take advantage of a small but significant shift as shoppers, tired of the endless sameness in the country's enclosed suburban malls, are looking to shop outside them, even back on Main Street.
"The most successful downtowns throughout America today are those that are moving back to what they were in the beginning," said Doyle Hyett, the chairman of Hyett Palma, an urban renewal consulting firm in Alexandria, Va., that studied Kalamazoo and many other cities with pedestrian malls.
"They are moving back to much more of a neighborhood feel, as original city centers," he said. " 'Pedestrianization' as we define it today is not to close off cars; it is to make it easy to move through." The firm did consulting work for Kalamazoo about the mall, and favored the idea of opening it to motorists.
Of the roughly 200 pedestrian malls that once dotted the country, at least half are in some form of transformation, Mr. Hyett said.
Some cities, like Eugene, Ore., have ripped up pieces of their pedestrian malls. Others, like Milwaukee, have taken the whole strip down. Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and Raleigh, N.C., are just two of the many other cities considering similar moves.
Retail experts note that pedestrian malls never took into consideration the preferences of most shoppers, who arrive downtown in their cars and want to park near their shopping area, or have easy drop-off access to stores; pedestrian malls do not offer either. Trees and birds are perfectly nice, but no one really goes shopping to see them.
Pedestrian malls, built to invigorate aging downtowns, started to founder as the shopping world became peppered with regional enclosed malls during the 1970's. Shoppers quickly abandoned the idea of strolling about trees and man-made rivers to get their shopping done, and weekend and evening foot traffic quickly dried up. In some cases, the downtown malls became menacing crime zones at night because they were so isolated.
The only places that pedestrian malls tend to be a hit, retail consultants say, are at the centers of large college towns like Boulder, Colo., where there are fewer drivers than normal, or in tourist areas that lend themselves to strolling, as in Miami Beach and in Santa Monica, Calif.
By contrast, cities like Kalamazoo are hard pressed to get retailers into their malls' storefronts -- even at the $8 a square foot charged by the Kalamazoo Downtown Mall.
"In the downtown area, 19 new businesses have come in the last 18 months and the same number have left," said Kimberly Williamson, president of Downtown Kalamazoo Inc. "We have heard what merchants downtown want, which is access, visibility and convenience. The mall in its current configuration does not address these needs."
Towns that have embraced the bulldozer often seem to have an almost instant turnaround. "I think it has been probably the most important thing that has happened downtown," said Russ Brink, the executive director of Downtown Eugene Inc., which was part of the coalition that has pushed to tear down that town's H-shaped pedestrian mall. One leg was opened to traffic four years ago, and another leg is in the process of doing so now.
"The idea that you could close off the center of the city from vehicular traffic and still have a viable commercial area never clicked," Mr. Brink said. "Plus, people stopped coming downtown because of perceptions of safety. After we took part of the mall out, there was a pretty remarkable transformation.
"There is night life, new restaurants, a nice area that sprang up after the reopening," he said. "In 1992, the retail vacancy rate was 30 percent for the whole pedestrian mall, and in March it was down to 7 percent."
Questions about what to do with downtown landscapes have become more urgent as retailers inch out of the giant enclosed malls and into new locales -- stand-alone shops along busy freeways, sprawling super-centers in the middle of nowhere and, even, back to downtown.
"Big box" retailers like Home Depot, Baby Superstores and CompUSA got the ball rolling by introducing their giant stores in strip malls. Many other retail companies -- including the Limited, Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue -- are setting up shop outside enclosed malls.
But American shoppers have been spoiled by the one-stop convenience that enclosed malls offer, and car-free strips generally do not meet the demands of time-pressed shopping trips downtown. In this current wave of downtown revitalization, charm may be yielding to convenience.
"What you saw in the 70's were days of urban renewal which tended to look at plazas, above-ground malls and above-ground connections between malls," said Frank Fish, a principal at Buckhurst Fish & Jacquemart, an urban planning firm in New York.
"But those things were not designed well; they were not based on how people really interact," he said. "The shopping destination does have to provide traffic access and parking. The key is balance."
Still, residents tend to split over what to do with their pedestrian malls, for reasons that range from sentiment to fears over how to pay for renovations.
In Kalamazoo, most stores -- from Jacobson's, the largest downtown merchant, to the little local bookseller -- love the demolition plans. The local newspaper, which has made no secret of its support for the demolition, has rallied for the change.
Yet a handful of enraged merchants and hundreds of residents who want to save the mall gathered signatures to get the issue on the ballot. Some grow elegiac at the thought of bulldozing a piece of Kalamazoo's history.
"We're not against improving the mall, but I am against the cars on the mall," said Marvel Neal, the owner of Terrapin Worldwide Imports, a gift shop on the mall.
"It is the one place in Kalamazoo where you don't have to worry about traffic," he said. "People walk down here by the hundreds to sit on the lawn and eat their lunch. It's just great. Plus, now we will have to deal with car exhaust."
But other mall merchants argue that lunchtime business alone will not pay the bills. "I'll be disappointed if we don't have the vision to go forward with this," said Bruce Johnson, a co-owner of Gazelle Sports, an athletic goods shop.
Yet other residents are skeptical of both sides. "I would love to see the downtown revitalized, but I just don't think they are going to get the kind of business they think they're going to get just by taking up the mall," said Florence Nelson, a homemaker who has watched downtown retailing dry up over the years.
Indeed, retailers like Gap Inc. have said that -- more than its pedestrian strip -- it is Kalamazoo's small size and proximity to a suburban mall which work against the town's downtown.
Like most towns that have dug up pedestrian malls, Kalamazoo plans to pay for the changes with a mix of private and public funds. The cost of a total downtown revitalization should be between $7 million and $9 million, Ms. Williamson said; about a third is earmarked for the mall.
Yet urban planners and retail experts warn that even if retailers do flock to reconfigured strips, they alone can not save downtowns.
"If you are really going to compete with the suburban malls, you have to create an equal or greater draw," said Eugene A. Pinover, the head of the real estate group at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, a New York law firm. "Shoppers need to have the reason to leave their home. You need theaters, restaurants and things that are at least in part entertainment. You have to make a there there."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Recoups Losses; Canadian Money at New High

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly higher yesterday, deriving strength from diminished anxiety about the outcome of the American election, as well as new signs of economic weakness in Japan and Germany.
Many currency traders had sold the dollar in advance of the voting yesterday, fearing that the Democrats might retake control of Congress. Some in the financial markets view Democrats as less fiscally responsible than Republicans and more inclined to let the budget deficit increase, which can be inflationary. 
 "I think that concern has abated somewhat," said Pierce Acheson, chief dealer of foreign exchange at the Chicago office of Nationsbank. "With that abating, we had some money movement back into dollars."
As the dollar rose, traders who had bet on a falling dollar were forced to buy to minimize their losses, further bolstering the currency in what is known as a short-covering rally.
At the same time, many remained cautious and were not bidding the dollar beyond recent trading ranges.
Late in New York yesterday afternoon, the dollar rose to 1.5192 marks from 1.5104 on Monday and to 114.15 yen from 113.75. The pound traded at $1.6446, down marginally from its 20-month high of $1.6449 on Monday.
The notable exception in the dollar's movement was its weakness against the Canadian dollar, which jumped to the highest levels in nearly two years from a strong rally in the Canadian bond market. Traders were receiving many orders for Canadian dollars needed to purchase securities in Canada. The dollar ended at 75.21 Canadian cents, compared with 74.85 cents on Monday.
The dollar first rose against the yen in Asian dealings after a major property developer, Sueno Kosan, and two affiliates sought bankruptcy because of debts estimated at nearly $5.3 billion. It was the latest sign of financial problems confronting Japanese banks and lending agencies.
"It shows the complete lack of recovery in Japan and the fact that low rates in Japan are there to stay," Mr. Acheson of Nationsbank contended. Low rates in Japan have helped depress the demand for yen-denominated assets.
The mark was hurt by a German Finance Ministry report that manufacturing orders dropped sharply in September, reviving talk of a possible further easing of interest rates in Germany.

HEADLINE: Experts Disagree on Adding Fatty Acid to Infant Formula

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY 

 BODY:
IN the last year and a half, the issue of adding a certain fatty acid to infant formula has become an international cause celebre.
The additive in question, a major component of fish oil called docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, is present in breast milk and is important to the proper growth of an infant's brain. 
 Some argue it is unethical not to give formula-fed babies a supplement of this fatty acid, along with a companion, arachidonic acid, or AA, that is also present in breast milk but not in formula. And some infant formula producers in Europe and Asia have already begun to include these fatty acids in formula destined for premature babies, who miss the full benefit of their mothers' supply in the last weeks or months of fetal life.
In this country the Martek Biosciences Corporation of Columbia, Md., which has developed a way to grow marine microalgae in the laboratory and extract DHA from it, has used a public relations agency to convince the American public to support the addition of DHA to infant formula.
But other medical experts and American formula producers, citing the first law of medicine, "First, do no harm," are urging caution. They are awaiting the results of several dozen clinical studies now under way here and abroad that are expected to show whether this nutritional boost is necessary, safe and effective in enhancing an infant's neurological development. Thus far, the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition has taken no stand on the issue, calling it too complex and the data too limited to warrant a definitive statement.
Some facts are clear:
*DHA is essential to neurological development and one of the two most prominent fatty acids in the brain and retina.
*The peak period of brain development occurs during the last three months of fetal life and the first several months of infant life.
*Human breast milk contains DHA (the amount varying according to the mother's diet), but infant formulas sold in the United States do not.
*Humans can make DHA from another fatty acid, alpha linolenic acid, that is now in all infant formulas, but the conversion ability of newborns, especially preterm babies, may be unable to keep up with the demands of the nervous system.
*Blood levels of DHA fall after birth in babies who are bottle-fed, but less so if at all in breast-fed babies. And bottle-fed babies who die in infancy have less DHA in their brains than breast-fed babies.
*In this country breast-fed babies seem to be smarter than bottle-fed babies, as measured by average I.Q., which is is eight points higher at the age of 8.
The question is: Should DHA be added to infant formula? If so, should it be given only to premature babies or to all babies?
The body is perfectly capable of making its own DHA. In order for it to do so the diet must include two polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic and alpha linolenic acid, which are components of vegetable oils that are found in all infant formulas. From these so-called essential fatty acids, the body can manufacture the two long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, AA and DHA, respectively.
Dr. William E. Connor, a nutrition researcher at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, said that the conversion occurred slowly both in infants and adults, but that through the years adults accumulated DHA and AA and stored it in their body fat. During pregnancy and lactation, the fatty acids are released from a woman's body fat to supply her fetus and infant.
What has been called into question is whether newborns who are bottle-fed, and particularly those infants born prematurely, can produce DHA and AA efficiently enough on their own to develop optimally.
"A driving force in the matter is whether there might be another required nutrient" that must be supplied in the diet to assure normal growth, Dr. J. Thomas Brenna, a Cornell University nutrition researcher, said in an interview. He and Dr. Peter Nathanielsz at Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine are examining the extreme: whether pregnant vegan monkeys, which get no DHA or AA in their diets, can adequately supply their fetuses with these fatty acids.
Last week, a group of experts convened under the auspices of the Harvard School of Public Health and Ross Laboratories, a formula producer, discussed the reasons for not rushing headlong into supplementing infant formulas with DHA and AA, even though it might seem logical and, on the surface at least, vital to optimal infant development.
"We should assure that formulas are as good as possible, but we must never make formulas less safe," said Dr. Stanley Zlotkin, pediatric nutrition specialist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.
"Current formulas are very good and very safe and babies consuming them develop well," Dr. Zlotkin said. "From a nutritional point of view, it is very hard to tell the difference between babies who are breast-fed and those who are bottle-fed."
Dr. Alan Lucas, an expert in child nutrition at the British Medical Research Council in London who directed the I.Q. study of breast-fed and bottle-fed babies, said there were a great many differences between breast milk and infant formula beyond their fatty acid content. "If all the factors in breast milk were important," he said, "we should be seeing an epidemic of illnesses among bottle-fed babies. We shouldn't regard breast milk as the perfect guide for making formula."
It is also not yet clear what, if any, differences between breast milk and formula might influence intelligence. Dr. Robert B. McCall, a psychologist and child development specialist at the University of Pittsburgh, said: "While breast-fed babies are smarter, the question is why. Other factors in milk than DHA could also account for the higher intelligence of breast-fed babies."
Furthermore, he said, mothers who choose to breast-feed are likely to be different in some important ways from mothers who choose to feed their babies formula. These days, nursing mothers tend to be better educated and economically more secure. Even though studies account for factors like the mother's education and socioeconomic level and the status of the baby at birth, there is no way to control for the effects of the postnatal environment, which can strongly influence a child's performance on I.Q. tests and in school.
The only way to be certain that the kind of nutrition given is responsible for the developmental differences observed is to assign babies randomly to receive either regular formula or formula supplemented with DHA and AA, Dr. McCall said. Such studies are now under way both in preterm and full-term babies, who must be followed for several years to determine first if there is a developmental advantage to the supplemented formula and second if that difference persists beyond the first few years of life.
Researchers are examining such effects as the development of babies' visual systems and differences in their so-called attentional behavior (how long they look at novel and familiar images), which is predictive of later I.Q.
Dr. Robert T. Hall, chief of the division of human development at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., said that the largest North American study to date had found that in full-term babies, "there's nothing more than a transient difference in visual development at 2 to 4 months of age in babies fed supplemented formulas; after that, the differences disappear."
But Dr. McCall said two studies of premature babies showed that those receiving supplemented formula had better attentional behavior in the first year of life, but that he "wouldn't bet the farm" on whether this translated into higher intelligence.
There are also safety concerns. In studies of premature infants fed formula supplemented with fish oil, the babies' visual development was enhanced but their growth was impaired. They were shorter, weighed less and had smaller heads than comparable infants given standard formula, Dr. Lucas said.
"We now think that fish oil is inappropriate to use" as a source of DHA, since other ingredients in the oil could have had adverse effects on growth, Dr. Lucas said. He said it was currently not possible to add pure DHA to formula because "it comes mixed with other things."
While fish oil is the major dietary source of DHA, it originates in plants -- specifically the microscopic algae that grow in the ocean and that work their way up the food chain, becoming increasingly concentrated as they go.
Dr. Ronald Kleinman, a pediatric nutrition expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, noted, "The amount of DHA in breast milk can vary as much as twentyfold, depending on the mother's diet." The more fish she eats, the more DHA would appear in her milk. He said that while DHA was most important to the brain and visual system, it was also important to the development of the immune, gastrointestinal and reproductive systems.
Dr. Connor said his advice to women would be to "eat fish during pregnancy and lactation" to build up a supply of DHA and "to breast-feed their babies, if at all possible, for the first three or four months of life, the time of the most rapid incorporation of DHA into the brain." He noted that in the days before milk was fortified with vitamins A and D, babies were routinely given cod liver oil, a rich source of DHA. As for current infant formula, he said: "In my view, we should mirror human milk as much as possible because that is what nature intended infants to have. Once it is determined to be safe to add these fatty acids, we should do it."

If you're looking for a New Year's Eve cruise
in 1999, now is the time to get in line.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
AS Times Square and other traditional New Year's Eve sites plan for the arrival of the year 2000, the travel industry is also busy preparing to ring out the old and ring in the new.
Carnival Cruise Lines, for example, will not publish its 1999 itineraries or prices for another 13 months, but is already accepting reservations -- for the waiting list. For cruises departing or under way on Dec. 31, 1999, potential passengers must submit a written request to Carnival with an initial deposit of $150 a person for three- or four-day cruises, $250 a person for seven days or longer. 
 Its brochures declaring "It only happens once every thousand years," Kvaerner's Cunard Lines is currently accepting reservations for its five millennium cruises. QE2 passengers will have an opportunity to sing Auld Lang Syne off the coast of Barbados while watching a fireworks display, while passengers on the Royal Viking Sun will celebrate in Acapulco harbor. The Vistafjord will be steaming toward Kenya that historic night, after having departed Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Sea Goddess I passengers will gather on the beach at Virgin Gorda Sound in the British Virgin Islands while Sea Goddess II will be in Paula Naira, a cluster of islands in Indonesia.
Reservations for all Cunard cruises require a $1,000 deposit.
 
Smoking Aloft
Air France passengers between Paris and the United States are forbidden to smoke in their seats, but the airline has added smokers' bars that are open throughout the flight except at mealtime. The two bars, one for economy class and one for business and first class, are enclosed by drapes and ventilated by special smoke-extracting fans.
 
The Occupancy Factor
Almost two months ago PKF Consulting, the international hotel consulting firm with headquarters in San Francisco, predicted the re-election of President Clinton in yesterday's election -- based on an analysis of the performance of the United States lodging industry since 1929.
The firm predicted that the average occupancy for United States hotels in 1996 will be 1 percent greater than last year. "When the average occupancy rate for U.S. hotels has increased during a presidential election year," said Robert Maandelbaum, the director of research, "there is a 70 percent chance that the Democratic candidate will win."
 
Corporate Travel Powwow
The 1,600-room New Orleans Hilton Riverside was host recently to 125 corporate meeting planners and travel managers at a four-day business summit meeting, complete with 11 working sessions. The Hilton Hotels Corporation property, which has 127,000 square feet of meeting space (and eight indoor tennis courts atop the parking garage) already is host to some 400 meetings and conventions a year, and corporate travelers account for some 45 percent of the hotel's business.
Mike Taylor, the hotel's director of marketing, said that as corporate meetings had been increasing along with an improving economy, such summit meetings were valuable for exchanging ideas about catering, audio-visual equipment, and what amenities business travelers look for in their rooms. He added that fitness rooms, which some hotel officials still regard as white elephants, were getting much more use from business travelers than ever before.
 
Spend and Fly
Pan Pacific Hotels' Mauna Lani Bay, the resort on the Kohala Coast of Hawaii, will close from May 9 through Aug. 1 next year for a $10 million renovation. Meanwhile, there is still time to earn a million frequent-flier miles on American, Delta, United or T.W.A. The catch? Just stay 30 consecutive days and nights in any of the resort's five bungalows, at a mere $4,500 a night. If that is a bit steep, Don Dickhens, the resort's general manager, recently noted that 100,000 mileage points required a minimum stay of only five consecutive days and nights at the $4,500-a- night rate.
 
Caution on Gifts
Think twice before giving foreign customers or associates a holiday gift. Dean Foster, director of the Berlitz Cross-Cultural division, warns never to give a gift of leather in India, for your recipient could be Hindu, and most leather comes from cows, sacred incarnations of life in the Hindu religion. Muslim friends or associates would appreciate a fine silver compass, he said, which would allow them to locate Mecca for their daily prayers no mater where in the world they are. Clocks are not good gifts for Chinese associates, since the Mandarin word for clock is similar to the word for death. And a fine bottle of brandy or Scotch is appreciated by Japanese, who are the world's largest consumer of both products, A box of citrus fruits, which are very expensive in Japan, is also highly prized.

Bond Prices Post Sharp Increases

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Weak economic data and a strong dollar, combined with expectations in the stock and bond markets that the post-election political landscape will not change, sent bond prices sharply higher yesterday.
The benchmark 30-year bond surged 31/32 , to a price of 1026/32 to yield 6.58 percent, down from 6.66 percent on Monday and the lowest since March 26, when it was 6.57 percent. A bond's yield moves in the opposite direction of its price. 
 Investors yesterday saw yet another sign of slowing economic growth, as September home completions fell 5.8 percent, to 1.358 million units, from a a revised 1.442 million units in August.
The downturn in completions further removed concerns that the Fed might raise interest rates at its coming Federal Open Market Committee meeting on next Wednesday, or at the final meeting for this year on Dec. 17. The first meeting for 1997 will be Feb. 4.
Foreign demand for Treasury securities caused by the rising dollar also pushed prices higher. Weak retail sales reports also contributed to the rally.
Analysts said the bullish tone in trading yesterday also eased fears about the market's ability to absorb the large amount of Treasury paper coming to market this week.
The market reacted to early exit polls that showed President Clinton leading the Republican challenger, Bob Dole, but the Democrats failing to make headway in their effort to regain control of one or both houses of Congress. The market had feared that if Democrats were successful, there would be less incentive to cut the budget deficit.
Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said the optimistic view on the election this week, was for a Democratic President with a Republican Congress. "Expectations among Wall Street traders and investors are that we will continue having the two parties work toward a solution in reducing the budget deficit, pretty much the way they have for the past few years," Mr. Regan said.
Mr. Regan said that yesterday's three-year note auction, the first part of the Government's quarterly refunding, was a "fair auction" and came in as advertised. He noted that noncompetitive bidding was a little less than expected, with the bid-to-cover ratio, or the number of bids compared with size of the total auction, a little on the light side. The bid to cover at yesterday's auction was 2.28 to 1, compared with an average of 2.49 to 1 over the last four auctions.
The yield came in at 5.889 percent, in line with expectations.
Mr. Regan said the retail sales reports helped alleviate inflation fears.
"The weekly retail reports released yesterday were a little lighter than they had been in the prior week," he said. Today the Treasury will auction 10-year notes, but with the yield in the 10-year and 30-year maturities lower than they have been since last March, Mr. Regan said, "it may prove to be more formidable to auction the 10-year, considering that we still don't know the full effects of the election at the present time."
Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said that while a resurgence of foreign demand helped propel the market along to lower yields, "the Street fought it the whole way, believing that it is dangerous to press the market higher during a refunding auction."
In when-issued trading ahead of today's and tomorrow's auctions, the 10-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.27 percent, down 7 basis points from the previous day, while the 30-year bond was offered at a price to yield 6.54 percent, down 8 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-year notes:

HEADLINE: Auto Makers Fell Shy of Expectations

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Vehicle sales were below expectations last month, rising only slightly from the lackluster period a year before. Sales of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans were strong but the results were dragged down by car sales.
Overall sales rose 2.2 percent in October, a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 14.9 million light vehicles. The mediocre sales results could be a factor in the decision next week on interest rates by the Federal Reserve, Wall Street analysts said. 
 Separately, the General Motors Corporation said that a tentative agreement had been reached at its highly profitable plant in Janesville, Wis., ending a strike by 4,800 members of the United Automobile Workers local there. A ratification vote was scheduled for Wednesday at the plant, which builds G.M.'s popular Suburban sport utility vehicle. A settlement would end G.M.'s latest round of labor problems.
The Ford Motor Company said today that its sales rose 2.7 percent. Sales of its sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks rose 8.3 percent, while car sales fell 3.9 percent. Ford is the last big auto maker to release its monthly sales figures.
Some Wall Street analysts yawned. "The month was decent," Joseph S. Phillippi of Lehman Brothers said, adding that "it probably was below a lot of people's expectations," but that most of the declines were explained by one-time events.
Still, he said, the figures suggested that the economy was not overheating.
October's auto sales "show the Fed that there is no need to tinker with interest rates," Mr. Phillippi added.
Shares of Ford rose 12.5 cents today to close at $31.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. G.M. shares closed unchanged at $55.625, while Chrysler eased by 25 cents, to $33.125.
Sales figures for the Ford Windstar, Ford Taurus and Mercury Grand Marquis were especially strong, but those for the Ford Ranger, Ford Aerostar and Mercury Sable were weak. October was the first full sales month for Ford's new large sport utility vehicle, the Expedition. It sold just over 13,000 of them, and said it would have sold more if it could have built them faster.
"Expedition is the right product in the right market at the right time," said Bob Rewey, Ford's group vice president for marketing and sales. "The only question appears to be 'how high is up?' and we won't know the answer until our dealers have greater availability."
Auto dealers echoed that sentiment. Lee Weinman, a Ford dealer on the north side of Chicago, said, "Our only problem with Expedition is we can't get enough -- we are selling every one we can get."
Sales at his dealership were especially brisk last month -- up 20 percent over those in October 1995. He said he expected sales for the rest of the year to stay fairly strong.
"Selling cars is not a mystery," Mr. Weinman said. "When people are working and interest rates are decent, they buy cars."
Pete Greiner, a Ford dealer in Casper, Wyo., said his sales were up, too, and predicted "a good finish for 1996." Mr. Greiner added that "the hottest product we have is the F-series truck," with the Explorer and Expedition sport utility vehicles a close second and third.
Many auto makers had already reported record October results. Chrysler on Friday said its sales rose 18.6 percent. Honda sales were up 8.8 percent; Toyota, up 15.7 percent, and BMW, increasing 24.8 percent. All percentage calculations are based on a daily selling rate because there were 27 selling days last month and 26 in October 1995.
Some others fared poorly. G.M. said Friday that its sales dropped 7.9 percent, with car sales falling 24 percent, while pickup trucks, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles rose 22.2 percent.
Wall Street analysts said the October sales figures only partly reflected G.M.'s recent labor troubles: the full effect of a three-week strike in Canada and of local strikes at two important factories in the United States, they indicated, was likely to be felt in November and December.

GRAPHIC: Photos: ILLINOIS -- Richard J. Durbin, a liberal Democrat, held the Senate seat that had belonged to his mentor, Senator Paul Simon, for two terms. He defeated former State Representative Al Salvi, a staunch conservative who had captured the Republican nomination by beating a moderate in the primary. (Associated Press)
 
VIRGINIA -- The state's Republican senior Senator, John W. Warner, won a fourth term despite a surprisingly strong effort by a little-known namesake, Mark R. Warner, a cellular telephone executive who spent $8 million of his own money. The Senator had alienated some voters, but apparently won many others over, by opposing Oliver North's Senate bid in 1994. (Associated Press)
 
TEXAS -- Senator Phil Gramm, who started the year seeking the Republican nomination for President, won a consolation prize: a third term in the Senate. He survived a challenge from an upstart Democrat, Victor Morales, a schoolteacher who had never run for statewide office. Mr. Gramm celebrated with his wife, Wendy. (Associated Press)
 
NORTH CAROLINA -- In a replay of their bitter 1990 race, the Republican Senator Jesse Helms turned back a challenge from Harvey Gantt, who would have been the first black Southern Senator since Reconstruction. Mr. Helms, long a conservative standard-bearer, won a fifth term -- six more years. (Duane Hall for The New York Times)
 
MASSACHUSETTS -- In a hard-fought race pitting two of the state's best-known politicians, the Democratic Senator John F. Kerry withstood a challenge from Gov. William F. Weld. The two held eight debates and spent $10 million on television. "What a long, strange trip this has been," the winner told supporters. Article, page B2. (Associated Press)
 
INDIANA -- Lieut. Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon held the governor's office for the Democrats, defeating Mayor Stephen Goldsmith of Indianapolis, considered a rising Republican star. Negative advertising appeared to have backfired for Mr. Goldsmith; Indiana's healthy economy helped Mr. O'Bannon. (Mary Ann Carter for The New York Times)
 
SOUTH CAROLINA -- As he has each election for the past four decades, Senator Strom Thurmond tasted victory last night, winning an eight term. By beating out Elliott S. Close, a Democrat less than half his age, the 93-year-old Senator has a chance to become the Senate's longest-serving member next May. (Associated Press)

For six weeks, the police and Manhattan prosecutors believed that Pasquale Coppola was so morbidly obsessed with his estranged wife that he might kill her. Yet in a series of missteps and miscommunications, they repeatedly allowed him to elude their grasp, culminating with Mr. Coppola's fatally shooting Helen Coppola the day after a judge had mistakenly been assured that Mr. Coppola was in jail. [B19.]
 
Pataki Vetoes Development Bill
Governor Pataki has vetoed a bill that would have shifted some of Mayor Giuliani's authority over economic development to the five borough presidents. The bill, which both houses of the Legislature passed by overwhelming margins, would have set up a state-sponsored Industrial Development Agency in each borough. [B20.]
 
CONNECTICUT
 
Putting an Accuser on Trial
Ten years after a 16-year-old girl accused Alex Kelly of rape, his lawyer said it was a lie invented by a girl from "a strict Catholic family with its prohibitions and its rules." The defense lawyer's version of the events continued a strategy of trying to put Mr. Kelly's accuser on trial. But it represented the first time in the courtroom that the defense addressed the underlying question of the case: why would a young woman invent a humiliating rape? [B17.]
 
Discord Over a Stradivarius
In 1987, Marcelle Hall returned a stolen Stradivarius to Lloyd's of London -- a violin that she said her husband told her on his deathbed he had stolen from a Carnegie Hall dressing room in 1936. While Ms. Hall, 78, said the "whole reward" of returning the violin was "to bring this beautiful instrument back to the world," she did receive a $263,000 finder's fee from Lloyd's. But Ms. Hall's stepdaughter, Sherry Altman Schoenwetter, is seeking a portion of that fee. [B18.]
 
Surgeon and Wife Are Slain
In a crime that has shaken residents of affluent West Hartford, an orthopedic surgeon and his wife were killed, apparently during a burglary at their home. The victims were identified as Dr. John Haugh, 68, and his wife, Patricia, 70. [B18.]

HEADLINE: Carl H. Pforzheimer Jr., 89, Leading Investment Banker

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Carl Howard Pforzheimer Jr., a leading New York investment banker, book collector and benefactor of medicine, education and the arts, died on Monday at his home in Stuart, Fla. He was 89 and a former resident of Purchase, N.Y., and Manhattan.
At his death, he was the senior partner in Carl H. Pforzheimer & Company, which was founded by his father in 1901 because, the son once recalled, his father was "manic about the horseless carriage" and had begun to invest in oil. The investment firm continued to concentrate on oil and gas after his death in 1957. 
 Mr. Pforzheimer Jr. also took over the work of the family's Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation, which was endowed by his parents in 1942. Among its recent beneficiaries were Mount Sinai Medical Center, Radcliffe College, Bank Street College of Education, Lincoln Center Institute, Wellesley College and Harvard University.
Mr. Pforzheimer was also a Mount Sinai trustee for more than half a century. Through the foundation, he supported innovative programs at the School of Medicine, scholarships for medical students, nursing scholarships and other programs in clinical care, medical education and scientific research.
At his father's death, he became the patriarch of a family of bibliophiles and steward of a treasure trove Mr. Pforzheimer Sr. had amassed in his huge library in Purchase. It included a Gutenberg Bible, acquired in 1923, and a wealth of early English literature.
As the library's focus shifted toward 19th-century English romantics, Mr. Pforzheimer sold the Gutenberg in 1978 to the University of Texas for a record $2.6 million.
Eight years later, H. Ross Perot acted as middleman in the sale of some 1,100 books and 250 manuscripts, dating from 1475 to 1700, from the Pforzheimer collection. Mr. Perot advanced funds to the University of Texas for that sale, which at $15 million was considered the largest sale of rare books ever. It helped finance the new scholarly interest in 19th-century works within the Pforzheimer collection.
Then in 1987, Mr. Pforzheimer and his son, Carl 3d, presented their collection to the New York Public Library. The legacy of three generations, it contains 8,000 original manuscripts and 13,000 printed volumes, including numerous journals, poems, essays, letters and sundry memorabilia of Shelley, Keats and Byron.
Mr. Pforzheimer, who was born and raised on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, graduated in 1928 from Harvard College and two years later from Harvard Business School..
He was a colonel on the United States Army General Staff in World War II and later took on a number of civic assignments. He was a member of the New York State Board of Regents from 1958 to 1978, and was vice chairman for the last three of those years. He was a past president or officer of the National Civic League, the National Association of State Boards of Education, the New York Public Library and the Economic Development Corporation of New York City.
Mr. Pforzheimer is survived by his wife of 65 years, Carol Koehler Pforzheimer; his son, a resident of Scarsdale and managing partner of Pforzheimer & Company; a daughter, Nancy P. Aranson of Manhattan; seven grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Borough Development Units Are Turned Down by Pataki

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki vetoed a bill yesterday that would have shifted some of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's authority over economic development in New York City to the five borough presidents.
The bill, which both houses of the Legislature passed by overwhelming margins, would have set up a state-sponsored Industrial Development Agency in each borough. The borough agencies would have had the power to grant millions of dollars in tax incentives and other inducements to companies to persuade them to create or retain jobs. 
 Supporters of the legislation had contended that City Hall often focuses its economic development efforts on Manhattan, neglecting to nurture companies in the other boroughs. They said job-creation agencies run by the borough presidents would better serve the other boroughs.
Mr. Giuliani had fought the bill, arguing that it would lead to competition among the boroughs that would cost the city money. He had also said the borough president should not be allowed to grant incentives like tax cuts because the presidents do not have responsibility for the impact of those reductions on the city budget -- the Mayor and the City Council do.
There is already a citywide Industrial Development Agency, which would have continued to operate if Mr. Pataki had signed the legislation, so the city would have had six such agencies.
Since 1974, the citywide agency has assisted local companies in more than 750 projects through the issuing of $5 billion in bonds, officials said. That has helped retain 140,000 jobs, they said.
Under the bill, the Mayor would have had veto power over deals made by the borough development agencies, but only after a final agreement had been reached. Giuliani administration officials had said that it might be difficult for the Mayor to reject agreements after they had been negotiated because that might anger the companies involved.
Mr. Pataki vetoed a related bill last year that would have established a separate Industrial Development Agency only in the Bronx. He said in a statement accompanying the veto yesterday that the legislation passed this year would have undermined the Mayor's control over job creation.
"This bill, if approved, would inevitably trigger competition among the boroughs for certain economic development projects," the Governor said, "and thus place the Mayor, through his approval or veto power, in the untenable position of having to choose among the boroughs."
"A bidding war for projects could escalate the size of the tax exemption packages to the detriment of the city's and the state's budgets."
Charles Millard, a top Giuliani aide who is president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, praised the Governor.
"We are very grateful," Mr. Millard said. "It was a stupid bill, but it had a lot of political support. It would have Balkanized economic development in New York City. Economic development in one city has to have a citywide strategy."
Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, a Bronx Democrat who sponsored the bill, attacked the veto, saying that the Governor now had an obligation to present alternative legislation for reviving the economies of areas like the Bronx. Mr. Ramirez said he would introduce the bill again when the Legislature returned in January.
"It is unfortunate that the Governor obviously made a political decision and ignored the merits of what was a meritorious idea for bringing capital into poor communities," he said. "I have a very strong suspicion that the Republican Mayor and the Republican Governor are not interested in the communities that I represent, and that is a shame."

HEADLINE: Brewery's Exit Leaves a Bitter Taste

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, Nov. 1

 BODY:
The breweries that made Milwaukee fa mous Schlitz, Pabst and Miller -- were a source of good jobs and civic pride for generations and became as much a part of this city's image and soul as the winds howling off Lake Michigan.
In the glory days, Detroit made cars; Milwaukee made beer. Beer money sent the worker's children to college and their parents across the sea to visit the old country. Women met their husbands in the massive plants, and the family toasted their good fortune and sometimes their bad luck with a six-pack or two of the company brew. Fathers and sons and daughters worked side by side and then went to the ball park on summer nights to cheer the hometown team, the Milwaukee Brewers. 
 But those days are almost completely dead. Schlitz closed in 1982 and now Pabst, the granddaddy of the city's once mighty breweries and one of the oldest businesses in Wisconsin, is shutting down its Milwaukee operations by the end of the year, leaving 250 people without jobs.
Miller is now the last survivor of the major Milwaukee beer makers, the last direct survivor of a way of life that began here in the 1840's when German immigrants first began brewing a sweet taste of home.
Today, the taste of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer is as bitter as betrayal.
"They just didn't kill a bunch of jobs for brewery workers," said Wayne Watkins, who has worked at Pabst for 28 of his 51 years. "They killed a family."
The announced shutdown of Pabst after 152 years has set off a firestorm of protest by unions, politicians and Pabst drinkers far beyond the economic impact the death of the plant will have on Milwaukee.
Beer has not been a major fuel of the local economy for a long time. In the 1960's there were thousands of brewery workers in the union. Today there are only about a thousand. Still, beer making has continued to be a powerful symbol of the city's blue-collar roots and its identity as Brew Town U.S.A. or, as the more worldly sometimes called Milwaukee, the American Munich.
The Pabst Brewing Company, saying that the plant here had not turned a profit in several years, announced the closing last month. The beer will be produced instead at the Stroh Brewery Company's plant in La Crosse, Wis.
Gary Lewitzke, a spokesman for Pabst, said shutting down the plant was a difficult decision because of the workers and because of what the brewery has meant to Milwaukee.
"It was very, very tough," he said. "But a company can't print money. Survival is paramount."
Pabst left open the possibility that the plant could be reopened when the contract with Stroh's expires in 1998.
"The brewery isn't necessarily closed for good," Mr. Lewitzke said. "We'll take another look at the situation when the contract expires."
Jim Robinson, an official with Local 9 of the Brewery Workers Union, said, "I believe that like I believe I own the Brooklyn Bridge."
The union has filed an unfair labor practices complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, charging that Pabst failed to negotiate in good faith before deciding to lay off workers and move out of town. A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 12.
The union is trying to block Pabst from cutting off medical benefits to about 700 retired union members, but has lost an early round in court.
"I've looked at insurance and everybody wants $800 a month," said Frank Peritz, 58, who, after 32 years at Pabst, retired last May largely because he was diagnosed with colon cancer. "I just can't afford that. That's half my pension."
Now there is talk of a national boycott of Pabst products. Taverns across the city and suburbs have stopped selling Pabst and many have held Pabst dumping parties, an idea that would have been nearly sacrilegious a few years ago.
Anthony Zielinski, a Milwaukee County Supervisor, introduced a resolution seeking to ban the sale of Pabst in buildings owned and operated by the county.
For workers like David Lipske, who put in 34 years at Pabst, and Tom O'Brien, who has been with the company for 29 years, the shutdown is a personal tragedy. "I don't have any skills," said Mr. O'Brien, 51. "I'm just a brewery worker. That's what I did all my life."
For the city itself, the closing of Pabst "is the end of an era," said Maggie Jacobus of the Greater Milwaukee Convention and Visitors Bureau. Even though microbreweries are popping up all over the city and there are still plenty of beer drinkers, Ms. Jacobus said, "beer is a great piece of our heritage and Pabst has been such a landmark, and now an outsider is taking it away."
In 1985 a California company, the S & P Company, bought Pabst and, according to John Gurda, a local historian and author of several books on Milwaukee, did little to promote the beer in the highly competitive market.
"There's a sadness that a business that had been so central to Milwaukee is dead for all practical purposes," Mr. Gurda said. "It's certainly unwelcome but not unexpected news. Everyone knew the patient was very sick and the doctor was incompetent."
Mr. Lewitzke, the Pabst spokesman, said the company had continued to advertise, but could not compete with the advertising budget of the Miller Brewing Company, which is owned by Philip Morris.
Mr. Watkins, the Pabst worker, joined a group of fellow workers at the union hall the other day. Like so many beer workers in Milwaukee, Mr. Watkins's father worked for a brewery, and so did his uncle. His uncle was in his mid-40's when his brewery, Schlitz, shut down. His personal finances deteriorated; his marriage failed.
"He never recovered," Mr. Watkins said. "Some people don't come back from it. I bet before this is all over there'll be a suicide, divorces, houses lost."
Mr. Watkins said he could become a casualty himself. For the last year, anticipating the end of Pabst, he has been looking for a new job. He said he had 16 job interviews and 16 rejections. Now he is uncertain how he will make his mortgage payments on a house he built five years ago.
Still, the hardest day of his job, he said, fighting back tears, "was when I walked into a tavern and for the first time in my life not ordering a product with a PBR label on it."
For 30 years a Pabst sign has hung outside Danny Lynch's bar in West Allis, a Milwaukee suburb. In a few days that sign is coming down, said Joe Lynch, who, along with his brother, Jim, runs the bar for their father. Until then, the brothers have taped a red slash through the heart of the word "Pabst."
"It's very hostile around here with Pabst right now," Joe Lynch said as he served the lunchtime crowd pizza and Miller. "Everybody seems real united against Pabst. Now, it's just a matter of finding out what they want to drink."
In the old days, most people who came in drank Pabst. But recently, Mr. Lynch went around to his customers to find out what kind of beer they wanted instead. Some said Coors or Bud and one man asked for Corona Lite. Mr. Lynch did not mean to laugh in the man's face, but he could not help it. "Buddy," he said, "this is still Milwaukee."

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: THE NATION -- THE DECISIONS;
For Ohio Republicans, Shifting Allegiance Was Hard; for Some, Too Hard

SERIES: AN AMERICAN PLACE: The Day for Decisions

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: CANTON, Ohio, Nov. 5

 BODY:
When it was all said and done, Sally Efremoff, 57, a family court magistrate and longtime suburban school board member, walked into her polling place, Trinity United Church of Christ in Plain Township, and cast her first vote ever for the Democrat for President.
"I considered not voting for President," she said. "I kept going back and forth, I talked about it more than I ever have in my life -- I even was discussing it with my dentist. But in the end there were issues that were too important." She was upset with Bob Dole's positions against abortion and for school vouchers. 
 On the other hand, her friend Nancy McPeek, an assistant vice president at Bank One and a lifelong Republican, who agrees with Ms. Efremoff on abortion and vouchers, sat on the fence for months and then walked into her polling place at Holy Cross Lutheran Church in Plain and voted for Mr. Dole today. "I could listen to Dole and not hear these things I disagreed with, so it was easier," she said. "Clinton, I just didn't trust."
The two friends were the story of the election here tonight. In the end, many Republicans like Mrs. McPeek, who were undecided for months, returned to their party's Presidential candidate, but not enough to offset the swing vote for President Clinton. With over half the precincts counted, Mr. Clinton led in Stark with 46 percent to 38 for Dole, and 14 percent for Ross Perot.
People seemed to have lost the anger of 1994. Every single incumbent in the local races, from clerk to appeals court judge, won. Only the tax levy to keep the public bus system running lost.
Representative Ralph Regula, a Republican, could see it coming this morning, as he fed the horses and cattle on his farm. "I personally think Clinton will win, but not by as much as the polls have been showing," said Mr. Regula, who was easily re-elected to his 13th term.
Nancy Levengood seemed to be leaning toward Mr. Clinton in August as she presided over the best pie contest at the county fair. But today, she just could not bring herself to do it and returned to the Republicans. "I'm just worried about all these things that could happen if Clinton were elected again," she said.
Lucy Smith, a secretary and Republican voter, was greatly affected when she lost her job in a bank buyout last year and for months the anger she felt was pushing her toward voting for Mr. Clinton. But more recently, she found a higher-paying job as a school secretary, and on Monday night at 10, she decided she would vote for Mr. Dole this morning at 7:30. "I have the feeling that voting for Clinton would be giving a stamp of approval for the kind of person he is," she said.
It was in swing sections of the county, like Perry and Plain Townships, that it was easiest to find people who voted Republican for President in 1992 switching to Mr. Clinton. Casting his vote among Porsches and Grand Cherokees at Plain precinct 29 -- the rear showroom of Kempthorn Motors -- Maxion Leeper, an assistant manager for a Speedy Foods convenience store, went for the Democrat for President for the first time in his memory.
And at the Grange Hall and First Christian Church polling places in Perry, a blue-collar, Reagan Democrat area, Larry Smith, the local school board president, as well as Sandra Eash, Jack Kraus and his wife, Rusty, all voted for Mr. Clinton today though they supported the Republican Presidents in the 1980's. "I didn't like that Dole is against Medicare and education," Mrs. Eash said. "I have a young child and have to worry about the future a little bit."
"Dole's too old," Mr. Kraus said. "We don't need a President who will fall asleep at meetings."
And Mr. Smith, who voted Bush in 1992, did not like Mr. Dole's repeated criticism of teachers' unions.
Shortly after the polls opened at 6:30 A.M., W. R. Timken Jr., the fourth-generation Timken to run the steel and bearing company here, arrived at the tiny village hall in the upper-class suburb of Hills and Dales.
"Good morning, Mr. Timken," said Rose Graybell, a poll worker.
Afterward, a reporter asked how he voted. "All R's, all R's as usual," he said, adding that he expected Mr. Dole to win. His company has been experiencing record profits the last two years and Democrats here have cited it as a symbol of a robust economy under President Clinton.
"Bill Clinton and the Government are not running my company," Mr. Timken said, "The associates of the Timken Company are the ones responsible for its success. The idea that Presidents have that kind of influence over the economy is pure baloney." After voting, he headed downtown. "We have a lot of work to do down at the company," he said.
As he arrived, Ron Stokes, president of the 4,200-member steelworkers union local at Timken, one of the nation's largest, and two other officers, were at the Harrison Avenue gate for shift change, handing out campaign literature endorsing President Clinton. While many of the rank and file interviewed supported Mr. Clinton -- Charles Becker ("I'm a Democrat"), Sam Ward ("the economy's going good"), John Guilliouma ("he's for the working man") and Tim Shirey ("he stands for the same thing I do,"); there were a significant number of Dole supporters, too, including, Jerry Olson ("I like his whole story"), Louis Vinson ("taxes are killing us") and Roger Fout ("I'm anti-abortion.")
In 1992, Jim Repace, president of the 2,000-member electrical workers' local at the Hoover Company voted for Ross Perot, but switched to Mr. Clinton this time, and was handing out A.F.L.-C.I.O. literature at the factory gates.
Still, it was clear that Mr. Perot also cut into the President's margin here, which had been 23 points, according to a poll by The New York Times and the Ohio State University survey center taken two weeks before the election.
Jeannie Strittmatter, a floral designer who had voted for Mr. Perot in 1992, had planned to vote Mr. Clinton today, but switched back to Mr. Perot when she realized that he would do better than originally expected here.
During the last week, Bob Craven, head of the small Christian Coalition chapter here, distributed 40,000 voters' guides with his wife and a half-dozen members. His first stop on Thursday was a testament to the Coalition's organizational skill.
Mr. Craven lives a two-minute drive from the Firestone Road Baptist Church, but had no idea its members were interested in his group until he received a printout from the Coalition headquarters in Virginia. The Firestone pastor had sent a request to Virginia, which in turn reported the information to Mr. Craven and sent extra voters guides.
As Mr. Craven walked into the church, he handed a secretary a packet of guides and said: "This is a nice church. I didn't even know you were here."
The Rev. Joel Cochran, of the Chapel in Marlboro, a fast-growing evangelical church, got his guides from Mr. Craven on Thursday and left them out for interested members on Sunday. Mr. Cochran voted for Mr. Dole, and said there had not been much talk of the election around church. He estimates two-thirds of his 900 members voted Dole.
Jennifer Hubbell, a Republican and mother of three who was impressed with the Chapel and considered joining, but decided not to because it was too fundamentalist for her, voted for Mr. Clinton today, in part because she agrees with his position on abortion.
Michael Hanke, editor of The Repository, which last week endorsed a Democrat for President for only the second time in 181 years, voted at the Free Methodist Church in Jackson, but would not say for whom.
This afternoon, in downtown Canton, Lynn Hamilton, a vice president for Key Trust Company and a lifelong Republican, studied the stock market for hints of how the election might turn. In 1980, Jimmy Carter had led in the polls, but on Election Day, when Mr. Hamilton checked, he noticed defense stocks were way up. "That told me investors believed Reagan would win," he said.
Today the Dow was up 39 points, and Mr. Hamilton felt investors were confident the status quo would continue, the Republicans would keep control of Congress and though Mr. Clinton might win, it would not be a sizable enough victory to give him a mandate. "I also noticed that tobacco stocks were up, and took that as an indication that investors didn't feel too threatened by Clinton," he said. "It's reassuring."
 
An American Place
Living midway between Democratic Cleveland and Republican Columbus, the citizens of Canton, Ohio, and surrounding Stark County have a history of voting for the winning Presidential candidate. This is the 36th article in a yearlong series that seeks to explore the forces shaping the political debate at the grass roots.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Has 7-Hour Heart Surgery And Doctors Say It Was a Success

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Wednesday, Nov. 6

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin came out of a seven-hour, multiple-bypass heart operation in a hospital here on Tuesday with his doctors declaring the operation a success. They said they were optimistic about the 65-year-old Russian leader's chances of resuming a full workload.
At a news conference in the hospital an hour after the operation, the doctors said the surgery went without a hitch. Mr. Yeltsin's heart was stopped for 68 minutes during one phase of the operation. 
 Mr. Yeltsin signed a decree this morning reassuming his presidential powers, the Kremlin said. Sergei Yastrzhembsky, his press spokesman, said the President signed the document at 6 A.M. (10 P.M. Tuesday, Eastern time), 23 hours after he had delegated the powers to Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin on Tuesday morning, minutes before undergoing anesthesia..
In the operation, surgeons sewed five grafts to restore blood flow to coronary arteries. They had become constricted by the fatty deposits of atherosclerosis that had built up over a period of years and deprived the organ of vital nourishment, leading to two heart attacks.
Even if all goes well for Mr. Yeltsin, it may yet be months before he can run the country again. And when he does return to the Kremlin, many find it hard to imagine that he will be the same forceful leader who has for five years driven Russia away from Communism and toward a market economy. [News analysis, page A12.]
On Tuesday, Mr. Yeltsin was reported in stable condition in an intensive care unit, where he remained connected to an artificial respirator used during the operation. He opened his eyes early Tuesday evening but had not fully awakened from the anesthesia. Patients usually awaken from 6 to 18 hours after such surgery.
Mr. Yastrzhembsky said today that the President felt better than his doctors had expected. "He surprises doctors with his good state," the press secretary said. "He feels quite well for this stage."
 Mr. Yeltsin still faces certain potential risks like bleeding, infection and kidney failure as he enters a critical phase the next several days. Other possible complications after such surgery include neurological damage, like a stroke, or memory loss that may not become apparent until later.
But Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, the American heart surgery pioneer who consulted in Mr. Yeltsin's case and observed the operation, called it "a complete success."
"President Yeltsin will be able to return to his office and carry out his duties in normal fashion," said Dr. DeBakey, 88, of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
Dr. Renat S. Akchurin, 50, the surgeon who headed the team, said Mr. Yeltsin's heart muscle was now getting enough blood to function normally. The doctor's face and voice reflected exhaustion from performing the operation.
With the advent of managed care in the United States, many patients now leave the hospital four or five days after undergoing bypass operations. But hospital stays in Russia are generally much longer. And experience suggests that a few months will pass before Mr. Yeltsin feels fully recovered from the surgery.
Nevertheless, the favorable comments from the surgeons are likely to ease tension about Mr. Yeltsin's health just as Dr. DeBakey's comments did at a news conference here six weeks ago after he examined Mr. Yeltsin. At that time, Dr. DeBakey said that Mr. Yeltsin had a condition known as a "stunned myocardium" and that it would take 6 to 10 weeks for Mr. Yeltsin's heart to improve function and for several other medical problems to clear up before he could undergo the bypass operation with minimum risk.
Ever since Mr. Yeltsin announced on Sept. 5 that he needed heart surgery, the Kremlin had been combating rumors that he could never serve out his term, which ends in 2000. That created an enormous power struggle in the Kremlin.
A number of doctors not connected with Mr. Yeltsin's case criticized Dr. DeBakey for delaying the surgery. But Dr. DeBakey said their criticisms were unfounded. Mr. Yeltsin's aides contributed to the problem by saying he had liver and kidney failure. But tests showed that he did not have those conditions, Dr. DeBakey said in September.
Dr. DeBakey said in an interview on Tuesday that "everything went beautifully." The apparent success of Mr. Yeltsin's operation "vindicated my position a little over a month ago when there was doom and gloom all over the place," Dr. DeBakey said.
As further evidence, Dr. DeBakey said that a measure of heart function known as the ejection fraction rose to 40 percent just before the surgery from 20 percent in September. The ejection fraction is the amount of blood the heart expels with each beat -- usually about 65 percent of the blood in the heart's main chamber.
A dietary regimen imposed in September lowered Mr. Yeltsin's cholesterol level from 350 then to 187 on Monday, Dr. DeBakey said. A cholesterol level less than 200 is considered desirable. Controlling cholesterol now may prevent recurrences in the grafts that were placed on Tuesday. And the true test of the success of a bypass operation is how many years the grafts stay open.
There was heavy security at the Cardiology Research Center, where the operation was done. The center is named for Dr. Yevgeny I. Chazov, who pioneered in the modern clot dissolving techniques used to stop heart attacks in progress. Such therapy was used to stop a heart attack in Mr. Yeltsin last summer.
Dr. Akchurin carried out the operation like a standard bypass, except for the security and visiting experts, including two German surgeons who were observing, Dr. Axel Haverich and Dr. Thorsten Wahlers, both of Hanover Medical School.
Also at the hospital were Mr. Yeltsin's wife, Naina, and daughter Tatyana Dyachenko, Mr. Chernomyrdin and Anatoly B. Chubais, the Kremlin chief of staff.
After slicing the skin over Mr. Yeltsin's upper chest, Dr. Akchurin's team split his breastbone, or sternum, with a saw. Then they used a metal retractor to lift the rib cage while Dr. Akchurin removed an internal mammary artery from Mr. Yeltsin's chest. Meanwhile, other surgeons removed a vein known as the saphenous from his leg.
As they continued, the surgeons fashioned the arteries and veins to construct five grafts to revamp the blood supply to Mr. Yeltsin's heart completely, Dr. DeBakey said.
Dr. DeBakey said the surgeons sewed an internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery on Mr. Yeltsin's heart. They also made four grafts from the leg vein. Two were used to bypass blockages in the obtuse artery, the third for the right coronary artery and the fourth for the diagonal artery.
Until the circulation was repaired, the left side arteries on Mr. Yeltsin's heart were nourishing that side and much of the right side.
Stopping a heart for 68 minutes during a bypass operation is "not unusually long" for such a procedure, Dr. DeBakey said. Blood is pumped through a heart-lung machine during that period.
Dr. O. Wayne Isom, chief of heart surgery at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in New York City, who is not connected to Mr. Yeltsin's case, agreed. It usually takes surgeons from 7 to 15 minutes to sew each graft and the variation depends on anatomical factors, Dr. Isom said in a telephone interview from New York on Tuesday.
Dr. Akchurin's technique differs from that of most American surgeons, who wear jeweler type loupes while performing bypass operations. Before Dr. Akchurin became a heart surgeon he repaired severed digits and limbs by using microsurgical techniques and by looking through an operating microscope suspended from overhead. Dr. Akchurin has continued using such a microscope in sewing grafts in heart vessels.
During the operation, Dr. Akchurin said he "tried to forget that this is the President and imagine this is a normal ordinary patient that we are operating on."
When Dr. Akchurin's team had finished sewing the grafts and was ready to get Mr. Yeltsin's heart to beat again, it "came back right away," Dr. DeBakey said.
"That's always a very good sign that heart function is good, and I think he is going to really get a good result and be able to go back to his normal duties," Dr. DeBakey said in the interview.
In addition to his recent intestinal bleeding, Mr. Yeltsin bled from a stomach ulcer several years ago, Dr. DeBakey said.
Because of the past problems of bleeding, Dr. Akchurin's team asked Dr. DeBakey to bring experts in hematology and transfusion medicine from Houston to consult in Mr. Yeltsin's case.
So before Dr. Akchurin sewed up Mr. Yeltsin's breastbone and skin, he took extra time to observe the areas where he had placed stitches to make sure there was no bleeding from them. There was none.
"The risk of bleeding now is very remote," Dr. DeBakey said. "The odds are in Mr. Yeltsin's favor now."

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: THE PRESIDENCY -- LOOKING AHEAD;
The Second Term: Promise and Peril

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

 BODY:
Four years ago Bill Clinton won the Presidency with an outsized agenda and an underwhelming mandate, and the gulf between the two left him struggling in the first half of his term simply to establish his legitimacy. By the midpoint, the President had been reduced to proclaiming his own relevance.
Last night Mr. Clinton won re-election with a larger margin but with a manifesto both smaller and less clear. And if the promise of achievement glistens, potential pitfalls abound, from the ancient feuds of Bosnia to the paper chase of special prosecutors at home. 
 Campaigning in El Paso last week, Mr. Clinton declared, "This is an election of enormous moment, with great consequences." But for more than a year the President has steadily strived to blur the traditional divisions of American ideology in a politics of pointillism, at once capturing the electorate's vital center and renewing questions about his own.
In this President's effusive view, it is possible to both balance the budget and provide new tax breaks for college education, to force families off welfare and find new jobs for them, to expand the Federal role in everything from encouraging school uniforms to deterring violence on television -- all the while declaring that "the era of big government is over."
Surveys of voters leaving the polls yesterday showed that 6 in 10 did not believe he could cut the deficit and pay for his programs at the same time, and that a like number did not believe that their President was either honest or trustworthy. He and his wife, Hillary, face a raft of pending or continuing investigations into their financial and ethical conduct and their party's fund-raising practices. Still, nearly half those surveyed said they were either optimistic or excited about a second term.
"This is not about liberal or conservative," Mr. Clinton told a rally in Little Rock, Ark. last weekend, in one of the most pointed formulations of an argument he made in the last weeks of the campaign, citing Republican and Democratic predecessors alike as his heroes. "We have run by far the most fiscally conservative Government, and we've done more to stand against crime, and we've stuck up for this country in having a strong foreign policy. I think the record will stand on its own.
"This is about whether you're going to be diverted and divided," Mr. Clinton continued, "or whether we're going to find common ground and build that bridge to the 21st century together."
To that end, one of the closest Presidential advisers says, he expects Mr. Clinton to demand the resignations of all his Cabinet secretaries and accept some of them, to name a prominent Republican to at least one major Cabinet post, to put a premium on bipartisanship in dealing with a narrowly divided Congress and to expand his peacemaking efforts in hot spots from Ireland to the Middle East.
"I don't buy this notion at all that it's a small agenda," said George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's senior adviser. "If you balance the budget and make welfare work and put 100,000 cops on the street and cut the deficit in half, I defy anyone to say that's minimalist."
Still, the President sounds a less certain trumpet for a second term than he did for the first. In 1992, Mr. Clinton vowed to guarantee health care for all Americans, "end welfare as we know it," overhaul education, reduce the size of the Government and reform the campaign finance laws.
After mixed success, at least one stunning failure (health care) and one heavily compromised promise kept (welfare), his goals are far more modest: to preserve the essence of the Democratic social safety net and expand it at the margins, by extending health insurance to children and the unemployed and by offering new tax credits and deductions for college education, a volunteer literacy program for elementary-school students and a public-private effort to connect every classroom in the country to the Internet.
Indeed, Mr. Clinton has already backed so far away from the biggest ambitions that attended his first election that his aides long ago took to describing his first four years as two terms: first the halting missteps through controversies from homosexuals in the military to health care, and then the battles with the Republican-controlled Congress that let him reposition himself as a moderate standing firm against extremes.
That juxtaposition of expansive impulses and accommodationist tactics has been the hallmark of Mr. Clinton's career ever since he was turned out of office after one term as Governor of Arkansas by voters who thought he had overreached, only to win re-election two years later as a chastened, scaled-down centrist.
Once again Mr. Clinton has a chance for a fresh start, and his capacity for adjustment has repeatedly helped him turn weaknesses into strengths and setbacks into progress, in a perpetual campaign in which winning is all.
The tantalizing difference is that for the first time in his life, Mr. Clinton will be running no longer for re-election but instead for his place in the history books he loves to read.
In their more exhausted moments, Mr. Clinton's own longest-serving aides sometimes wonder aloud what he stands for besides winning, and they assume the world will finally find out.
Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history and director of the Eisenhower Center at the University of New Orleans, said, "One of the fascinating things about Clinton is that if he had not won a second term, he would have gone down as a totally forgettable character, with no accomplishments that you could put under glass in a Presidential library."
But, Professor Brinkley said, Mr. Clinton's "basic competence," coupled with a second, stronger victory, "makes him an interesting historical character."
"He really is a work in progress," the professor said, "and the fair question the public is entitled to ask is, What will he be?"
 
The Goals
 
Health and Welfare, Jobs and Education
Mr. Clinton's advisers suggest that the answer is plain enough, apparent in the President's own words and actions of recent months. And indeed 6 in 10 voters surveyed in the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, up from 49 percent in September, said Mr. Clinton had made clear what he wanted to accomplish in the next four years.
"I think the President's agenda is clear," said Bruce Reed, a senior domestic policy adviser who has toiled, at times in near solitude, for nearly a year now to help chart it. "Finish the job of balancing the budget, take on the challenge of reforming education and expanding college opportunity, move people from welfare to work and help families get ready for the 21st century by making sure that they have access to quality health care as well as the tools to raise their children the way they want."
Mr. Reed, who was one of the President's earliest moderate advisers in the 1992 campaign and whose star rose as Mr. Clinton tacked to the right during the first term, added: "All of those are big, difficult challenges. They don't necessarily involve big programs, but will require a lot of hard work, in Washington and across the country."
White House aides explain the President's emphasis on modest initiatives that once might have seemed beneath Presidential notice -- like encouraging the telecommunications industry to provide cellular telephones to neighborhood watch groups -- by saying their public opinion surveys show that voters no longer much trust the Government to do big things.
At the same time, Mr. Clinton's own initial decision to reduce the deficit, and his subsequent pledge to balance the Federal budget by the year 2002 as the Republicans demanded, have insured that fiscal resources will be tight for the foreseeable future.
Dick Morris, the political strategist and pollster who helped the President recover from the despair of the 1994 midterm elections by re-emphasizing the moderate themes that had always animated Mr. Clinton, contended last spring that many of the nation's most pressing problems were behavioral, not programmatic. Mr. Morris, who was forced to resign in a sex scandal on the day Mr. Clinton was renominated this summer, argued that Government programs could not make much headway on issues like values and families, for example, but that the bully pulpit could.
Aides say nothing else so convinced Mr. Clinton of the dangers of overreaching as the collapse of the health care legislation drafted under the supervision of his wife. And nothing else so convinced him of the power of his own office -- and of Presidential oratory -- as the public's positive response to his reassuring demeanor in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing and, eventually, to his initially unpopular decision to send American troops to enforce a tenuous peace in Bosnia.
Accordingly, aides say, Mr. Clinton came to realize that in the White House, symbolism is often substance, and that being seen as effective is as important as being effective.
 
Unfinished Business
How He'll Address 3 Thorny Problems
Much of Mr. Clinton's agenda centers on addressing problems left unsolved in his first term, from making further incremental stabs at extending access to health insurance to mitigating the harshest aspects of the welfare overhaul, which he signed to keep the Republicans from using it as a campaign issue against him.
The new Congress will be narrowly divided, however, and Mr. Clinton will have to find a way to use Republicans not only as an electoral foil, as he did successfully in the second half of his first term, but also, if he wants to leave a legislative record, as genuine partners in compromise. No one expects that to be easy.
The biggest problems of the coming decades -- how to keep Medicare and Social Security solvent in the face of the demands that Mr. Clinton's baby-boomer generation will place upon them -- remained almost entirely unaddressed during this campaign. Aides say Mr. Clinton is all but certain to favor naming blue-ribbon commissions to confront those problems.
Likewise, his aides expect a commission to address how to overhaul the campaign finance laws. Mr. Clinton pledged in 1992 to change those laws, but never seriously tried to. Instead, he raised record amounts of so-called soft money to help the Democratic Party skirt existing limits on contributions to individual candidates.
Mr. Clinton seldom exudes more enthusiasm on the stump than when he talks about the difference that education made in his life, and advisers insist that his election-year goal of offering a $1,500 tax credit to help make at least two years of college as nearly universal as four years of high school is already more than a politically popular offering, rather something like his bid for a legacy.
"Then, the big, big megillah's going to be his peacemaking stuff," Mr. Stephanopoulos said.
For much of his first term, Mr. Clinton seemed to shy from foreign policy, in part because he had been elected on so big a domestic agenda.
But increasingly, aides say, he has come to feel more comfortable on the world stage, one of the few areas where any President has the latitude to act with unilateral authority, and more certain that he has a role to play there.
Here too, though, there are problems.
Just one year ago Mr. Clinton promised that American troops would be in Bosnia only about a year. As the deadline approaches, the Administration has yet to acknowledge the virtual certainty that many will have to stay a good while longer.
Though his efforts to intercede in places like Northern Ireland and the Middle East have so far produced mixed results, his advisers expect him to intensify his efforts, much as Ronald Reagan pursued glasnost with the Soviet Union in search of his own legacy.
Expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include the former Soviet satellites of Eastern Europe will also be at the top of Mr. Clinton's foreign policy program, as he pursues the concept that his national security adviser, Anthony Lake, once dubbed "democratic enlargement."
 
The Risks
 
So Many Inquiries, So Much Peril
The history of second terms is replete with disasters, from Franklin D. Roosevelt's court-packing fight to Richard M. Nixon's Watergate scandal to Ronald Reagan's Iran-contra affair. Reminded of that, Mr. Stephanopoulos just laughed heartily and said the Clinton Administration got its problems "out of the way in the first term."
Still, dangers lurk for Mr. Clinton, from the prospect of turmoil in staff turnover to continued Congressional and criminal investigations into questions arising from the first term, or well before: Whitewater, the travel office dismissals, the gathering of F.B.I. files on prominent Republicans, and the Democratic Party's fund-raising relationships with foreign donors.
Already, for example, Attorney General Janet Reno has begun a preliminary review toward determining whether to seek appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the fund-raising questions. That could complicate any decision by Mr. Clinton to replace Ms. Reno, or to appoint someone with a highly political background, like Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, to succeed her.
Many of the President's senior aides, including Mr. Stephanopoulos and the chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, have made no secret of their intention to leave the Administration, and one senior aide said Mr. Clinton hoped to name a successor to Mr. Panetta before leaving on vacation and a trip to Asia next week. If he does not do so by then, this aide warned, that will be a sign of disputes within the inner circle over what to do, and thus of potential trouble ahead.
Vice President Al Gore, whose Presidential aspirations for 2000 are already plain, will be thrust into an even higher role than he has so far played, and with that will come more potential for conflict with his boss. Mr. Gore could well be torn between wanting Mr. Clinton to leave a strong record for him to run on, and wanting the President to avoid getting involved in policy compromises with Congress that could complicate Mr. Gore's efforts to win the Democratic nomination in a primary fight.
At the same time, the First Lady's role in a second term remains cloudy. On the campaign trail at Labor Day, she joked that in a second term, she might get the last laugh.
But Mrs. Clinton is at the center of most of the legal investigations still swirling around the Administration, and no one at the White House expects her to take a formal policy role, though the President has suggested that she might get involved in implementing welfare overhaul.
"She'll travel," one aide said, "and she'll keep up her interest in children and families. But she can never again be seen as having an overt, official job, and she knows it."
 
Legacy
 
Just How Close Does Greatness Lie?
As for Mr. Clinton himself, his aides agree that he has finally settled into the Presidency. The black rages that used to punctuate his workdays are "less frequent," in the words of one aide who bore the brunt of them, and he has more time to think, read and telephone informal advisers. Gone forever are the moments of antic informality that marked his last campaign, as when he was once asked his favorite Elvis Presley movie and replied enthusiastically with a straight face, " 'Viva, Las Vegas!' "
Though his once-salt-and-pepper hair is now almost completely silver, Mr. Clinton remains a young man, and on leaving the Presidency at 54 could still expect to live another 30 years. He might have not only the next term but a long lifetime to burnish his legacy.
"In the world that we live in now," Mr. Stephanopoulos said, "his presence will extend beyond his Presidency, because of the global village and the power of celebrity, among other things."
None of his aides really expect Mr. Clinton to go home and run for mayor or the school board, as he sometimes jokes, but they fully expect that he will be waging one campaign or another, with his Presidential library or a nonprofit foundation as a base.
By his own lights, Mr. Clinton's has been a transitional Presidency in a transitional time, the sole two-term Democratic island in the late-20th-century sea of Republican dominance of the office.
Indeed, that alone might be his principal legacy: that he managed to reshape the old New Deal coalition of liberals and labor into a new alliance of suburbanites and service workers, enough to drag his fractious party into a new century at least tenuously united.
In the end, Mr. Clinton's Presidency remains intriguing precisely because he is perpetually recalibrating it.
"One of the things that make Clinton exciting is the unpredictable nature of it," said Professor Brinkley, the historian. "Clinton-watching is a sport in America because at any moment it's a tightrope act. If there's anything we've learned about the guy, it's not to underestimate him. We have not seen a politician as astute as Bill Clinton since Franklin Roosevelt, so I feel he will be able to avoid the pitfalls, and constantly work around them.
"He's not there yet," Professor Brinkley added. "But he's never dull, and he has the potential here of going down as a truly great President."

Excerpts From President Clinton's Victory Address at Arkansas Statehouse

 BODY:
Following are excerpts of a transcript of the speech President Clinton delivered last night outside the Statehouse in Little Rock, Ark., after his re-election:
Thank you. My fellow Americans, thank you for being here. 
Just four years from now, we will enter a new century of great challenge and unlimited possibility. Now, we've got a bridge to build, and I'm ready if you are.
Today the American people have spoken. They have affirmed our course. They have told us to go forward. America has told every one of us -- Democrats, Republicans and independents -- loud and clear: it is time to put politics aside, join together and get the job done for America's future.
In the last four years, we've made remarkable progress. But in our schools, our families, our workplaces and our communities, our journey is not done. . . .
I would like to say a special word of thanks to Senator Dole, and I ask you join me in applause for his lifetime of service to the United States.
And I thank Jack Kemp for his service to America and his devotion to the proposition that this a country in which everyone should have a chance to live free and equal and to have a chance at success.
Let me say, and I had a good visit with Senator Dole not too long before he went out to speak. I thanked him for his love of our country, for his years of service.
I applauded the campaign that he fought so bravely to the very last minute. I thanked him for the work we did together to advance the common cause of America. And on behalf of all Americans, I wish him well and God speed.
Four years ago, on these very steps, we set forth on a journey to change the course of America for the better, to keep the American dream alive for everyone willing to work for it, to keep America the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity, to come together as one American community.
The time was one of widespread frustration and doubt about our economic and social problems, about our ability to deal with the vast sweep of change that was all around us. The scope and pace of those changes were threatening to many and our values seemed to be under attack on all sides.
But, together, you and I vowed to turn our country around, with a strategy to meet our challenges and protect our values, opportunity for all, responsibility from all, an American community of all Americans.
We have worked hard to end the politics of who's to blame and instead to ask, what are we going to do to make America better.
Tonight, we proclaim that the vital American center is alive and well. It is a common ground on which we have made our progress. Today, our economy is stronger, our streets are safer, our environment is cleaner, the world is more secure and, thank God, our nation is more united. . . .
We must make our democracy stronger by enacting real, bipartisan campaign finance reform. Talk is no longer enough. We must act and act now. And the American people will be watching the leaders of both parties to see who is willing not just to talk but to act. I am willing to act, and I ask others to join me.
And we must keep America the world's indispensable nation. Finishing the unfinished business of the cold war, meeting the new threats to our security through terrorism and the proliferation of dangerous weapons and seizing these extraordinary opportunities to extend our values of peace and democracy and prosperity.
Every American here tonight and every American within the sound of my voice can take pride in the fact that in these last few years for the first time in all of human history, a majority of the human beings living on this globe live under democracies where the people rule.
The challenges we face, they're not Democratic or Republican challenges. They're American challenges. What we know from the budget battles of the last two years and from the remarkable success of the last few weeks of this Congress is the lesson we have learned for the last 220 years -- what we have achieved as Americans of lasting good, we have achieved by working together.
So let me say to the leaders of my Democratic Party and the leaders of the Republican Party, it is time to put country ahead of party.
We do not know the final outcome of the Congressional elections but we know this: The races are close. The American people have been closely divided. The Congress, whatever happens, will be closely divided.
They are sending us a message: Work together. Meet our challenges. Put aside the politics of division and build America's community, together. . . .
What we need to do is to do the work of America, the way we seek to do the work of raising our children and doing our work and supporting our religious institutions and our community institutions.
If we would simply be Americans, the way we seek to live in all of our other roles, there is no stopping America. Our best days are still ahead.
And so, I say, when we look into our hearts and simply ask what is right for the American people and the future of our children, when we set aside our differences and build on our shared values of faith and family and work, when we roll up our sleeves and work together, America always wins. . . .
I got here tonight, my fellow Americans, because America gave me a chance. That is what all the children of America deserve. Our people have to give them the tools to give them not a guarantee, but that real chance to live up to their God-given potential.
And I ask you to join me in that commitment. Every child deserves the main chance that I was given.
And so I say again let us resolve to run our country the way we try to run our lives. Whether you are the party of Thomas Jefferson or the party of Abraham Lincoln, whether you're an independent or unaffiliated, remember that we all belong to the greatest nation in history.
To us, much has been given, and much is still expected. We must rise to the challenge of building that bridge to the 21st century. Tonight is a night for joy, not just for us here but for all Americans.
For the 53d time in our history, our people have made their quiet and deliberate decision. They have come together with their powerful voice and expressed their will.
Tonight we celebrate the miracle of America. Tomorrow we greet the dawn and begin our work anew. I am more grateful than I can say. You have given me an opportunity and a responsibility that comes to few people.
I will do my best, and together we will -- we will build that bridge to the 21st century. Thank you. Good night, and God bless America. Thank you.

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: NEW JERSEY -- THE CHOICE;
Strategy of Torricelli Painted Foe as Extreme

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
Convince New Jersey's independent, middle-class voters that Congressional Republicans endanger Federal programs they care about. Campaign relentlessly against Speaker Newt Gingrich. Portray your Republican opponent as a Gingrich ally and an extremist out of step with the state's moderate tradition.
The strategy that carried Representative Robert G. Torricelli to victory in the race for the Senate was not particularly complicated. 
 Mr. Torricelli, a Democrat, spent much of the campaign mirroring the words and tactics of President Clinton, invoking a carefully calibrated mantra: education, Medicare, the environment.
He repeatedly accused his Republican opponent, Representative Richard A. Zimmer, of having voted with Mr. Gingrich to cut the growth of Medicare, and to reduce Federal financing for programs to support education and protect the environment. Mr. Torricelli, a seven-term veteran of the House, had promised he would work to insure that those programs remained intact.
"The politics of protection," David P. Rebovich, a professor of political science at Rider University in Lawrenceville, N.J., called the Democratic strategy in New Jersey and around the country. "It resonated."
By a ratio of about 11 to 8, a majority of New Jersey's voters disapproved of what the Republicans in Congress had done in the last two years, a survey of people leaving polling places found yesterday. And of those who disapproved, more than 8 in 10 said they had voted for Mr. Torricelli.
When the voters were asked in the poll what issues mattered most to them in their vote for President, they listed the economy and jobs, taxes, Medicare and Social Security, and education.
Except for taxes, those were the issues Mr. Torricelli had emphasized during the campaign. Two-thirds of the respondents who said that Medicare mattered most to them said they had voted for Mr. Torricelli. More than three-quarters of those who said that education mattered most said they had voted for the Democrat. And two-thirds of those who listed the economy as most significant also voted for Mr. Torricelli.
"I liked what Torricelli had to say about education," said Paul DeMarse, a Paramus resident who teaches in a New York City junior high school.
Mr. DeMarse, interviewed after voting at the Parkway Elementary School in Paramus, said he was a registered Democrat. "I also thought Medicare was an important issue, and I'm fearful of what Congress wanted to do," he said.
Many of the issues that Mr. Zimmer emphasized did not appear to have served him well with voters, nor did his some of his campaign tactics.
A majority of survey respondents who said that taxes mattered most to them said they had voted for Mr. Zimmer, by a ratio of more than 2 to 1. Mr. Zimmer, who presented himself as a fiscal conservative and a social moderate, said often that he would never vote for a measure that would result in a tax increase.
Mr. Zimmer had also said that eliminating the Federal budget deficit was a paramount concern. But only about 1 in 20 voters said they considered the deficit the most important issue, and half of those said they had voted for Mr. Torricelli.
Mr. Rebovich contended that Mr. Zimmer and his advisers were aware that voters were responding to the Democrats' issues this year. Mr. Rebovich said he thought that was why they decided to make direct attacks on Mr. Torricelli's character and ethics.
"So how do we stop him?" Mr. Rebovich said, describing the Zimmer strategy. "By telling people that he's unelectable on ethical grounds."
Mr. Zimmer tried to convince voters that Mr. Torricelli's character was flawed, concentrating in television commercials on several accusations, including an accusation that Mr. Torricelli had helped the daughter of a former campaign contributor who had been indicted on charges of bank fraud and had fled the country.
Mr. Zimmer acknowledged in his concession speech last night that his effort to make the election a referendum on Mr. Torricelli's character, and not on Republican Congressional policies, had failed.
"Ultimately, this was a debate not of personalities, but of philosophies," Mr. Zimmer said. The survey of 1,752 voters, conducted by Voter News Service, also showed that several broad categories of New Jersey voters had proved critical for Mr. Torricelli. Black voters preferred him by a ratio of nearly 9 to 1. People between the ages of 45 and 59 selected Mr. Torricelli by a ratio of 3 to 2.
Not surprisingly, a large majority of those who described themselves as liberal voted for Mr. Torricelli, while most who said they were conservative voted for Mr. Zimmer.
Of those who described their political views as moderate -- half of the electorate, according to the exit poll -- Mr. Torricelli was preferred by a ratio of nearly 3 to 2.
Mr. Zimmer, apparently aware that the political winds were not blowing his way, insisted often that he too was a moderate on many issues. He noted often that several national environmental groups had given him high marks.
But voter sentiments expressed in the exit poll and in separate interviews yesterday indicated that the constant criticism of Congressional Republicans by Mr. Torricelli and other Democrats had reverberated with voters.
New Jersey voters have sometimes split their votes, selecting a Presidential candidate from one political party and a Senator from another, but this was not one of those times. Nearly 9 out of 10 of the voters who selected Mr. Clinton also voted for Mr. Torricelli, the exit poll found.
Many of Mr. Zimmer's commercials had attacked Mr. Torricelli as "foolishly liberal," a tactic that had worked in many recent elections around the country. It was not successful yesterday in New Jersey.
"People may have seen that movie too many times," said Hank Morris, a Democratic political consultant in New York City.

 BODY:

ILLINOIS -- CLINTON
President Clinton won Illinois. Dole supporters leaving the polls said that they chose their candidate particularly because they trusted him, but Clinton voters said that the President shared their vision of the future. 
 Representative Richard J. Durbin, a seven-term Congressman from the sparsely populated 20th District in southwestern Illinois, won the race to succeed Senator Paul Simon, a 67-year-old Democrat who is retiring. The national Republican Party had made Senator Simon's seat an early target, but suffered a setback when a moderate candidate with broad appeal was defeated in the state primary by Al Salvi, a wealthy conservative. Mr. Salvi campaigned vigorously for a ban on so-called "partial-birth abortions" and called for a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution.
Mr. Durbin, a former aide to Senator Simon, who strongly endorsed his protege, is best known as a crusader against tobacco interests. He had the disadvantage of being relatively unknown in heavily Democratic Chicago, and the advantage of being a popular Democrat in the fairly conservative downstate region.
The struggle to replace Mr. Durbin in the 20th District, which includes Springfield, the capital, produced a very close race between John M. Shimkus, the Republican treasurer of Madison County, and Jay C. Hoffman, a Democratic State Representative.
Representative Michael Patrick Flanagan won national fame two years ago when, at the age of 31, he beat Dan Rostenkowski, the disgraced former Ways and Means Committee chairman. But Mr. Flanagan was unable this year to hold on to the Fifth District, which covers Chicago's northwestern suburbs.
A weak fund-raising effort and the district's Democratic tradition undid Mr. Flanagan as Rod R. Blagojevich, a Democratic State Representative, won the race by a wide margin.
Republicans seemed secure in their control of the State Senate, but struggled to retain their majority in the Illinois House.

INDIANA -- DOLE
Indiana has voted for a Democratic candidate only once since 1932 -- for Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. And Bob Dole kept the streak alive, although President Clinton mounted a stronger than expected challenge for the state's 12 electoral votes.
Even with Mr. Dole's victory in one of the nation's Republican redoubts, the Democrats held on to the Governor's office, which is being vacated by Evan Bayh, a popular Democrat stepping down after the maximum of two terms.
In one of the tightest governor's races, Mr. Bayh's Lieutenant Governor, Frank L. O'Bannon, defeated Mayor Stephen Goldsmith of Indianapolis, a Republican who has a national reputation for his efforts to "reinvent government" by putting municipal services out for bids by private companies.
Mr. Goldsmith's campaign was beset with problems, including the resignation of the city's police chief after a drunken brawl by off-duty police officers. At one point, a frustrated Mr. Goldsmith blamed the Dole campaign for his travails. "My numbers are obviously repressed by Dole," he said.
In House races, the Republicans appeared to have fewer worries. In the Second District, Representative David M. McIntosh held off a challenge by Marc Carmichael, a former state legislator. But in the Eighth District, Representative John Hostettler, another freshman, faced a strong challenge from Jon Weinzapfel, a former aide to Representative Frank McCloskey, the Democrat Mr. Hostettler defeated two years ago.
Representative Lee H. Hamilton, a 16-term Democrat, prevailed in his rematch against Jean Leising, a Republican State Senator who nearly upset him in 1994.

IOWA -- CLINTON
Iowa has been friendly territory to Democratic Presidential candidates in recent elections, and this year was no exception. President Clinton captured the state's seven electoral votes in 1996, as he did four years ago.
Senator Tom Harkin, a veteran liberal populist, won re-election to a third term, beating back a strong challenge by Representative Jim Ross Lightfoot, a six-term Republican who is chairman of a House Appropriations subcommittee. In a race that seemed to tighten considerably at its end, Mr. Harkin had promoted his support for abortion rights and an increase in the minimum wage, while Mr. Lightfoot portrayed himself as a budget cutter.
Mr. Lightfoot's decision to challenge Mr. Harkin threw open his seat in the Third District, an area that encompasses many of the state's southern counties, which are largely rural. In that contest, Leonard L. Boswell, a farmer and the State Senate president, campaigned on his support for education financing, while the Republican, Mike Mahaffey, a county attorney and former state party chairman, promoted his support for a balanced budget.
But the race in the neighboring Fourth District, encompassing southwestern Iowa, drew far more national attention. A freshman Republican, Representative Greg Ganske, a plastic surgeon who upset a 36-year Democratic incumbent in 1994, won a second term, turning back a strong challenge from Connie McBurney, a well-known former television weather forecaster who is well known throughout the state. Ms. McBurney had been trying to buck history: Iowa has never sent a woman to Congress.

KANSAS -- DOLE
 As expected, the Republican Presidential nominee, Bob Dole, won his state's electoral college votes. The Senate seat he vacated stayed in the Republican column.
Mr. Dole's sudden retirement from the Senate in May to concentrate on his campaign touched off a race to fill the remaining two years of his Senate term. The Republican nominee, Sam Brownback, a House freshman, won a bitterly fought primary in August that wounded state party unity.
Despite Mr. Dole's position at the top of the ticket and the traditional Republican hold on Kansas politics, Mr. Brownback fought hard to defeat his Democratic opponent, Jill Docking. Mr. Brownback, a member of his party's conservative wing, had the support of Kansas's Christian conservative movement. He opposes abortion rights while Ms. Docking supports them.
The Brownback-Docking contest somewhat overshadowed the race to fill the full-term Senate seat vacated by Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, a retiring three-term Republican. While Kansas politics has been unpredictable this year, Pat Roberts, an eight-term Republican member of the House, won comfortably over his opponent, State Treasurer Sally Thompson.
Mr. Roberts, who gained state and national attention by pushing a major farm law revision through Congress, attacked Ms. Thompson as a relative newcomer to Kansas, in that she has lived in the state only since 1985, while his family has resided there for several generations.
With the many retirements announced this year in Kansas, both in the House and Senate, Representative Todd Tiahrt, a freshman Republican, stood the chance of becoming the state's senior House member. He faced a strong challenge from Randy Rathbun, a Democrat and a former United States Attorney. Mr. Tiahrt won in 1994 by defeating Representative Dan Glickman, a nine-term Democrat.

MICHIGAN -- CLINTON
In the state that made Reagan Democrats famous, a strong economy and low unemployment helped President Clinton keep a lead through the autumn and win the state again. Both Presidential candidates made frequent visits, but Mr. Dole had difficulty convincing voters of the need for his 15 percent tax cut at a time when the auto industry is booming and the state government is looking for ways to lure skilled workers from other states.
Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat, retained his seat, defeating Ronna Romney, a conservative Republican and former radio talk show host, according to exit polls.
Strong backing from anti-abortion groups and gun control opponents helped Mrs. Romney win the primary against a moderate Republican businessman, Jim Nicholson, but proved less useful in the general election.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. poured money into the state's many hotly contested Congressional races, and business groups responded by buying many television advertisements, too. In the days before the election, almost every advertisement during the evening news broadcasts was for some candidate. One of the most hard-fought campaigns came in the Eighth District in central Michigan, where Representative Dick Chrysler, a freshman Republican, faced Debbie Stabenow, a state legislator.
Representative John D. Dingell, the longest-serving current member of the House, benefited from generous campaign contributions and was a favorite to defeat Jim DeSana, a former Democratic Mayor of Wyandotte, a town in the district. Mr. DeSana switched parties for the race.
Representative David E. Bonior, the Democratic whip, and Representative Sander M. Levin, a senior Democrat, both had comfortable leads in October polls.
The vote count was very close on a state referendum to approve casino gambling in Detroit, which has watched for years as tourists crossed the Detroit River to the casinos of Windsor, Ontario. Detroit residents also voted on whether to approve another tax on hotels and rental cars to help the Detroit Lions football team move downtown from Pontiac, Mich. Two wealthy landowners spent more than $1 million to back an initiative limiting the hunting of bears, a practice that sometimes involves trespassing and has been criticized as inhumane, but polls showed limited public support.

MINNESOTA -- CLINTON
President Clinton's success never appeared in doubt in this traditional Democratic stronghold, now the only state to vote Democratic in the last six elections. So the Republicans focused their attention on recapturing the Senate seat held by Paul Wellstone, a Democrat embroiled in a rematch against the Republican Senator he narrowly defeated in 1990, Rudy Boschwitz.
It was one of the most competitive campaigns in the nation, and one of the nastiest, but Mr. Wellstone withstood the challenge.
Mr. Boschwitz and the National Republican Senatorial Committee produced many negative television advertisements, calling Mr. Wellstone "embarrassingly liberal."
The Senator's decision to vote against the new welfare restrictions pushed by Republicans in Congress and signed by President Clinton -- he was the only Democrat seeking re-election to do so -- fueled the attacks.
Saying that the law would only create more poverty, Mr. Wellstone, perhaps the most unabashedly liberal Senator, strongly defended his vote. He also countered with his own attacks, accusing Mr. Boschwitz of voting in the Senate against an increase in the minimum wage.
And by the end, there were signs that Mr. Boschwitz's harsh advertisements had backfired. According to one poll, 44 percent of those who saw the advertisements said they made them more likely to vote for his opponent. At the same time, Mr. Boschwitz's approval ratings sank.
In the House races, Democrats sought to hold seats they narrowly won two years ago. The most competitive race was in the First District, where the Democratic candidate, Mary Rieder, a former Republican and an economics professor, challenged a freshman Republican, Gil Gutknecht. Mr. Gut knecht was singled out by Democrats and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. as one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress.

MISSOURI
Bob Dole traveled to Missouri 12 times this campaign season, but President Clinton maintained a narrow, steady lead in the state, which he visited four times this year and won by a margin of 10 percentage points over George Bush in 1992.
Mr. Clinton's coattails helped the first-term Democratic Governor, Mel Carnahan, win his bid for a second four-year term against his Republican challenger, Margaret Kelly, the State Auditor. Poor fund raising hurt Ms. Kelly, who trailed Mr. Carnahan throughout the race.
Most House incumbents looked safe, including James M. Talent, a two-term Republican who won a rematch with a former Democratic Congresswoman, Joan Kelly Horn, and Ike Skelton, a Democrat who is a senior member of the National Security Committee. Mr. Skelton defeated Bill Phelps, a Republican.
Representative Harold L. Volkmer, a Democrat, faced the toughest challenge: a rematch against Kenny Hulshof, a Republican who lost to Mr. Volkmer by only six percentage points in 1994.
One of the country's most unusual contests was the three-way race to fill the seat of Bill Emerson, a Republican who died in June. His widow, Jo Ann Emerson, missed the filing deadline for Republican candidates, but, running as an independent, she defeated Emily Firebaugh, a Democrat, and the Republican primary winner, Richard A. Kline. Republican Party officials at the state and national levels backed Mrs. Emerson, who promised to continue her husband's legacy.
Democrats hoped a Clinton win in Missouri could bolster their State Senate majority.

NEBRASKA -- DOLE
The Republicans had their appetites whetted when Senator Jim Exon, a three-term Democrat, announced his retirement in what is essentially a conservative state. The Democrats were able to persuade Gov. Ben Nelson, who is enormously popular in the state, to run for the open seat. But the victor was the Republican, Chuck Hagel, an Omaha businessman.
Both candidates ran on conservative platforms, although Mr. Hagel's campaign was noteworthy in that it featured earnest and explicit support for Bob Dole's call for a sizable Federal tax cut.
Both candidates presented themselves as abortion opponents.
In the state's Second Congressional District, Representative Jon Christensen, a freshman Republican, campaigned unabashedly on the Contract With America, the House Republicans' 1994 campaign manifesto, and held on to his seat. Mr. Christensen narrowly defeated a three-term Democrat, Peter Hoagland, two years ago, and Democrats mobilized strongly to oust him this time. Mr. Christensen began to rely heavily on the Christian Coalition in his re-election bid.
The Democratic nominee, James Martin Davis, tried to attach his wagon firmly to the Nelson campaign and depicted himself as a moderate-conservative.

NORTH DAKOTA
Only once since 1944 has a Democrat carried North Dakota, and that was in the Johnson landslide of 1964. George Bush carried the state easily four years ago, despite a strong showing by Ross Perot, who took 23 percent of the vote. But the latest statewide poll this year, in mid-October, showed President Clinton ahead, 41 percent to 35 percent, in a two-way race against Mr. Dole. The poll did not measure Mr. Perot's support.
Democratic Congressional candidates have always fared better in North Dakota than Democratic Presidential candidates have, perhaps reflecting the state's populist, agrarian history. Both Senators, Byron L. Dorgan and Kent Conrad, are Democrats, as is the state's House member, Earl Pomeroy, the only member of the Congressional delegation up for re-election this year.
Mr. Pomeroy won his race by emphasizing his moderate voting record and arguing that his challenger, Kevin Cramer, would be a loyal Gingrich soldier pushing a radical Republican agenda. Mr. Cramer did not argue. In fact, he invited Mr. Gingrich and Representative Dick Armey, the House majority leader, to hold fund raisers for him.
Mr. Cramer, the state's tourism director, trailed in polls throughout the race. His strategy was to argue that the state needed a Republican in its Congressional delegation since the Republicans controlled Congress.
Gov. Edward T. Schafer, a Republican, won a second term against Lee Kaldor, a member of the State House. Mr. Schafer campaigned on his record of cutting taxes and increasing spending on education.

OHIO -- CLINTON
President Clinton won Ohio, though by less than polls had suggested until the final few days. No Republican has won the White House without Ohio in this century, and Bob Dole was unable to overcome Mr. Clinton's persistent lead.. The state suffered from a case of the "political blahs," one prominent commentator said, despite dozens of visits by both major-party candidates and their wives and running mates.
The main suspense for the state involved Congress, where the Republicans captured a Senate seat and four House seats from the Democrats two years ago, with all freshmen now vulnerable along with a sophomore, Martin R. Hoke, whose comments about a female journalist's anatomy weakened him.
Mr. Hoke, twice the beneficiary of opponents who self-destructed, was opposed by Dennis J. Kucinich, a Democrat who as a 32-year old Mayor of Cleveland two decades ago presided over his city's bankruptcy, a fact that Mr. Hoke hammered home. The irrepressible Mr. Kucinich, now a State Senator, ran advertisements in which the incumbent was represented by a parrot that squawked "Gingrich." Mr. Hoke could have suffered from a September prediction by a fellow Republican Congressman that he would have lost an election held then.
Representative Frank A. Cremeans of the Sixth District in Appalachia looked to be the most vulnerable of the Republican freshmen as he faced Ted Strickland, the Democrat, in a rematch of their 1994 race, when Mr. Cremeans's margin was just two percentage points. The contest was regarded as a referendum on the Republican agenda, which Mr. Strickland, a psychologist who held the seat from 1992 to 1994, criticized as hurting working people and the poor.
Labor flooded the district with advertisements on Medicare. Mr. Strickland made tactical errors, but Mr. Cremeans lost important newspaper endorsements.
Among the other Republican freshmen -- Steve Chabot, Bob Ney and Steven C. LaTourette -- only Mr. Chabot had a lead that could be called comfortable.
Representative Tom Sawyer, a five-term Democrat who squeaked to victory last time, faced a challenge from Joyce George, a Republican who is a former United States Attorney and state judge.

SOUTH DAKOTA
In one of the toughest United States Senate races this year, Representative Tim Johnson, a Democrat, defeated the Republican incumbent, Larry Pressler.
Late last month, the first independent poll in the race showed Mr. Johnson, with a 10-percentage-point lead. Mr. Pressler, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, was seeking a fourth term. A Rhodes Scholar with a law degree from Harvard, he was first elected in 1978.
Mr. Johnson, elected to Congress in 1986, has three degrees from the University of South Dakota.
Mr. Pressler had accused his opponent of supporting "Washington's failed liberal philosophy of tax and spend versus South Dakota's conservative, common-sense values," while Mr. Johnson had accused the Senator of blocking campaign finance reform and of not supporting farmers strongly enough.
The race was followed closely by national party officials. South Dakota's other Senator is Tom Daschle, a Democrat and the minority leader.
Mr. Daschle's longtime staff director, Rick Weiland, lost the fight for Mr. Johnson's old job, the state's lone House seat. The victor was John Thune, a Republican businessman and onetime aide to former Senator Jim Abdnor.
The Presidential race in South Dakota was a tight contest over just three electoral votes. Bob Dole led in most polls.

WISCONSIN -- CLINTON
Buoyed by a booming economy and a lack of major controversies, voters in Wisconsin for the most part maintained the status quo.
As expected, Bill Clinton beat Bob Dole. Although Mr. Dole gained in the polls in the state as the election neared, he still all but wrote off Wisconsin after the Republican convention this summer, concentrating instead on Ohio and other Midwestern states. That prompted complaints from the state's Republican Governor, Tommy G. Thompson.
The race in the First Congressional District, between the Republican incumbent, Mark W. Neumann, a supporter of Newt Gingrich and the Contract With America, and his Democratic opponent, Lydia Spottswood, was too close to call early today in what once had been a Democratic stronghold. Mr. Neumann portrayed himself as a deficit hawk who dared to buck the House leadership over a military spending bill.
In the Second District, the Republican incumbent, Scott L. Klug, defeated the Democratic candidate, Paul R. Soglin. Mr. Soglin sought to tie Mr. Klug to Mr. Gingrich by morphing Mr. Klug's image into that of Mr. Gingrich in a television advertisement. Mr. Klug countered with a commercial in which his image was morphed back from that of Mr. Gingrich.
In the Fourth District, the Democratic incumbent, Gerald D. Kleczka, defeated Tom Reynolds, a Republican.
In the Fifth District, Thomas M. Barrett, the Democratic incumbent, won re-election over his Republican rival, Paul D. Melotik.

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: THE PRESIDENCY -- NEWS ANALYSIS;
Economy Helps Again

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

 BODY:
Four years ago, a faltering economy persuaded American voters to give Bill Clinton a chance as President. Yesterday, surveys of voters leaving the polls showed, a robust economy persuaded them that he deserved a second term.
Four years ago, only 39 percent of voters said they thought the country was headed in the right direction -- a key indicator of the nation's mood. That figure grew this year to 53 percent. 
 But Mr. Clinton's success in occupying "the vital center," as he called it in his victory statement, in a phrase borrowed from the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., did not extend to Capitol Hill. He and his party failed in their quest to recapture control of the Senate, and they appeared headed for failure in the struggle for dominance of the House of Representatives. So he and his country face two more years at least of divided Government.
After a campaign filled with fund-raising abuses on a grand scale, Mr. Clinton pledged early action on campaign-finance reform. His Vice President, Al Gore, said he was ready to work with the Republicans, and the President himself said, "It is time to put country ahead of party."
But appeals to eschew partisanship may be lost in the clamor of investigations of alleged scandals in the first Clinton Administration.
The returns showed little diminution in the conservative trend that has coursed through the country since the 1970's. The new Senate will be more conservative than the old. In California, the most publicized initiative of the year, opposing affirmative action, was approved.
Bob Dole did everything he could to refocus the Presidential contest, the last of the 20th century, as Mr. Clinton said so often. He quit the Senate. He abandoned his long-term insistence that deficit reduction must take precedence over tax cuts. He chose Jack Kemp, with whom he had often quarreled, as a running mate. He tried to persuade Ross Perot to withdraw. He gambled everything on a long shot in California, where he had little chance.
At the end, like George Bush in 1992, he assailed Mr. Clinton's character and ethical standards.
None of it worked. None of his tactical zigs and none of his tactical zags changed the strategic reality: Presidents, even Presidents like this one, mistrusted by the electorate, are unlikely to be cast from office in times of peace and prosperity.
Especially when the President is as politically adept as Mr. Clinton. Mr. Dole, 23 years older, reared in a bygone political culture, could not match the President as a campaigner. He provided this wistful analysis of his own in an interview with CNN shortly before the end of the campaign: "You have to give the President credit. He's a very smooth talker. He hits the right buttons. He'll adopt things, things the Republican Congress has passed."
The discombobulation of Mr. Dole's campaign was epitomized when the campaign prematurely sent to newsrooms a fax conceding that he had lost. After a flurry of telephone calls, he became the first Presidential candidate in history to unconcede, however temporarily.
Mr. Clinton also had a valuable electoral insurance policy: his popularity (and his main rival's unpopularity) among women, which apparently resulted at least in part from the Republican Party's resolute stand against abortion. But it was not just abortion; there was an even larger gender gap in the Massachusetts Senate contest, where both candidates defended abortion rights.
In the Presidential campaign, it was almost as if there were two elections, one for men, who gave Mr. Dole a majority, and one for women, who gave the President a larger one.
So Mr. Clinton, derided in 1993, humiliated by a Republican sweep in 1994, forced to defend his own political relevance in 1995, won a second term -- something accomplished by only two other Democrats in this century. It was a remarkable achievement, especially for one so tainted by scandal. More than half those who voted said they doubted the President's trustworthiness.
He did better than he had four years ago, approaching if not reaching 50 percent, though not quite as well as some of his strategists had hoped.
Florida, where Mr. Clinton lost by a hair four years ago, swung easily into his column this time, perhaps because the state's many elderly voters believed the Democrats when they said the Republicans threatened Medicare. One of the Sun Belt mega-states, Florida constituted one of the night's big prizes.
Nowhere in the early returns did Mr. Dole surprise. His best big state was Texas, but he was unable effectively to challenge Mr. Clinton anywhere in the broad swath of states that form the Northeast quadrant of the country. From Ohio to Maine and south to Maryland and Missouri he took only Indiana.
Mr. Clinton swept the Pacific Coast states. Mr. Dole showed more strength in the South, but not nearly enough, and a good deal more in his native region, the Great Plains.
The larger question, unanswered in the voting, was what kind of second-term President Bill Clinton would prove to be. The liberal of his first two years? The moderate of his second two? Operating under financial stringency, his options will be limited, and they may be limited further if, as anticipated, the final tally leaves the Republicans in control of both houses of Congress.
In the final days of the campaign, Republican leaders appealed, in speeches and in television commercials, for mass ticket-splitting, arguing that if Mr. Clinton won, it would be even more important to elect a Republican House and Senate to prevent the President from completely dominating Washington.
It appeared that the Democrats had succeeded in their efforts to demonize Mr. Clinton's tormentor from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, Speaker Newt Gingrich. Six of 10 voters said they held an unfavorable opinion of the Speaker, and of those, more than two-thirds backed Mr. Clinton.
Voters said that rather than character issues, the economy and jobs mattered most, followed by Medicare and Social Security. More than 6 in 10 said the economy is in good shape, and Mr. Clinton got most of their votes.
The cleavage was clear. About 3 voters in 10 said their own finances had improved during the Clinton years, and two-thirds of them voted for the President. About 2 in 10 said their finances had worsened since the last election, and two-thirds of them, cast their ballots for Mr. Dole.
Mr. Dole's furious closing onslaught against the ethics of the White House, delivered in an increasingly frayed voice, apparently had an impact, if not enough to turn the election around. According to the exit poll, conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of television networks and The Associated Press, voters who waited until the last minute to make up their minds went to Mr. Dole by two-to-one.
And Republicans "went home," as the politicians say, as the campaign came down to the wire. Mr. Dole took a greater share of their votes, according to the exit polls, than earlier surveys had suggested he was likely to do.
But the election left a bad taste in the country's mouth.
Half the voters interviewed for the exit poll said they cast their ballots with reservations about the man they were voting for. Most were skeptical about what the candidates told them; they had doubts that Mr. Clinton could pay for his social programs and cut the deficit at the same time, and they had doubts about Mr. Dole's ability to cut taxes and reduce the budget deficit.
Democratic chances of taking control of the Senate were damaged in the South, where the retirement of four Democratic incumbents in the days when Mr. Clinton seemed unlikely to win re-election created open seats. Democrats lost two of those seats, those being relinquished by Senators Howell Heflin of Alabama and David Pryor of Arkansas, though they held two others.
In House contests, it appeared that the Democratic efforts to unseat Republican freshmen, bolstered by millions of dollars of trade-union money, were falling short.
Two pieces of American political lore remained intact as the result of yesterday's voting: No Republican has ever been elected President in the modern era who failed to win the New Hampshire primary, which leads off the quadrennial voting marathon. Mr. Dole was beaten this year by Patrick J. Buchanan, the outspoken conservative.
And Mr. Clinton also won Ohio, a reliable bellwether in Presidential elections. No Republican has ever been elected without taking that state's electoral votes.

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: THE PRESIDENCY -- THE OVERVIEW;
CLINTON ELECTED TO A 2D TERM WITH SOLID MARGINS ACROSS U.S.; G.O.P. KEEPS HOLD ON CONGRESS

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

 BODY:
William Jefferson Clinton was re-elected President of the United States yesterday, capping a yearlong political resurgence that made him the first Democrat since Franklin Delano Roosevelt to win a second term as President.
Mr. Clinton built a landslide in the Electoral College and won a decisive victory in the popular vote, overwhelming Bob Dole in all regions of the country except the South and the High Plains, where the Republican won several states. The President's sweep carried to California, where Mr. Dole, in an enormous gamble, diverted millions of dollars from other states and stumped doggedly in the final weeks of the campaign. 
 Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who ran on the ticket of the Reform Party he had created, finished a distant third, drawing roughly half of the 19 percent he won in 1992.
With 84 percent of the popular vote tallied at 3 A.M. today, Mr. Clinton drew 49 percent; Mr. Dole 41 percent, and Mr. Perot 8 percent. The President surpassed his showing of 43 percent of the popular vote in 1992.
A state-by-state breakdown of those returns gave Mr. Clinton more than the 370 electoral votes he won four years ago, a commanding showing in the Electoral College, which requires 270 votes for victory.
The support for Mr. Clinton did not run deep enough to allow Democrats to declare a reversal of the Republican tide that swept Congress two years ago. The Republicans retained control of the Senate; by early this morning, they appeared headed to keep a majority in the House.
With a Democrat still in the Oval Office and Republicans still dominating at least one chamber of Congress, the nation's political landscape remains competitive and unsettled.
Shortly after midnight, eastern time, Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore and their families emerged before a joyous crowd jamming the streets in front of the Old State House in Little Rock, Ark., where they had their victory celebration four years ago.
"Today the American people have spoken," Mr. Clinton said, recognizing the power of the mixed message that voters seemed to be sending him and Congress.
"America has told every one of us -- Democrats, Republicans and independents -- loud and clear: It is time to put politics aside, join together and get the job done for America's future."
Paying tribute to Mr. Dole, the President called on the partisan crowd to "join me in applause for his lifetime of service to the United States." Mr. Clinton said he spoke with his rival last night, adding, "I applauded the campaign that he fought so bravely."
Less than an hour earlier, Mr. Dole, accompanied by his wife, Elizabeth, and his daughter, Robin, appeared at a hotel ballroom in Washington that was packed with his cheering supporters.
"Tomorrow will be the first time in my life I don't have anything to do," he said. He added: "It hurts to lose an election. But stay involved and keep fighting the good fight because you are the ones who will make the 21st century the next American century."
At times over the past two years, winning his party's nomination appeared as vital to Mr. Dole as winning the White House. He said last night, "I've never been prouder in my life than to have been the Republican nominee for President of the United States."
The 50-year-old Mr. Clinton offered himself as a vigorous leader for a new century, but the success of his campaign turned largely on his ability to seize a litany of Republican issues as his own, welfare, crime and balancing the budget. Often, the President seemed to be running as much against Newt Gingrich, the unpopular Speaker of the House, as against Mr. Dole. Mr. Clinton's nimble and aggressive political organization, and the fact that he has presided over a relatively hardy economy in peacetime, left Mr. Dole with few openings to make his case.
Perhaps the most striking example of Mr. Clinton's electoral strength was his victory in Florida, where both candidates campaigned strenuously. Mr. Clinton was particularly determined to win Florida because he viewed a victory there as emblematic of the Democrats' breaking the Republican stranglehold on the South.
In addition, the President lost the state very narrowly in 1992, even though he barely campaigned there. The last Democrat to win Florida was Jimmy Carter in 1976.
Besides Florida and California, Mr. Clinton's electoral victories included New Jersey, Connecticut, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. Mr. Dole's biggest prize was Texas.
Among women, Democrats, Asian-American and Hispanic voters, Mr. Clinton won more support than he did against George Bush in 1992.
Though his attempt to stage a Trumanesque upset never materialized, Mr. Dole managed to hold his own with some important voter groups.
Independent voters and suburbanites, whom both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole courted assiduously, supported those candidates equally, according to a survey of voters leaving the polls conducted by the Associated Press and the television networks.
Voters who waited until the final hours to make up their minds gave their votes to Mr. Dole by 2 to 1. And Republicans stepped forward for their nominee more vigorously than earlier polls had suggested they would.
Mr. Dole, who is 73, said he was offering the nation a chance to return to the values of the World War II generation. But though he won his party's nomination this year, on his third try, he was unable to appeal to a wider audience in the general election, despite a series of self-consciously dramatic gestures.
In one of the most memorable moments, Mr. Dole resigned as Senate majority leader after three decades in Congress. He also put forth an ambitious 15 percent across-the-board tax-cut plan that went against decades of his own strong belief in deficit reduction. He picked Jack Kemp, with whom he has had strained relations, as his surprise choice for a running mate. And in the final weeks, after agonizing in public over whether he was risking his carefully nurtured reputation as a man of rectitude, he began slamming Mr. Clinton as unethical.
Indeed, the survey of voters leaving the polls showed that they were willing to set aside any concerns they had about Mr. Clinton's character in favor of their satisfaction with the humming economy -- and their general perception that the country was headed in the right direction.
Democrats hailed the outcome as a triumph for a politician who as recently as four years ago was still Governor of Arkansas.
After a hectic campaign schedule, Mr. Clinton arrived in Little Rock early yesterday morning, only to play hearts with Leon E. Panetta, his chief of staff, and Douglas Sosnik, the White House political director, until the sun rose. He voted just after midday at a renovated train station in his hometown.
Mr. Dole cast his paper ballot just after noon at his hometown of Russell, Kan., before flying to Washington on the last leg of his often sleepless 96-hour campaign marathon.
Even before Mr. Dole formally conceded, his aides and prominent Republicans were engaged in a round of soul-searching as well as searing port-mortems over some major decisions of the campaign, particularly the move to transform the final weeks of the race into essentially a battle for California.
In the wake of the 1994 midterm elections, expectations had been high for the campaign of 1996. Republicans lined up to take on a vulnerable-appearing Mr. Clinton. Many prominent politicians toyed with running as independents, only to back down in the end. And one of the most gripping stretches was in 1995, during Colin L. Powell's will-he-will-he-not process of mulling over a White House bid.
Still, throughout this year, the campaign often seemed more perfunctory than passionate, with the battle over the control of Congress offering the most suspense. The Presidential match-up was largely between two candidates who have long been well known to the American public. And no disruptive world or national events altered the contours of the race.
Mr. Clinton's lead over Mr. Dole in the polls never wavered from October 1995. It was around that time that Democrats succeeded in blaming Republicans for the budget standoff in Congress that led to the Government shutdown.
Nevertheless, Mr. Clinton's re-election was an impressive turnabout for the President. Only two years ago, he was faulted for the Republicans' takeover of the House and Senate, the first time in 40 years that the party gained control of Congress. And only a year ago, he was widely viewed by leading Republicans, and even many Democrats, as eminently beatable.
Mr. Clinton will now be a lame duck, the first Democrat to be subject to the ban on Presidents serving more than two full terms. Increasingly, the attention and speculation will shift to Mr. Gore, who delivered a long introduction of Mr. Clinton in Little Rock this morning and who has left no doubt of his intentions to seek the White House in 2000.
Yesterday's election may also have brought an end to the role of Mr. Perot as a major political player. By piling up more than 5 percent of the vote, Mr. Perot insured that his Reform Party will continue to get Federal financing for a run in 2000. Yet unlike four years ago, when Mr. Perot's message about eliminating the deficit and overhauling the campaign finance system altered the political dialogue, he did not loom large over the 1996 campaign.
This year, according to the survey of voters leaving the polls, voters who backed Mr. Perot in 1992 gave Mr. Dole nearly half their support, and split the rest between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Perot.
But in his concession speech, Mr. Perot vowed not to fade away, saying: "We're going to keep the pressure on the major issues. I think they've gotten the word on campaign finance reform, don't you? They've repented and been reborn."
Even after he glides to another term, the specter of scandal still looms over Mr. Clinton. More than half of the voters in the survey said Mr. Clinton was not honest or trustworthy. Seven in 10 of those voters backed Mr. Dole. Six in 10 voters said the President had not told them the truth about the Whitewater case.

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTION: NEW JERSEY -- 12th District;
Pappas Overcomes Del Vecchio Charges

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
In New Jersey's tightly contested 12th District, Mike Pappas, a Republican, defeated his Democratic opponent, David M. Del Vecchio, overcoming Mr. Del Vecchio's attempt to paint Mr. Pappas's opposition to abortion rights and gun control as too extreme.
With 100 percent of election districts reporting, the vote was:
 
Pappas 133,377 (50%)
 Del Vecchio 123,804 (47%)
Unlike many other Republican Congressional candidates, Mr. Pappas did not distance himself from Mr. Gingrich. Instead, during his campaign, he often praised Mr. Gingrich's Contract With America. 
 "The victory was hard fought from Day One," Mr. Pappas told his supporters. "We fought an opponent and at times we fought some in the media."
Throughout the race, Mr. Del Vecchio, 40, had portrayed his Republican opponent as far to the right of the moderate voters of the 12th District, which includes all of Hunterdon County and parts of Monmouth, Mercer and Middlesex counties.
Mr. Pappas, 35, defeated two more moderate Republicans in the June primary. He played down his views on social issues this fall and instead campaigned as a fiscal conservative who supported Bob Dole's proposed 15 percent tax cut.
Neither candidate was well known in the Republican 12th District, which has been represented by Mr. Zimmer since 1990.
Mr. Del Vecchio, the Mayor of Lambertville since 1991, is on leave from a job as senior executive for economic development in the State Treasury Department. He was an aide to former Gov. Jim Florio, which Mr. Pappas used in radio commercials to portray his opponent as "even more liberal than Bob Torricelli," alluding to television ads used by Mr. Zimmer to attack his opponent in the United States Senate race.

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: THE NATION -- THE GOVERNORS;
Democrats Make Inroads In Elections for Governor

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
As President Clinton won a second term tonight with surprising victories in former Republican strongholds like Florida and New Hampshire, Democratic candidates for governor also headed to victory in states well known for their Republican leanings.
In Indiana, which Mr. Clinton failed to win for the second time, voters kept the governor's office Democratic. Lieut. Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon narrowly defeated Stephen Goldsmith, the Mayor of Indianapolis, who was widely perceived as a rising star in the national Republican Party. 
 And in New Hampshire, where a Democrat has not served as governor in 16 years, Jean Shaheen, a longtime state legislator, defeated her Republican challenger, Ovide Lamontagne, the former head of the State Board of Education.
The Democrats had even more to celebrate last night as victories by four incumbent Governors -- Thomas R. Carper in Delaware, Mel Carnahan in Missouri, James B. Hunt Jr. in North Carolina and Howard Dean in Vermont -- gave them a majority of the 11 gubernatorial contests this year. In Washington, another Democratic candidate, Gary Locke, the King County executive, defeated his Republican challenger, State Senator Ellen Craswell, according to an Associated Press projection.
Cecil Underwood, a Republican who became the youngest governor of West Virginia when he was elected in 1956, became the oldest -- he turned 74 yesterday -- by defeating Charlotte Pritt, a coal miner's daughter, in a race to succeed West Virginia's Democratic Governor, Gaston Caperton.
After serving one term through 1960, Mr. Underwood spent the next 36 years as a coal industry executive, a college president and real estate developer.
The Republican incumbent in North Dakota, Edward T. Schafer, won by a wide margin over Lee Kaldor, a Democratic State Representative. The Republican incumbents in Montana, Marc Racicot, and in Utah, Michael O. Leavitt, were expected to win easily.
Indiana, where Gov. Evan Bayh was also barred by law from seeking a third consecutive term, has supported a Democrat for President only four times this century and not since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.
But Mr. O'Bannon said the voters were impressed by the eight-year record of Mr. Bayh, who has taken credit for 350,000 new jobs in his two terms, a 30 percent drop in the number of welfare recipients in the last two years and a budget surplus of $1.67 billion last fiscal year.
"This is a positive message, saying we have built a strong foundation over the last eight years," Mr. O'Bannon said in an interview, adding that his victory reflects "a strong combined well-put-together plan" by state Democrats to make gains at all levels in a conservative state.
It was a stinging defeat for Mr. Goldsmith, who won national attention for efforts to privatize city agencies and held a steady lead in statewide polls through the summer. But then a series of problems, including a police scandal that led to the resignation of the Indianapolis police chief, gave Mr. O'Bannon an opening, and by last weekend, Mr. O'Bannon appeared to move into a safe lead.
Mr. Goldsmith also ruffled a few Republican feathers when he blamed Bob Dole for his fall in the polls.
A big embarrassment for Mr. Goldsmith was failing to carry Marion County, which includes Indianapolis.
In New Hampshire, Ms. Shaheen, 49, a three-term State Senator who appeared to benefit from a succession of visits by Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, became the state's first female governor. The only woman serving as a state's chief executive is Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who was elected in 1993.
Yet, Ms. Shaheen fought through a strong tradition of male and Republican domination in New Hampshire by campaigning on popular themes of improvements in health care, schools and employment while she pledged not to raise taxes or impose new ones.
She also won wide support among women for her position favoring abortion rights and initiatives she helped push through the State Legislature, including measures that provide portability for health insurance and require health insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions.
The victories by Mr. Carper in Delaware, Mr. Carnahan in Missouri, Mr. Hunt in North Carolina and Mr. Dean in Vermont were wholly expected, and those by Mr. Carper and Mr. Carnahan kept two other women from moving into governor's mansions. Mr. Carper defeated Delaware's treasurer, Janet Rzewinicki, and Mr. Carnahan prevailed over Margaret Kelly, the state auditor.
Mr. Hunt, who also served as governor from 1976 to 1984, beat the majority whip in the State House of Representatives, Robin Hayes, and Mr. Dean, who helped engineer Vermont's escape from economic recession, easily defeated John Gropper, a Republican consultant.

HEADLINE: CLOSE TO HOME;
The Elusive Edges of Middle Age

BYLINE: By MARIA LAURINO 

 BODY:
A YEAR ago, when I had just turned 36, I posed a question at a dinner party that was intended as a casual query, a trifle that slipped off my tongue with the buttery smoothness of the evening's chardonnay.
"So, when do you think middle age begins?" I asked after the youthful dew of the gathering had faded and the first awkward silence appeared. "Thirty-five," said a 41-year-old man without a moment's hesitation. 
 "Thirty-five?" I repeated with disbelief. Had I already turned middle-aged without even knowing it? A month or so later, I raised the topic again. But this time I detected a note of stress in my voice, as if I had already anticipated an answer that I didn't want to hear.
"By 38, there's no promise left," a 35-year-old Wall Street trader responded.
Soon I found myself slipping the "m" word into most of my conversations, urgently grilling friends and acquaintances, capturing people's attention long enough to demand an answer.
"I'm middle-aged because when I was a teen-ager I thought 43 was middle-aged -- I'm not going to change the rules of the game now that I'm 43," said a friend who is a sportswriter.
My dinner-party question, posed to soothe my fears, was producing the opposite effect. To be called middle-aged in your 30's was like discovering that your alarm clock rang an hour earlier each morning until sleep was forever lost, attainable only as a sweet memory.
I was hoping to find a doctor with an authoritative voice who could pinpoint that magic moment when youth ends and middle age starts. Once I knew the diagnosis, I could write my life's prescription.
Instead, I discovered that there was no clear consensus among doctors, psychologists and sociologists. Middle age has been placed on the back burner of gerontological and developmental studies. Like a middle child trying to find a place in between, all the attention has been given to the younger and older siblings.
"It's an uncharted, almost unidentified professional field," said Dr. Orville Brim, an expert in human development and the director of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Successful Midlife Development in Vero Beach, Fla. Dr. Brim and 12 other scholars are nearing the end of an eight-year research project on midlife -- one of a series of MacArthur Foundation studies on the stages of human development.
"Many cultures don't have any concept of middle age -- the idea does not exist," Dr. Brim said. "So you can see it was constructed. And then when you get into societies where they do have the concept of middle age, the definitions of beginning and ending vary."
While Dr. Brim could not yet release any details from the project, his initial research revealed a basic truism: the older you are, the later you say middle age begins. Twenty-year-olds, for example, claimed that 35 was middle-aged. The 40-and-over crowd, on average, believed that middle age began at 40, but many extended its start by another 5 to 15 years to match their own perceptions of themselves.
Middle age is also perceived differently according to socio-economic status. Dr. Brim found that lower-income respondents, who have less access to decent health care and who often lead more physically difficult lives, usually say they reach midlife at an earlier point than do middle-class respondents.
Dr. Brim, who is in his 70's, said his studies covered people from 30 to 70, but he considers 40 to 60 as the core middle-age years.
As it turned out, the wrong person to ask for a neat pigeonhole for the middle-aged state was Betty Friedan, whose most recent book was "The Fountain of Age."
"Honey, don't bother me with this middle-age nonsense," she said grumpily. "It is obsolete. I am not for any kind of denial, I am not for an obsessive holding on to youth. I am for being fully where you are, but I think that all those terms about age have been pejorative terms and they don't apply anymore."
"Somehow middle age has the concept of big rolls of fat around your middle," she continued. "People don't use that term anymore. People don't feel that term anymore. They are grown-up now -- they're not kids, that's all, but they continue to grow old. O.K.?"
But Dr. Robert Butler, a gerontologist and the director of the International Longevity Center at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, believes it is misleading to say that middle age is just a matter of mind over body. "In my definition of medicine, the concept of middle age is very real, because I see it as having physiological and biological representations," he said. He added that he considers middle age to occur roughly between 37 and 60. Between those years, he said, some profound realizations occur that are worthy of the term middle age.
"The British in centuries past called it the 'period of gravity,' " he said. "That's when people get more serious, a time when people reassess their commitments and what they want to make of them. It's the time when changes occur if there are going to be significant changes."
The term middle age had grave connotations to the Victorians, as well. In "Jane Eyre," which Charlotte Bronte wrote nearly 150 years ago, when a person's life expectancy was the early 40's, Jane describes Rochester as a man who was "past youth, but had not reached middle age; perhaps he might be 35." Obviously, Bronte wasn't suggesting that middle age correlated to a chronological midpoint in life, but the words "past youth," compared to the drearier term "middle age," created a more desirable portrait of the heroine's future husband.
Carol Ryff, a professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin and a member of the MacArthur Foundation's research team, said: "At some point you have got to come to grips with what your own definition of midlife is. And I think coming to grips with it is one of those important developmental challenges of life."
A difficulty in thinking about middle age -- that point in time, as Schopenhauer defined it, when you begin to count backward from death rather than forward from birth -- is acknowledging that one must let go of youth, with its unlimited promises and sense of immortality.
A friend who has turned 40 and who has a 2-year-old daughter sees age symbolized by a drawing she can't forget: in it, a young woman heads up a staircase while an older woman helps her. The older woman is, in effect, passing the torch to the younger one, leading her up the metaphorical stairway to the future. "I once fiercely resisted the notion that I could be that older woman," she said. "Now, I think I've reach that point when I can allow myself to be her."
Since I first posed my dinner party question, I still vacillate between a hard-won acceptance of middle age and the more commonplace desire of wanting to be young. At times I pretend that the period of youth lasts longer today than ever before. But then I spend time with college students and realize that the years I thought were right behind me are merely dusty memories, an antiquated record album permanently packed away. Or I listen to an exhausted 24-year-old tell me how he danced at a club until 4 A.M. and understand that I am happily, thankfully, no longer that young. So if I am not that young, what am I?
For the moment, 37, and approaching what some might call middle age.

HEADLINE: Hold China to Its Word On Hong Kong Rights

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You are correct in saying (editorial, Nov. 4) that Washington must use its influence to encourage China to keep its word on the rules it agreed to for preserving autonomy and freedoms in Hong Kong when it returns to Chinese control next year. That will not be easy for Washington to do because of the political pressures that will be brought to bear on our leaders by American companies trading in China. 
 It must be done, however, because if we (and Britain) do not act, a great and vital city will lose its freedom and be economically destroyed. The ordinary people of Hong Kong will suffer, not the Hong Kong tycoons, who are now kissing up to the Chinese. With foreign passports in their back pockets, the tycoons will bail out to join their millions overseas when things get bad.
We must encourage and support the British to insist on Chinese compliance with the terms they agreed to in the Joint Declaration. It sounds sometimes as if the colony's Governor, Chris Patten, is left twisting in the wind as he protests Chinese pronouncements and actions while at the same time London ignores Hong Kong and worries about its trade with China.
My wife and I recently returned from a year in Hong Kong. The threat of Chinese oppression has cast a pall over the territory. Nine thousand troops from China that are to occupy the colony on July 1, 1997, are training across the border in Shenzhen. Some Hong Kong newspapers are practicing self-censorship as suggested by the mandarins in Beijing. Government officials are circumspect in what they say publicly because of the real possibility of retaliation after the change of sovereignty.
In trying to increase exports to China and improve our balance of trade, we have tolerated broken promises by the Chinese Government that we would not tolerate with other trading partners. China needs to understand that respect for human rights and the rule of law are essential if it is to enjoy the benefits of free commerce. It is time to draw a line; the issue should be Hong Kong.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
How the Baby Boomers Can Save Social Security

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:

WILL AMERICA GROW UP BEFORE IT GROWS OLD?
How the Coming Social Security Crisis Threatens You, Your Family and Your Country
By Peter G. Peterson
Illustrated. 237 pages. Random House. $21.
 The mountain foliage, brilliant in the autumn sun, drew busloads of healthy retirees to New England in recent weeks. They would be the last generation, in Peter G. Peterson's scheme of things, spending so many of their final years in idle tourism. To help make Social Security solvent, Mr. Peterson would require their children, the Baby Boomers, to work at least until age 70 before they could collect a full pension.
That is a reasonable suggestion, even if the Social Security system weren't about to become strapped. So is Mr. Peterson's call for new training programs "to make seniors more attractive employees," and his ideas about phased-in retirement. "As a growing number of Americans reach their late 60's and 70's in good health and with employable skills," he writes, retirement at 65 "is no longer enlightened social policy." 
 But these sensible suggestions appear rather briefly in the final chapters of "Will America Grow Up Before It Grows Old?" The Peterson message through most of the book is that of a passionate pamphleteer. Social Security, in his hands, must be cut back because of an economic thesis that he fervently embraces, although it might be flawed.
The thesis, shared by many others, is this: Americans spend too much on consumption, either from their own pockets or through Government outlays, particularly Social Security pension checks. Huge debts have been accumulated in pursuit of this consumption. But to make the economy prosper, we must become a society of savers, not deficit spenders. That can happen only if we spend less on consumption, which means above all shrinking the huge Federal outlays for Social Security and Medicare, particularly Social Security.
In this way, Mr. Peterson argues, we will accumulate enough savings to invest sufficiently in machinery, computers, airports, education and the like. This expanding "capital" will make the economy grow and prosper, and eventually Social Security might become more affordable. Repeatedly, Mr. Peterson, a 70-year-old investment banker who shuns retirement himself, invokes this savings-investment doctrine as he makes his case for cutting back Social Security until the promised prosperity finally kicks in.
That day may not come so quickly. Too much saving and too little consumption can hold back economic growth or precipitate a recession. Then the savings pool, for all its size, isn't invested.
Whatever the shortcomings of Mr. Peterson's economics, he is becoming a powerful voice in an expanding debate over Social Security and balanced budgets. As chairman of the Blackstone Group, an investment bank, and former chairman of Lehman Brothers, he speaks for Wall Street, which pushes for balanced budgets and is increasingly viewing Social Security as a means to get there. A former Commerce Secretary, he is the founding president of the Concord Coalition, dedicated to deficit cutting. His 1993 book, "Facing Up: How to Rescue the Economy From Crushing Debt and Save the American Dream," was about saving and balancing the Federal budget, although Social Security was not then as big a target for achieving this goal as it is becoming.
There is indeed a Social Security problem. The Baby Boomers in retirement, starting in 2011, will cost more. The surplus now accumulating from the existing Social Security payroll tax will turn to deficit when the Boomers' benefits must be paid. And if no change is made, the pay-as-you-go-system that has functioned so well, with each generation of workers financing the pensions of their parents and grandparents, will no longer cover the retirement bill.
Mr. Peterson is right on these points. But in his blunt, sometimes hard to follow prose, he exaggerates the crisis that would arise. While his book is mainly a plea to reform Social Security, he often adds in Medicare costs, amplifying the crisis, although the two programs are very different. And he gives little attention to a social conflict that may be built into his proposals.
Social Security pensions have paid off handsomely for most Americans, the well-off as well as the poor, giving them pensions that replace from 20 percent to more than 50 percent of their pre-retirement incomes. The poor have enjoyed the highest percentages, but the payback for higher earners has been substantial, too. That has explained the broad public support for a Social Security system that embraced nearly everyone.
The Peterson approach, advocating a means test, would reduce Social Security pensions for retirees with incomes above $40,000, undermining their stake in the system. Individual retirement savings accounts, another proposal, might also make wealthier people less dependent on the minimum Social Security benefit that would come from a general fund for those who did not earn or save much. Such trends could take their toll. Better-off Americans, benefiting less and less from the general fund, might in time oppose basic pensions altogether as a waste of their taxes. The potential divisiveness rates far more discussion in a book on Social Security than Mr. Peterson gives it.
The first hundred pages of his book are rich in scare statistics. The cost of Social Security and Medicare once the Baby Boomers move into retirement will overwhelm the economy, he writes. By the year 2040, the two programs would absorb in taxes nearly 50 percent of the work force's payroll, if today's benefits were to continue. "Unless we change course," Mr. Peterson writes, "entitlements will consume all Federal revenues by the mid-2020's. Not a dime will be left over for national security -- much less for vital domestic investment priorities."
Only many pages later, and briefly, does he acknowledge as perhaps accurate two significant findings by others. One is that as the Baby Boomers flood into retirement, the percentage of children in the population will shrink, so that the portion of non-working Americans, young as well as old, who must be supported by the working population won't be much higher than it is today.
The second is a projection by the Social Security Administration, which says that if Congress were to raise the payroll tax today by only 2.19 percentage points, to 14.59 percent, Social Security would probably remain solvent for the next 75 years.
For Mr. Peterson, such arguments miss the point. The issue is not how much parents spend on their children, or even whether Social Security can be made solvent by a relatively small tax increase. The issue is total Government spending and the deficit that results from it. That deficit is expected to grow in the next century, and for Mr. Peterson, the only way to reverse this is to shift money away from Social Security.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Slips After Elections And Pessimistic Euro Report

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped yesterday as currency traders shifted their focus from elections in the United States to a report that suggested no more than a handful of countries would qualify to join a single European currency.
The dollar dipped against the yen after the head of Japan's central bank raised concern that Japanese interest rates might rise sooner than investors had expected. 
 In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5175 marks from 1.5192 marks on Tuesday and to 113.93 yen from 114.15 yen. The British pound fell to $1.6418 from $1.6446.
The dollar rose in Asian trading after President Clinton won re-election, and Republicans kept control of Congress. The election results were widely expected, though, and the gains evaporated in European trading. "The dollar got no fresh direction from the U.S. elections," said Stephen Flanagan, a trader at Credit Agricole in New York.
Traders also weighed words from the governor of the Bank of Japan, Yasuo Matsushita, who said that monetary policy needed to be pre-emptive to achieve price stability, according to the Jiji Press. His comments suggested that the central bank might soon raise interest rates, traders said.
"The market is saying that maybe we are coming to the end of the dollar's rally against the yen," said Hillel Waxman, manager of currency trading at Bank Leumi Trust Company in New York.
The mark rebounded against the dollar after the European Monetary Institute, the forerunner of a planned European central bank, warned that progress in cutting budget deficits and debt by nations hoping to join monetary union had been "too slow."
Traders largely ignored a more upbeat report from the European Commission, the European Union's executive body, which said a majority of the 15 member countries would qualify for the single currency.
Traders bought marks after the institute's report. The mark typically gains on signs of delays to European monetary union because the mark will remain Europe's main reserve currency until there is a single currency.
Still, the institute said that even though a majority of European Union countries might not take part, European economic and monetary union could begin.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
A retrospective of Britain's best television ads from the last 20 years traces their evolution.

BYLINE: By Jane L. Levere 

 BODY:
THE observation by George Bernard Shaw that England and America are two countries separated by the same language is no longer true, at least when it comes to advertising.
A new retrospective of Britain's best television ads from the last 20 years, brought to New York by the Museum of Modern Art and now traveling to other museums, traces the changes in British television advertising, which has evolved from small, charming vignettes full of tongue-in-cheek humor to sleekly photographed campaigns, many with references to the United States and its culture. 
 Compiled from the top award-winning TV ads chosen annually by the judges of the British Television Advertising Awards, the program also looks at changes in the British creative process. Directors like Ridley Scott, Alan Parker, Hugh Hudson and Adrian Lyne cut their teeth in advertising in London in the 1970's before moving on to advertising and film making on this side of the Atlantic; Mr. Scott, for instance, created the former Chiat/Day's "1984" TV ad for Apple Computer, and also directed the Hollywood movies "Alien," "Blade Runner" and "Thelma and Louise," among others. The agency, now called TBWA Chiat/ Day, is a unit of the Omnicom Group.
In these directors' work, exemplified by Mr. Parker's 1976 Collett Dickinson Pearce & Partners ad for Parker Pens, in which the actress Penelope Keith teaches a class of finishing school girls how to use a pen, "every frame of film counted," said Barry Day, director of creative communications for the Interpublic Group of Companies and a founding judge of the TV awards program. "There was a much more visual approach than in the United States," he added.
Mr. Day also said he believed that these directors and their successors felt more compelled than their counterparts in the United States to entertain their audience. "The United States is a selling culture; it's prestigious to be a good salesman,"he said. "But in the United Kingdom, selling is vulgar. People don't mind buying, but they don't want to be sold."
Not surprisingly, this sentiment has led to a soft sell in many ads, achieved through quintessentially British humor. According to Mr. Day, "in the U.K., ads are designed to make you smile, charm you, create rapport, and then sell."
One example is a highly praised 1987 ad for Hamlet cigars, also by Collett Dickinson Pearce, in which a homely man, frustrated in his attempt to take his own picture in a self-service photo booth, calms down by lighting up a Hamlet; Mr. Day said this spot had succeeded because of "the simplicity, the excellence of the joke and the performance; we've all been there."
According to Peter Bigg, the administrator of the TV awards, the 1980's marked the first time that advertisers in the United States and Britain began to pay serious attention to each other's work.
Since then, British advertisers clearly have taken some of their cues from the United States. The Monty Python alumnus John Cleese appears in a 1992 black and white Saatchi & Saatchi ad for Schweppes tonic water that is a sly takeoff on Calvin Klein's campaign for Obsession perfume: Mr. Cleese and a woman trade nonsensical barbs that parody the Obsession ads' posturing. Several ads for Levi's 501 jeans by Bartle Bogle Hegarty borrow heavily from American culture: a 1993 spot, depicting a handsome young man traveling from backyard to backyard, via swimming pool, refers to the l968 film "The Swimmer," itself adapted from a short story by John Cheever, while a black and white 1994 spot shot at Yosemite National Park recalls the old West, as well as photographs by Ansel Adams. Saatchi & Saatchi is now owned by Cordiant P.L.C.
Laurence Kardish, curator of film at the Museum of Modern Art, finds British TV ads today less witty than in the past, perhaps because of the onslaught of global marketing of products like Levi's. "A striking visual counts more than repartee," he suggested.
Like Mr. Kardish, Mr. Bigg finds that many recent ads have "got a hard edge; they've lost their charm." Comparing a 1985 Boase Massimi Pollitt ad for John Smith's beer, in which two Laurel and Hardy lookalikes do a funny routine, with a 1995 campaign by GGT Group for Holsten Pils, featuring a fast-talking, sardonic, unshaven beer drinker, he lamented the loss of "song and dance" in beer advertising, one of the largest British categories.
In addition, he believes that much current advertising, both in the United States and Britain, emphasizes expensive, technically sophisticated production above all other values, a trend begun with Richard Loncraine's well-known 1983 "Manhattan Landing" spot by Saatchi & Saatchi for British Airways, in which a flying island of Manhattan lands at night at an airport, much to the surprise of the onlookers. The trend continued in Tony Kaye's 1995 "Twister" ad by Omnicom's Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO for Volvo, in which a meteorologist driving a Volvo attempts to study the eye of a tornado.
Mr. Bigg attributes the new, hard edge in some British campaigns in part to the lack of stability since the early 1990's in the British economy in general and in the advertising industry there in particular.
Mr. Day calls these tougher ads "nouvelle ugly, to go along with the trend toward fashionable grunge created by MTV."
"To pin your faith on a style or look that will probably change tomorrow is quite a gamble," he warned, because it goes against the main tenet of advertising, which is to build a brand over time around consistent elements.

HEADLINE: Study Looks At Care Rates After Strokes

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Elderly stroke patients are more likely to survive if treated by neurologists instead of family doctors, but the expense will be higher, a study has found.
Death rates during the 90 days after a stroke were 36 percent lower for patients treated by neurologists rather than family practitioners, the study found. The expenses were 34 percent higher. 
 The neurologists' patients may have benefited from better diagnosis, treatment, prevention and rehabilitation, the researchers said.
An author of the study, Dr. David J. Ballard, said the research underscored the importance of giving stroke patients access to specialists.
"It raises concerns about health-care plan arrangements that would make it difficult for neurologists to participate in the care of patients with stroke," said Dr. Ballard, an internist and director of the Center for Clinical Evaluation Sciences at Emory University in Atlanta.
The study was published in the November issue of Stroke, a journal of the American Heart Association. It was financed by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, part of the Federal Department of Health and Human Services.
Stroke occurs when a blood vessel to the brain bursts or is blocked by a clot. Deprived of oxygen, nerve cells in the affected area are unable to function and die within minutes. About 500,000 Americans suffer stroke each year.
The researchers studied 38,612 Medicare patients over 65 treated at hospitals across the United States for strokes caused by blood clots, the most common type. Among patients discharged from a hospital, 16.1 percent of those in neurologists' care died within 90 days of a stroke. That compares with 25.3 percent of those in family physicians' care.
The 90-day expenses for patient care, including hospital and doctor expenses, averaged $15,919 for patients treated by neurologists and $11,838 for those cared for by family physicians.
Despite neurologists' higher patient-survival rates, "people should not use this paper as a rationale for 'the more we spend the better we do,' " said Dr. Alan L. Hillman, a health economist at the University of Pennsylvania.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Market Off Slightly After Election

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities dropped slightly yesterday, as the bond market put the elections behind it and continued to work through the Government's quarterly refunding of debt, which concludes today with the sale of a new 30-year bond.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 13/32, yesterday, to 101 25/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.61 percent, from 6.58 percent on Tuesday. In when-issued trading ahead of today's bond auction, the new 30-year bond was being offered at a price to yield 6.56 percent, up a couple of hundredths of a percentage point from the previous day. 
 The Treasury's auctioning of $10 billion in 10-year notes yesterday, part of this week's quarterly refunding, went as expected, with the notes awarded at a rate of 6.273 percent.
Over all, bond traders seemed content that the elections did not greatly alter the status quo. Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said, "The combination of a Democratic Administration and a Republican-controlled Congress is a classic example of the American system of checks and balances and is likely to result in a fiscal pragmatism that will help maximize the efficacy of monetary policy."
Short-covering, in which traders are forced to buy back borrowed securities at a loss after betting wrongly that their prices will fall, provided a spur to the early gains. In addition, hedge fund and mortgage-backed buying added to the market's early rebound in trading. But the market gave back the gains as some traders took profits after the recent rise in the market.
With no major economic data available yesterday from the Government, investors examined a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a job placement firm, which showed that the number of job cuts announced in October surged 62 percent compared with the September report. But some analysts said the recent strike at several General Motors Corporation plants might have skewed the numbers higher, so traders sold bonds after seeing the report. The bond market reacts favorably to job cuts because they are an indicator that wage pressure, and thus inflation, will remain in control.
The Federal Reserve was also reported to be in the market yesterday, buying bills maturing on Nov. 14, 1996, to Oct. 16, 1997, to permanently add reserves to the system.
Patrick R. Dimick, an analyst at CS First Boston, said that yesterday's auction of 10-year notes came in remarkably similar to Tuesday's auction of three-year notes, with results about as expected but not good enough to entice investors to buy securities with longer maturities.
"Following the auction results," Mr. Dimick said, "the market traded flat, but that may have been more in preparation for tomorrow's 30-year bonds auction than any reaction to today's 10-year note."
He said the bid-to-cover ratio, or the number of bids compared with the total size of the auction, was 2.41 to 1, compared with 2.34 to 1 at the last auction and the 2.1 to 1 average over the last two years. A higher ratio indicates stronger demand for the notes.
"We've now taken care of the 10's and 3's and have not had a problem in distributing either issue," Mr. Dimick said.
Elsewhere, after a brief pause for the elections, analysts expect municipalities and corporations to begin picking up the pace of debt issuance amid the current low interest rate environment, in an effort to complete deals before the holidays, when deals become hard to structure because trading desks are thinly staffed.
Yesterday, New York City and Massachusetts priced a total of $1.53 billion in general obligation bonds in the municipal market, while the Chase Manhattan Corporation came to the corporate market with a $1.4 billion asset-backed deal.
New York City sold $834.1 million of general obligation and refunding bonds through underwriters led by Bear, Stearns & Company, with a maximum yield of 6.20 percent for an issue due in 2026, while Massachusetts priced $700 million in general obligation bonds through Paine Webber with a maximum yield of 5.55 percent for bonds due in 2013 through 2016.
Chase Credit Card Master Trust, which was called the Chemical Master Credit Card Trust I before the merger of Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank, sold $1.4 billion of 7-year floating-rate asset-backed certificates at the London interbank offered rate, plus 13 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, with the rate to be set on Tuesday. Underwriters were led by Chase Securities Inc.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a 10-year note:

Dole's First Day Without 'Anything to Do'

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
After about 114 hours of near nonstop campaigning, Bob Dole finally got a full night's sleep last night in his own bed.
He woke up today with, as he had foreseen, nothing to do. For the first time in nearly half a century, he held no political office, having resigned from the Senate to run for President and then watched as his Presidential aspirations were crushed in Bill Clinton's landslide victory last night. 
 Mr. Dole spent a few quiet hours at his campaign headquarters here this afternoon, wrapping up loose ends, posing for pictures with his aides and his Secret Service detail and perhaps giving a thought to the future.
Word has been circulating around Washington that Mr. Dole would be a good choice to head a bipartisan commission to save Medicare from financial collapse. The former Senate majority leader, known for his ability to broker negotiations and bring opposite sides to consensus, said repeatedly in the campaign how proud he was to have served on a commission that "saved" Social Security in 1983.
But it is unclear whether he wants to return to that sort of work at this point in his life.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, who replaced Mr. Dole as majority leader and who would probably be part of selecting any such commission, was asked about the possibility today.
"He'd be great," Mr. Lott said. "I'm not sure he'd want to do it."
He added: "I've never discussed it with him. I think he may want to say, 'Wait, I want time to go off and think things through and kind of look to my next life.' And I'm not sure he'd want to pick that cudgel up after the way it has been demagogued by President Clinton and his allies."
Mr. Dole complained repeatedly during the campaign that the Democrats had spent millions of dollars on negative advertisements saying that Mr. Dole wanted to cut Medicare.
And it is uncertain whether the President would agree that such a commission would be necessary. "Any discussion like that is premature," said George Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser to Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Dole said in his concession speech Tuesday night that he would sit down for a few days and then stand up for causes he believed in. He has already indicated that he might devote some of his time to work on behalf of people with disabilities. His wife, Elizabeth, who took a leave of absence from her position as president of the American Red Cross, has said she would return to that job in early January.
Mr. Dole has been eager to get down to his wife's apartment in Bal Harbor, Fla., where he likes to tan by the pool. He had originally planned to leave for Florida today, but Nelson Warfield, the campaign spokesman, said those plans were still up in the air.
Mr. Dole had also hinted at having some sort of farewell news conference, but that has not materialized. A notice here at campaign headquarters announced that Mr. Dole would be available for more staff photographs on Thursday, leaving open the possibility that he might hold a news conference at the same time.
A desultory air hung over the headquarters today, with Mr. Warfield dropping in briefly to the press room for one last spin.
Looking on the bright side of Mr. Dole's loss, he said the Republicans had kept control of the House and Senate because "the energy of Senator Dole's total commitment radiated down the ballot."
Mr. Warfield also confirmed that Mr. Dole had called the President in Little Rock, Ark., at 10:25 Eastern time Tuesday night to offer his congratulations. Mr. Clinton told him that his campaign polling showed Mr. Dole making gains in the last few days, Mr. Warfield said. He said Mr. Dole described the five-minute chat as "pleasant."

 BODY:

ILLINOIS -- CLINTON
President Clinton beat Bob Dole by an even wider margin than his 14-percentage-point victory over President Bush in 1992. 
 Representative Richard J. Durbin, a seven-term Congressman from southwest Illinois, won the contest to succeed Senator Paul Simon, a 67-year-old Democrat who is retiring. He defeated Al Salvi, a wealthy conservative whose opposition to abortion and gun control and other positions led many voters to consider him too extreme.
Mr. Durbin's victory carried a stiff price for Democrats as John M. Shimkus, a Republican County Treasurer, won Mr. Durbin's seat in the 20th District, which includes Springfield, the state capital. Mr. Shimkus beat Jay C. Hoffman, a Democratic State Representative.
Democrats balanced that loss by taking back the House seat for the Fifth District, which covers Chicago's northwestern suburbs. Dan Rostenkowski, the disgraced former Ways and Means Committee chairman, held the seat until two years ago, when he lost to Representative Michael Patrick Flanagan, a Republican who was 31. Rod R. Blagojevich, a Democratic State Representative, had little trouble this year in beating Mr. Flanagan, who had gone to Washington without a clear agenda and who had trouble raising money for his campaign.
Republicans lost two seats in the State Senate but kept control, 31 seats to 28. Democrats took control of the House, winning 60 seats, while Republicans kept 58.

INDIANA -- DOLE
Indiana has voted for a Democratic candidate only once since 1932 -- for Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 -- and so it was little surprise that Bob Dole won its 12 electoral votes.
But it was a measure of his weakness that even in one of the nation's Republican bastions, President Clinton polled strongly and the Democrats held ground.
In a tight race for Governor, the Democratic candidate, Lieut. Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon, defeated Stephen Goldsmith, the Republican Mayor of Indianapolis. The victory allowed the Democrats to keep the Governor's office being vacated by Evan Bayh, a popular party member stepping down after the maximum two terms.
In the House races, the Republicans held on.
The Democrats and organized labor took aim at two freshmen Republicans, Representatives David M. McIntosh and John Hostettler, but they withstood challenges.

IOWA -- CLINTON
 Iowa gave the Democrats much cause to cheer, with voters handing the state's seven electoral votes to President Clinton for the second election in a row and re-electing a veteran liberal Senator.
 Senator Tom Harkin, who campaigned for a third term on his support for abortion rights and increasing the minimum wage, overcame a strong challenge by Representative Jim Ross Lightfoot, a six-term Republican.
 Connie McBurney, a former television weather forecaster, came short in her bid to upset Representative Greg Ganske, a freshman Republican, in the Fourth District.

KANSAS -- DOLE
As expected, the Republican Presidential nominee, Bob Dole, won his state's electoral college votes, and Kansans again elected two Republican Senators, one to fill the seat vacated by Mr. Dole, despite a split in state party unity.
Mr. Dole's sudden retirement from the Senate in May to concentrate on his campaign set off a bitter race to fill the remaining two years of his Senate term. Sam Brownback, a Republican House freshman, won the primary, but not without angering party moderates.
But Mr. Dole's position at the top of the ticket and the traditional Republican hold on Kansas politics helped Mr. Brownback defeat his Democratic opponent, Jill Docking.
Representative Todd Tiahrt, a freshman Republican, became the state's senior House member.

MICHIGAN -- CLINTON
A vigorous auto industry and a strong economy left Michigan residents feeling kindly this year toward incumbents. After a costly election campaign in which organized labor, big business and the national parties spent millions of dollars, voters chose to re-elect President Clinton, Senator Carl Levin and all but two of their 16 Representatives in Congress. Ronna Romney, a conservative Republican who opposed abortion and gun control in her run against Mr. Levin, had difficulty reaching beyond her rural base of support.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Republican Party poured money into the House race for the Eighth District in central Michigan, one of the nation's most closely watched contests. Representative Dick Chrysler, a freshman Republican, lost his seat to Debbie Stabenow, a Democratic state legislator.
With most of the votes counted, a state referendum allowing the construction of three casinos in Detroit appeared likely to be approved. Detroit has been losing tourists for years to casinos in Windsor, Ontario.

MINNESOTA -- CLINTON
President Clinton's success never appeared in doubt in this traditional Democratic stronghold, now the only state to vote Democratic in the last six elections. But the fight for the Senate seat held by Paul Wellstone was one of the most competitive in the nation -- and one of the nastiest.
Mr. Wellstone easily prevailed in a rematch against the Republican former senator he narrowly defeated in 1990, Rudy Boschwitz. He did so despite a barrage of negative advertisments by Mr. Boschwitz and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which repeatedly called the Senator "embarrassingly liberal."
The outcome appeared to show the limits of negative advertising. According to one poll before Tuesday's vote, 44 percent of those who saw the advertisements said they made them more likely to vote for his opponent. At the same time, Mr. Boschwitz's approval ratings sank, while Mr. Wellstone's rose.
In the House races, Democrats held seats they narrowly won two years ago, but so did the Republicans. In one of the most competitive races, Gil Gutknecht, a freshman Republican singled out by Democrats and labor as vulnerable, fended off a challenge by Mary Rieder, an economics professor.

Missouri delivered its 11 electoral votes to President Clinton by 7 percentage points, a narrower margin than the 10-point cushion in Mr. Clinton's victory over George Bush.
The first-term Governor, Mel Carnahan, coasted to victory over his Republican challenger, Margaret Kelly, the State Auditor.
Most House incumbents won re-election easily, including James M. Talent, a two-term Republican who won a rematch with a former Democratic Congresswoman, Joan Kelly Horn. But Representative Harold L. Volkmer, a 10-term Democrat, fell to his Republican opponent, Kenny Hulshof. Mr. Volkmer had defeated Mr. Hulshof by only six percentage points in 1994.

NEBRASKA -- DOLE
Although Nebraska began the election season with two Democratic Senators, it is a conservative state and proved to be a Republican stronghold this time around.
When Senator Jim Exon, a three-term Democrat, announced his retirement, the Democrats were able to persuade Gov. Ben Nelson, who is enormously popular in the state, to run for the open seat. But the victor was the Republican, Chuck Hagel, an Omaha businessman.
Both candidates ran on conservative platforms, although Mr. Hagel's campaign was noteworthy in that it featured earnest and explicit support for Bob Dole's call for a large Federal tax cut. Both candidates presented themselves as abortion opponents.

NORTH DAKOTA -- DOLE
Only once since 1944 has a Democrat carried North Dakota, and that was in the Johnson landslide of 1964. George Bush carried the state easily four years ago, despite a strong showing by Ross Perot, who took 23 percent of the vote. And though a poll in mid-October showed President Clinton ahead, North Dakota held true to form this year, giving its three electoral votes to Bob Dole.
Democratic Congressional candidates have always fared better in North Dakota than Democratic Presidential candidates have, perhaps reflecting the state's populist, agrarian history. Both Senators, Byron L. Dorgan and Kent Conrad, are Democrats, as is the state's House member, Earl Pomeroy, the only member of the Congressional delegation up for re-election this year. And despite the strong showing by Mr. Dole, Mr. Pomeroy cruised to re-election.
Mr. Pomeroy won by emphasizing his moderate voting record and arguing that his challenger, Kevin Cramer, would push a radical Republican agenda.
Gov. Edward T. Schafer, a Republican, easily won a second term against Lee Kaldor, a member of the State House.

OHIO -- CLINTON
President Clinton won Ohio, though the race tightened a bit toward the end. No Republican has won the White House without Ohio in this century, and its bellwether status continued.
The main suspense for the state involved Congress, where the Republicans captured four House seats from the Democrats two years ago. These freshmen were all vulnerable along with a sophomore, Martin R. Hoke, whose comments about a female journalist's anatomy weakened him.
Mr. Hoke lost to Dennis J. Kucinich, a Democrat, who as a 32-year-old Mayor of Cleveland presided over his city's bankruptcy two decades ago. Mr. Kucinich is currently a State Senator.
Representative Frank A. Cremeans of the Sixth District in Appalachia looked to be the most threatened of the Republican freshmen as he faced Ted Strickland, a Democrat, in a rematch.
In their 1994 race, Mr. Cremeans's margin was just two percentage points. And Mr. Cremeans narrowly lost his seat in a contest regarded as a referendum on the Republican agenda, which Mr. Strickland, a psychologist who held the seat from 1992 to 94, criticized as hurting working people and the poor.
The three other Republican freshmen -- Steve Chabot, Bob Ney and Steven C. LaTourette -- all retained their seats. Representative Tom Sawyer, a five-term Democrat who squeaked to victory last time, fended off a challenge from Joyce George, a Republican who is a former United States Attorney and state judge.

SOUTH DAKOTA -- DOLE
In one of the toughest Senate races this year, Larry Pressler, a Republican, became the only incumbent to be dismissed by voters. He was defeated by Representative Tim Johnson, a Democrat.
Mr. Pressler, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, was seeking a fourth term. A close contest had been expected but there was no gauge of the situation until late last month, when the first independent poll in the race showed Mr. Johnson with a 10 percentage point lead.
Mr. Johnson, who was elected to Congress in 1986, had accused Mr. Pressler of blocking campaign finance reform and of not supporting farmers strongly enough. Mr. Pressler had accused his opponent of supporting "Washington's failed liberal philosophy of tax-and-spend versus South Dakota's conservative, common-sense values."
The race was followed closely by national party officials. South Dakota's other Senator is Tom Daschle, a Democrat and the minority leader.
Mr. Daschle's longtime staff director, Rick Weiland, lost the fight for Mr. Johnson's old job, the state's lone House seat. The victor was John Thune, a Republican businessman and onetime aide to the former Senator Jim Abdnor.
Bob Dole won a tight race for South Dakota's three electoral votes.

WISCONSIN -- CLINTON
With a booming economy and a lack of major controversies, voters in Wisconsin maintained the status quo, re-electing all Congressional incumbents.
As expected, President Clinton beat Bob Dole. Although Mr. Dole gained in the polls in the state as the election neared, he still all but wrote off Wisconsin after the Republican convention this summer.
In the First Congressional District, the Republican incumbent, Mark W. Neumann, a supporter of Newt Gingrich and the Contract With America, defeated his Democratic opponent, Lydia Spottswood. In the Second District, the Republican incumbent, Scott L. Klug, defeated the Democratic candidate, Paul R. Soglin. Mr. Soglin had sought to tie Mr. Klug to Mr. Gingrich by morphing Mr. Klug's image into that of Mr. Gingrich in a television advertisement. Mr. Klug countered with a commercial in which his image was morphed back from that of Mr. Gingrich.

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: THE PRESIDENCY -- THE VOTERS;
Half the Electorate, Perhaps Satisfied or Bored, Sat Out Voting

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

 BODY:
About 49 percent of the nation's voting-age population went to the polls on Tuesday, the lowest level for a Presidential election since 1924, according to the Voter News Service, a consortium of six major news organizations that provides exit-poll information.
Several hundred thousand uncounted absentee ballots could eventually lift the national tally beyond 50.3 percent, the turnout in 1988. 
 Political analysts said Tuesday's low turnout reflected a largely static Presidential campaign, an electorate that is generally satisfied with the economy, compared with the recession of 1992, and a troubling, long-term set of institutional problems with the country's political parties.
"We have misaligned political parties," said Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, which tracks turnout. "We have a Republican Party that's way to the right of center. We have a Democratic Party that is so poll-driven that it doesn't have a consistent message, and it's targeting the middle class, which leaves out the poorer people."
In the 1992 Presidential election, 55.1 percent of those 18 or older voted, reversing a steady decline in turnout since 62.8 percent of the voting population went to the polls when John F. Kennedy ran against Richard M. Nixon in 1960. In 1972, the first year in which 18-year-olds could vote, turnout was also 55.2 percent.
Prof. Sidney Verba, a professor of government at Harvard University, said voter turnout was likely to hover around 50 percent, with only minor variations.
"It's reached a low plateau where it bounces up and down, depending on the particulars of the election," Professor Verba said. "There was a lot of negativity in this campaign, and many people were not thrilled by either candidate."
But Mr. Gans disagreed with the idea that this campaign was not interesting. He argued that the candidates, if judged on their merits, should have attracted a much larger turnout.
"Bob Dole, Bill Clinton, Jack Kemp and Al Gore are the best set of four candidates we've had since 1960," Mr. Gans said. "They're intelligent; they're experienced; they're knowledgeable."
Maybe so. But in the most recent New York Times/CBS News Poll just before the election, 42 percent of those surveyed said they would describe the Presidential race as interesting, compared with 75 percent who felt that way about the 1992 Presidential race.
"The campaign has been pretty dull, and everyone thinks they've known the results," said Murray Edelman, editorial director of the Voter News Service, a consortium of the five major television networks and The Associated Press.
Mr. Edelman said the decline in turnout was a national trend. In the East, the turnout on Tuesday was 49 percent, down 6 percent from 1992; in the Midwest, 54 percent, down 8 percent; in the South, 46 percent, down 5 percent; in the West, 46 percent, down 8 percent. Over all, Mr. Edelman said, turnout will be 48 to 49 percent.
If those numbers hold firm, the national turnout will be the lowest since 43.8 percent of the voting-age population went to the polls in 1924, when women were newly enfranchised and many were unfamiliar with voting. And several restrictive registration laws were in place that discriminated against immigrants.
But many indicators today suggest that voter participation should be increasing, not decreasing. The well-educated baby boom generation is getting older, and older people are more likely to vote than younger people. More than five million new voters have registered since the National Voter Registration Act, or motor-voter law, went into effect in 1995. Registration is probably at the highest level since 1968, when 68 percent of eligible voters registered.
Both political parties and several major interest groups, like the A.F.L.-C.I.O., marshaled thousands of volunteers to persuade people to vote this week.
Some political analysts attributed the Republicans' ability to retain control of the House and Senate to Mr. Dole's whirlwind dash at the end of the campaign.
"We believe that turnout would have been even lower had it not been for the Dole dash at the end," said Mary Crawford, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. "It really energized the grass roots and our base."

HEADLINE: Serbs Said to Ship Arms to Libya In Effort to Evade U.N. Sanctions

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Nov. 5

 BODY:
For three hours last August a lumbering Russian transport plane, its lights and instrument panels shut down in a power failure, desperately circled low over Belgrade until it crashed as it made an emergency landing at Surcin International Airport.
Shortly after the doomed IL-76 plowed into a nearby corn field, a series of secondary explosions illuminated the night sky, eyewitnesses said. Well-armed Serbian police officers immediately cordoned off a wide area around the crash site. And when the Russian Ambassador arrived at the airport he was denied entry, although 11 Russian crew members lay dead in the wreckage. . 
 Western embassies, drawing on carefully guarded intelligence sources, recently concluded that the plane was on its way to the Mediterranean island of Malta with a clandestine military cargo bound for Libya -- a violation of United Nations sanctions imposed on Libya for its refusal to extradite suspects in the December, 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Scotland.
Western diplomats have determined that this cargo was only one of several that have been sent covertly in the last few months to Malta and on to Libya by Serbia's Government-run arms manufacturers.
"Libya and Yugoslavia have a long history of arms dealing," said a senior European military official, "and this continued after the breakup of Yugoslavia and even during the war directed against the Muslims by the Serbs. But we had managed to get Belgrade to shut down most of this trafficking of arms. Now the pipeline is open again."
American officials said they have quietly told senior Serbian officials they are "concerned" about the arms dealing with Tripoli and want it stopped. But Washington has stopped short of directly blaming the Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian President, who is now considered a key American partner in the Balkans, for the arms trafficking.
"Sometimes," said a senior Western diplomat in defense of Mr. Milosevic, "the right hand here does not always know what the left hand is doing."
Serbian officials deny that they are involved in arms shipments to Libya and dispute the report, which has circulated in the opposition press in Belgrade, that weapons were aboard the Russian aircraft.
But other Western diplomats said they thought it unlikely that the arms trade was being carried out without the direct approval of Mr. Milosevic, whose security apparatus keeps close track of arms trade inside and outside the country.
A major Serbian arms dealer, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity, acknowledged that he and other senior arms industry managers had flown to Tunis in July and driven overland to Tripoli for a meeting with Libyan officials. This official, however, refused to say what was discussed at the meeting or whether any arms deals had been negotiated.
Western officials both here and in Washington, were unable to say how extensive the trafficking is or exactly what types of weapons were involved. They said that the cargo on the Russian transport was relatively innocuous and included crates of military flares to decoy heat seeking missiles, tires for military fighter planes and other spare parts.
"We think what is being shipped is primarily spare parts for weapons, for planes, military vehicles and some small arms," said a European military official, "but our intelligence on this is not as good as it should be."
Belgrade has re-opened the arms trade with Libya to bolster its sagging arms industry and, perhaps, to continue the barter arrangement Belgrade had set up before the war to receive Libyan oil.
Yugoslavia's arms industry, once one of the largest in Europe, has been badly hurt by the imposition of economic sanctions during the war and by a lack of foreign investment.
Ties between the Libyans and Yugoslavs date back to the mid-1970's when Belgrade became a major exporter of arms to the North African nation. The Yugoslav arms industry, which sold $2 billion worth of weaponry abroad in the 1980's, did $600 million trade each year with Libya. The arms transactions declined with the outbreak of the war in Bosnia in 1992, according to former Yugoslav army commanders.
"Libya was a special country for the Yugoslav arms industry," said Lieut. Gen. Martin Spegelj, a retired officer who now lives in Zagreb.
"The Libyans bought planes from the Soviet Union, but Yugoslavia trained all the pilots, the maintenance teams and the ground crews," General Spegelj said. "We sent many Yugoslav pilots to fly for the Libyan Air Force. The Libyans bought a wide variety of weapons from Yugoslavia, including all types of infantry weapons, heavy 122-millimeter and 152-millimeter howitzers, ammunition, multiple rocket launchers, tanks and armored personnel carriers. All these transactions were secret. We had a hard time with the accounts and often received oil in exchange for the weapons."
Since war erupted in Yugoslavia, the island of Malta has long been a staging area for for Libyan efforts to evade the sanctions, Western diplomats contend.
The United Nations sanctions against Libya forbid the export of military equipment, spare parts, weapons or ammmunition. They also call on member nations to bar all flights from their territory to Libya, unless they have been approved in advance by the United Nations sanctions committee as meeting a "significant humanitarian need." In New York, a diplomat said no country has reported the possible Yugoslav violations of the sanctions to the United Nations Libya sanctions committee.
It was in Malta that two Libyan agents planted the bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, according to American investigators. The attack, and refusal by the Libyans to turn the two men over for trial, resulted in sanctions being imposed on Libya.
The use of Russian transport planes, usually hired by Serbian companies based in Cyprus, is a common arrangement made by Yugoslav arms dealers, Western diplomats said. During the war, when sanctions were in force against Belgrade, dozens of Cypriot companies, set up by senior Serbian officials and businessmen, carried out millions of dollars in illegal trade for Belgrade, according to American officials.
The Russian plane that crashed near the Belgrade airport belonged to Spair Airlines, a company that operates out of Ekaterinenburg, Russia, airport officials said.
The plane was carrying cargo for a Cyprus-based company called Mensus Trade, these officials said. The company is owned by Misko Djordjevic, a Serbian businessman, according to these officials.
A spokesman for Spair Airlines told reporters shortly after the Aug. 19 crash that the plane had been carrying sports equipment, spare tires and spare parts for sports cars, as well as signal rockets. According to reports in the Serbian press, the spokesman asserted that the cargo did not violate the sanctions, but he said it was headed for Libya.

HEADLINE: Shanghai Journal;
Merry Mayor (No Dour Red He) to Come Calling

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Nov. 6

 BODY:
The Mayor of Shanghai, Xu Kuangdi, shares a few things with his counterpart in New York City: an array of problems that demand immediate attention in his country's largest city, a love of classical music and a determination to comb his hair over a gradually balding pate.
While Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani may best be known for toughness and zeal, however, Mayor Xu is striking for his affability and self-deprecation, revealed in an engaging smile and a hearty laugh. 
 "I'm not very good-looking," said Mr. Xu (whose name is pronounced shoo kwahng-dee), laughing again as a reporter prepared to take his picture. "I look even worse in a photograph."
Mr. Xu, 58, is a refreshing contrast to most government officials in China, who typically follow a strict, dour Communist Party line when appearing in public. Mr. Xu speaks with a disarming openness about problems and challenges, and easily sprinkles historical references into his conversation.
The careful listener will find that Mr. Xu's comments on government policy do not vary in substance from those made by his more impassive fellow officials. And he is not exactly accessible. An interview, his first with an American publication since he became Mayor, came 20 months after he took office.
But Mr. Xu's manner is so friendly and direct that he is easily one of China's best ambassadors to the West, routinely charming businessmen and diplomats, and even journalists.
As China and the United States work to mend relations, Beijing is sending Mr. Xu on a 10-day visit to New York, Washington and Los Angeles, starting on Friday.
When he glad-hands business executives and members of Congress, and makes a scheduled stop at the White House, Mr. Xu will be able to speak a language Americans understand. His English is fluent.
Even more than that, Mr. Xu has a worldly perspective that allows him to describe China's concerns in a context that is comprehensible to non-Chinese. It comes, in part, from spending nearly two years in Sweden and Britain as a visiting scholar in the 1980's, a time that also nourished his devotion to classical music.
"I like Mozart and Tchaikovsky," Mr. Xu said with a grin. "Civil servants are not allowed to listen to music in their offices, to keep them quiet. But I can be more efficient if I have music."
"When I want to get pepped up, I put on Mozart," Mr. Xu went on, breaking into a bar from "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik": "dum, dah-dum, dah-dum-DUM-DUM-DUM-DUM!"
If he doesn't seem like an ordinary Chinese politician, it may be because Mr. Xu came to politics late in life. Originally a college professor, Mr. Xu joined an advisory group to Mayor Zhu Rongji of Shanghai on how to develop the city into an international business center, and got to know Mr. Zhu, now a Deputy Prime Minister and China's economic czar.
As Mr. Xu has told the story, the two men were on a trip to Europe when Mr. Zhu asked him over breakfast to head Shanghai's Planning Commission, a producer of thick, arguably useless documents.
"But I don't believe in planning," Mr. Xu replied.
"That's what we need, someone with new ideas," said Mr. Zhu, who became his political mentor.
As Mr. Zhu was promoted, moving to Beijing as a Politburo member, so was Mr. Xu. He became Mayor in February 1995. Though he runs the city government, he is still subordinate to Huang Ju, the Communist Party chief here.
At a news conference last year, Mr. Xu was asked to talk about his private life, ordinarily taboo for a politician in China.
"For Chinese leaders, this is a tricky question," he said. "We don't usually talk about this."
Then he smiled and proceeded to talk about it anyway.
Mr. Xu volunteered that his wife is a professor at Shanghai University. "We have an agreement: she doesn't participate in my work -- not like that Mrs. Clinton -- and I don't interfere in hers."
He was also unexpectedly honest about why he joined the Communist Party so late, at age 45.
"They wouldn't let me in," he said with a chuckle. "I did not come from a family of workers or farmers. My parents were intellectuals."
Mr. Xu has not lost his taste for academia. Despite a hectic schedule, he still tutors a few graduate students, and prefers his closest aides to call him Teacher Xu rather than Mayor Xu.
Teacher Xu inevitably drops historical references into conversation, whether it is about the growth of an American securities market a century ago or Germany's postwar recovery. There is no easy historical precedent, however, for the transition under way in Shanghai, a city of 14 million residents, plus 3 million or so transient workers.
"In America, a mayor is essentially responsible for public safety and public service," Mr. Xu said. "A mayor in China has to take care of these things, and much more."
There is a vast construction agenda: a subway, a cross-harbor tunnel, an airport and a rash of skyscrapers and highways are all being built, requiring 1.2 million people to move. There is a constant campaign to win domestic and foreign investment. And on top of that, Mr. Xu has to supervise the shift from a planned to a market economy in Shanghai.
"I don't have any time to play golf or tennis," Mr. Xu said, laughing again. "It would be easier to be Mayor of New York."

HEADLINE: Canada Defends Reactor Sale To China, Dismissing Outcry

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Anti-nuclear groups today denounced the expected sale of two nuclear reactors to China, but the Government, unwilling to lose business in the world's biggest market, said that it had no qualms about the $3 billion deal.
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who has aggressively sought to increase Canadian exports to Asia, is expected to sign a final agreement on the sale during a trade mission to China this month. 
 A coalition of groups opposed to the deal released a study today titled "Exporting Disaster," which calls the sale immoral and economically unsound. The study by the Campaign for Nuclear Phaseout said that the Canadian Government, in order to sell the reactors, "looks the other way when it comes to economics, human rights violations and nuclear proliferation."
The study says Canada should follow the example of the United States in barring the export of reactors to China because China has supplied nuclear technology to other nations on the brink of building atomic bombs.
The so-called "Candu" reactors are manufactured by the state-controlled Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., which recently signed a deal with Romania making it the first Western company to supply reactors to a former East Bloc country.
The study says the pursuit of buyers for the reactors has led to the erosion of Canada's human rights policies.
Potential customers, "such as China, Indonesia and Turkey are among the worst human rights violators in the world, and Canada should not be selling them nuclear reactors," said Kristen Ostling, of the coalition.
Mr. Chretien, responding to charges that Canada is overlooking China's human rights violations, said last month that a high-principled "Boy Scout" approach would cost Canada jobs while having no effect on Chinese policy.
Charles Larabie, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Canada was deeply concerned by the spread of nuclear weapons and technology. But he said the Government felt there was adequate international monitoring of China's commitment to use Canadian technology only for peaceful purposes.
He said that while the sale had substantial economic benefits for Canada, it would also help China meet a pressing need for cleaner energy production. Coal, China's main source of energy, is also the country's main source of air pollution.
"We're quite comfortable," Mr. Larabie said. "This is a business partner with whom we want to develop a long-term business relationship."
Past sales of Canadian reactors to India and Pakistan led to friction when both countries refused to commit to nonproliferation.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Business Was a Big Winner, Too

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
The race for the White House and the battle to control Congress may have dominated the election news, but what stood out for corporate America was the defeat of a host of state ballot initiatives that were intended to circumscribe the ability of business to operate freely.
From California, where voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposition fought vigorously by Silicon Valley that would have made it easier to sue companies for misleading investors, to Maine, where a timber industry-sponsored alternative won out over an outright ban on clear-cutting, business almost always got its way on Election Day. And health maintenance organizations emerged from the fray still largely free to set their own rules after proposals in California and Oregon to impose certain limits fell well short of majorities. 
 All this suggests that Americans' on-again, off-again flirtation with antibusiness causes is off again.
"The public is less angry and less willing to identify with populism," said Thomas Mann, director of Governmental Studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington. To sustain a healthy economy, he added, "there's a certain sobriety out there -- a new understanding that we need a strong private sector."
But business, while successful in playing defense, did not win any great victories for its own causes, either. There was disappointment in certain business circles, particularly among entrepreneurs, that the Republicans did not put Bob Dole in the White House and achieve the kind of overwhelming majority in Congress that would let conservatives set an agenda of sharply lower capital gains taxes and less Government regulation.
And the gambling industry, after spending more than $6 million around the country, achieved only modest gains. Arkansas voters blocked casinos and Ohio rejected riverboat gambling while voters in Michigan agreed to allow casinos in Detroit. Riverboat casinos can stay in Louisiana but 34 of the state's 64 parishes voted out video poker.
Still, if the rise in the stock market is any indicator, Wall Street was generally pleased that the status quo was left intact in Washington and that neither party will be able to impose a liberal or a conservative ideology without having to compromise with its opponents.
If anything had set off alarm bells in corporate board rooms, it was California's Proposition 211, the shareholder measure that was one of the highest-profile ballot initiatives in the country. The simplest explanation for the result is that the proponents, a handful of law firms specializing in securities suits, were outspent by business interests, which raised more than twice as much as the lawyers managed to collect for advertising. But the extent of its defeat -- it went down by a vote of 74 percent to 26 percent -- indicates that voters found no good reason to change the rules of the game governing business.
Under current law, owners of corporate stock can sue for damages in Federal court if they believe that management fraud -- bogus claims of valuable new inventions, for example -- have lowered the value of their shares. But business leaders, particularly those in high-technology fields heavily concentrated in California, have long asserted that William S. Lerach, the flamboyant lawyer based in San Diego, and a few other "strike suit" specialists, were trying to convert stockholders' clear right to a day in court into an anticapitalist money machine.
When a stock price tumbles in response to bad news, a number of lawyers have routinely filed class-action suits on behalf of all stockholders. Most companies settled, rather than deal with the expense of going to court and the risk, albeit small, that a jury might bankrupt the corporation. Mr. Lerach's firm says it has pursued some 400 cases, with settlements totaling $5 billion. The firm's average income: $100 million a year.
When Congress overrode President Clinton's veto last year and approved legislation that made it more difficult to win a class-action securities suit in Federal court, Mr. Lerach turned to the California voters. Proposition 211 would have nullified the impact for strike suits filed in California courts. And since most big companies have stockholders in California, the effect would have been felt nationally -- in effect, trumping the Federal law.
Initially, Proposition 211 looked like a winner. After all, California voters had rejected a tough anti-strike suit initiative sponsored by business by a margin of 60 to 40 percent in the March primary election. But led by business luminaries including Andrew Grove of Intel; Tom Proulx, a founder of Intuit, and John Doerr, a venture capitalist, Silicon Valley fought back with a vengeance.
Their coalition scrambled for endorsements from brand-name Democrats as well as from Republicans. They even managed to get one from President Clinton, who, to Silicon Valley's surprise and dismay, had sided with the trial lawyers in the Congressional battle last year.
The vote, however, will not bury the issue for good.
"Our opponents claim California has adequate protection from fraud under current law," said Sean Crowley, spokesman for the pro-Proposition 211 campaign. "So if they try to strip investors' protections in the future, we will fight them tooth and nail."
Meanwhile, Mr. Proulx, who served as chairman of the business coalition against the measure, said, "We expect them to come back again, maybe not in California, maybe somewhere else."
But judging by the results around the country, business may have little to worry about right now.
In Florida, voters defeated a penny-a-pound tax on sugar to restore the Everglades, which environmentalists argued was being destroyed by fertilizer runoffs from the cane fields to the north. In Maine they backed a proposition endorsed by the paper industry as an alternative to a prohibition on clear-cutting private forest land that had been put on the ballot by the state's Green Party. In Montana, they rejected tougher anti-pollution standards for waste water from mines. In Oregon, they nixed new regulations designed to reduce livestock waste in streams and rivers.
In Colorado, Missouri and Montana, voters rejected higher state minimum wages while in states like California, Nevada, South Dakota, and Florida, they made it more difficult to raise state or local taxes. One of the few exceptions to the trend was in Oregon, where voters approved a new 68-cents-a-pack tax on cigarettes to help pay for a state health care program.
Most significant, perhaps, California voters also rejected high-profile ballot initiatives that would have barred health maintenance organizations from giving physicians any financial incentive to withhold treatment, or ordering physicians to withhold information on treatment not financed under an H.M.O.'s plan. Just a month ago, the tide seemed to be running the other way: Congress and the White House had rushed through Federal legislation prohibiting H.M.O.'s from encouraging "drive-through deliveries" -- the practice of sending new mothers home after one day in the hospital.
All politics is local, goes the old saw. And local politics surely did play a big part in determining the winners of the state initiatives. In Florida, Big Sugar spent a fortune to persuade conservative upstate voters that others were responsible for damage to the Everglades, and that thousands of jobs in the sugar industry were on the line. In Maine the paper industry cleverly positioned itself as the moderate middle, warning that an outright ban would cost 15,000 jobs. In California, opponents of Proposition 211 appealed to Californians' pride in the achievements of its electronics and biotechnology industries.
"When business gets its act together," concluded Lester Brickman, a professor at the Cardoza Law School in New York, "it can win."

HEADLINE: Wall Street Votes: Dow Soars 96.53

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Investors and voters seem to agree: They want more of the same.
The Dow Jones industrial average soared 96.53 points, to 6,177.71 yesterday, setting a closing high for the first time since Oct. 18, as Wall Street showed it thinks a renewal of the political status quo was the best possible election outcome. 
 The bond market did not join in the celebration, with sentiment there weighed down by a lack of enthusiastic buyers for a new 10-year Treasury bond issue.
But in the stock market, the 24 hours after the elections witnessed a number of trading stretches -- the first just as the Congressional election returns became clear -- in which prices spurted upward.
"Wall Street loves it," said David Shulman, the chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, speaking of the election results.
The stock market had concluded some time ago that it liked a divided Government, with a Democratic President and the Republican Congress able to block extreme measures from each other.
"It's hard to believe that Wall Street would applaud so loudly for continued gridlock," said Hugh Johnson, the chief investment officer at First Albany. But that, he said, is what it is doing.
In recent weeks, it had been taken for granted that President Clinton would win re-election, but there was some concern that the Democrats might be able to regain control of the House of Representatives, and perhaps even the Senate. That had led to some money managers selling stock index futures, a tactic that would have protected them in the event of a market decline.
Instead, with the Republicans keeping control of Congress, those money managers have had to buy back the stock index futures -- buying that has helped push share prices higher in recent days.
Stock index futures, unlike the stock market itself, now trade almost around the clock, and futures on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index began to rise sharply just after 9 P.M. on Tuesday, as the Republicans voiced confidence that they would hold on to Capitol Hill.
Prices settled back early in the morning -- a time dominated by Japanese traders -- then began rising again after the stock market opened in New York yesterday morning. The rally calmed down late in the morning, but then surged again in the afternoon.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also set a closing high yesterday, gaining 10.45 points, to 724.59. The Nasdaq composite gained 16.42 points, to 1,245.49, though it remains below the high it established last month.
Some of the strongest stocks were viewed as beneficiaries of election results directly or of the checks maintained on Democratic power. For instance, tobacco stocks rallied, with Philip Morris up 3 7/8 a share, to 97 3/8. Health maintenance organizations, which survived hostile ballot propositions in California, also did well. United Healthcare added 3, to 40 1/8, and Oxford Health was up 4 5/8, to 51 1/2.
It is no wonder that investors might like the idea of a Democratic President and a Republican Congress. The last two years have been among the best ever on Wall Street. Measured from Election Day 1994 to Election Day 1996, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 58.7 percent, making it the third-best two-year period since the Dow was reformulated during World War I.
Bears -- there are still some -- may take pleasure from what has happened following the three other Congresses that saw moves of 50 percent or better in the Dow. Those were in 1926-28, 1934-36, and 1984-86. In each case, the market suffered a substantial setback during the next term.
Many on Wall Street believe that the standoff for control of the Government will mean continued progress on reducing the budget deficit, though some worry that progress itself might prove to be a problem should the economy slow and require some fiscal stimulus.
And there is some optimistic talk that the two political parties will be able to find common ground on reining in expensive entitlement programs -- this despite the fact that many Democrats ran on a platform of denouncing Republican efforts to do just that.
Economically sensitive stocks, which do the best when the economy is growing strongly, have generally lagged in the current rally, a sign that investors do not expect much stimulus for the economy. One such stock, that of General Motors, was down fractionally yesterday, while consumer goods companies, which suffer less in a weak economy, did well. Procter & Gamble rose 3 1/8 a share, to 105 1/8.
While the stock market was zooming, many other financial markets showed little if any change. The bond market, which had been rallying in recent weeks, showed small price declines, with the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, which moves in the opposite direction to its price, rising three-hundredths of a percentage point, to 6.61 percent.
The dollar was marginally lower, though the moves seemed to have more to do with overseas events than with reaction to the elections. And gold prices, which have been edging down amid a total lack of concern over inflation, continued to do so. Gold for December delivery fell 90 cents, to $378.70 an ounce.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Ruling

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the ruling yesterday by Judge Denise Cote of Federal District Court in Manhattan barring the Giuliani administration from forcing Time Warner to add the Fox News Channel to its cable system.
I find that the evidence at the hearing establishes the following, when taken as a whole. In response to learning that it had not won the bidding battle with MSNBC, Fox used its direct access to the Mayor to seek the city's assistance. The city, in a strategy developed and executed by the Mayor's senior staff, then undertook to convince and, if necessary, force Time Warner to place Fox News on one of Time Warner's commercial channels. Fox and the city understood and agreed that Fox News could not run on television for any significant length of time without commercials, and, therefore, it was essential that Time Warner be convinced to place Fox News on a commercial channel. . . . 
 With respect to the city's purported desire to increase the diversity of news programs available to New Yorkers, it must be observed as an initial matter that it is not self-evident that this is in fact a constitutionally permissible purpose when the city has favored specific speakers in pursuit of this goal. . . .
The conclusion is inescapable that the city's intonation of the rubric "diversity" is a thinly disguised reference to its preference for the editorial content of Fox News. As such, this rationale for the city's actions cannot constitute a permissible purpose for its actions. The city's second justification fares no better. While the economic health of a city and the preservation and creation of jobs is an appropriate and essential concern of city government, the record here does not indicate that this concern was other than pretextual in the context of this dispute. . . .
The city's actions create a chilling effect under which Time Warner will feel pressure to capitulate to city requests that it accommodate a New York City commercial programmer who has direct access to City Hall. In such cases, if Time Warner refuses the city's requests, then the city can simply turn Crosswalks into a competing commercial system of channels. . . .
The city's purpose in acting to compel Time Warner to give Fox one of its commercial channels was to reward a friend and to further a particular viewpoint. As a consequence, Fox was the recipient of special advocacy. The very fact that the city chose Fox News out of all other news programs -- not to mention the significant number of other programs which have been denied space on Time Warner's commercial network -- is by itself substantial evidence that the city chose Fox News based on its content. . . .
The city has engaged in a pattern of conduct with the purpose of compelling Time Warner to alter its constitutionally protected editorial decision not to carry Fox News. The city's actions violated longstanding First Amendment principles that are the foundation of our democracy. . . .

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: THE REGION -- THE VOTERS;
Fear of G.O.P. Cuts Emerges In Clinton's Northeast Sweep

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
New York State barely saw Bill Clinton during the campaign, and its economy remains sluggish. Yet the President's overall victory in the popular vote on Tuesday stemmed in large part from substantial margins from New York and surrounding states, support that both Democrats and Republicans said demonstrated clear regional support for the government programs Mr. Clinton vowed to preserve.
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut combined to produce nearly one-third of President Clinton's 7.6-million-vote margin of victory. Add Massachusetts and Rhode Island to the mix and the percentage of his margin goes up to 44. 
 In New York State, it appeared Bob Dole was able to win only 11 counties, compared with the 33 taken by George Bush in 1992. (Several counties were still too close to call.) Areas around New York City where Mr. Bush did well four years ago, like Orange and Suffolk Counties, moved solidly into the Democratic column this year.
Mr. Clinton took 57 percent of the three states' vote -- 59 percent in New York, 53 percent in New Jersey and 52 percent in Connecticut. The regional sweep was galling to local Republican leaders, who watched helplessly as the Dole-Kemp campaign wrote off the area in favor of the South and West.
"We've got a problem on our hands," said Guy V. Molinari, the Borough President of Staten Island, who was the city chairman of the Dole campaign. "Our party is in bad shape in this area of the country, and we're going to have to deal with it. I can't fault them for not campaigning here, but it had a big impact. I had people calling and asking for bumper stickers, and there were none to be had."
Mr. Molinari agreed with his Democratic counterparts that the Northeast remained so much more reliant on the kinds of government programs that Republicans had tried to cut that the outcome was not surprising after the party's takeover of Congress in 1994.
Bill Lynch, the New York City Democratic strategist who assembled the coalition that elected Mayor David N. Dinkins in 1989, said the President was able to rely on an ingredient more potent than even the economy: fear.
"It was fear of the Republican agenda, pure and simple," Mr. Lynch said. "People in the Northeast felt that the Republicans went too far with their contract, on issues like Medicaid and school aid. Those are the issues that really resonate around here."
Exit polls taken around the country on Tuesday showed a striking difference between New Yorkers and residents of other states in their views of whether government should be doing more or less to solve problems. Half the New Yorkers surveyed said the notion that government should be doing more was closer to their view. By contrast, only 40 percent of those in Florida felt that way, 38 percent in Ohio, 37 percent in California and 31 percent in Texas.
Republican setbacks in the region were not limited to the Presidential race. Of the handful of House seats picked up by Democrats, one each came from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. In the New York State Assembly -- where in 1994 Republicans, fresh from their victory over Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, vowed to take 20 seats -- the party actually lost a seat on Tuesday. Party leaders said they were lucky the defeat wasn't worse.
"It was a great night for us being able to hold on to what we had, in light of the Dole campaign not campaigning in this state," said Thomas M. Reynolds, the Assembly minority leader, from western New York. "I think we overcame great odds in light of the whole climate out there."
Mr. Dole found himself unable to reach many of the demographic and ideological groups that might have formed the base of his support, exit polls showed. In fact, name the demographic group in New York State, and Mr. Clinton won it on Tuesday: all races, all religions, all income groups, all ages, all educational levels, both sexes. Only in certain demographic subgroups, like white non-Catholic Christians, did Mr. Dole win small pluralities.
A majority of independent voters in New York State supported Mr. Clinton, who also picked up 18 percent of voters who said they voted for George Bush in 1992, and 23 percent of the 1992 vote for Ross Perot. (Mr. Perot only won 34 percent of those who voted for him in 1992, exit polls indicated; 40 percent of those voters went for Mr. Dole this time.) The President also won 29 percent of those voters who consider themselves conservative.
Mr. Clinton got more than three-fourths of the vote in New York City, where his margin was 28 percent greater than it was four years ago. In several Assembly districts dominated by black voters, Mr. Dole barely appeared to be on the ballot. In the 55th District, in Brownsville, Brooklyn, Mr. Dole received only 324 votes, compared with 23,084 for Mr. Clinton. In the 70th District, in Harlem, Mr. Dole received 684 votes, and Mr. Clinton got 30,819.
But the decisive turnaround came in the suburbs -- the swing voters of Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland Counties -- where Mr. Clinton's margin over the Republican was more than five times greater than in 1992.
In the previous election, Mr. Clinton got 44 percent of the vote in those four counties, and Mr. Bush 41 percent. This year, Mr. Clinton got 54 percent, and Mr. Dole 37 percent, with many of the President's votes coming from former Perot supporters. In Suffolk County, for example, Mr. Clinton lost to Mr. Bush by 9,000 votes four years ago, but beat Mr. Dole by 70,000 votes.
A similar turnaround could also be seen in other suburban areas, including northern New Jersey. For instance, Mr. Clinton lost Passaic County in 1992 by 1,000 votes, but won it this time by 31,000 votes.
"Mr. Dole's natural appeal has never been an urban Republican appeal," said Prof. Michael J. Malbin, director of the Center for Legislative Studies at the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany. "He wasn't able to get the Northeast Catholic swing voter, and even Republicans in the Northeast didn't want a revolution that would challenge the New Deal. When the issue became framed as whether the government is your enemy, a lot of swing voters around here said, 'This is where I'm getting off.' "
A symbol of these ambivalent swing voters, of course, is Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican Mayor of a Democratic city. Almost every Republican candidate he endorsed in Tuesday's election lost, including two from out of state.
The Mayor had to vote for Bob Dole to avoid the outrage of his party, but his heart was clearly never in it, and he waited until the last possible moment to essentially endorse Mr. Dole's running mate, Jack F. Kemp. After the results were in, Mr. Giuliani immediately began saying that they were inevitable and that the country was in good hands.
"I don't think tonight's result is tragic, I guess because I'm not that partisan a person," he said Tuesday night. "I think President Clinton is a good man, he's a very decent man, and the country has run pretty well."
The Mayor added yesterday that he believed the city would be unaffected by the outcome.
One local official who was affected by the outcome was Representative Charles B. Rangel Democrat of Manhattan. He would have become chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee if the Republicans had not kept their majority in the House.
"It hasn't caused me any concern, and I'll explain all that in my suicide note," Mr. Rangel joked yesterday. He added that the overall effect on the city would be determined by the ideological path to be chosen by the President, a decision he said he could not predict.

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: NEW YORK STATE -- BALLOT QUESTION;
Riding the Bond Act Victory, Pataki Tries to Widen His Appeal

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
With the passage of the Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act, voters have given Gov. George E. Pataki the opportunity to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on three politically crucial areas -- urban renewal, job creation and the environment -- with just a year to go before the 1998 gubernatorial campaign begins.
For most of the two years that he has been in office, Mr. Pataki has been largely defined by a sparely conservative agenda to cut taxes and spending, reimpose the death penalty and trim welfare rolls. 
 But with the passage on Tuesday of the $1.75 billion bond act, which Mr. Pataki proposed and guided through the Legislature, he has in one bold stroke brought an expansive spirit to a state government he had pledged to shrink.
With money borrowed through the sale of long-term bonds, the administration will be able to finance cleaning up scores of abandoned industrial sites in urban areas, replacing hundreds of coal-burning furnaces in city schools, closing landfills including Fresh Kills in Staten Island and building sewage treatment plants in rural villages and suburban towns. In the process, it will pump hundreds of millions of dollars into the state's economy and create as many as 60,000 jobs.
For Mr. Pataki, the promise of those programs has helped him broaden his political base beyond fiscally conservative suburban and rural voters, whose overwhelming support catapulted him to victory in 1994, to include more city dwellers, union members and moderate Democrats.
Indeed, exit polls on Tuesday as well as two recent statewide public opinion polls have indicated that the bond act campaign has helped lift Mr. Pataki's approval rating above 50 percent for the first time in his term. The polls have also shown that Mr. Pataki's support in New York City, where he received only 28 percent of the vote in 1994, has been steadily climbing.
"The net result is, it is a political plus for the Governor," said State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who campaigned for the bond act. Mr. McCall, a Democrat, is viewed as a likely challenger to Mr. Pataki in 1998.
The Governor also used the bond act campaign to claim the mantle of Teddy Roosevelt-style progressivism. For Mr. Pataki, invoking Mr. Roosevelt's image does more than recall New York's proud history. It gives the Governor a means to distance himself from United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who is Mr. Pataki's mentor but who polls show to be deeply unpopular. Through the bond act, Mr. Pataki is able to define himself as an independent and to appeal to centrist voters.
And it does all those things just as the Governor is preparing to release a tough new welfare policy and a spare new budget -- plans that are likely to draw charges of mean-spiritedness from Democrats. The bond act victory may blunt those charges in the minds of many moderates.
Looking haggard but happy at a news conference this morning, Mr. Pataki recalled Mr. Roosevelt once again, saying, "New York State now is positioned again to lead the nation in environmental issues as we approach the next century, just as at the turn of the century we led the nation in environmental issues with Teddy Roosevelt leading the state."
With 98 percent of precincts reporting this afternoon, voters had approved the proposition by 2 million to 1.6 million, or 56 percent to 44 percent. City voters supported it by a 3-to-1 margin and suburban voters supported it by a 2-to-1 margin, but voters upstate rejected it by a 3-to-2 margin.
The poor showing of the bond act in the state's northern, central and western reaches raises questions about whether Mr. Pataki has hurt himself in his base of support among fiscally conservative voters, who have been the driving force behind his efforts to cut state taxes and spending.
Indeed, members of one of the state's most prominent anti-tax groups, Change-N.Y., spent about $800,000 on an advertising campaign attacking the bond act as frivolous and politically motivated. Many of those same people have been contributors to Mr. Pataki, prompting the Governor's aides to lament that the anti-tax group had undermined its conservative cause by criticizing the Governor so harshly.
But Thomas Carroll, Change-N.Y.'s president, said he thought conservative voters would soon forgive Mr. Pataki's bond act, which he described as a "grab for downstate, liberal, Democratic voters."
Mr. Carroll said that once the Governor releases his welfare plan, which is expected to include sharp new restrictions on benefits, he would once again win favor among conservatives. "He has a strong record on taxes and crime," Mr. Carroll said. "It's not a life or death thing."
Many Democrats who supported the bond act have quietly fretted that its passage will now give Mr. Pataki the opportunity to travel about the state, disbursing millions of dollars on popular programs and talking about policies he has not often talked about before, like urban renewal.
During the bond act campaign, Mr. Pataki often used empty, forlorn-looking downtown factories as backdrops to promote the "brown-field" programs in the proposition. Under that program, municipalities will receive grants to clean up abandoned industrial sites with the goal of using them for manufacturing again.
At just such a site along the Mohawk River last week, Mr. Pataki told two Democratic mayors that "unless cities like Troy, Albany and Schenectady do well, we're all in trouble."
Democrats say that the bond act money could not have come at a more opportune time for Mr. Pataki, since the Legislature may have to cut spending in other areas to balance next year's budget. "It's great governmentally for him," said Hank Morris, a Democratic political consultant. "It gets him out of his budget mess."

HEADLINE: What's 4-H Without Competition for Blue Ribbons? Extremely Stormy

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: LE MARS, Iowa, Nov. 3

 BODY:
Kari A. Beitelspacher has been bringing home blue ribbons for years from 4-H club competitions at the state fair in Des Moines. But this year, even her well-received homemade salsa did not win first place.
The 16-year-old was disappointed, but then so were thousands of other children who belong to 4-H, a rite of passage in rural America. In an experiment this year, 4-H gave 3,500 Iowa State Fair competitors the same multicolored ribbons recognizing participation, rather than awarding the traditional first, second and third place ribbons. 
 From small cities like this one to the state capitol, the reaction has been nearly hysterical. While the children were unhappy with the new ribbons, the grown-ups were really riled up.
One critic successfully introduced a plank in the state's Republican Party platform assailing "the encroachment of socialism" in 4-H. The Des Moines Register carried articles about the controversy on its front page, prompting a slew of letters to the editor.
Here in the heartland, where radio stations list corn prices as often as urban radio stations report rush-hour traffic tie-ups, the changes in 4-H, which stands for head, heart, hands and health, seemed to many to challenge not just a cherished program, but also a way of life.
Linda K. Mohning, a former 4-H leader, said, "To us, 4-H has been a microcosm of traditional American life and values, values that have worked for 200 years."
Mrs. Mohning, author of the Republican plank on socialism, said, "Free enterprise is a bedrock value of America and we would be concerned about any move to stray from that." She and her husband grow corn and beans and raise hogs and cattle on their farm near Remsen, a small town in northwestern Iowa.
Some opponents of the move even said it would undermine the work ethic and make it harder for children to learn how to prosper in today's global economy.
"This is a competitive world," said Evan Rayl, who breeds Angus cattle at his farm in Bridgewater, in southwestern Iowa. "How in the world is a 4-H leader supposed to explain to an 18-year-old why we didn't all get the job?"
He fondly recalled the 4-H motto he had learned as a boy: "to win without bragging and to lose without squealing."
Faced with such an uproar, Iowa 4-H leaders have been quick to beat a retreat. They have declared the ribbon experiment over, and at next summer's state fair they plan to award blue, red and white ribbons for first, second and third place finishers.
"The whole issue surrounding whether 4-H is socialist is a ridiculous discussion," said Joseph R. Kurth, the state 4-H director. "There is certainly no basis in truth for that."
The multicolored ribbons were one part of a pilot project that affected all nonlivestock contests at the state fair in August, he said. Children displaying projects in woodworking, food, clothing and other events liked other parts of the experiment, like one-on-one discussions with judges, and those will be continued, Mr. Kurth said.
Many 4-H leaders agree that the 4-H flap is overblown. "I don't know what has really got people so stirred up," said Chris D. Gleason, a longtime 4-H leader who raises sheep in Greenfield, a town about an hour's drive southwest of Des Moines. "Maybe it is because they do see such value in 4-H."
But here in Le Mars, a city of about 10,000 near Sioux City, where Iowa meets up with Nebraska and South Dakota, 4-H club members were simply glad to have the chance next year to win a blue ribbon again.
"I like the blue ribbons better personally because then you know how you rank among the other 4-H'ers in the state," said Kelsea A. Jacobson, 17, who has won all blue ribbons at state fairs in past years. Her multicolored ribbon this year rewarded the prom for elderly neighbors that she and several friends organized.
Three of Ms. Beitelspacher's projects won local and county prizes to qualify for the state fair this year -- the salsa, a display promoting the benefits of calcium, and a scrapbook describing her family's nearly five-decade heritage with 4-H membership.
"It was kind of disappointing to say you'd gotten all the way to state fair and then everybody received the same ribbon," she said.
Critics said they object to more than just the new kind of ribbons handed out at the fair this summer. "The ribbon thing was just kind of the tip of the iceberg of this liberal agenda," Mr. Rayl said. He objected after 4-H began requiring last year that all new leaders agree to a criminal background check and a check for drunken driving violations.
"The trouble is, they'll do all this checking and they won't discover a one -- there are legions of uncaught out there," Mr. Rayl said. Because parents know the leaders have been screened, they will have a false sense of security, he said.
Mr. Rayl said he worried the requirement might drive away good 4-H leaders. "How much fun is it to have a rap sheet be run on you -- even if you're spotless -- to do a volunteer job?"
Mr. Kurth, the Iowa 4-H leader, said the new requirements were similar to those found in most other states and those used by other youth organizations like the Boy Scouts. They are designed to deter criminals by making them think twice about signing up as volunteers, he said.
"You just can't do a youth program in the 90's without some kind of protections" for the safety of children, Mr. Kurth said.
The 4-H organization also drew criticism when it asked all local leaders to agree to uphold 4-H's mission, vision and values by signing a form that described them. It outlined goals like teaching children citizenship, leadership and a positive self-concept, and described values including favoring volunteerism, diversity and prevention programs.
Mrs. Mohning balked at signing the form because she believes it is wrong for the government "to designate a required set of values that everyone has to agree to." She said she was dismissed from her volunteer post as a 4-H leader for refusing. "It was a tough decision because we have been involved in 4-H for a long time," she said.
But Mr. Kurth said she misunderstood the intent of the values statement. "There may be a fear that these values replace local values -- that is certainly not the case."
The Republican Party platform also reflected Mrs. Mohning's objection to a discussion at a 1993 conference attended by hundreds of Iowa's high-school-age 4-H members. One of many topics was tolerance for homosexuals. Mrs. Mohning said that was not the usual bill of fare. "Usually it deals with hog diseases and horticulture, but this time it dealt with homosexuality," she said.
Her plank in the Republican platform reads, "We protest the teaching to 4-H'ers that homosexuality is an acceptable alternative lifestyle and we oppose the encroachment of socialism in 4-H competition at fairs."
Brian M. Kennedy, chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, hastens to point out that "this was just one little plank in a lengthy platform," and said that he did not know of the plank until after the state convention in June. "Every year there is one or two like this in each party's platform," Mr. Kennedy said.
Some Iowa 4-H leaders praised the group's efforts to modernize. "It has to stay up with the times," Mrs. Gleason said. "We live in a very diverse society and rural Iowa is going to have to admit it," she said. "Our kids are not going to be staying down on the farm anymore."
Indeed, the changes in 4-H may have come under attack precisely because membership has been such a mainstay of growing up here.
"There is a whole lot of change going on in society today," Mr. Kurth said. "People want to find things they can count on that are stable, and the 4-H program is one of those things."

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: THE PRESIDENCY -- THE STRATEGY;
Stung by Defeats in '94, Clinton Regrouped and Co-opted G.O.P. Strategies

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
As he struggled to come to terms with the 1994 Republican sweep of Congress, President Clinton made one point to anyone who would listen: he had lost the fight to overhaul health care, the centerpiece of his agenda, because his opponents went on television and defined his program.
He would never let it happen again. 
 And so, as the battle over the Republicans' sweeping plans to shrink the Federal budget was about to be joined in August 1995, the President's political consultants were ready. They had cut two 30-second commercials that accused the Republicans of seeking to cut Medicare.
Expecting an instant Republican counter commercial, the consultants had an emergency drill in place to respond quickly once the air war began.
Dick Morris, the President's chief strategist, would reach out to Mr. Clinton, at any time, anywhere, to approve a new script. Robert Squier and Bill Knapp would produce the spot. Mark Penn and Douglas Schoen, the pollsters, would rush it out for their signature "mall testing," in which shoppers view and judge an advertisement. If all tested well, they would be back on television fast.
They waited. And waited. And waited. "Every week that went by, we'd look at each other blankly," Mr. Knapp recalled.
In the end, the Republicans did not go on the air at all, even as the Democrats kept up a more than $1 million-a-week advertising campaign throughout the fall. In effect, the anxious President had planned and won the first skirmish of his re-election drive with the opposition never firing a shot.
Certainly Presidential campaigns have many turning points. Ruminating on Air Force One today, his arm draped across the shoulder of his adviser, George R. Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton traced the beginnings of his extraordinary political comeback to the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, which he said had caused Americans to "move back to the vital center."
He said the policies enacted in his first two years in office, like his deficit reduction plan and his anti-crime legislation, had come to be appreciated only in 1996. And he cited his ability to work with Congress at the end of this legislative session as "the thing that sealed all this."
But it is also the case that the television blitz of 1995 and the unused emergency drill foretold much about Mr. Clinton's re-election. For the contours of this Presidential race were largely set in 1995 when Mr. Clinton rediscovered his voice, found his target audience and forged his main campaign appeal from out of the budget battle. He co-opted the Republican idea of a balanced budget and then turned the debate to how to balance it -- focusing on Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment, areas where the voters favor Democrats.
Moreover, the Republicans made many mistakes: their failure to go on television; their political misjudgment in forcing two Government shutdowns; the missteps of a single day in October when Bob Dole told one audience that he had voted against Medicare at its inception and Speaker Newt Gingrich told another audience that he expected to see the agency that administers Medicare, "wither on the vine."
To the very last hours of his last campaign day, Mr. Clinton was running as much against the Republican Congress as he was against Mr. Dole.
"The Republicans have given us great gifts," the White House political director, Douglas Sosnik mused one day last spring. "Whether it's shutting down the Government or the revolutionary rhetoric of Newt Gingrich or Bob Dole's inability to articulate a message, they all compound to create a much more favorable environment for Bill Clinton."
Still, it was only in retrospect that Mr. Clinton's advisers called the Republican rout of 1994 a blessing in disguise, only later that they would say that it shocked the President into discipline and helped him return to the "New Democrat" roots that had seemed to disappear in his first two years in office.
In the days after the Republicans took control of both houses of Congress, Mr. Clinton was frustrated, raging, and depressed. "I want my Presidency back," he said, according to a high-ranking aide who recalled the plaintive mood.
The immediate task facing Mr. Clinton's political team was to ward off the kind of divisive primary that had helped defeat Jimmy Carter in 1980 and forced Lyndon B. Johnson into retirement in 1968. Despite fears about how they would do, Mr. Clinton's aides decided to begin fund-raising earlier than any President had before. In part, the effort was designed to scare anyone else out of running. In part it was to have a war chest if an opponent materialized.
Mr. Clinton, meanwhile, was struggling to regain his voice. In the aftermath of the 1994 defeat, he had fired most of the strategists who had staffed his fabled War Room of 1992. In their place, he turned secretly to Mr. Morris, who had known him for nearly two decades and rescued him from his defeat as Arkansas governor.
Mr. Morris had long since become a Republican, working for candidates who made him anathema to many on Mr. Clinton's staff. But he had a knack for listening to Bill Clinton. He could finish his sentences and take the scattered shards of his ideas and build them into a campaign mosaic.
He and the team of pollsters and strategists he brought in with him created a counterbalance to Mr. Clinton's more liberal advisers, led by senior adviser, George R. Stephanopoulos and the deputy White House chief of staff, Harold M. Ickes. And Mr. Clinton would navigate between the two feuding groups, sometimes siding with one, sometimes with the other, to create his own synthesis.
Still, Mr. Clinton could not immediately regain his bearings. At a prime-time news conference in April, he was reduced to insisting that he was still relevant in the face of the Republican juggernaut.
His salvation came in tragedy. The bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City caused the stricken nation to focus on the President with an intensity it had drifted away from in the aftermath of the cold war. Mr. Clinton rose to the moment, firm in his vow to fight terrorists, comforting in his turn to liturgy.
One aide close to Mr. Clinton called the speech given by the President "perhaps the single most important turning point," in restoring the President's voice and sense of purpose. On Air Force One today, returning to Washington from Arkansas, Mr. Clinton, too, called the bombing a turning point but said it was because it changed the public mood. "The American people sort of began to move back to the vital center after Oklahoma City," he said. Recalling the "bitter, bitter rhetoric" of the time, he said the bombing "broke the spell in the country as people began searching for the common ground again."
The next pivot point was Mr. Clinton's decision to embrace the Republican goal of balancing the budget. Virtually his entire White House staff opposed it, afraid the President would take the spotlight off the Republican program cuts and keep the Democrats from running as the defenders of Medicare, Federal health insurance for the elderly.
But Mr. Morris and Mr. Schoen, one of the pollsters he had brought with him, had an eye on Perot voters and suburban independents. They advised Mr. Clinton that he had to embrace fiscal conservatism to become relevant to those voters. The President heeded them and announced his conversion on national television. The speech enraged liberal Democrats, but it shifted the debate from whether to balance the budget to how to balance the budget.
Over the summer Mr. Clinton similarly used a series of speeches to diffuse social issues. He opposed a constitutional amendment on school prayer but said religious expression was allowed in schools. He joined the crusade against media violence. He defended affirmative action, but said that overt quota programs should be eliminated.
"He was saying yes and saying no at the same time," said Mr. Stephanopoulos. "He was stealing the center, creating the center."
 
Deciphering The Electorate
By the end of the summer, Mr. Clinton had put much of his campaign framework in place.
His strategists, particularly the pollster Mr. Penn, had looked closer at the voting public and discovered a sharp divide between single people and married couples with children, who had a more negative view of Mr. Clinton. The campaign's target group became the great American middle, but unusually defined: middle-aged parents with children.
Some of Mr. Clinton's White House aides argued that he should wage a populist campaign on pocketbook issues as he did in 1992. But his new crop of consultants said this was not suitable for an incumbent who had to run on his record. They also contended that it would be counterproductive. "When you divide rich and poor, the middle class sides with the rich," said Mr. Schoen.
Instead, Mr. Clinton chose to reach out to his target voters by stressing values. This did not mean that the President would not talk about pocketbook matters, like Republican plans to slow the growth of Medicare. But he would not speak about them in specifically economic terms.
And so one of his first Medicare advertisements proclaimed that Mr. Clinton "is right to protect Medicare, right to defend our decision as a nation, to do what's moral, good and right by the elderly."
By October, the President's campaign against the Republicans was having its effect. Mr. Clinton's approval ratings were creeping up. The Republican Congress was dropping in voter esteem. But the question in the White House was how long to keep up the fight.
Mr. Morris insisted that Mr. Clinton needed to clinch a budget deal to be viewed as an effective leader. Mr. Ickes, Mr. Stephanopoulos and Congressional Democrats opposed a deal, afraid it would nullify the contrast between Republicans and Democrats.
Mr. Clinton, in the end, could not swallow Republican proposals to put Medicaid -- the Federal health insurance for the poor -- under the control of the states, and he fought on.
He had laid his groundwork well, his advertisements driving home the theme that he was the moderate, protecting programs that Americans valued from extremists. The Government shutdowns cemented that view and many of Mr. Clinton's strategists believe the shutdowns won Mr. Clinton re-election. "The budget fight was a turning point," Mr. Clinton said today.
Mr. Clinton was helped further by his announcement that he was sending troops to Bosnia. The very unpopularity of the move undercut the image of him as a waffler, created in his first two years as President.
December brought another victory. On the day that Hillary Rodham Clinton showed up in New Hampshire to register her husband as an official candidate in the nation's first primary, she was the lone Democrat to make the pilgrimage. Mr. Clinton, through prodigious fund raising and behind-the-scenes courting of the party base, had escaped a primary challenge.
 
Small Government, Small Ideas
There are moments in politics when the public will give someone a second look. Mr. Clinton's moment came in January 1996 and he was ready for it -- unveiling a new line of argument in his State of the Union Message that cemented the gains he had won in the budget fight.
What attracted attention in Washington was Mr. Clinton's pronouncement that the "era of big government is over" -- his official divorce from Democratic orthodoxy. But what truly distinguished the speech was its focus on small initiatives that would soothe the anxieties of Mr. Clinton's target voter group.
Some of these proposals were economic, such as a tax break for college tuition. Some were sheer exhortation, such as the President's endorsement of school uniforms. Some went to the heart of people's fears of crime, such as a promise to battle youth gangs.
Mr. Morris told colleagues that this was a "new dialogue" in American politics. It seemed unpresidential after the dramatic concerns of the cold war. But it marked the realization -- attuned to the aging Baby Boom generation -- that, as one White House aide put it "the personal is political." What concerned voters most was their marriage, their children, their neighborhood.
These issues particularly resonated with women. But the President also had an argument for men: the economy. The 1993 deficit reduction package, particularly its tax increases, had helped brand Mr. Clinton as a liberal. But it also brought an economic dividend. Mr. Clinton could point to more than 10 million new jobs and a drop in the deficit for four years in a row. "Historians will say that this Administration had the most serious attempt to put together a comprehensive economic policy of any administration in 60 years," Mr. Clinton said today.
In an odd way, by the time Mr. Dole had triumphed in the primaries to become the Republican standard bearer, the Presidential race was over. Mr. Clinton's approval ratings suggested that a majority of the public had swung to Mr. Clinton's side. And nothing that Mr. Dole tried served to shake loose enough independent voters.
"There was never anything from the day that Bob Dole wrapped up the nomination to Election Day that fundamentally altered either the nature or the dialogue of the race," said Joe Lockhart, a Clinton aide.
When Mr. Dole, strapped of cash, sought to use his post as Senate majority leader to showcase his leadership, Mr. Clinton's strategists worked with Congressional Democrats to tie him in knots.
Convictions in the Whitewater trial of Mr. Clinton's former business partners and the discovery that a White House aide had requested hundreds of F.B.I. files of former White House officials gave Mr. Dole an opening to revive questions about Mr. Clinton's character and ethics. But the Clinton camp had a counter argument. In essence they redefined character around public, not private, behavior. Character, they said, was taking on the National Rifle Association or the tobacco industry.
"I think that you can demonstrate character most effectively by what you fight for and for whom you fight," Mr. Clinton told a television interviewer. "And I believe that the fact that I've stood up for the American people for the things like fighting for the family-leave law or the assault-weapons ban or the Brady bill or the V-chip for parents or trying to keep tobacco out of the hands of kids."
 
Metaphors: The Future and Past
Even when Mr. Morris himself revived questions about Mr. Clinton by having to resign because of a report he had been having an affair with a prostitute, Mr. Clinton's approval ratings did not drop.
Nor did Mr. Dole's pledge of a sweeping 15 percent tax reduction work. Mr. Clinton's aides said their polls showed the American public had become suspicious of any big promise, whether of a health care overhaul or a dramatic tax cut.
And even Mr. Dole's carefully choreographed, nearly flawless national convention did not give him a lasting increase in support.
But it did give Mr. Clinton a great gift -- the metaphor on which he ended his campaign. For half a year, an unstated theme of the Clinton campaign had been the age difference between the 73-year-old Mr. Dole and the 50-year-old Mr. Clinton. It was touched on obliquely when Mr. Clinton surrounded himself with college students at his campaign rallies, when he talked of education, the Internet, and family concerns.
But the Clinton campaign made the contrast much more explicit when Mr. Dole in his lyrical speech accepting his nomination said, "Age has its advantage. Let me be the bridge to an America that only the unknowing call myth."
If Mr. Dole would offer a bridge to the past, then Mr. Clinton would offer a bridge to the future, a bridge as he would say, "to the 21st century, wide enough and strong enough to take us to America's best days."
By the end of the Democratic convention, it seemed nothing could stop Mr. Clinton. He sailed through the debates and he coasted through rallies conjuring up visions of a glorious millennium.
The Republican Congress -- concerned about its own survival -- struck compromises with him on a host of bills in the last six weeks of the session. "I think the thing that sealed all this was that we had such a great six weeks," Mr. Clinton said today.
The prodigious money raising Mr. Clinton had set in motion so long ago with his insistence on an early television advertising campaign, paid for by the Democratic National Committee, came back to haunt him as questions arose about some of the donors and about John Huang, one of the fund-raisers. But Mr. Clinton simply rode out the storm to a second term.
Very early in the morning on Election Day, in a scene that could have been from a Busby Berkeley musical, spotlights focusing mid air in the Sioux Falls arena captured Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, walking across a bridge suspended mid air, music blaring and a fan of American flags arrayed behind them. "We just need to run our country the way we want to run our lives," Mr. Clinton said ruminating on his 23 years in politics as he ended his last rally before flying home to Little Rock. "That is what I learned in 23 years, and that is what I ask you to vote for tomorrow as we build our bridge to the 21st century."

HEADLINE: Genetic Soybeans Alarm Europeans

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
As genetically engineered soybeans from the United States begin to arrive in Europe, concerns about possible health risks raised by consumer groups and critics of biotechnology are prompting a boycott by some food producers and supermarket chains.
Soybeans are one of the United States' biggest farm exports to Europe; oil from the crushed beans is used in a wide variety of grocery items, including margarine, cake and chocolate, and soymeal is fed to livestock and poultry. 
 The bioengineered beans, developed by the St. Louis-based chemical producer Monsanto to yield larger harvests at lower costs, have been approved by both the Food and Drug Administration in the United States and the European Union.
But by the time the first shipment of American soybeans that included the bioengineered bean docked in Hamburg, Germany, today aboard the freighter Ideal Progress, European consumer groups had made the soybean their main line of resistance against a coming wave of bioengineered crops, including corn, chicory and rapeseed.
In Germany -- where anxiety over tampering with the food chain has been raised to a high pitch by mad cow disease, which spread among old British cattle and, as it turned out, some diseased cows were recycled as cattle feed -- packaged-food companies including Unilever and Nestle Deutschland A.G. have pledged not to use the Monsanto product.
Food industry associations in Sweden, the Netherlands and other countries are concerned that products using the beans could be challenged in court by consumer groups demanding further testing of their long-term safety. Grocery chains, including Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway P.L.C. in Britain, are demanding that American producers keep the Monsanto beans separate and labeled as altered.
In the European Union, environmental campaigners are to try next week to reverse its approval of the soybeans and to block future shipments of similarly engineered crops unless they are labeled, Hiltrud Breyer, a European Parliament member, said in an interview the other day.
And while many companies, including Nestle S.A., the giant Swiss-based parent of Nestle Deutschland, are committed to the new products and see their acceptance as inevitable, the industry is concerned about starting off amid panic as environmental groups like Greenpeace fan consumer anxieties.
Ever since genetic engineering arose in the 1980's, it has provoked an unease among many people at the idea of humans disturbing the natural genetic order. And despite the Food and Drug Administration's position that there is no evidence that bioengineered foods require special precautions, critics who oppose taking any chances continue campaigning to have such foods tested as thoroughly as any new food additive.
Monsanto is counting on the controversy dying down as consumers get enough information, a spokeswoman for the company, Lisa Watson, said. "There is a lot of noise out there now by groups trying to make consumers believe there is something wrong," she said.
But an influential European business representative urged caution. "Our message from our customers is that for whatever reason they would prefer not to have it in their foodstuffs," said Henrik Kroner, secretary general of Eurocommerce, a Brussels-based lobbying association for hundreds of retail and commerce groups in 20 countries.
"We should do more to make them change their minds," Mr. Kroner said. But he added: "I am telling the American exporters to please, in this season, if you are wise, don't ship those soybeans to Europe because you may trigger a lasting reaction. And, if you must, separate and label them."
With soybeans second only to corn as a cash crop in the United States, biotechnology engineers have experimented for years to produce a higher-yield variety. Monsanto's eventual solution was to transplant a gene from another plant to make soybeans resistant to its best-selling herbicide, Roundup.
Roundup generally kills any plant with leaves. So by planting a soybean that can withstand it, farmers can use a single treatment of Roundup, instead of the customary two applications of other weedkillers, and in the process kill more weeds.
Plants that have to compete with fewer weeds can produce more soybeans, and so farmers -- in theory -- save time and money while harvesting a larger crop. Monsanto sells its technology to seed companies, which incorporate it into their soybeans. The soybeans are in turn marketed under the label Roundup Ready, and Monsanto makes money licensing the technology and by selling lots more Roundup, too.
Seed companies began marketing the soybean only this year, and the variety is expected to constitute less than 2 percent of the United States' production of 59 million tons.
But Greenpeace, which sent out a barge today to interfere with the docking of the Ideal Progress, sees that trickle as the opening for a flood of bioengineered crops.
"This will be the first time genetically engineered ingredients have appeared in a wide range of everyday supermarket products," Michelle Sheather, a campaigner for Greenpeace, said in a telephone interview from headquarters in Amsterdam. "If the food multinationals have their way, millions of tons of engineered crops will be grown."
Food companies, indeed, have invested enormous amounts of money in biotechnology research to develop new varieties of crops, from corn to tomatoes, with higher yields or lower costs.
Altering genes by transplanting them from different species instead of crossbreeding related varieties, bioengineers have already made corn and potatoes more resistant to insect pests. In coming years, exports of these products are expected to total billions.
With the stakes so high, some American exporters say that the opposition in Europe in recent weeks has already caused soybean exports to the Continent to drop 10 percent.
The United States Department of Agriculture is skeptical, attributing the drop to higher soybean prices at a time when European grain production is greater than usual. In any case, officials say, soybeans that cannot be sold in Europe will find a market elsewhere.
The fight against genetically engineered food products may also be fed, in part, by recent disputes in which Europeans have accused the United States of trying to control commerce beyond its borders, such as American sanctions against countries that trade with Iran, Libya or Cuba. And there may well be resentment over the assumption that if a United States agency has deemed a product safe, that should be good enough for Europeans. But the opposition is also driven by activist groups like Greenpeace, which European businesses say are overly zealous but impossible to ignore.
"The soya bean has wide-ranging approval and in our assessment it is safe," said Frank Vanooyen, a spokesman for Unilever in the Netherlands. "But the fact remains we are a consumer-driven company, and therefore we leave the decision up to our operating companies on a country-by-country basis."
Surveys have found that 85 percent to 90 percent of European consumers support clear labeling of bioengineered products, and are less enthusiastic than American consumers about embracing what the Europeans see as novel foods.
But the large food companies here agree with Monsanto that once the public is informed of the benefits of newly developed crop varieties and what the producers insist are their low risks, there will be widespread acceptance.
"This is not in itself a big deal, but it sets signals for things to come," said Claus Conzelmann, an assistant vice president for Nestle, in a telephone interview from company headquarters in Vevey, Switzerland.
"We are perhaps a little more realistic about it," he said. "If the consumer finally does not want it, we will draw the final conclusion. But we are convinced biological engineering will remain an important field. In our opinion, it increases the efficiency of agricultural production with positive repercussions on the environment."
Monsanto, of course, is not alone; Ciba-Geigy, Du Pont, Dow Chemical, Zeneca and Hoechst have also aggressively invested in genetically engineered crops. In the United States, analysts say the compelling economics of bioengineered soybeans and the crops to follow will win out.
The soybeans have "been on sale in the United States and it has not caused any problems," said William Young, of the brokerage firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, who follows the grain industry.
"I can't predict politics but economics will triumph in the end," he added. "The simple truth is that organic food is a lot more expensive."
American farmers have a say, too. And they are watching developments in Europe closely before they return to Monsanto this winter to buy more bags of expensive Roundup Ready seeds, according to Philip Paarlberg, a trade specialist at Purdue University.
By the time next year's planting starts in May and June, he said, "We will be able to assess the damage properly."

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: THE CONGRESS;
New Faces In the House

 BODY:

FLORIDA
 
Jim Davis
Democrat, 39. A lawyer, Mr. Davis has served in the Florida House since 1988 and is currently the majority leader. His campaign strategy included emphasizing local issues and his moderate stance and assuring voters that if elected, he would not become a tool of Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader. Mr. Davis's rival for the open seat in Florida's 11th Congressional District was Mark Sharpe, a former Navy intelligence officer who brought in Speaker Newt Gingrich to help raise campaign money and said it was important for Republicans to keep control of Congress "if only to prevent national health insurance." 

INDIANA
 
Julia M. Carson
Democrat, 38. In a race that was declared a dead heat by both campaigns, Ms. Carson defeated her Republican challenger, Virginia Blankenbaker, and will succeed Andrew Jacobs Jr., a Democrat retiring after 30 years. Ms. Carson became Indianapolis's second black Congresswoman. But uncomfortable carrying the banner of race ("I am not your African-American candidate, I am the Democratic candidate for Congress," she said), Ms. Carson instead emphasized education, health care and her record as the trustee of Center Township, which she helped recover from a budget deficit.
 
KANSAS
 
Jim Ryun
Republican, 49. A motivational speaker and track star in the 1960's, Mr. Ryun is renowned for holding the world record in the one-mile run for nine years. He is a new face not only in the House but also in politics. Born and reared in Kansas, he is a conservative who advocates strong family values and a balanced budget.
 
OKLAHOMA
 
Wes Watkins
Republican, 57. A home-building contractor and economic developer, Mr. Watkins has traveled a long and winding road back to the House. A former Democratic Representative, he served in the House from 1977 to 1991. In 1992, he left the House in an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for Governor. After losing, Mr. Watkins supported Ross Perot for President in 1992 and made another unsuccessful race for governor as an independent in 1994. Last year, he switched parties. This year, Mr. Watkins defeated his Democratic challenger, Darryl Roberts, and won the seat opened up by the retirement of Representative Bill Brewster, a Democrat.
 
NORTH CAROLINA
 
David E. Price
Democrat, 56. A professor of political science, Mr. Price has taught at Yale and Duke for 19 years, was North Carolina's Democratic Party chairman in 1983 and 1984, and represented his state's Fourth Congressonal District from 1987 to 1994. Armed with his belief that "politics is more exciting than political science," he took a leave from Duke this semester in an effort to regain the seat he lost in 1994 by 1,215 votes. Mr. Price defeated Fred Heineman, the Republican who defeated him two years earlier. Mr. Price cast the election largely as a referendum on the agenda set by the Republican leadership of the 104th Congress, saying, "Newt Gingrich and his 95 percenters like Fred Heineman have had their shot and people have been alarmed by what they've seen."
 
OHIO
 
Dennis J. Kucinich
Democrat, 50. A former video producer and public power consultant, Mr. Kucinich was first elected to office in 1969, serving on the Cleveland City Council until 1971. In 1977, at the age of 31 and with little political experience, he was elected Mayor of Cleveland. He was nicknamed the "boy mayor" and he came under heavy fire the next year when the city defaulted on its debt. He tried unsuccessfully to get elected to Congress in 1972, 1974, 1988 and 1992. In a race for the Ohio Legislature in 1994 Mr. Kucinich became the only Democrat to oust an incumbent Republican.

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: THE PRESIDENCY -- THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Liberal Use of 'Extremist' Is the Winning Strategy

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

 BODY:
In the epithet wars that were the 1996 Congressional and Presidential campaigns, "extremist" proved to be a more dangerous label than "liberal."
Because of more than a year's worth of consistent Democratic and labor advertising linking Bob Dole to Newt Gingrich and assaulting the Republican Congress as extreme, Bill Clinton was able to control the political agenda. He threw Republicans nationwide on the defensive, in the view yesterday of weary Democratic and Republican strategists, as well as independent experts. 
 The advertising campaign may also have rewritten the book on how early Presidents should start paying to promote themselves.
"It was the key in which all of these races were played," said Stuart Stevens, a one-time advertising strategist for Mr. Dole, who also created the advertising in Gov. William F. Weld's losing bid for the Senate in Massachusetts. "Clinton had very impressive coattails in these races, in the sense of turning them into a referendum on a mythical enemy. He set up a straw man and then attacked it. He set up a series of code words that other Democratic candidates could use."
Battling back by spending heavily for their own advertising, Republican Congressmen were generally able to survive the onslaught by reversing the strategy they used in 1994. This year they isolated themselves from a national conservative movement to run as the voices of their specific districts.
But at same time, a traditional Republican tactic -- attacking a Democrat as liberal -- may have lost its edge in 1996. Arthur J. Finkelstein, a pollster and Republican consultant known for his relentless use of this line of attack, lost three Senate races, including one against Paul Wellstone, who had been labeled "embarrassingly liberal."
"Calling Paul Wellstone liberal in Minnesota is like calling Jim Innocenzi an Italian," said Jim Innocenzi, a Republican advertising consultant who worked for a dozen winning Congressional candidates this year. "The liberal thing, the liberal attack, has no traction except in the South. Using the liberal label without a huge justification is a waste."
Mr. Finkelstein did not respond to a telephone message yesterday.
Mr. Dole also tried to use the liberal label. But he changed advertising messages even more times than he changed advertising teams, making it hard to judge which message might have been effective, had it been sustained.
Alex Castellanos, one of Mr. Dole's advertising men, designed a campaign mocking the President as a dishonest liberal. Playfully but pointedly, the advertisements, using clips of Mr. and Mrs. Clinton, provided lessons in "How to talk liberal."
Evidently concerned that the advertisements were too harsh, the Dole campaign only broadcast one of them, toning it down to soften its suggestion that Mr. Clinton was a liar.
Mr. Castellanos acknowledged that it was harder this year to brand a politician as liberal, "now that there are two Republican Parties." But, he said, "if it were a term of endearment, Clinton would not have run away from it as fast and as far as he did."
Mr. Castellanos said of the Dole campaign: "We bounced around too much from drugs to economy to trust to everything. The other guy's running the one commercial for a year and a half: 'Dole-Gingrich is extreme, and I'm trying to protect you.' "
No Presidential campaign had ever advertised as early or as often as the Clinton-Gore campaign and the Democrat National Committee did, using the same firm, Squire Knapp Ochs. "It was an unprecedented effort by the party to resuscitate the party," said Bill Knapp, a partner of the firm. "This was a party that was dead. It was flat. There were road marks on our backs."
Blessed without opposition in the Democratic primaries, Clinton officials decided to strike early against the Republicans in part because of their experience during the debate over health care reform, when the officials concluded that they lost the public debate by ceding the advertising war to interest groups. Such early advertising may now become the standard, some consultants said.
"I do, in fact, tip my hat and congratulate Squire and Bill Knapp and company for running a spectacularly successful advertising campaign," said Greg Stevens, another on Mr. Dole's final advertising team. "They came out early and defined the race, and defined Bob Dole. They did it in a very disciplined way."
Mr. Clinton's first advertisement of the campaign ran on June 27, 1995, praising the President's record on crime. But the commercial that, in retrospect, seemed to form the template for most Democratic advertising did not appear until August. It was paid for by the Democratic National Committee.
"The Republicans are wrong to want to cut Medicare benefits," the announcer declared, in a commercial broadcast in select states that showed faded images of the faces of Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Dole floating beside the Capitol. "And President Clinton is right to protect Medicare, right to defend our decision as a nation to do what's moral, good, and right by our elderly."
A more traditional, old-school Democratic advertisement might have taken a class warfare tack, arguing that the Republicans wanted to cut Medicare to give a tax break to the rich. In fact, that was the claim that the American Federation of Labor made in its Medicare advertisements attacking Republican Congressmen.
Instead, the Presidential advertising always emphasized that cutting Medicare "was a violation of our duties and our values," Mr. Knapp said. "That was a huge departure, and a critical, critical difference."
As Mr. Clinton made his bid for the political center, one of his campaign's guidelines for advertising was to emphasize values rather than Government programs. Another was to stress unity rather than class warfare.
The Presidential spots, supplemented by the labor advertising, formed the backdrop for many tight Congressional races, helping candidates like Debbie Stabenow, who prevailed in Michigan's Eighth Distict over Representative Dick Chrysler, a Republican freshman.
The tightly focused, repetitive Democratic advertising kept many Republicans on the defensive, at least until campaign finance questions began to dog Mr. Clinton in the final weeks of the campaign, said Charles E. Cook Jr., an independent analyst of House races.
Paradoxically, Republican incumbents may have benefited from Mr. Clinton's lead in the polls, as well as the strength of the economy, consultants said, because many voters stopped paying attention to politics.
"Nobody clued in, so it became an incumbent year, and so the Republicans played to that by isolating their races," said Doug McAuliffe, a Republican consultant who, among other races, helped Representative J. D. Hayworth of Arizona fend off a stiff challenge.
To isolate their races, incumbents highlighted their role providing constituent service.
Mr. Innocenzi, for example, discovered that one of his candidates, Representative Steven H. Schiff of New Mexico, was under withering advertising fire as a Gingrich clone. He responded with a 60-second commercial in which a man described how Mr. Schiff had intervened to help his son, a former gang member who had changed his ways and was serving in the Navy. Having discovered the man's checkered past, the Navy was on the verge of kicking him out, his father said, when Mr. Schiff intervened to get him a hearing.
"That's ultimately what you want," Mr. Innocenzi said."Someone to represent you and take care of you."
Mr. Schiff won.
The other way to isolate the race was by attacking the challengers -- "ripping their faces off," in the words of Mark Mellman, a consultant to the Democratic Congressional leadership. And a last-minute advertising blitz by the Republican Party probably shored up several vulnerable Republicans.
Consultants on both sides said that they were astonished by the amount and the ferocity of the advertising this year. Candidates were broadcasting commercials up to three times more frequently than they might have 10 years ago, some said, partly because there are so many more channels now, and so much more advertising clutter.
Mr. Mellman recalled winning a Connecticut race in 1982 by buying only enough air time for two negative commercials so that voters would see the spots eight times.
"Today, that wouldn't get you on the radar screen," Mr. Mellman said. "You have to speak loudly and carry a big stick."

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: THE PRESIDENCY -- THE ADMINISTRATION;
Same Star, but Supporting Cast to Change

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton came home to a sentimental rally on the South Lawn of the White House this afternoon -- and to a Cabinet and senior staff shuffle already swirling around him.
By the time Air Force One touched down at Andrews Air Force Base in the early afternoon, bringing Mr. Clinton back from his victory celebration in Little Rock, Ark., his Secretaries of State, Defense, Commerce and Energy, or people close to them, had let it be known that they would not be staying on. 
 Minutes later, the Cabinet members sat like so many schoolchildren in red, white and blue T-shirts proclaiming, "Welcome Home President and Mrs. Clinton!" Taking note of his dapper Secretary of State's unorthodox attire, Mr. Clinton said, "That picture of Warren Christopher in that T-shirt gets out -- he'll be on Letterman and Leno within 48 hours."
In fact, Mr. Christopher will soon be home in Santa Barbara, Calif., sipping one of his favorite chardonnays. The 71-year-old Secretary, who headed Mr. Clinton's transition team in 1992, spent two hours in Little Rock with him on Tuesday afternoon, informing the President of his intention to leave sometime after Inauguration Day. The list of possible successors includes former Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine and Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, who is retiring.
The White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, marched down the steps of the South Portico to the cheers of his assembled troops, telling the President: "Before you are the engineers, the designers and the workers who will build that bridge to the future."
But Mr. Panetta will not be among them, off instead to his home in California, perhaps to run for governor. Senior White House aides said Mr. Clinton was working hard to persuade his former deputy chief of staff, Erskine B. Bowles, who now heads his own investment concern in North Carolina, to return as White House chief of staff.
"It's close," one senior aide said of Mr. Bowles, who is known to be reluctant to return but who has also become one of the President's most trusted friends and who has already been advising him for weeks on the transition, along with Vernon E. Jordan, the Washington lawyer and longtime Clinton confidant. "But it's not there yet."
Defense Secretary William J. Perry informed members of his staff today that he intended to leave early in the new Administration, although he, too, is expected to remain at the Pentagon for a few months, until a successor is confirmed by the Senate, officials said. His possible successors include the Director of Central Intelligence, John M. Deutch, a former Deputy Defense Secretary, and Mr. Nunn, the former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, one of Mr. Clinton's earliest political comrades in arms, has also told the President he does not want to continue in the job he took after the death of Ronald H. Brown, or to be considered for other posts.
The White House also made it clear today that Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary will go. Among those mentioned most often to succeed her is Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico.
Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena is also expected to leave, and the brother of Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago, William M. Daley, a lawyer who was a leading candidate for the post four years ago, may claim it this time.
But at least one oft-mentioned change will now apparently not occur: Mr. Clinton has been said to want to replace Attorney General Janet Reno, but she has made her desire to stay on equally plain. White House officials acknowledged today that pending inquiries into the Democratic Party's fund-raising practices meant that Ms. Reno would stay for the time being.
While some aides strongly encouraged Mr. Clinton to seek the pro-forma resignations of all his Cabinet members -- as Richard M. Nixon did after his re-election in 1972, for example -- Mr. Panetta decided it would be more orderly to sound out members informally. Over the last several weeks, aides said, he has done so, and made the President's wishes clear.
"Nobody had to be kicked," one senior aide said.
Mr. Clinton had initially hoped to have enough work done on the transition to leave for a weeklong vacation in Hawaii next Tuesday before beginning a 10-day official visit to Australia, the Philippines and Thailand. But top aides said they now expected him to delay his departure until later next week, to get as much done as possible. Once he leaves, the President is to be out of the country until Thanksgiving, and the White House is eager at all costs to avoid the last-minute decisions that plagued his first transition.
As it is, the President's schedule is busy. Tonight he attended a thank-you dinner dance for major Democratic donors at the National Building Museum here, and aides said he might hold a news conference on Friday if he had appointments to announce by then.
Among Mr. Clinton's economic advisers, musical chairs are possible. Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the National Economic Council, appears undecided about her next move. Her husband and son have moved back to Berkeley, Calif., where she was a professor before joining the Administration, and she has been commuting between California and Washington almost every week. But she might be persuaded to stay if she is offered a Cabinet job, her colleagues say.
The most frequently mentioned alternative for her is Labor Secretary, if Robert B. Reich, whose family has moved back to Boston, leaves the Administration. Mr. Reich has not yet indicated what he plans to do. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, already one of the President's most influential advisers, is expected to stay on.
George Stephanopoulos, the onetime "war room" wunderkind who has functioned as Mr. Clinton's all-purpose adviser, conscience, mind-reader and occasional whipping boy for nearly five years, will leave the White House staff soon, and he is exploring job options in academia and the news media with plans to make speeches on the side.
Hovering over the whole transition is Vice President Al Gore, and aides said they expected him to have a say in all major decisions. His appearance at the welcome-home rally today amounted to the first step in his own expected campaign in 2000.
Mr. Gore joked that he would now join the short list of Democratic Vice Presidents elected to two terms: John Nance Garner, Thomas R. Marshall, Daniel D. Tompkins and George Clinton.
"He was the first, so from George Clinton to -- from Clinton to Gore!" the Vice President told the crowd, which began chanting, "Four more years!" at that apparent reference to his own plans.
"Oh, oh, no, no, no -- no, no, no, no, no!" Mr. Gore insisted. "You misunderstand me. George Clinton, 1805 to 1812, from New York, first Democratic Vice President to be elected. The other, I assure you, is just a slip of the tongue."

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: THE STATES -- THE GOVERNORS;
Chinese Roots of Winner Delight the Pacific Rim

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Surrounded by news crews from all over the Pacific Rim, Gary Locke was asked today what it felt like to make history. A Democrat who won the Washington State gubernatorial race by a landslide, Mr. Locke will become the nation's first Chinese-American governor.
"It's hard for me to think of myself as a role model," said Mr. Locke, the son of Chinese immigrants. "I'm just an average guy." He likes to tinker with plumbing, is a baseball fan and will occasionally break out in Broadway song. 
 On election night, as supporters handed out fortune cookies and danced, Mr. Locke was singing "Something Good," from the movie "The Sound of Music."
In the wake of Mr. Locke's 20-point victory over Ellen Craswell, a Republican, many of Mr. Locke's supporters were treating him as anything but average.
"It's a big story -- the American dream come true for Asian-Americans," said Judy Yu, who has been acting as an intermediary for the Asian media crews that have swarmed around Mr. Locke and his wife, Mona Lee Locke. "It's very rare for Asian people to go into politics to begin with."
Indeed, Mr. Locke has said that his family was discouraged when he decided to go into politics after he graduated from Yale University.
In January, he will move into the Governor's Mansion in Olympia, a few blocks from where his grandfather once worked as a houseboy. His grandfather later returned to China. But his father emigrated to America, fought against the Germans in World War II and settled in Seattle.
Mr. Locke was elected governor of a state with an Asian-American population that makes up only about 4 percent of the state's 5.5 million people.
He won, many analysts said, not by playing up his ethnicity -- it was never an issue in any public forum -- but by advancing his ideas and his personal narrative as someone who grew up in public housing and did not even speak English until after his fifth birthday.
In the 24 hours since Mr. Locke was elected, leaders in China and Taiwan have already invited him to visit their countries on trade missions, he said today.
Washington, the most trade-dependent state in the country, has long had close economic ties with Asia, selling Boeing airplanes, Microsoft software and Yakima Valley apples abroad and importing electronic goods and clothes.
The majority owner of Seattle's major league baseball team, the Mariners, lives in Japan.
Up and down the West Coast, the age of the Pacific Rim has long been heralded as an inevitable pivot of history. But while trade and cultural connections between the American Pacific coast and Asia have grown considerably in the last decade, the political power of Asian-Americans has developed more slowly.
With all the negative publicity over the Democratic National Committee's ties to questionable Asian fund raising, the Locke victory has provided a positive counterpoint, Mr. Locke's supporters said.
"People are just so proud," said Dorothy Chen, president of the Seattle Chinese Womens Club.
"This is front-page news in Taipei, in Hong Kong and Beijing," said United States Representative Jim McDermott, a Democrat from Seattle who has known Mr. Locke for 15 years. "You get a first-generation Asian-American elected governor by a huge margin -- it's just a marvelous statement about the values of America."
Mr. Locke attributes his rise toeducation.
He was an Eagle Scout and graduated from Yale University, then worked as a prosecutor. He spent 10 years in the State Legislature. Now 46 years old, he is serving his first elected term as King County Executive, governing the most populous county in Washington.
"Education," he said on election night, "is the great equalizer." He tried to interest his 800 or supporters gathered in a ballroom in Seattle to chant the words about education, which he said would be his No. 1 issue.
Republicans had tried to portray Mr. Locke as a tax-and-spend liberal. On social issues, he favors gay rights and affirmative action -- two positions that Republicans thought would give them some traction in the race.
But Mr. Locke benefited from an opponent who was so closely tied to the religious right that about 1 in 5 Republicans said they could not vote for her, according to late independent polls. Mrs. Craswell said she was going to run state government according to "God's plan," and she criticized homosexuals as immoral. Several prominent Republicans publicly supported Mr. Locke.

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: THE PRESIDENCY -- THE OVERVIEW;
CLINTON PREPARING FOR 2D TERM WITH SHUFFLE OF TOP OFFICIALS

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

 BODY:
President Clinton followed his 31-state electoral sweep yesterday by beginning to build a new Government, accepting the resignations of some of his top Cabinet officials, including Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
The moves indicated that Mr. Clinton intended to act swiftly to inject some freshness into a second term in which he is facing a much-reduced agenda and a Congress still controlled by the Republicans. 
 White House officials said Mr. Clinton might hold a news conference later this week at which he would discuss his Cabinet shuffle and name some replacements.
Others who have told Mr. Clinton that they plan to depart include Defense Secretary William J. Perry; Leon E. Panetta, the chief of staff, and Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor. The leading candidate to replace Mr. Panetta is Erskine B. Bowles, a friend of the President who is his former deputy chief of staff.
Although the shuffling consumed the White House yesterday, it was not a surprise that a shake-up was in the offing. Several of Mr. Clinton's top lieutenants, including Mr. Christopher and Mr. Perry, have signaled their desire to move on for weeks or, in some cases, months.
But some of the talked-about changes, like replacing Hazel R. O'Leary, the Energy Secretary, were said to be wanted by the President. Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, has told friends that he plans to resign for personal reasons. But Administration officials said one much-rumored change -- the resignation of Attorney General Janet Reno -- was rejected out of concern about pending investigations of the Clintons and their friends and aides.
Officials said that Mr. Clinton did not want to appear to be interfering in those investigations by removing Ms. Reno and that in any case, he feared he would have trouble getting Senate approval for her replacement in the current political climate.
It was not clear how many of the other members of Mr. Clinton's Cabinet, if any, would be leaving.
The composition of the new Cabinet and the rest of Mr. Clinton's new Government may provide some clues about his priorities as he tries to work with the new Republican Congress.
During the campaign, he did not offer much in the way of a second-term agenda, beyond small-gauge proposals that were intended by his strategists more to appeal to specific groups of voters than to provide a blueprint for governing.
Rather than talk about Republicans in Congress, Mr. Clinton dwelled today on his own victory over Bob Dole. Despite the President's dominance of most regions of the country, with 379 electoral votes (270 are needed to win), he won 49 percent of the popular vote -- falling short of the 50 percent he had hoped for to claim a mandate from the American voters. Mr. Dole drew 41 percent, with 8 percent for Ross Perot.
Returning triumphantly to the White House yesterday afternoon from Little Rock, Ark., the President told his staff at a welcoming ceremony on the South Lawn, "This race was won because of the record we made and because of the plans we have and because we have established in the minds of the American people that it's more than talk with us -- that we work at it hard every day."
Haley Barbour, the Republican national chairman, congratulated Mr. Clinton, but he said the President had been re-elected only because he had adeptly appropriated Republican issues for himself.
"It was a super campaign, and Bill Clinton is a super candidate," Mr. Barbour said at a news conference in Washington. "He is the most outstanding political performer of my lifetime, and he deserves great credit. But we have to say straightforwardly that he campaigned as a moderate Republican, which was the right thing to do because that's where the American people are."
He added, "Bill Clinton went out and there were days that sounded like Ronald Reagan had taken over his body."
In one of the many postmortems among Republicans yesterday, Tony Fabrizio, Mr. Dole's pollster, conceded, "We never really controlled the agenda."
With all the whispering about musical chairs in the Administration, it was striking how swiftly the attention of official Washington turned yesterday from electoral politics to the business of governing. That may be because election night on Tuesday will not be remembered as particularly gripping. Mr. Clinton's victory over Mr. Dole had been widely expected for weeks, and there was no shift in control of Congress.
The absence of suspense may also help explain why the turnout on Tuesday was the lowest level for a Presidential election since 1924.
About 49 percent of the nation's voting-age population voted, according to a survey of voters leaving the polls. The final tally could rise slightly after several hundred thousand absentee ballots are counted.
Yet the outcome of the election only prolonged the unsettled state of American politics, with neither Republicans nor Democrats able to claim the upper hand.
Mr. Clinton, who drew 43 percent of the vote four years ago, is the first President since Woodrow Wilson to be elected twice without a majority of the popular vote. As a result, he may again face a struggle to reassert his relevancy with the Republicans on Capitol Hill.
White House officials are already fretting because some Republican leaders yesterday made clear that they intended to pursue with vigor inquiries into ethical and campaign finance allegations swirling around the President and the Democratic Party.
But at least for the day after the election, the watchword was cooperation, as both the President and Republican leaders in Congress talked of their desire, and need, to continue to work together.
Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, said the election results "gave us all another opportunity to work together." But he also seemed to put the White House on notice. Referring to voters at a news conference in Washington, Mr. Lott said: "It's obvious that they have some reservations about President Clinton. On the other hand, they did return our Republican majority to the Congress to sort of keep an eye on him."
Yet tensions are certain to continue on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue because while Republicans hung on to Congress, they could not claim an overwhelming mandate either. In the 435-member House, the Republicans' majority of 236 seats fell to 225 seats won, with 4 seats undecided and 2 depending on a runoff election next month in Texas. In the 34 Senate races, the Republicans' majority grew to either 54 or 55 seats, depending on the outcome of a race in Oregon.
Not surprisingly, Republicans and Democrats offered far different interpretations of the Senate and House results.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, general chairman of the Democratic Party, said at a news conference in Washington that after the Republican takeover of Congress two years ago, the outcome amounted to a "repudiation of the so-called Republican Revolution and an endorsement, at least, of common sense leadership."
He emphasized that voters had turned out more than a dozen Republican incumbents in the House, though an overwhelming number held on to their seats.
But Mr. Barbour, the Republican chairman, said the results only reaffirmed the takeover in 1994. "In 1994," he said, "Republicans won the greatest midterm majority sweep of the century. We went from minority to the majority, winning more -- and up and down the ticket, and across the country. And often in our political lifetimes after that, there's a rebound. And a lot of people predicted a rebound here, but instead of a rebound, we got a reaffirming election."
And Speaker Newt Gingrich, who was as much the target of Mr. Clinton's campaign as Mr. Dole, said of the Republicans' showing in the House: "It's pretty amazing, a truly historic moment.
"The last time the G.O.P. successfully defended a House majority was 1930, during the Presidency of Herbert Hoover."
James Innocenzi, a Republican consultant, said the election could have a moderating influence. "This was a softening election," he said. "All the extremists on both sides lost."
There was less of an effort yesterday to interpret how Mr. Clinton won re-election. That may be because Mr. Dole's defeat had been expected and because the healthy economy and Mr. Clinton's adept re-election organization seemed to give the Republicans little hope of winning back the White House. Still, Republicans vowed that they would once again claim their dominance of the White House.
Among those thinking about the race in the year 2000, the attention focused on Vice President Al Gore, particularly since two of his possible rivals for the White House were disappointed on Tuesday night: Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, had hoped to become Speaker.
And Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, would have enhanced his reputation significantly if his party had reclaimed the Senate.
White House aides said Mr. Clinton had intentionally put off most staff decisions until now because he feared he would jinx the election. But in the days leading up to the election, he dispatched Mr. Panetta to meet with several top appointees to gauge their interest in staying on -- and to strongly drop hints if the President did not want them to continue.
"This is the natural end point and the natural starting point," said George Stephanopoulos, the senior adviser to the President who for months has talked openly of leaving after the election.
But there was no immediate reshuffling after President Ronald Reagan's re-election in 1984, although T. H. Bell, the Education Secretary, announced his resignation a few days after the election.
Mr. Perry, the Defense Secretary, informed his staff yesterday that he intended to leave early in the new Administration. But he told reporters traveling with him to Europe last month that there was never a good time to leave.
"I don't think there is any good time or bad time walking away from the job as Secretary of Defense," he said. "There is always a problem. There is always a crisis. There's always some program that is halfway completed."

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: THE REGION -- THE CHOICE;
In New Jersey, Democrats See Renewed Hope

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
The 1990's have been a good decade for Republicans in New Jersey. They have seized control of the governorship and both houses of the Legislature. But many Democrats ran unexpectedly well in the state on Tuesday, raising the party's hopes for a year from now, when Gov. Christine Todd Whitman is up for re-election.
Even the Republican Senate candidate, Representative Richard A. Zimmer, mentioned in his concession speech that Mrs. Whitman's re-election campaign had now begun. 
 That may be distressing news for the public, reeling from weeks of saturation political advertising on television. But as the gubernatorial race gathers steam, the strong showing by President Clinton and Representative Robert G. Torricelli, the Democrat who defeated Mr. Zimmer in the Senate contest by an unexpectedly wide margin of 53 to 43 percent, will encourage many of the half-dozen or so Democrats who have been contemplating a challenge to the popular first-term Republican Governor.
Women and minority-group voters responded enthusiastically to the Democrats' themes this year, a survey of voters leaving the polls in New Jersey found. Turnout in the cities and other traditional Democratic strongholds was heavy. In the Eighth Congressional District, which includes Paterson and Passaic, a Democrat, Mayor William J. Pascrell of Paterson, defeated an incumbent freshman Republican, Representative William J. Martini.
It would be hard to fault Democrats, after their dismal statewide showing in recent years, for not seeing in the election results at least the glimmer of a brighter future.
Representative Robert E. Andrews, a Democrat from Camden County who will probably seek the nomination to challenge Mrs. Whitman, said he thought the debate had now shifted to issues like jobs, education and the environment, giving Democrats the upper hand.
"When the debate shifts, we win," Mr. Andrews said. "There is no question that what happened yesterday was a revival of the Democratic base."
But several experts said Democrats and Republicans should be cautious about reading long-term trends from the results on Tuesday, especially any that might involve the Governor.
"The Democrats have reason to be encouraged, but they shouldn't get heady," said Stephen A. Salmore, a professor at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University and a Republican campaign consultant.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Torricelli ran well by capitalizing on voters' anxieties about cutbacks in popular middle-class programs, like Medicare, educational aid and environmental protection, that had been proposed by Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republican leadership in the House.
Fifty-four percent of New Jersey voters disapproved of the Congressional leadership, a survey of people leaving polling places on Tuesday found, while 41 percent approved. Mr. Torricelli was able to seize on that dissatisfaction by portraying Mr. Zimmer as too extreme for the state's moderate voters.
But tagging Mrs. Whitman as a Gingrich clone would be difficult for potential Democratic challengers. She does not vote in Congress, and unlike Mr. Zimmer, she is well known throughout New Jersey with a substantial record of her own.
Seeking to counteract Mr. Torricelli's tactics, Mr. Zimmer had tried to characterize himself as fiscally conservative but socially moderate, "a Christie Whitman Republican," as he said countless times.
Mr. Zimmer failed to make that connection with voters. But Mrs. Whitman will surely have much less difficulty making the case.
There were also some encouraging signs for the Governor in Tuesday's survey of voters. Fifty-seven percent of those surveyed said they approved of her performance in office, with 40 percent saying they disapproved.
The poll of 2,018 voters on Tuesday was conducted by Voter News Service, an association of ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, NBC News and The Associated Press.
A slight plurality of voters said they thought government should do more, rather than less. A large majority, 57 percent to 39 percent, said they thought it was possible for the Federal Government to cut its deficit while also reducing taxes.
Mrs. Whitman won election in 1993 by promising a 30 percent cut in the state income tax, and she made good on that promise. The Governor is an advocate of a smaller, more streamlined government and of using tax cuts to stimulate the economy, and her positions continue to mesh well with voters' sentiments.
When Democrats controlled Congress, New Jersey tended to be a little more conservative than the rest of the country and to vote Republican a little more often, largely because it is wealthier and more suburban than most states, Mr. Salmore of Rutgers said.
With the Republicans having retained their majority in Congress, New Jersey is now slightly to the left of the rest of the country, he said.
"What that says is that a Republican in New Jersey has to be a little more moderate than the party as a whole, and that's Christie Whitman," Mr. Salmore said.
Mr. Zimmer was unable to separate himself from the Republican leadership in Congress this year, but other Republicans in New Jersey did. Six Republican Representatives were re-elected on Tuesday, including Marge Roukema of Ridgewood, a moderate who represents parts of Bergen, Passaic, Sussex and Warren counties in northern Jersey, and Frank A. LoBiondo of Vineland, in South Jersey, a centrist who has been rated well by environmental organizations.
David P. Rebovich, a professor of political science at Rider University, said it would be a mistake to see the election results as a broad ideological shift, primarily because the President and Mr. Torricelli had concentrated their campaigns on a few, highly charged issues, like education and Medicare.
Many political professionals were surprised by the margin of Mr. Torricelli's victory, but they also noted that the dynamic in the Zimmer-Torricelli race would be different from Mrs. Whitman's re-election campaign.
Cliff Zukin, a professor of political science at the Eagleton Institute, said the Governor had to be considered "a prohibitive favorite," because she will begin her campaign as a well-known and popular figure. Whoever emerges as the Democratic candidate is likely to be much less known statewide.
"Voting publics are generally loath to turn out known, well-regarded incumbents," Mr. Zukin said. "And they are unwilling to do that in the face of an unknown. It's a big risk."

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: NEW YORK STATE -- BALLOT QUESTION;
With Term Limits Affirmed, Politicians Ponder the Future

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
One day after New York City residents voted to keep limiting elected officials to only eight years in office, many City Council members spent the day yesterday pondering their options once they are forced to step down in 2001.
While Council members contemplated retiring, returning to private life or seeking other public office, most of the other city officials affected by Tuesday's vote -- the Mayor, the Comptroller, the Public Advocate and the Borough Presidents -- said the pending deadline meant little to them because they had never planned to stay in their positions beyond another term. 
 The vote soundly rejected a proposal that would have lengthened the existing limit of two terms, or 8 years, to three terms, or 12 years.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has not yet announced plans to run for re-election next year but is expected to do so, said yesterday that he was not disappointed by the eight-year limit on the Mayor's office.
"I think two terms is an adequate time to get done the things you want to get done in government," he said. "I had always been a supporter of a three-term limit for New York City mayors because of the history and tradition of New York City. But I don't have a real quarrel with two terms."
In this century, 3 of the 19 Mayors served three four-year terms: Fiorello H. La Guardia, Robert F. Wagner and Edward I. Koch.
The Mayor said, however, that he was concerned about the implications of having virtually all City Council members leave at the same time. "I think that will be a terrible situation for the city in the year 2001," he said, "and I'll consult with the Speaker of the City Council to see if there are any other ways to address that."
The Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, led efforts to defeat term limits in 1993 and spearheaded this year's referendum to change them. But he said that he would not further challenge term limits. Instead, he has started to consider ways to strengthen the Council's professional staff, so that when a largely freshman Council takes office in 2002, there will be sufficient support to help them understand the workings of city government.
The vote was 505,120 in favor of lengthening term limits, and 586,890 in favor of keeping the two-term limit enacted in 1993. Manhattan was the only borough where the measure to lengthen term limits had majority support, picking up 52 percent of the vote. Longer term limits were most strongly opposed on Staten Island, where 69 percent voted against them, and in Queens, where 56 percent voted no.
While the effect of term limits will be felt most immediately in city government, the limits could reverberate beyond into state and national politics.
With 49 of 51 Council members facing unemployment in five years if they run and are re-elected to the Council next year -- the other two, elected more recently, can serve until 2003 -- many will probably consider running for higher office.
Others may return to private law practices or labor union jobs, or go to work for other elected officials. Or they may become lobbyists.
"It's going to be up to every individual and their constituents, but obviously there's going to be major change and we have to start preparing for that," said Kenneth K. Fisher, a Brooklyn Councilman who is considered a likely candidate for Speaker of the City Council if Mr. Vallone leaves before 2001.
Walter L. McCaffrey, a Queens Councilman who also is considered a candidate for Speaker, said, "This is not the kind of thing that you can plan fully in life, but I think all of us are probably thinking about ways to try to make our so-called marks in history."
Mitchell L. Moss, director of New York University's Urban Research Center, said state legislators and Congressmen from the city will soon realize that the city's term limits could mean serious challenges in what otherwise would have been sleepy re-election bids in which incumbents are routinely victors.
The fact that Mr. Giuliani will be limited to two terms, for example, could affect the field of candidates that emerges to run against him in next year's election.
"You have to assume that some people who haven't yet announced their intentions to run for mayor next year probably wanted to wait and see how this vote went," said Ruth W. Messinger, the Borough President of Manhattan, who has said that she plans to run for mayor in 1997. "It could both encourage and discourage people from entering the race."
Hank Morris, a political consultant who is close to Alan G. Hevesi, the city's Comptroller, said Mr. Hevesi had not yet considered how the term limits might affect his decision on whether to run for mayor.
Mr. Morris said, however, that some potential candidates might decide not to run in 1997, thinking that their chances would be greatly improved if they waited until 2001, when they would not have to face Mr. Giuliani.
He also noted, however, that many people have run for office prepared to lose a first election so that they could position themselves better to win in a subsequent election.
"So there might be people who decide to run in 1997, figuring they'll lose to Giuliani, but that will make them stronger candidates in 2001," he said. "No matter what happens, it'll definitely make for some interesting times."

HEADLINE: Booming Brooklyn

 BODY:
One of the truly heartening urban success stories of the past decade has been the quiet transformation of downtown Brooklyn, fueled by a series of well-conceived joint public and private investments. The resurgence of New York City's most populous borough will gain fresh momentum today with a ceremonial ribbon-cutting opening Atlantic Center, a new 400,000-square-foot shopping complex at the junction of Flatbush and Atlantic avenues. The site, a city-owned urban renewal property, was proposed 40 years ago for a new stadium to persuade the Brooklyn Dodgers not to flee to Los Angeles. It has stood vacant ever since.
The new retail development features suburban-style "big-box" outlets for Caldor, Old Navy, Sports Authority, Marshalls, Pathmark and other stores. It is expected to provide more than 1,200 permanent jobs in addition to shopping opportunities for a neighborhood that is not well served by big retail chains. 
 Six blocks away, meanwhile, work has begun on a new Marriott hotel, Brooklyn's first new hotel in 50 years. The hotel site is located across the street from Metrotech, the growing office complex begun in 1986 on 10 blocks of blighted property. Metrotech's success led to the rediscovery of Brooklyn as a commercial center, convenient to Manhattan's business districts and able to offer lower rents.
A new report by the Regional Plan Association rightly calls Brooklyn's revitalization "a sign of optimism for the entire country." The report cautions, however, that future progress could be difficult, in part because Brooklyn's image as an "old inner city" persists despite the new construction and general sprucing up in the area, involving universities, arts institutions and businesses. In addition to providing a much-needed economic and psychic boost for New York City, the opening of Atlantic Center should help erase that image. After years of decline, Brooklyn is coming back.

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: NEW JERSEY;
Voters Approve Bond Act for Dredging Harbor

 BODY:
A bond act that will provide $185 million to help pay for dredging New York Harbor and other waterways passed with 68 percent of the vote on Tuesday.
On another ballot measure, 70 percent of voters said yes to a constitutional amendment that would dedicate 4 percent of corporate taxes to cleaning up hazardous waste sites and removing underground storage tanks. 
 Donald T. DiFrancesco, the president of the State Senate, said he would offer proposals for implementing the bond issue.
Another $125 million will be used for economic development plans in South Jersey, restoration of inland waterways and lakes and cleanup hazardous waste sites.
On the local level, ballot proposals authorizing the Board of Freeholders in Passaic County to raise taxes for buying open space and developing parks apparently squeaked through Tuesday, officials said yesterday.
According to unofficial returns, a measure to allow property taxes to rise as much as 2 cents to buy land was approved by 600 votes out of more than 80,000 cast. A second measure to allow a similar increase for park development passed by 338 votes. The tax increase could raise more than $9 million a year, said Robert Calise, the county's finance director. A tally of absentee ballots will not available until next week.
In Monmouth County, voters approved a similar tax increase by a vote of 140,000 to 51,000.

HEADLINE: In Toulouse, High Culture Embraces High Tech

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: TOULOUSE, France

 BODY:
"The paradox of Toulouse," Mayor Dominique Baudis says of this southern French city of 600,000 people, "is its combination of one of the most complete heritages from the past and the most advanced technology in all of France, all in the same place."
France may eventually bankrupt itself trying to keep up at both ends of the time scale, but the results here are unusual. 
 At the high-tech end, near the city's airport, two huge aircraft manufacturers, Airbus and Aerospatiale, dominate a Silicon Valley-like landscape.
At the historical end, in the ancient streets of the center of the city, rises the terraced spire of the 12th-century Romanesque Basilica of St. Sernin, the most celebrated of a cluster of churches and monasteries that made Toulouse a major stop on the medieval pilgrimage route to the shrine of St. James of Compostela.
For two weeks in October, the two faces of the city turned toward a celebration of musical instruments that were at the summit of the art of mechanical engineering until the Industrial Revolution -- the historic pipe organs in St. Sernin and a dozen other city churches -- with the first international organ festival of Toulouse.
"We worked on this festival for 20 years," said Mayor Baudis, 49, before the final concert. "My thinking was that we had 20 historic organs in the city, more than in any other city in France, and that we ought to make the most of the legacy. I wanted this festival to be for the organ what the Salzburg Festival is for the opera."
At least 10,000 people came to the festival's 21 concerts, paying $17 a seat at most of them. Both the city and the national Government also contributed millions of dollars to repair or restore a dozen of the historic organs.
Just to restore the famous three-keyboard, 54-stop instrument in St. Sernin, a symphonic organ built by Aristide Cavaille-Coll in 1890, cost $720,000, evenly divided between city and state, said Jan Willem Jansen, one of the church's organists, who also helped run the festival.
Thanking the Mayor for the city's support, Mr. Jansen said the festival would be repeated next year. "The organ is, if not exactly a marginal instrument, one that needs, perhaps, a second wind these days," he said.
They do not build organs in Toulouse these days, but airplanes have figured importantly in the city's economy ever since the days when the author Antoine de Saint-Exupery was a pilot based here.
Airbus Industrie, a consortium of four European aviation companies, is working on the design for a new plane to succeed the Boeing 747, currently the largest jumbo jet.
Aerospatiale, which owns 37.9 percent of the consortium and does the final assembly of most Airbus planes here, is planning to merge with the privately owned Dassault Aviation as a public stock company next year.
Under pressure to compete more efficiently, it has reduced the size of the labor force by 17 percent over the past three years, mainly by attrition, and unemployment in the Toulouse area is now about the same as the French national average -- 12.5 percent.
"We don't know yet if the merger will bring further cuts, but everybody is nervous," said a union official who asked not to be identified.
But in this city, people recognize that technological advances sometimes have their limits. The organ restorers at St. Sernin, Jean-Loup Boisseau and Bertrand Cattiaux, collaborated in a partly unsuccessful attempt to computerize the mechanical components of the organ at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris in 1992. Here, they left well enough alone.

HEADLINE: THE 1996 ELECTIONS: THE STATES -- THE INITIATIVES;
In California, Foes of Affirmative Action See a New Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

 BODY:
Supporters of a measure to dismantle state-sponsored affirmative action programs in California predicted yesterday that its approval would begin a new era of equal opportunity by wiping out preferences based on race or sex in public hiring, contracting and college admissions.
But civil rights advocates said that the results did not necessarily foreshadow a surge of opposition to affirmative action in other states or in Congress. 
 California approved the measure, Proposition 209, on Tuesday by a vote of 54 percent to 46 percent.
The measure was supposed to take effect immediately, but critics, including minority contractors, filed a lawsuit yesterday in Federal District Court in San Francisco to block enforcement. The suit maintained that the measure denied "equal protection of the laws" to women and members of minority groups in violation of the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution.
On the other hand, the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative group representing supporters of Proposition 209, filed a suit in state court in Sacramento yesterday, seeking prompt enforcement.
The proposition amends the California Constitution to say, "The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education or public contracting." The new ban also applies to cities, counties, public schools and public colleges. It does not affect any court order or consent decree or any act required as a condition of receiving Federal money.
The measure means, for example, that the University of California may not consider race or sex as a factor in student admissions and that city governments may not set aside contracts for businesses owned by black or Hispanic people.
The measure was one of 90 initiatives put to voters across the country on Tuesday. California and Arizona voted to legalize the use of marijuana as medicine to combat nausea or alleviate pain, and in California supporters celebrated by smoking marijuana cigarettes. Florida rejected a tax on sugar producers to create revenue to help clean up the Everglades. Maine rejected a ban on clear-cutting of forests.
In California, Gov. Pete Wilson and Attorney General Daniel E. Lungren hailed the vote for Proposition 209 and vowed to resist legal challenges.
Bob Dole had endorsed the California measure, and Mr. Wilson had hoped to use it to mobilize support for Republicans in the election.
"Beginning today," Mr. Wilson said, "Californians will be judged by one standard and one alone: their individual merit. I can think of no better way to reinstill the basic American principle of equality for all under the law."
The campaign against affirmative action has had particular resonance in California, where such programs have been hotly debated for nearly two decades. Most recently, in July 1995, the University of California Board of Regents voted to curtail affirmative action. Opposition to affirmative action was a cornerstone of Mr. Wilson's brief Presidential campaign, and he championed the ballot initiative.
Robert K. Best, president of the Pacific Legal Foundation, said: "California initiatives tend to be trend-setters. When California moves with a populist initiative on an issue high on the public agenda, it is often mimicked in other states."
But civil rights advocates and educators said it was important not to exaggerate the measure's effect.
Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, and Wade J. Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition of national organizations, said yesterday that they did not expect a wave of similar measures.
"This issue did not go anywhere in the Presidential campaign," Ms. Berry said in an interview. "It didn't seem to help Bob Dole. So for national politicians, there do not seem to be great benefits in pursuing the issue. We have all kinds of evidence of heightened racial tensions in America -- F.B.I. hate crime statistics, church fires, a riot the other day in St. Petersburg, Fla., continuing fallout from the O. J. Simpson verdict. I don't see anybody in Congress who thinks they could win fame and fortune by leading an anti-affirmative action campaign."
Mr. Henderson said that women emerged as a powerful force in this election, and that as a result politicians might be wary of attacking affirmative action programs, which often benefit women. He added that President Clinton had deflected anger over the issue with his strategy of "Mend it, don't end it."
David R. Merkowitz, a spokesman for the American Council on Education, an umbrella group for the nation's colleges and universities, said that although he was disappointed by the vote in California, universities would remain committed to the goal of affirmative action. "It in no way changes our position on affirmative action and racial diversity," he said. "We will work with our member institutions in California to find ways to maintain access to higher education for all groups and to promote diversity, which we regard as a key ingredient in educational quality."
Richard C. Atkinson, president of the University of California, said the university "will comply with the law." In a letter yesterday to university officials, the provost, C. Judson King, said, "Effective immediately, campuses may no longer use race, ethnicity, sex or national origin" as a criterion for selecting students.
But Mr. Atkinson said the university would find ways to admit "greater numbers of disadvantaged young people" -- for example, by working with elementary and secondary schools to prepare such youngsters for college.
Nancy M. Zirkin, a lobbyist at the American Association of University Women, predicted that Proposition 209 would have "a very minor impact on Congress." In the last two years, she said, proposals to ban affirmative action did not make much progress on Capitol Hill, and she does not expect them to win more support in the new Congress.
Governor Wilson issued an executive order yesterday directing state agencies to identify programs that grant or encourage preferences based on race or sex. At the same time, he said, state agencies should try to "recruit qualified applicants from all segments of the relevant work force."
Here is a summary of results on other ballot questions.
 
Marijuana
The California measure permitting use of marijuana for medical purposes prevailed by a vote of 56 percent to 44 percent; the vote in Arizona was 65 percent to 35 percent.
The California initiative says, "No physician in this state shall be punished, or denied any right or privilege, for having recommended marijuana to a patient for medical purposes." It does not require doctors to prescribe marijuana.
The Arizona measure says that any doctor licensed to practice in the state may prescribe marijuana to treat a disease or to relieve the pain and suffering of a patient who is seriously or terminally ill.
Federal officials vehemently opposed both measures, but it is unclear whether Federal authorities will take action against doctors or patients in either state.
Mr. Lungren, the Attorney General of California, said, "We're going to have a very confused legal situation here," because doctors who recommend marijuana may find themselves in violation of Federal law.
 
Term Limits
Voters in nine states signaled support for Congressional term limits. But five other states rejected such limits.
The nine states expressing support were Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada and South Dakota. Those rejecting them were Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming.
The United States Supreme Court ruled last year that, in the absence of a constitutional amendment, neither states nor Congress could set term limits for members of Congress.
Typically, the measures on state ballots this year asked candidates to pledge support for Congressional term limits. Those who refuse to do so or who violate such a promise after making it would have their positions noted on the ballot in future elections.
 
Wildlife and the Environment
In Florida, voters rejected a proposal to impose a tax of one penny on each pound of raw sugar grown in the Everglades region. The money would have been used for conservation and protection of the Everglades. At the same time, Florida amended the state Constitution to require a two-thirds majority of voters to approve new taxes.
Robert H. Buker, vice president of the United States Sugar Corporation in Clewiston, Fla., the state's largest sugar producer, said: "Floridians clearly said no to higher taxation. Everyone has a desire for a cleaner environment, but there is a heavy antitax sentiment here. The sugar tax would have put many of Florida's sugar producers out of business. They could not have competed with producers in other states and foreign countries."
Rindy M. O'Brien, vice president of the Wilderness Society, said: "The sugar industry poured a lot of money into this campaign. Advertising determined the outcome, persuading voters to go in and vote against the initiative. If we had been able to match the industry dollar for dollar, the outcome would have been different."
In Maine, a proposed ban on clear-cutting on 10 million acres of northern forests failed after the most expensive referendum in the state's history. Among the opponents were the paper industry, which spent more than $5 million, and Gov. Angus King, who said the plan would have cost the state thousands of jobs.
"The gun that has been pointed at the head of the Maine economy is now uncocked, unloaded and off the table," Mr. King said yesterday.
Among Maine residents voting on the issue, 47 percent expressed support for a competing measure that would reduce but not ban clear-cutting. This measure, the Compact for Maine's Forests, was developed by timber companies and some environmental groups, with support from Mr. King. It will be put on the ballot in a future election.
Robert C. Deis, a spokesman for Citizens for a Healthy Forest and Economy, a coalition of business and environmental groups, said, "We are very pleased that the citizens of Maine rejected the extreme proposal to ban clear-cutting and supported the competing measure." Ms. O'Brien of the Wilderness Society said she did not regard the outcome as a setback for environmentalists. Indeed, she said, the strong support for the compromise measure shows that Maine has made "a major advance over where it was 5 or 10 years ago."
Voters approved ballot measures to place limits on hunting in Alaska, Colorado, Massachusetts and Washington State. Idaho and Michigan rejected measures that would have limited hunting. Oregon voters upheld a measure, adopted in 1994, that bans the use of bait and hounds to hunt black bears and cougars.
Wayne P. Pacelle, vice president of the Humane Society of the United States, said ,"This is a strong rejection of inhumane and unsportsmanlike hunting practices that inflict needless suffering on animals," he said.
 
Other Measures
Colorado rejected a proposed amendment to the state Constitution declaring that parents had inalienable rights to "direct and control the upbringing, education, values and discipline of their children."
California rejected two proposals to impose tough new regulations on health maintenance organizations.
Crime victims won new protections in Connecticut, Indiana, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina and Virginia.
Casinos and other gambling proposals lost out in Ohio, Arkansas, Colorado, Nebraska and Washington.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 8, 1996, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a brief report about Alaska yesterday in the state-by-state election summary misstated the result of a ballot measure to limit hunting there. It was approved.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Operating Room

BYLINE: By A.M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
So, to sum it all up with clarity and charity: The American people chose as President a man most of them do not trust and who has not revealed his goals for his new administration, except to build some kind of cockamamie bridge. And, God bless America, they were right -- given the circumstances.
As I walked to cast my grumpy vote I was mindful of the time a couple of years ago when the doctor told me I had to have coronary bypass surgery. That seemed outrageous. I demanded to know the alternative. He informed me immediately. Given the circumstances I leapt toward the operating room. Now the blood courses like a wild torrent through my body lithe and lean. 
 Facing the alternative offered by the current attitudes, agenda and candidates of the Republican Party, the voters decided reasonably if not joyously to give themselves over once more to a Clinton administration.
That decision was set in motion soon after the Republican Congressional victory in 1994. Speaker Gingrich happily cried out that the new American revolution had arrived. That made his popularity with the public last about 10 minutes.
President Clinton then understood that America wanted a non-revolutionary, all neat and polite, to stand between it and Congress. He knew exactly the man.
Republicans could have saved themselves had they freed the party from its ideologues and modified hard-line positions on abortion, gun control, immigration. But no. Then they came up with a candidate whose idea of leadership was to repeat the same phrases three or four times without drawing breath, so that the stupids out there could grasp them.
For the past four years, the two parties have been doing everything possible to destroy each other. Now we come to the traditional post-election rituals.
Democrats and Republicans will prattle awhile of how they will cooperate like mad. Nobody fooled, nobody hurt -- a little non-snarl time lets everybody pause for another ritual, telling the winner how to be a big success after he takes the oath.
I have only one suggestion, Mr. President. Be candid with yourself, what you have done and are doing.
Decide for yourself whether John Huang or anybody else broke the law against mixing fund-raising with political dealing. If so, get rid of all those involved. If you had any hint, say so. It is the best way to avoid the impalement for which your enemies plan and slaver.
You have gone back on your promise to use American economic pressure to diminish repression in China. Your aides say you will break your promise not to keep American troops in Bosnia for more than a year. Facing yourself: Can you do nothing to salvage your name?
You have promised to try to find jobs for people thrown off the welfare rolls under the bill you signed. Will you keep your word? Tell yourself, then us.
Do you mean it when you say affirmative action should be mended, not ended, or will you go with the flow to kill it? Did your own contacts in Arkansas and the color of your skin not affirmatively help your career?
Will you become America's leader against drugs? Devote the time and heart needed? If so, why did you not lead the fight against the near-legalization in California of marijuana, the proven gateway drug to hard drugs and mean deaths?
You know that money from tax-free foundations, particularly those of George Soros, pushed the marijuana proposition to success. Do you also know that the legalizers expect to put across more such legislation in states across America -- using more from Mr. Soros and other folk whose own children are not likely to wind up in gutters, brains crippled by drugs?
What does your mirror tell you about how hard and often you will expose that?
Will you stop pretending nuclear danger has disappeared, and talk to Americans about how China sells weapon-grade nuclear materials and techniques to rogue states and the danger of nuclear smuggling from Russia to terrorists?
So on. The President can create a second term worthy of the pride of the nation and his descendants. But he needs inner and public candor to achieve it. Whether God's blessing on America will include that, we cannot tell, but Mr. Clinton can.

HEADLINE: New Cabinet In Japan: Quite a Lot Like the Old

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was formally re-elected in Parliament today, inaugurating a loose coalition Government that says it is serious about streamlining the national bureaucracy.
Mr. Hashimoto's re-election, after his Liberal Democratic Party's victory in general elections last month, marks a return after three years to the customary situation in Japan in which the Liberal Democrats hold all the Government posts. 
 In the new Cabinet, which Mr. Hashimoto made public today, Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda retains his post, as does Seiroku Kajiyama, the chief Cabinet secretary. Other Cabinet ministers are new, but they are mostly figures who have been in and out of similar posts before and are not expected to shake the Government up dramatically.
"A Cabinet that may be forced to make severe choices has been formed," Mr. Kajiyama said, adding that the new administration's most important challenges will be to streamline Government and bolster the national finances.
Mr. Hashimoto, 59, bowed to supporters in Parliament today and did not make a speech, but he has suggested that he intends to press ahead with economic deregulation and Government restructuring. Commentators have been skeptical, though.
It is expected to become more clear in the next few months how strenuously Mr. Hashimoto will push for economic and political changes. All parties, including the Liberal Democrats, campaigned on platforms of far-reaching change, but among the top few parties the Liberal Democrats seemed least enthusiastic about the idea.
Mr. Hashimoto is scheduled to meet President Clinton at a conference of Asia-Pacific leaders in the Philippines this month, and the Government here hopes to forge a strong relationship with Washington during Mr. Clinton's second term. Mr. Hashimoto has been a tough negotiator during trade disputes, but he is a strong supporter of the American-Japanese security relationship.
The new Government is a bit of an oddity, more than a minority Government but less than a full-fledged coalition.
The Liberal Democrats governed Japan as a virtual one-party state for most of the nation's postwar history, but for the last two years they had to share Cabinet posts with other parties to remain in the Government. In last month's elections, they won 239 seats in the 500-member lower house, the more important chamber in Parliament, just a dozen short of an absolute majority and many more than any other political party.
So the Liberal Democrats worked out agreements with two smaller parties, the Social Democrats and New Party Sakigake, which between them have 17 seats. The two smaller parties are supposed to cooperate with Mr. Hashimoto in most respects, but they will not have any Cabinet posts.
In addition, some independents will support Mr. Hashimoto. As a result, Mr. Hashimoto was elected Prime Minister today with 262 votes, a slim but workable margin that suggests he will be able to hold on to power for some time -- though perhaps not for the full four years until the time when the next general elections must be held.
Among other major posts, the Finance Minister's job went to Hiroshi Mitsuzaka, a 69-year-old party leader who has already served as Foreign Minister and in other top positions. The new Minister of International Trade and Industry is Shinji Sato, 64, who is a former Transport Minister and the son of former Prime Minister Eisaku Sato.
Kabun Muto, 69, a former Foreign Minister, was named head of the Management and Control Agency, with responsibility for overseeing plans to streamline the bureaucracy.
Traditionally, Cabinet secretaries have often been little more than figureheads, with the real decisions made by career bureaucrats in the ministries.
But Mr. Hashimoto appointed seasoned officials not just to the top posts in each ministry but also to the posts of parliamentary vice minister, apparently in a signal that he wishes to exert greater political control over the bureaucracy.

HEADLINE: 3d Quarter Saw Only Slight Rise in Productivity

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
The productivity of the American workplace barely increased last summer, the Government said today in a report that contained hints of possible inflationary pressures.
The Labor Department reported that nonfarm productivity -- output per number of hours worked -- inched up just two-tenths of 1 percent at a seasonally adjusted annual rate from July through September. 
 The growth, short of the rise of five-tenths of 1 percent in the April-June quarter, was the slowest since productivity fell 1.1 percent in the final three months of 1995. Many analysts had expected a decline of about two-tenths of 1 percent in the third quarter.
"It confirms we have a classic late-cycle slowing of productivity under way," said Stephen S. Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley & Company.
Mr. Roach, who had previously said that the economy was entering a period of markedly improved productivity from corporate job cuts and restructuring, now said he believed that the earlier efficiencies were temporary.
"Companies have not really uncovered the Holy Grail on what makes their processes more efficient," he said.
Economists consider increases in productivity to be a critical factor in raising Americans' standard of living. The sluggish growth in productivity for more than two decades has been cited as a reason for stagnant personal incomes.
Productivity increases averaged just 1 percent from 1973 to 1995. That was only about a third of the growth rate of the 1950's and 1960's.
Greater efficiency means businesses can increase wages without raising prices, because workers are producing more with the same amount of work. If unmatched by productivity gains, increases in labor costs must often be passed on to consumers.
Indeed, the report showed that unit labor costs -- typically two-thirds of a product's price -- shot up at a 3.7 percent rate in the summer. Costs had risen 3.3 percent in the second quarter and just 1.5 percent in the first.
"That's where inflation starts," Mr. Roach said. "We're seeing yet another early warning sign."
In the report, the Labor Department said output rose at a 2.5 percent rate in summer, down from 3.2 percent from April through June. The number of hours worked increased at a rate of 2.2 percent, compared with 2.4 percent the previous three months.
Manufacturing productivity increased at a 6.3 percent rate, more than twice the 2.9 percent rate in the second quarter and the fastest pace since a 6.7 percent rate in the first three months of 1994. Manufacturing represents about 18 percent of American employment.
Total business productivity, including farming, was up at a rate of three-tenths of 1 percent. It had shot up at a 1.1 percent rate in the second quarter and a 2 percent rate in the first.

HEADLINE: In America;
The Farce Before the Storm

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Fasten your seat belts and shoulder harnesses, you are going on a wild, wild ride. Forget the nice-nice talk coming out of Washington. The daggers are only temporarily sheathed. To get from here to Election Day 2000, voters will have to travel a chaotic and confusing route through a succession of political combat zones.
At the moment, perennial warriors like Al D'Amato, Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott are trying on camouflage outfits. Senator D'Amato, whose Whitewater hearings backfired, causing more damage to him than to the President, is now saying, with a straight face: "It's not the time to be looking at investigations. . . . We should leave that in the hands of the special prosecutor and shouldn't be attempting to substitute our judgment." 
 Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Lott are talking about compromising and finding "common ground" on tough issues with Bill Clinton and the Democrats. Any day now I expect them to show up in the Oval Office, drape their arms around the President and sob in unison, "We love you, man!"
This is the farce before the storm.
Reality is somewhere in the high-pitched wail of Ross Perot. That's where you will hear, if you can stand it, serious warnings about some of the conflicts to come. The lineup of existing and potential investigations into Whitewater, the firings in the White House travel office, the misuse of F.B.I. files, Democratic fund-raising practices and other matters is daunting. And there is every danger that a circus-like atmosphere will surround the Supreme Court hearing early next year on whether a sexual-harassment suit against Mr. Clinton should go forward while he is in office.
Bipartisanship in the face of such matters is a fantasy. Mr. Perot believes the country is headed toward a constitutional crisis that could take two or more years to resolve. "The last thing we need," he said, "is to lose two more years while our Government is frozen because the President is being investigated."
Meanwhile, despite all the talk about a centrist consensus, there are sharp and sometimes bitter divisions among the voters and within both parties. Daniel Yankelovich, the president of Public Agenda, a nonpartisan research organization, said in an interview more than a week ago that he believed Tuesday's election would be remembered for "institutionalizing the gender gap."
Women have not been nearly as willing as men to buy into the idea of dismantling government. Women have tended to be much more concerned about carefully defining the role of government and maintaining a social safety net.
Said Mr. Yankelovich: "The question from women is, 'What should government do?' We never had that debate and we are going to have to have it now because of the gender gap."
The views of a large percentage of women voters were reflected in a number of issues that candidates from both parties have recently rallied around: protecting Medicare and Medicaid, defending the environment, investing in education, increasing the minimum wage, making health coverage more portable.
Robert Borosage, co-director of the Campaign for America's Future, a progressive advocacy group, said, "Just four years ago, that would have been called a liberal agenda."
Even as the Republican Party is trying to figure out how to appeal more effectively to women, its far-right wing is hard at work in its search for a suitable troglodyte to support in 2000. The Christian Coalition's president, Pat Robertson, was quoted yesterday in The Times as saying, "We were not consulted on this campaign. We were peripheral."
He said that wouldn't happen again.
While the G.O.P. fights that one out, the Democrats will be confronted by huge numbers of voters who are upset by the Administration's lurch to the right and the economic inequality that persists despite the President's claims that the economy is doing swell. And Big Labor is back and wants its voice heard. Al Gore will have plenty of company in his quest for the nomination.
All of this will be played out against the mania that is bound to accompany the arrival of the 21st century. Hang on. You have never been on a ride like this before.

HEADLINE: Manufactured Home Makes New Bid for Chateau Properties

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Manufactured Home Communities Inc., the mobile home operator controlled by Sam Zell, the Chicago financier, yesterday withdrew its hostile tender offer for the rival Chateau Properties Inc. and proposed a revised bid aimed specifically at winning over Chateau's largest shareholders.
The new deal offers Chateau investors a choice between $26 a share in cash, the same as Manufactured's original offer, or a sweetened package of convertible preferred securities intended to appeal to those Chateau shareholders who want to defer taxes. J. P. Morgan, which is advising Manufactured, values the convertible securities at $26 apiece. 
 "The offer now puts all parties involved on an equal footing in a transaction that creates the company with the best assets, the respect of the investment community and the best position to dominate this market," said David A. Helfand, the chief executive of Manufactured.
The new offer, with a total value of $387 million, is yet another attempt by Manufactured to head off a merger between Chateau and ROC Communities Inc., another mobile home operator. Analysts have valued that deal at $24 a share or less, depending on the stock prices of the two companies.
In a statement yesterday, Chateau said it would review Manufactured's offer "in due course." So far, Chateau has refused to have any discussions with Manufactured, saying it was not for sale.
Almost 60 percent of Chateau is controlled by holders of operating partnership units, known as O.P. units, securities created by real estate partnerships to avoid steep taxes when they convert their holdings into publicly traded real estate investment trusts, or REIT's. The units have no voting rights until converted to common shares, which creates a tax liability for their holder.
Unit holders had complained that Manufactured's original deal, which offered Chateau investors $26 a share in cash or 1.15 Manufactured shares or O.P. units, was worth less to them than to shareholders.
If they took the cash, they would incur a hefty tax liability. But the stock swap option would give them securities valued at just $22.43 apiece based on Manufactured's closing price yesterday -- a 14 percent discount to the cash offer.
Since it made its original offer in August, Manufactured has been negotiating with several of Chateau's unit holders in an effort to address their concerns. The company's sweetened offer gives the unit holders tax shelter, an option to sell their Manufactured units back to Manufactured should the price drop below $26, and a $2-a-unit annual dividend, better than the $1.62 dividend they would get in a Chateau-ROC merger.
"From the Chateau unit holders' perspective, it's a significantly better offer than what had been on the table previously," said Jim Sullivan, an analyst at Greenstreet Advisers, a real estate advisory firm in Newport Beach, Calif. Manufactured has not had any discussions with John A. Boll, chairman, founder and largest O.P. unit holder of Chateau. Mr. Boll holds 3,378,906 O.P. units, or about 23 percent of the total shares and units outstanding.
Mr. Sullivan said Mr. Zell's new offer could create a division between Mr. Boll and his co-founder, J. Peter Ministrelli, who is no longer active in Chateau, and other unit holders. Together, the two men own roughly 5.75 million O.P. units, or about 39 percent of total shares and units outstanding. Other investors hold the remaining 3.3 million units.
"From the minority unit holders' standpoint, economic considerations are paramount, and Manufactured's new offer is attractive economically," Mr. Sullivan said. "Economics are important to Mr. Boll and Mr. Ministrelli, too, but there appears to be other factors which are affecting their decision-making."
Manufactured also said yesterday that it had withdrawn its request for a preliminary injunction to block the Chateau-ROC merger.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Pace Declined During September

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Consumers remained cautious as the summer turned to fall.
For the first time in more than three years, borrowers in September paid off more credit card and other nonmortgage debt than they newly borrowed and installment loans declined 2.7 percent at an annual rate. 
 The Federal Reserve's midafternoon report helped explain why household spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity, slowed, braking the economy's growth sharply this summer. For the holiday shopping season to improve over a poor 1995 Christmas, consumers would have to reopen their pocketbooks. And that is exactly what most economists are expecting.
"It's a voluntary, temporary pullback," contended Christine Chmura, chief economist at Crestar Bank in Richmond. "The economy is in good shape, which suggests that consumers are just pausing."
Indeed, retailers reported a good start to the fall, with sales in October up significantly nearly across the board.
The decline was in keeping with other reports that showed virtually no change in personal spending in September and a summer quarter in which consumption growth decelerated to a pace of just four-tenths of 1 percent from 3.4 percent in the spring.
It was also consistent with a modest reported tightening of bank lending standards at a time of record credit card delinquencies.
"We're going to see the consumer retrenching a bit," said Martin Regalia, economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce. But he pointed to growing employment, continued high confidence, swelling stock market wealth and even a jump in the savings rate as factors arguing against a serious spending slowdown.
The Fed's report showed declines in automobile debt to a pace of 3.1 percent and in a category that includes education, mobile homes, vacations and boats to a rate of 9.1 percent.
The third major category, revolving debt, advanced but at only a 2.6 percent pace following 6.7 percent growth in August and 18.9 percent in July. This was regarded as a clear sign of retrenchment even though this statistical series has become muddied by increasing use of credit cards for convenience or to get such benefits as frequent-flier miles rather than for actual borrowing.
According to Kenneth R. Crone, a senior vice president at Visa U.S.A., 60 percent of card users now pay their entire balance within 30 days, up from 50 percent five years ago.
It is also hard to tell "confident" borrowing from "distress" borrowing, analysts say, especially since the Fed provides only a net change in outstanding debt with no breakdown of extensions and repayments.
The most recent decline was in May 1993, when the economy was still expanding at a subpar pace following a slight first-quarter decline in total economic activity. Consumer installment debt, generally viewed as an indicator that tracks the economy's current performance, also fell during several months of the 1990-91 recession.
On a year-to-year basis, growth of installment debt peaked at about 15 percent in July 1995 and has now eased to 9 percent, Ms. Chmura calculated.
The decline in automobile credit was $1 billion in the latest month, an amount exactly offset by the rise in revolving credit, the report also showed. The "other" category slumped $2.6 billion to account for the overall decline to $1,172,500,000, from $1,175,100,000 in August.
"In the long term, this should brace the economy," said Oscar Gonzalez of John Hancock Financial Services in Boston, referring to the trend of debt deceleration. "In the short term, it reduces the threat posed two years ago when borrowing and debt had reached unsustainable levels."
Credit unions fared best last month, raising their outstanding volume by $1.1 billion while savings institutions and commercial banks added $800 million each. Nonfinancial businesses had a $2.4 billion reduction.
The Fed's report also showed that interest rates on new cars at auto finance companies edged up to 10.52 percent from 10.49 percent, while the average maturity rose to 51.9 months from 51.4. The average size of a car loan was $17,182, up $255.

HEADLINE: Focusing on Black South Africa;
Returning After 8 Years, Kodak Runs Into White Anger

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Nov. 7

 BODY:
When most blacks here want a picture of a birthday party, a child's first day at school, or even a new dress, they rarely take it themselves. In the townships, a camera is an expensive and sometimes daunting piece of equipment, something to be handled by a professional like Innocent Mahoa.
Mr. Mahoa, 21, is one of thousands of street photographers who charge roughly 85 cents a photo -- a pittance, to be sure, especially when customers order only one. But the Eastman Kodak Company, returning to South Africa after an absence of nearly eight years when it agreed to observe sanctions against apartheid, is trying to make sure that every nickel-and-dime photo opportunity is another Kodak moment. 
 "I am not doing this only to make a profit," Mr. Mahoa says. "I want to prove to my children that photography is important. That it is not for white people only."
This is music to the ears of Kodak, which is vigorously pursuing the black consumer market while it tries to win back the favor of whites, some of whom resent it for leaving in the first place. When Kodak left the country in 1987, it had 60 percent of the film market. When it returned in 1994, it had only 4 percent -- all of it gray-market purchases for professional photographers.
The Fuji Photo Film Company and, to a lesser extent, Agfa, a unit of the Bayer Group, and Konica had stepped into the gap. And since 1994, despite the company's world-famous name, Kodak's market share has returned to only about 12 percent.
Part of the reason is that the Fuji distributorship, owned by the Premier Group, a large food, pharmaceutical and retailing conglomerate, has a tight grip on the South African market. It owns or has contracts with 600 of the country's 950 small labs, requiring that they use only Fuji paper and chemicals and stock 80 percent Fuji film, according to surveys by S.A. Photo, an industry magazine.
And, as Kodak acknowledges, there is lingering animosity among some whites. "We stock their film because tourists ask for it," said the manager of a Foto First lab in the wealthy northern suburbs here. "But a lot of people here won't buy Kodak because it left the country. Fuji stuck it out during the bad times."
That is a painful lesson many American corporations that left during sanctions have learned. There is little gratitude for having done the right thing: the Mandela Government gives no special breaks to companies that honored sanctions. Whites, who still have most of the disposable income, are loyal to companies that stayed. Blacks, only now getting a piece of the economic pie, don't know the brands that left.
"A whole generation has never been exposed to Kodak," said Brian Schwartz, who owns a new Kodak Express lab in the Woodmead Shopping Center, in a white neighborhood in northeastern Johannesburg.
Yet some companies that left prospered, finding ways to continue selling their products. Coca-Cola, for instance, moved only to Swaziland, a small independent nation surrounded by South Africa, and distributed through South African Breweries. Pepsico truly left, and its market share plummeted.
Pepsi is trying to come back, touting itself as "the drink of liberation," buying lots of billboards in the townships and using prominent black Americans like Whitney Houston and Johnnie Cochran as spokesmen. Coke still dominates the market.
Unlike cola, however, film has until now been a business for white customers. Nearly all the small labs are in white neighborhoods, or in downtown shopping areas patronized by people of all races. During Kodak's absence, Fuji and Agfa did little to expand the customer base. Roughly the same number of rolls -- 10 million -- were sold in this country last year as in 1990. That's about a quarter of a roll a person a year, compared with roughly two rolls a person in the United States.
To expand, Kodak is franchising its own small labs, like Mr. Schwartz's, that stock only Kodak products. It hopes to have 110 by 1998, but it's slow going. Virtually every mall already has a Fuji-connected lab, and there are very few malls in black areas.
Kodak is also mailing free test rolls of its newest slide film to professional photographers. It is advertising on television. But the ads, unlike Pepsi's, are nonracial and apolitical -- the same "Kodak for the Moments of Your Life" ones used in the United States.
Its most important strategy, however, said Ron Crane, managing director of Kodak South Africa, is to encourage blacks to shoot pictures. "Seventy percent of South Africans have never taken their first picture," he said.
In areas where blacks shop, Kodak is selling rudimentary plastic 35-millimeter cameras with batteries and film for about $27. In two places, they are marked: "Uses Kodak Film," a calculated statement since any 35-millimeter film would fit.
Fuji's reaction to the threat is dismissive. Kodak executives and outside analysts say that Fuji is arrogant, and a conversation with Malcolm Ryan, managing director of Fuji South Africa, seemed to bear that out.
"Obviously, as a household name, they are going to gain some market share," he said. "But I don't think it will be significant. I believe they'll take it from Agfa, since their 35 percent share is unreal.
"We're the leader," he said. "It's for them to chase us."
Mr. Ryan also suggested that appealing to black customers was futile. "We've done a lot of study of that market," he said. "Blacks don't see their own past as a happy memory, so they don't want photos of it. For example, they don't see their kid going to school on the first day as a happy thing, because they have to go to a township school or walk five miles to school."
Asked about that, Innocent M. Ndlovu, Kodak's man in charge of reaching out to street photographers like Mr. Mahoa, sneered. "What a load of rubbish," he said. "You can see why they've never shown any commitment to the black market."
Calculating that its best point of entry is street photographers like Mr. Mahoa, Kodak is going to great lengths to win them over. A two-month survey by the company found that what they wanted most were lessons in photography and business, and those can be pretty basic. Public education for blacks has been bad for decades, and some street photographers can barely read and write.
But Kodak has done things in a highly visible way, bringing over living legends like Gordon Parks to teach workshops.
"I learned from him to change the aperture when the weather changes," said Midion Mthimkhulu, who was sitting by a waterfall in a downtown park, hoping for customers to pose beside it.
Kodak has also had senior officers of local banks explain how to open a checking account. It offers kits to registered freelancers that include not only Kodak camera bags to spread the brand name, but also business cards and invoice books.
Perhaps most important, the company has developed a special film, ProFoto II, for them. Its emulsion chemistry is adjusted for taking black faces in bright sunlight. (Professional photographers all over Africa complain about the difficulty of getting such high-contrast exposures right.)
The film is also trimmed long, so that a careful photographer can get 40 shots from a roll of 36. And, in a price-sensitive market, it costs only $2.75 a roll -- compared with about $5 for Kodak Gold and $3.50 to $4.50 for Fuji or Agfa.
"We obviously try to keep it as far away from the amateur market as we possibly can," said Anthony Doyle, Kodak's marketing manager. "To buy it, they have to show a card saying they're in our freelance program."
Kodak also supports labs catering to street photographers, whose customers typically return in a day or two to look at the picture and pay for it. Thomas Thosa's lab on Bree Street downtown offers inexpensive processing for ProFoto II, plus a lounge, kitchen and lockers.
"A lot of the photographers live in squatter camps, and the postal service is no good there," Mr. Ndlovu explained. "And they can leave their gear in the box. There are a lot of robberies on the trains to the townships."
Mr. Thosa, a former street photographer, appreciates Kodak's attitude. "I come from a background where blacks weren't supposed to know anything," he said. "We buy photographs, but we don't think we can take them.
"Kodak explains how it works, and they say 'You need this thing -- when a child is born, you need a picture.' And besides -- a lot of blacks are moving into the middle class. They can afford to go on holidays to Kruger Park, or to the beach. There are no street photographers there."
Right now, said Mark Young, S.A. Photo's editor, customers say Kodak still seems disorganized. Its expanding sales force has trouble returning phone calls and getting deliveries in on time. "But I imagine they'll get that sorted out," he said.
Harvey Thomas, the publisher, said he expected Kodak's growth to take time. "They're fighting for market sectors, and they didn't choose the battleground," he said, adding that in 10 years' time, Kodak may be the film of choice. "But the Americans are going to have to spend a lot of money to get back," he said.

Dollar Slumps Against Yen After Tokyo Aide's Remark

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The dollar, which has appreciated by roughly 40 percent against the yen in the last 18 months, fell sharply yesterday after a key architect of its rise strongly suggested the yen had fallen far enough.
In comments to Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the leading Japanese financial newspaper, Eisuke Sakakibara, director general of the Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau, said, "We are not thinking of leading the yen any lower." 
 The dollar, which rose to its highest level in more than three years last week, when it reached 114.92 yen, fell after the remarks were published. Late in New York yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 111.60 yen, down 2.33 yen from 113.93 late Wednesday. During the day, the currency had fallen as low as 111.32 yen.
"The dollar was technically fragile, and the statement from Mr. Sakakibara pushed it over the edge," said Russell LaScala, head of the spot trading desk at Citibank.
Ron Leven, global currency strategist at J. P. Morgan, said the bulk of the dollar selling was done by speculators, not by Japanese investors, who have been big buyers of dollar-denominated assets, particularly United States Treasury securities, for more than a year.
But Mr. LaScala took issue with that view.
"Most of the action we saw was from international investors and the Japanese, who were big sellers of dollars," he said.
Perhaps more important, traders and analysts say, is that the pace of trading, which has been extremely lethargic for much of the year, is beginning to revive. That could mean that volatility in currency movements will return.
"For most of this year we went through a period where the world was confident that all things were converging," said Richard E. Witten, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "Most importantly, that inflation around the world was low. That reduced volatility a great deal. Now we seem to be getting back to a more normal trading market."
To illustrate the dollar's lack of volatility, Mr. Leven said that for the year as a whole up until now, the dollar had traded in a three-pfennig range against the German mark.
"If the dollar doesn't break 1.55 marks by the end of the year, it will be the narrowest range for that rate since 1972, when the dollar started to float," he said.
Late yesterday, the dollar was quoted in New York at 1.5120 marks, down from 1.5175 marks late Wednesday.
Mr. Sakakibara's comments were the first by any official from a major country about the dollar since President Clinton was re-elected on Tuesday, and the first in more than a year that questioned the continued strength of the currency.
Mr. Sakakibara's comments were in contrast to Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin's most recent statement on the dollar.
Last Friday, Mr. Rubin told reporters at the White House that he believed "in a strong dollar."
Although traders like Mr. LaScala said they expected the dollar to weaken a bit more against the yen, some analysts said Mr. Sakakibara's comments yesterday may have been prompted by recent criticism leveled against Tokyo by C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington research organization.
In an article in the current issue of The Economist magazine, Mr. Bergsten, a former Treasury official, accused Japan's Ministry of Finance of seeking a further 10 to 20 percent decline in the value of the yen against the dollar as a way of bolstering economic growth.
But Mr. Leven of J. P. Morgan said the Japanese had not been seeking a weaker yen to increase exports.
"Japanese exporters can compete very nicely with the yen at 90 to 95 to the dollar," he said.
"The reason they are pushing the dollar up is to shore up their fragile banking system."
Mr. Leven said that if the dollar were to weaken below 108 yen, Japanese banks, which are big owners of American assets, would be forced to sell their positions. He said he did not expect those levels to be tested, and suggested that the Bank of Japan would step in to buy dollars in the event they were.
Still, "for the time being the dollar has peaked against the yen," he said. "And longer term, the dollar will go down against the yen. We are still running trade deficits, and Japan is still running surpluses. And over the last 10 to 15 years, deficit-country currencies go down. That is not likely to change in the next five years."

HEADLINE: Stocks Set Record Again As the Dow Passes 6,200

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks set records for a second day yesterday, helped by an optimistic forecast for fourth-quarter sales from the Intel Corporation and a better-than-expected sale of 30-year bonds that sent yields back to eight-month lows.
"The environment is almost ideal" for investing, said Peter Canelo, chief investment strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds. "You've got a benign inflation environment" and a soft economic environment that's about to pick up. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average passed 6,200 for the first time, rising 28.33, to 6,206.04, after reaching an all-time high Wednesday. It was the Dow average's 33d record in 1996. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 3.06, to 727.65, its 31st record of the year. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 8.65, to 1,254.14, about 4 points shy of its closing record of 1,258.10. Stocks were buoyed by a rebound in bonds, which erased early losses after the Government sold $10 billion in securities at a maximum yield of 6.62 percent, an indication of strong demand for United States Government debt. Yields slid 8 basis points, to 6.53 percent, from 6.61 percent on Wednesday. The sale was the last of this week's auctions of $38.5 billion of notes and bonds.
"The market is definitely a little at the frothy end, but there is some reason for it, with the election and rates," said Patricia Chadwick, chief investment strategist at Chancellor LGT Asset Management, with $28 billion in assets. "Any concerns about things like health care that Clinton may have threatened are dead."
Intel, the world's largest maker of chips for personal computers, said it expects fourth-quarter sales and gross margin to beat third-quarter levels on increased new orders and strong sales of its Pentium line of computer chips. The company's shares jumped 3 1/4, to 122 1/8, spurring a host of technology shares higher.
"Strength is in technology today," said Edward Riley, chief investment officer at the Bank of Boston Corporation. "It is an industry that people expect will continue to beat numbers." Among PC makers, Gateway 2000 Inc. jumped 4, to 53; Hewlett- Packard Company rose 2 1/2, to 48, and the Compaq Computer Corporation rose 5/8, to 73 7/8.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 4.68, or 2.31 percent, to 207.34. The index has jumped 11 percent in the last five days.
The surge in United States stocks has further to go in 1997, according to some of Wall Street's top strategists. Goldman, Sachs & Company's Abby Joseph Cohen, co-head of Goldman's investment policy committee, said the Dow could reach 6,600 in the next six months. Retail shares lost ground amid a spate of mixed forecasts. Best Buy Company, an office products company, and Lowe's Companies, which sells hardware, said earnings would fall short of expectations. Best Buy fell 3 3/4, to 12 1/2, and Lowe's slumped 3 7/8, to 39 1/2.
Limited Inc., which sold a portion of its Intimate Brands division to focus on women's and men's outerwear, said its earnings could rise to 15 cents a share, a penny above analysts' estimates.
Its stock fell 2 1/8, to 18, because its 83 percent owned Intimate Brands Inc. unit, retailer of Victoria's Secret lingerie, said earnings would be lower than expected. Intimate Brands lost 3 1/2, to 16 1/2.
The Lockheed Martin Corporation shares fell 5/8, to 89 3/4, after the General Dynamics Corporation said it would buy two Lockheed units for $450 million. General Dynamics rose 1 1/4, to 68 1/2. The General Re Corporation rose 4 3/8, to 154 3/8, after the company said it earned $2.31 a share, down from $2.39 a share.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Continues to Gain; Coffee Prices Also Increase

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Copper jumped yesterday for a second day, reaching the highest price in almost two weeks, following a forecast for a smaller surplus than traders previously expected.
On other markets, coffee prices rose. 
 On Wednesday, Bloomsbury Mineral Economics halved its estimate of this year's global copper surplus to 50,000 metric tons. The London-based firm said it had lowered the forecast because global mine and smelter expansions were slowed by strikes, accidents and technology glitches.
The production decline comes at a time of dwindling copper inventories held in exchange warehouses. During the last two months, London Metal Exchange copper stocks plunged 56 percent, to 121,175 metric tons, their lowest since August 1990. A metric ton is 1.1 tons.
"Copper stockpiles will keep falling, even if it's at a slower pace," said Michael Casey, a vice president at Metal Commodities Inc. in St. Louis. While a surplus is still expected, exchange stockpiles may not see the new supply, he said, because "it goes to consumers and bypasses the warehouses."
Copper for December delivery rose 2.9 cents, to 95.55 cents a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the biggest one-day gain since Oct. 8.
Coffee prices surged for the third day, reaching a two-month high, amid concern that record-low exchange stockpiles and the slow pace of imports could cause a shortage in the weeks ahead.
Earlier this week, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York said stockpiles available for delivery to fulfill futures contracts totaled only 804 bags, the lowest since records began in 1980.
Though imports from this year's harvests in Colombia and Central America are starting to arrive, traders say they are already committed to roasters and will not enter exchange stocks.
"There is no available coffee for prompt sales," said Oscar Schapps, a trader at Hencorp Coffee Group in Miami. "There's coffee coming in, but those coffees are already committed."
December coffee rose 3.05 cents, to $1.2735 a pound, the highest price since Aug. 30.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE ELECTION: Anatomy of a Loss -- A Special Report;
How Bob Dole's Dream Was Dashed

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
On a gusty evening three and a half weeks before Election Day, Bob Dole was standing on a makeshift stage in an airport hangar in Wichita, Kan., smiling out at the audience. The scene before him was not inspiring. The hangar was just over half full, even though Mr. Dole was in his home state on a Friday night in the heat of the election season. A sizable portion of those who had shown up were Clinton supporters, there to disrupt the event.
Mr. Dole's, older sister, Gloria Nelson, who had driven 150 miles from their hometown of Russell, Kan., to join him, worked her way across the stage to stand beside him. "How's it going?" she whispered. 
 Mr. Dole's smile never left his face, and his eyes never left the crowd.
"Pretty rough," he said.
On Tuesday, Mr. Dole's political career, one of the most enduring in American political history, effectively came to an end. To run for President, he had resigned his seat in the United States Senate and given up the position he was, by many accounts, best suited for, majority leader.
Mr. Dole sacrificed these things not merely to lose the Presidency, but to run one of the most ineffectual Presidential campaigns in recent memory. Always the legislative tactician, Mr. Dole, according to his close associates, approached the Presidential race much as he did a Congressional negotiating session, believing that the key to victory was a clever endgame strategy. But so bleak were the polls, and for so long, that Mr. Dole was forced to realize, far earlier than most losing candidates, that the endgame would probably not be enough.
The week after he confessed his private pain to his sister, Mr. Dole, in two tense and scolding conversations with his campaign manager as he sat in a hotel room in southern California, offered what now appears to be an autopsy of his campaign. He was upset about the embarrassment of the bungled attempt to win Ross Perot's endorsement. He was mystified by the states his campaign had sent him to visit. He was unhappy with the television advertisements. He was convinced, in short, that the Presidency was about to escape him yet again.
At 73, Mr. Dole often seemed a man out of step with the times, and in President Clinton, he faced an opponent who had come to personify the methods of modern American politics. From the very start of his candidacy, Mr. Dole's friends wondered whether he had the political agility to take on Mr. Clinton, or whether it was worth risking his hard-won reputation for the uncertain prospect of unseating an incumbent in good economic times. By Tuesday, when Mr. Dole had completed his frantic shuttling across America and landed in Russell to vote, it seemed painfully clear that he did not, and that it was not.
Although he had built a career embracing deficit reduction, he had, in the hope of political gain, subordinated that goal to a call for a 15 percent tax cut. Although he had worked diligently to broaden the Republican Party, he found in the end he could barely hold onto its core voters. And although he had spent decades trying to live down his reputation as a "hatchet man," he finished his campaign on a note of bitterness.
There was something haunting, yet also finally authentic, about the way Mr. Dole ended his fourth and last national campaign, losing once again to a rival who, he clearly believed, was less deserving than himself. In the final weeks of the race, as it became apparent that there was no last-minute maneuver that would rescue him, Mr. Dole cut himself off almost completely from the aides who were trying to persuade him to end on an upbeat note. In frustration, he turned his attacks from his opponent to the press and finally to the voters themselves.
"Where," he demanded, again and again, "is the outrage?"
 
A Campaign Begins By Fits and Starts
Eight months before the first Republican primary, Mr. Dole -- reluctant and nervous -- went before an audience of film executives in Los Angeles to denounce what he described as the corrupting influence of Hollywood values on American culture. It was the spring of 1995, and Mr. Dole, it was assumed, was laying down one of the cornerstones of his campaign. The speech won him a flurry of attention both from the mainstream media and from the conservative activists who would be key to his electoral prospects.
But then, the issue disappeared. Mr. Dole barely discussed it. He did not incorporate it into his major speeches and it was never highlighted in his advertisements.
In retrospect, the Hollywood speech was a defining event for Mr. Dole's campaign, but not for the reasons the candidate and his aides might have hoped. It was the first of a series of bold statements and gestures that had no follow-up, a pattern that would prove devastating to his candidacy. In the most telling example, when Mr. Dole officially resigned from the Senate in June, the move seemed to create the perfect opening for the candidate to articulate the themes of his candidacy. That opening was never filled.
"We're trying to get good pictures," Mr. Dole instructed the huge contingent of reporters aboard his plane the first day after his resignation. "Don't worry very much about what I say."
Mr. Dole's third run for the Presidency was plagued by missteps, indecision and strategic blunders so fundamental that they bordered on amateurish. In any year, mistakes by a candidate and his staff can be damaging. But in the political environment Mr. Dole found himself in -- with a strong economy and an adept opponent -- they proved disastrous.
By now, many of Mr. Dole's weaknesses as a candidate have been abundantly documented. He is a halting public speaker who tends to ramble off the topic. He often comes across as stiff, even sullen, on television. He is given to wry off-the-cuff remarks that undermine his own arguments.
But beyond the traits that were in daily evidence as he traveled the country, Mr. Dole, it became clear, was limited by a view of the world shaped by over 35 years as a member of Congress. He was never ever to make the transition from legislative tactician to Presidential candidate, and he paid the price for that from the day he announced in Russell until the day he conceded in Washington.
"Dole has a lot of strengths and he has fewer weaknesses than people think," said Bill Lacy, one of the senior campaign advisers who was forced out after Mr. Dole lost the New Hampshire primary. "But he thinks like a legislator, which means he tends to think in cycles. He is not linear. Every day is new. Every day holds out hope."
Mr. Dole was always arguing that important campaign decisions could be delayed -- "His argument was that, 'we don't need to focus until the convention, until Labor Day," one aide said -- as long as possible. In that sense, he approached the election as if it were an omnibus bill, where the final compromise is forced by the deadline of a Congressional adjournment.
Similarly, Mr. Dole never managed to present a unifying rationale for his candidacy. As the Senate Republican leader, his job had been to focus on short-term tactics, not to conceptualize a broad agenda. And while some of Mr. Dole's allies came to argue that the notion that a candidate for President needs an overarching vision was a false construct, even they were dismayed by Mr. Dole's scattershot approach.
Some tried to coax him to change his ways. Gov. Steve Merrill of New Hampshire, for example, riding with Mr. Dole in a van shortly before his state's crucial primary, politely suggested to Mr. Dole that someone running for President needed to deliver the same speech at least four or five times, in order to assure that it seep into the public discourse. Mr. Dole, he recalled, seemed genuinely surprised by this observation, and rejected it, arguing it was "intellectually dishonest" to deliver the same speech over and over.
As the campaign progressed, on any given day, no one in Mr. Dole's camp could be quite certain what he might say -- much less whether he would address what was supposed to be his central topic. His aides responded by withholding advance texts of Mr. Dole's speeches from the press in case he did not deliver them. They fed reporters questions to ask Mr. Dole, so that he might say to them -- on airport tarmacs, in driveways, on the street -- what he had failed to say in the formal setting of his speeches. They critiqued Mr. Dole's speaking style to the press in the hope that Mr. Dole might take from the newspapers advice he had not taken from his staff. They aggressively shielded Mr. Dole from impromptu conversations with reporters, to avoid the flip remark that might turn into an embarrassing story.
By the end, Mr. Dole's aides and advisers had not only given up attempting to change his style, but were beginning to wonder if it had been a mistake to try. And for his part, Mr. Dole had taken to actively defying their efforts to protect him from himself. During the last 10 days of the campaign, he routinely ignored his teleprompter, and would wait until his press secretary had retired to the campaign plane's restroom and then bolt out of his seat to walk back and talk to reporters.
 
An Uneasy Team Goes Into Free Fall
In an effective campaign, the organization compensates for the shortcomings of its candidate. A stronger campaign team might have made up for Mr. Dole's weaknesses. Instead, the organization Mr. Dole assembled reflected and amplified his limitations, producing a kind of anti-synergy where the whole was less than the sum of its parts.
Mr. Dole surrounded himself with a group of like-minded people, short-term tacticians without strong ideologies. They were, by and large, young and inexperienced in the complexities of Presidential campaigning. Perhaps just as significantly, they had little personal history with Mr. Dole; few could say they felt comfortable with him and many had little personal loyalty to him.
Like the candidate, the campaign manager, Scott Reed tended to focus on immediate goals, rather than on long-term planning. His detractors at campaign headquarters took to privately mocking his habit of drafting endless "to-do" lists, which he kept neatly stacked on his desk. ("To do: find a message," was how one of his colleagues parodied the exercise.) Mr. Reed, who did not return phone calls seeking comment for this article, seemed to share Mr. Dole's faith that the election could be won in the fall, publicly asserting that the campaign was due a lucky break and privately confiding to reporters that newspapers were preparing devastating stories about the President's personal life. No such story was ever published.
The shortcomings of Mr. Dole's campaign team were apparent already last March when it became clear, though not yet official, that Mr. Dole would be the Republican Presidential nominee. Even in the darkest moments of the primary season, when Mr. Dole lost in New Hampshire, he had always remained the obvious front runner, so his victory could hardly be called a surprise.
Still, Mr. Dole's campaign was, according to those who worked on it, utterly unprepared for this moment. The months of April, May and finally June passed without anything approaching a general election plan. Mr. Dole was not advertising on television, pleading poverty after the primaries, though there was Republican National Committee money the campaign could have used, had it chosen to. In the meantime, the campaign organization began to break down into warring factions. Mr. Reed, the campaign manager, was barely talking to Don Sipple, whom he had hired to be the campaign's new chief strategist.
The Reed faction argued that Mr. Sipple was not producing, and made fun of the memorandums he wrote, which were filled with broad -- some called them fuzzy -- concepts, but no clear directives on how to proceed. ("Steady dependable leadership to secure America's future," was the slogan Mr. Sipple advised in one memorandum that was later distributed by his critics in the campaign, eager to discredit him.)
The Sipple faction, meanwhile, complained that its ideas were being ignored. So mistrustful were the two sides of each other that Mr. Sipple took to basing his memorandums on the NBC/Wall Street Journal polls rather than on the campaign's own internal polling data. The week after Labor Day, Mr. Sipple was forced out.
It was in that context of backbiting and infighting that the campaign essentially backed into what would eventually be its organizing theme: a 15 percent across-the-board tax cut that Mr. Dole proposed just before the convention. Some of Mr. Dole's advisers pushed the idea despite the fact that the campaign's own polling data suggested that, after the last two Presidents had promised tax cuts and not delivered, it would not be a winning issue. They also pushed it despite the concern among some of Mr. Dole's friends that it was so at odds with the former Senator's own history in Congress, and that it would undercut the argument that he was the more trustworthy of the two candidates.
By Labor Day, it had become clear that the tax cut plan was not catching on. Lacking any other unifying theme, Mr. Dole bounced through the fall, experimenting by the week with different messages: That Mr. Clinton was responsible for an increase in teen-age drug use. That he was a liberal. That he could not be trusted. That he was too liberal. That he was unethical. One result of these quicksilver changes, in the view of some of his own aides, was that Mr. Dole undermined his description of himself as steady and dependable.
With typical detached acerbity, Mr. Dole commented on his campaign's increasingly obvious deficiencies during the first round of debate preparations in October. Mr. Dole's debate advisers sought to put him through a run of trial questions and answers, according to a participant, but the candidate cut them off: "What I want to hear is not questions and answers: I want a strategy for winning this debate and winning this election."
Mr. Dole paused, and then delivered his own verdict to his assembled staff, seated behind tables in the ballroom at the Seaview Hotel in Bal Harbour, Fla. "We've never had a strategy for winning this election," he said.
With polls showing Mr. Dole's position growing not better, but worse, the infighting in the campaign became all the more public. Other aides made it known that Mr. Dole had long ago stopped talking to his own communications director, John Buckley, blaming him for the frequent leaks and constant feuding in the campaign. And they were furious, but not surprised, to learn that Mr. Reed, in an interview with The New Yorker six days before the election, had analyzed the campaign he was then still running in the past tense.
By the eve of the election, the campaign was involved in a full-bore brawl over who should bear responsibility for the defeat: Mr. Dole or Mr. Dole's campaign organization. The final consensus emerging yesterday was that there was plenty of fault for everyone -- but the campaign organization had ultimately failed the candidate with its fractious performance.
"This campaign couldn't sell a tax cut," one senior adviser said. "If we were a bordello, we'd go out of business."
 
Candidate Struggles To the Finish Line
On the first night out on the 96-hour, campaign-ending journey that would return him to Washington to concede on Tuesday, Mr. Dole stopped at a bowling alley in East Lansing, Mich. It was one of those ostensibly spontaneous, though in fact entirely staged events that campaigns routinely arrange -- a quick drop-by to win a flash of attention in the local press.
Once again, things did not quite turn out as planned.
Mr. Dole's campaign had publicized the "spontaneous" appearance in advance and, as had by now become routine, Democratic hecklers were waiting for him. As Mr. Dole picked up the microphone to address the assembled Friday night bowling leagues, Mr. Clinton's supporters broke into a chant of "Four more years!" At first Mr. Dole tried to yell over them -- "No more years!" -- but he had been campaigning for 14 hours straight and his voice was failing. Even at a distance of five feet, his words could barely be heard. Looking ashen and frustrated, he quickly gave up and led his entourage back to the caravan of buses waiting in the night.
For almost a year, Mr. Dole had struggled to make himself into what he was not: A "private citizen, a Kansan, an American, just a man" who had not really spent his adult life on Capitol Hill. A devoted tax cut advocate. "The most optimistic man in America," as he described himself in his acceptance speech in San Diego.
Now, at the end of the campaign, Mr. Dole knew he had lost, and he reverted to form. He took control over the schedule, the message, even the itinerary. It was he who decided that the campaign would go on the non-stop 96-hour trip. It was he who decided the campaign should approach Ross Perot and ask him to drop out of the race.
"The captain has taken control of the helm," his press secretary, Nelson Warfield, reported, with more than a little relief. In the final days of the campaign, Mr. Dole -- unplugged and unfettered -- was antic, focused, defiant, sometimes bitter but often funny. He seemed genuinely to be enjoying himself, even as his last campaign was spiraling out of control.
It all ended Tuesday night, in a hotel suite on the 11th floor of the Renaissance Hotel in Washington. Mr. Dole was there with his wife, his daughter, Robin, Mr. Reed and Senator John McCain of Arizona. He watched calmly as the election results came tumbling in, confirming what he had known since that moment his sister had turned to him on the stage in Wichita and probably even before that. Still, there was one last bit of business to attend to.
It was nearly 11 o'clock, and with the election at its unsurprising conclusion, Mr. Dole turned to Mr. McCain, his loyal friend from the Senate.
"We ought to start planning my speech," he said.
 
Late Night With Dole
(By The Associated Press) -- With no transition duties to worry about, Bob Dole is headed for an appearance with David Letterman.
Mr. Dole is a scheduled guest on "Late Show with David Letterman" tonight, along with the broadcaster Ted Koppel and the singer Mary Chapin Carpenter, a Letterman spokeswoman said.
Mr. Letterman's show is being broadcast from Washington tonight, part of a series of trips he is making around the country.

Squeeze U.N. And the City Feels the Pain

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
DURING the Presidential campaign -- in fact, because of it -- a prominent foreign resident was mugged on the East Side of Manhattan. At least, that is how some observers of this scene describe what happened, people who usually know what they are talking about.
The mugging, you should know, was political in nature. The victim: Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary General of the United Nations. Months ago, the Clinton Administration let it be known that it would rather walk barefoot over hot coals than allow him to continue working in Turtle Bay after his present term ends on Dec. 31. No Secretary General has ever been denied a second term, but the American threat to veto attempts to extend Mr. Boutros-Ghali's tenure means that he will probably spend Christmas packing his bags. 
 With the election behind us, the struggle over who will lead the United Nations is expected to get intense in a hurry. And many foreign diplomats and commentators consider this a political mugging, because they see no good reason to give the boot to Mr. Boutros-Ghali. These people are convinced that the Administration beat up on him only to outflank the Republicans among voters ready to blame the big building on the East Side for everything that ails us, including fallen arches.
By now you may be wondering what this has to do with New York City. The short answer is: Plenty.
OUTRAGE at Washington is running high among foreign nations, which resent being pushed around on this issue by a country that is a chronic deadbeat, running up a debt to the United Nations that now stands at $1.5 billion. Any New Yorker knows that deadbeats do not get pushing-around rights. They're the ones who have to worry about being visited by those fellows whose nicknames show up in the tabloids wrapped in parentheses.
Not surprisingly, some resentful member states of the United Nations are asking why nearly half the organization's procurement contracts -- by far the largest share -- should go to the United States. Those contracts involve far more than dry-cleaning striped pants. They cover everything from ball-point pens to window washing.
Whom do you think United Nations people turn to when hallways need to be painted and light bulbs replaced? They do not haul out the Jakarta Yellow Pages. They call, obviously, on contractors in and around New York City. Should the prevailing hostility to the United States be translated into concrete action, it would inevitably come at New Yorkers' expense.
"There's a feeling among some states that if you don't pay your dues, why should you get our contracts?" said Sylvana Foa, the spokeswoman for the Secretary General.
A few diplomats in town have been heard muttering privately that the United Nations ought to just pick itself up and move out of the United States -- lock, stock and pork barrel. But this comes from a tiny minority. There is no campaign to flee New York. As one city official put it: "Honestly, for the U.N. to move, it would cost an awful lot of money. Where would they go?"
BUT scaling back on local contracts is a distinct possibility, and indeed it is already under way, a result of general belt-tightening and the budget crunches created by Washington's debt. Repairs have been delayed, construction plans are on hold and existing office equipment is stretched to the limit. Much of this affects the pockets of New York contractors and suppliers.
According to the United Nations Secretariat, procurement agreements with businesses in the New York region were worth $104.4 million last year. The 1996 figure, through September, is way down, to a mere $28.6 million. "No contracts are being awarded in many areas," an official at the Secretariat said, "and that has a domino effect. You may not hire an architect, and that affects his hardware suppliers, which may not hire as many workers, and so on."
Required cutbacks have led the United Nations to encourage 425 headquarters employees to take early retirement since Jan. 1, 1995. Their jobs have been left unfilled. And while most were foreigners, all lived here and spent money in local shops and restaurants.
Sometimes, New Yorkers become distracted by stories about foreign envoys racking up parking tickets or stiffing some store owner, and they forget that the giant diplomatic community here generates an estimated $3.3 billion in overall economic development and more than 15,000 jobs.
They might keep that in mind, especially should the numbers shrink, however slightly, because of the perceived mugging in Turtle Bay.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE ELECTION: THE INVESTIGATIONS;
D'Amato Declares His Pursuit Of Whitewater Inquiry Is Over

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato reiterated today that he would not seek to reopen Senate hearings into the Whitewater real-estate venture of President Clinton and his wife, Hillary.
"It seems to me we've done our job," Mr. D'Amato said in an interview. "Now it's time for us to let the special prosecutor do his. In my opinion, we should let the special prosecutor do his work and don't second-guess him." 
 Mr. D'Amato, who is up for re-election in 1998, has seen his approval ratings slip since he began leading the hearings in 1994. Exit polls on Tuesday showed that 59 percent of New York voters disapproved of how he does his job and 34 percent approved. At the same time, Mr. Clinton won New York with 59 percent of the vote. The numbers suggest that Mr. D'Amato's dogged attacks on Mr. Clinton, and particularly the First Lady, may have backfired in the minds of voters.
Mr. D'Amato said in the interview he had never had any intention of holding a new set of hearings, a fact that he said had been known for months. He said he repeated his position on Wednesday in response to a reporter's question at a news conference on other matters. He added that his position on Whitewater had nothing to do with the election results or with his approval rating.
In fact, it would be nearly impossible for Mr. D'Amato to convene more hearings. His committees' authorization to investigate Whitewater expired last June. New hearings would require a new resolution from the Senate, but the atmosphere has changed sharply in the 18 months since the Senate voted 96 to 3 to investigate the Whitewater deal.
Earlier this year, Republicans were barely able to win approval to extend the investigation. Now, Democrats would probably filibuster such a proposal to death. It takes 60 votes to end a filibuster, and the Republicans will have only 54 or 55 seats in the Senate, depending on the final election results.
And the Republicans' zeal for investigating the Whitewater affair has waned, as there is little indication that their pursuit of the matter played well with voters.
Still, Whitewater is not likely to fade from the headlines. The White House has repeatedly attacked the special prosecutor, Kenneth W. Starr, over the last few months as little more than a Republican political operative. In the coming months, Mr. Starr will be faced with decisions about whether to end his investigation or press on, possibly into the White House.
Mr. D'Amato said today that it was time for him to move on to the pressing issues that face ordinary people, especially the impending crisis in Medicare. "I'm going to concentrate on doing the things people want: smaller government, more efficient government and to be able to keep more of their money."
And he is not concerned, he said, about his approval rating.
"Two years is a lifetime in politics," Mr. D'Amato said. "You make a big mistake trying to pattern everything on the basis of a poll."
But an adviser close to Mr. D'Amato said aides believed his pursuit of the Clintons and Whitewater had hurt him significantly in New York and was largely responsible for his poor showing in polls.
Mr. D'Amato is now trying to recast himself in a new, softer image that will appeal to moderates in New York, the adviser said. One element of his new campaign was his support of the environmental bond act on Tuesday's ballot in New York, which he hoped would make him more appealing to environmentalists, the adviser said.
The Republicans lost the race for the Presidency, Mr. D'Amato said, because they failed to bring home to people how the Dole economic plan would affect them. "We could have done a better job of talking about the economic plan sooner," he said. "People are hurting. We should have argued the case that the biggest part of the tax plan was the $500 tax credit for each child."
And the Republicans failed to counter the Democrats' "chilling message" that Republicans wanted to make large cuts in Medicare, he said.
As a result, Mr. D'Amato's relationship with his party and with former Senator Bob Dole has been somewhat strained over the last year.
But Mr. Dole telephoned Mr. D'Amato on Wednesday for what the Senator described as a "personal" conversation.
"Here he was in all this pain and what-not," Mr. D'Amato said. "He's a great person. We're good friends and I'm hurting for him."

HEADLINE: Nigerian Plane With 141 Aboard Is Missing

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria, Nov. 7

 BODY:
A Nigerian passenger plane disappeared today on a domestic flight with 141 people on board.
The Aviation Development Company, the owner of the missing Boeing 727, said the plane had been flying from Port Harcourt, in Nigeria's southeastern oil-producing region, to Lagos, the capital, with 132 passengers and 9 crew members. 
 "A search and rescue operation is going on," the company said in a statement. A company spokesman said, "We are expecting the manifest from Port Harcourt."
Airport officials said they presumed that the plane had crashed. They said several foreigners, probably oil company executives, were on board.
Nigeria has had a spate of air disasters in the last few years when the economy has been in trouble and taken a toll on infrastructure.
The airline company, which is owned by Nigerian shareholders, operates domestic services and also flies to some West African countries. One of its plane crashed in Liberia last year. In January, a Nigerian presidential aircraft crashed in the north of the country, killing the son of the military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha. The crash was followed by another in Jos, in central Nigeria, in which a state military governor and several other officials were killed.

Crash Laid to Pilot Error
SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, Nov. 7 (AP) -- Pilot error probably caused a chartered Boeing 757 to crash into the Atlantic in February, killing all 189 people aboard, Dominican aviation authorities said today.
Most of the victims were German tourists returning to Frankfurt and Berlin. Also killed were 11 Turkish crew members, 7 Poles and 2 Dominican flight attendants.
The plane, leased by Alas Nacionales, a small Dominican carrier, crashed from 7,300 feet on Feb. 6, six minutes after takeoff from Puerto Plata, a popular resort on the north coast of the Dominican Republic.
In a final report, the Dominican civil aviation agency said the crew of the Birgenair plane did not recognize the danger of stalling when the steering column began shaking, a warning that a stall is possible.
The crew also was confused about different airspeed readings, including a false reading that the plane was flying too fast, the report said.
In March, Turkey's Transport Ministry blamed a faulty airspeed indicator for the crash.
Other factors contributed to the crash, the Dominican report said. It said the crew was not familiar enough with the 757's systems, including the automatic pilot system and procedures to follow when indicators show different airspeeds.
It also blamed a Birgenair ground crew for failing to cover airspeed sensors known as pitot tubes while the plane was being serviced. The ground crew then failed to insure the tubes were operable before releasing the plane, the report said.
Aviation industry sources and the United States National Transportation Safety Board, which took part in the investigation, have said airspeed indicators might disagree if dirt or debris blocked an external sensor.
Today's report did not say whether a pitot tube was blocked.
Blocked sensor ports may have also caused the Oct. 2 crash of an Aeroperu flight, which killed all 70 people aboard, Peru's Transportation Ministry said earlier this week.

HEADLINE: Perspectives and Musings on Clinton's Round 2;
Victory Inflation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Once again the strange workings of our Electoral College have confounded pundits and misled headline writers. You say (front page, Nov. 6) that Bill Clinton won "with solid margins across U.S." Other newspapers proclaim a "big sweep" and a "landslide," although Mr. Clinton won only 49 percent of the popular vote!
Because of the winner-take-all rule in the Electoral College, Mr. Clinton's ever-so-modest success at the polls was inflated into a lopsided electoral-vote victory -- 379 to 159. 
 In fact, Mr. Clinton's percentage of the popular vote was the second-lowest winning percentage in the last seven Presidential elections. The only candidate who received a smaller percentage of the vote and still won was Mr. Clinton himself in 1992.

HEADLINE: Retailers Beat Expectations For October

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Retailers beat analysts' expectations for October same-store sales yesterday with numbers that appeared to be a harbinger for a decent holiday shopping season.
Winners of particular note included department stores, which have been having a weak fall, and specialty apparel stores, which generally suffered dismal same-store sales in October 1995. Indeed last October marked the start of record-low sales for retailers, which served as a portent for an equally dismal Christmas. 
 But this October proved strong, in part because retailers were going up against very easy comparisons with last October, and for factors ranging from strong consumer confidence to fresh apparel buys in the clothing stores to the inexplicable urge that seized many shoppers and sent them into the stores ready to spend. These gains followed a relatively weak September.
As a result, some retailers raised their earnings estimates for the fiscal third quarter. The Goldman, Sachs retail composite index, which tracks same-store sales data, or sales at stores open at least a year, from about 60 retailers, gained 3.3 percent in October, well above the five-tenths of a 1 percent gain in October 1995.
"We are increasing our Christmas estimate from a gain of 5 to 5.5 percent to 5.5 to 6 percent for the season," Jeffrey M. Feiner, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., said.
"Consumer confidence is at its highest in seven years, there is low inflation and low interest rates. This is in combination with a very apparel-driven environment. And at the bottom line retailers are still budgeting for very low inventories and tight expenses."
The retail sales figures came out on the same day that the Federal Reserve reported that consumer credit fell 2.7 percent in September, the first decline in more than three years. But revolving credit, which includes credit cards, showed a modest increase and analysts said that the numbers would not affect the holiday shopping season.
"Consumer credit numbers have been shrinking gradually for much of the year," David Blitzer, chief economist at the Standard & Poor's Corporation, said. "Consumers in general should be really bullish. I think the retailing season should be good. There is nothing in the consumer credit numbers that should raise concerns."
As with each month of sales reports, some themes emerged. Like athletes who throw more and more weight on their bench press, stores that had a consistently strong fall got stronger still: Ross Stores Inc., an off-price apparel chain based in Redwood City, Calif., reported a gain of 17 percent in same-store sales, up from gains between 9 percent and 16 percent between July and October. The J. C. Penney Company, which had a fairly poor September but an otherwise improved fall season, soared ahead with a 13.1 percent gain in same-store sales.
And some of the weakest players got more sand kicked in their faces. The Kmart Corporation, which has barely eked out sales gains this fall, reported a 1.3 percent gain yesterday, down from last year's 2.4 percent gain in October and trailing Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which had a 4.2 percent gain, and Target Stores, which reported a 9.6 percent gain.
After months of sales that were all over the board, some themes within sectors also appeared.
Computer sellers, for example, almost all reported weak sales in October, despite easy comparisons with the year before. The Tandy Corporation said that sales fell 10 percent, although last year's October brought a mere 1 percent gain for the company. Circuit City Stores Inc. reported a loss of 9 percent in same-store sales, even though it lost 1 percent last year. The Best Buy Company reported a whopping 15 percent decrease in sales.
Compare this with specialty apparel chains, which by and large got clobbered last October and last holiday season. Stores like the Limited, Ann Taylor and Eddie Bauer all took advantage of poor 1995 October sales with strong showings yesterday. The Ann Taylor Stores Corporation reported a 15.9 percent gain over last year's 13.2 percent loss; Eddie Bauer gained 4 percent over a 1 percent loss last year and Gap Inc. had a 4 percent gain over last year's 2 percent upswing.
"There is still too much capacity in the hard-goods sector," Robert F. Buchanan, a retail analyst at NatWest Securities, said. "Also, there isn't much in the way of new product, no Windows 95 this year."
Department stores, too, have made some progress. Federated Department Stores Inc., after a rather soft fall, zipped in with a 4.9 percent gain, above last October's 1.8 percent loss and a mere eight-tenths of 1 percent gain in September. The May Department Stores Company, which has been inconsistent since last year, reported a strong 4.6 percent gain.
Anyone selling merchandise with strong brand names is sure to score a hit, retail experts say, because consumers cannot get enough of names like Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein. Department stores watch designer items fly out, and discounters sell the second runs or last year's merchandise to the masses.
As such, several companies raised their earnings estimates for the third quarter. Ann Taylor said it expects to earn one penny, or two cents more a share than the consensus estimate of 19 cents; Ross Stores, which analysts were predicting would have earnings of 50 cents to 52 cents a share, said that it expects to gain something closer to 63 cents and Limited said that it will earn 15 cents, a penny more than the 14-cent expectation.
The Limited's stock got hammered nonetheless yesterday when its Intimate Brands unit announced that it expected earnings to rise about 22 percent in the third quarter to 11 cents a share, better than the period last year but a penny less than analysts' estimates.
The Limited's shares closed at $18, down $2.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. Intimate Brands, which operates the Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body Works chains and is 83 percent owned by Limited, fell $3.75, to $16.25, in heavy trading.
While the holiday season is almost certain to shine, some analysts are still worried about what is in store once the trees are taken down and the last of the eggnog has been cleaned off kitchen counters. "There is no question in my mind that we are going to have a good if not great Christmas," Mr. Buchanan of NatWest said. "What bothers me is what happens next. By next year, now that the Presidential election is over, the Fed is more inclined to tame the inflation beast.
"I think Christmas is already in retail stocks," he added. "We are telling people to sell the group."

HEADLINE: Smoking Report Sees Signs Of Grim Fates, and of Hope

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
More than five million Americans now under the age of 18 will die prematurely from smoking, according to new Government projections that reflect increasing tobacco use by teen-agers.
But the Government also said yesterday that figures from California and Massachusetts showed how much success a combination of anti-tobacco advertising and higher cigarette taxes could have in reducing adult smoking. A third report showed wide differences among the 50 states in their percentage of adult smokers. 
 "These studies show the potential for prevention," said Michael D. Eriksen, director of the Office of Smoking and Health at the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which published the research in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. "The five million deaths is a projection that doesn't have to become reality. This is a wake-up call."
Dr. Eriksen said the studies underscored the need for the Food and Drug Administration's recently adopted regulations to curtail tobacco marketing that appeals to young smokers and to reduce their access to cigarettes. The tobacco industry, which is mounting legal challenges to the agency's authority to impose the new rules, dismissed the new studies as old news rehashed to build support for the regulations.
"It's reminiscent of things we've seen before," said Walker Merryman, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute in Washington.
The Government said its estimate of five million premature deaths was a conservative one based on current smoking rates. It included an allowance for people who will stop smoking after the age of 35 and thus have a reduced risk of early death from tobacco-related illnesses. The report estimated that the cost of treating such illness in today's young smokers at $200 billion in 1993 dollars.
The state-by-state figures reflect surveys made last year. Utah, where the anti-tobacco stance of the Mormon Church is influential and only 13.2 percent of residents 18 or older smoke regularly, is the only state below the 15 percent level that the Federal Government has set as a national target for the year 2000. Kentucky, a tobacco-growing state with very low tobacco taxes, has the highest rate, 27.8 percent.
The report on California and Massachusetts said those states had rapidly cut their rates of adult smoking by imposing a 25-cents-per-pack tax increase and dedicating some of the new revenue to statewide anti-tobacco advertising. From 1992, the year before Massachusetts adopted its measures, to 1996, the state spent $116 million on tobacco control programs, including $43 million on advertising. The number of cigarettes smoked by the average adult in the state fell 2.2 percent annually, based on state tax receipts.
The annual decline in the same period in California, which introduced similar measures in 1990, was 2.7 percent. Smoking rates also fell in 41 states that did not have such programs and for which data were available, but the annual decline was much lower: 0.8 percent.
The report cautions that Massachusetts' performance might not have been as good as the 19.7 percent overall decline suggested by the figures because cigarette sales jumped in neighboring New Hampshire, indicating that some people may have simply bought their cigarettes out of state rather that quit.
The results are also murkier than health officials would like because a price war in the tobacco industry cut local cigarette prices. Once inflation is considered, smokers ended up paying no more than before the taxes.
Still, tobacco critics say, the trends are clear enough to encourage similar programs in Arizona, which began them last year, and Oregon, whose residents voted on Tuesday to increase cigarette taxes by 30 cents a pack and to step up its tobacco education programs.
Mr. Merryman of the Tobacco Institute said such measures reduced smoking but also had side effects overlooked by their advocates, including encouraging smuggling, which could cost a state like California tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue while hurting retailers.
Some tobacco critics also said yesterday that a closer examination of the experience in California and Massachusetts might lead to renewed disputes over whether anti-tobacco efforts had become overly focused on young smokers. Adult smoking rates in California have actually risen slightly since 1994, when Gov. Pete Wilson and the tobacco industry diverted anti-tobacco advertising money into other health programs and focused on young people's smoking. 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 14, 1996, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about new research on smoking misstated the decline in smoking rates for adults in a study comparing California and Massachusetts statistics with those from other states. The decline was 2.2 percentage points in Massachusetts (from 23.5 percent to 21.3 percent), 2.7 percentage points in California and eight-tenths of a percentage point in 41 other states, not 2.2 percent, 2.7 percent and 0.8 percent respectively.
The article also misstated measures used to calculate the declines. The rates were based on the percentage of adults who smoke cigarettes, not the number of cigarettes smoked by the average adult, and were calculated by comparing two three-year periods, 1990-1992 and 1993-1995, not annual figures.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Down Again vs. Yen; Policy Shift Is Still Suspected

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar weakened further yesterday on concerns that Japan and the United States wanted a stronger yen, despite assurances from Japanese officials that their foreign exchange policy remained unchanged.
Traders were skeptical because the backtracking came a day after the dollar's plunge. Many suspected the statements were merely an attempt to slow the dollar's fall. Their doubts were increased by a lack of comment from United States officials supporting the dollar. 
 Traders reacted by selling the dollar going into the weekend.
"There seems to be a degree of concern out there," said Joseph Pedone, vice president at the New York branch of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan. "We just don't get a sense yet of what may be a shift in policy."
In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 111.50 yen, from 111.60 yen on Thursday. The dollar traded at 1.5053 German marks, down from 1.5120. The British pound rose to $1.6464 from $1.6448.
A senior Japanese monetary policy maker surprised the market on Thursday and sent the dollar tumbling against the yen by asserting that the yen's prolonged period of weakness was over.
The official, Eisuke Sakakibara, director of the Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau, also said the market had overestimated the weakness of the Japanese economy. Traders took this to mean that Japan's record-low interest rates could start rising, which would tend to increase the value of the yen.
Mr. Sakakibara, who is widely credited with orchestrating the gradual decline of the yen over the last 19 months, toned down his remarks yesterday, saying that the Finance Ministry has not altered its position.
In addition, Japan's new Finance Minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, said the dollar had not finished recovering against the yen from the lows reached in the spring of 1995.
Still, many traders said they believed these officials were simply trying to slow the yen's sudden ascent. "You've still got some nagging fears that the first thing out of people's mouths is what they really meant, and now they're trying to stop the damage," said Elliott Dix, assistant vice president of foreign exchange at the Signet Banking Corporation in Richmond.

HEADLINE: Eileen C. Dugan, 51, State Assemblywoman

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Eileen C. Dugan, a Brooklyn Democrat who was elected to her ninth term in the New York State Assembly only on Tuesday, died yesterday at Beth Israel Medical Center. Ms. Dugan, who lived in Carroll Gardens, was 51.
The cause was breast cancer, according to her family. 
 Gov. George E. Pataki, who served in the Assembly with Ms. Dugan, ordered state flags to be flown at half-staff in her memory.
Since 1991, Ms. Dugan, one of the principal political tacticians in the Assembly, had served as the chairwoman of the Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee, a major fund-raising and strategy-making arm of the party. This year, despite a determined Republican effort, Democrats won an additional seat in the Assembly and will hold 96 of its 150 seats when the new session begins in January.
Ms. Dugan, who won her most recent election with 70 percent of the vote as the candidate of the Democratic and Liberal parties, represented the 52d District, which includes not only Carroll Gardens, but also Bay Ridge, Cobble Hill, Red Hook, Sunset Park, Brooklyn Heights and Boerum Hill.
The district includes much of the Brooklyn waterfront in Red Hook, an area Ms. Dugan was dedicated to revitalizing through the establishment of open space and park land and the introduction of new business. She sponsored legislation that committed funds for studies to accomplish these ends.
At the time of her death, Ms. Dugan was chairwoman of the Assembly's Committee on Economic Development, Job Creation and Industry and a member of the Governmental Employees Committee, the Labor Committee, the Rules Committee and the Ways and Means Committee.
In 1985, five years after she was first elected to the Assembly, Ms. Dugan became the first female member of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, which writes the budget.
As chairwoman of the Committee on Economic Development, she was successful in establishing economic development zones in deteriorating neighborhoods.
As a member of the Subcommittee on Displaced Homemakers, she was active in the passage of legislation to commit funds for training divorced or battered women in marketable skills at centers throughout the state.
Ms. Dugan was born in Carroll Gardens and attended the Grace Institute in Manhattan. She began her career in government in 1974 as a special assistant to the New York City Comptroller .
She is survived by her sister, Patricia Curtin of Sound Beach, L.I., and two brothers, Brian, of Holbrook, L.I., and Brendan, of Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: Treasury Securities Prices Lower in Shortened Session

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved lower in a shortened session yesterday, as investors took profits following Thursday's rally.
Prices surged on Thursday following an auction of new 30-year bonds that was better than expected. Yesterday, the price of the newly issued 30-year fell 2011/32 , to 100. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, edged up to 6.50 percent, from 6.48 percent at the close of trading on Thursday, but still down from the average yield at auction of 6.619 percent. Trading ended at 2 P.M. yesterday, and the market will be closed on Monday in observance of Veterans Day. 
 Investors are typically reluctant to hold securities over a long weekend, and yesterday they used a Government report on wholesale trade as a reason to sell. The report showed a 1.3 percent drop in inventories -- the third consecutive monthly decline. Shrinking inventories suggest that there may be an economic rebound ahead.
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a research analysis firm, said he was not surprised by yesterday's profit taking, noting that prices rose steadily this week through the Treasury's quarterly refunding.
"Now that supply is out of the way people will likely go back to looking at what is the state of the economy," he said.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation, Columbus, Ohio, said the strong demand seen in the 30-year bond auction on Thursday boded well for the market in the short run.
Next week, the market will turn its attention to reports on consumer and producer prices, retail sales, industrial production and trade.
Mr. McCarthy said: "I think the economy is growing moderately, but it is slowing down. As a result the Fed is not going to do anything and I expect longer-term rates to continue to decline. The key is that the consumer spending is tapped."
Mr. Chan said the reports on producer prices and consumer prices should give additional clues on the worrisome subject of labor pressures. "My suspicion is that the numbers will still portray only small, incremental increases in overall inflation, but one has to keep in mind that these increases could begin to add up over time," he said.
While Mr. Chan acknowledges the data on labor cost pressures have been spotty, he fears that the Fed will not react to the growing tightness in the labor market fast enough. The Fed's interest-rate policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee, will meet on Wednesday, but few in the market expect the central bank to change rates.

HEADLINE: Norfolk Raises Bid for Conrail To $10 Billion

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Norfolk Southern Corporation raised the ante yesterday for Conrail in the battle to control rail freight in the East by increasing its bid by 10 percent, to $10 billion cash, or about $1.5 billion more than the offer from its rival bidder, the CSX Corporation.
Only three days ago, CSX sweetened its own cash-and-stock offer and Conrail reaffirmed its Oct. 15 merger agreement with CSX and strengthened the ties between the two railroads. CSX offered $110 a share in cash for 40 percent of Conrail's stock immediately. After the merger is approved by Federal regulators, CSX would acquire the remaining 60 percent through a stock swap. At yesterday's closing price, the entire offer is worth about $93 a share. 
 Norfolk Southern now is offering $110 cash a share for all shares of the Consolidated Rail Corporation and the $17-a-share gap between the two offers may be too much for either CSX or Conrail to ignore. Some analysts expect that CSX will have to take some action, possibly before Conrail's board meets on Tuesday to issue a response to Norfolk Southern's hostile tender offer. In the meantime, Conrail, which is based in Philadelphia and controls nearly all freight traffic in the Northeast, has asked shareholders not to act on the offer from Norfolk Southern.
"CSX's offer is of lesser economic value and it makes it harder for the Conrail board to forget their fiduciary responsiblity," said Douglas W. Rockel, an analyst at Furman Selz Inc. "If they still want to acquire Conrail they have to consider revising their offer."
The latest move by Norfolk Southern sent Conrail's share price up by $3.375 to close at $96.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Norfolk Southern's shares closed down 37.5 cents at $86.625 and CSX was unchanged at $44.25.
Norfolk's richer offer might have pushed Conrail's stock even higher, but the battle for Conrail is complicated by anti-takeover laws in Pennsylvania designed to protect companies from hostile acquisitions.
Conrail shareholders have to approve the merger ultimately, but under state statutes, the company's directors can shun a higher offering price in the interests of the corporation and employees. In addition, the merger agreement between CSX and Conrail contains a $300 million breakup fee, more than $100 million in stock options for CSX and a freeze-out provision that bars Conrail from negotiating with another bidder until July.
Norfolk Southern, which has referred to the merger agreement as a "coercive" front-end-loaded offer that forces Conrail directors to give up their fiduciary responsibilities, is hoping to entice shareholders, if not Conrail directors, with its all-cash offer. "This offer demonstrates our commitment to acquire Conrail," said David R. Goode, chairman of Norfolk Southern. "This will make it possible for the shareholders to accept what seems to us to be a clearly superior offer."
CSX declined comment on the new offer, but whatever the railroad opts to do, the bidding war is probably coming to a close. For now, Conrail remains committed to what it calls a strategic merger with CSX.
Soon the battlefield will shift to Federal District Court in Philadelphia and to a special meeting of Conrail shareholders sometime in mid-December. A court hearing is scheduled for Nov. 18 on Norfolk Southern's request for a preliminary injunction blocking the Conrail-CSX merger. Norfolk Southern plans to argue that at the very least Conrail's directors are obligated to consider its offer under Pennsylvania law. But legal experts and Wall Street analysts give Norfolk Southern only a slim chance of overturning the friendly merger in court.
Perhaps more importantly, Norfolk is lobbying stockholders to oppose a change in Conrail's bylaws, which require anyone who buys more than 20 percent of the company to offer to purchase the remaining shares for the same price, in this case $110 a share. The change would allow CSX to acquire more than 20 percent of Conrail stock without offering $110 in cash for every remaining share. That enables CSX to acquire as much as 19.9 percent of Conrail stock before the December meeting and then to vote in favor of the change. Many analysts expect CSX to acquire the first block of stock, because it is offering $110 cash, the same price as Norfolk Southern.
But many institutional shareholders and arbitragers who favor Norfolk Southern's higher offer say they will oppose the provision allowing CSX to go beyond 20 percent. That would provide an opening for Norfolk Southern, which is offering $110 cash a share, versus a CSX stock swap that would value the remaining 60 percent of Conrail stock at $82.13 a share, based on Friday's price.
"We need some help from stockholders," one person in the Norfolk Southern camp conceded.
"The court hearing and the shareholder vote in mid-December take on paramount importance with the increased bid from Norfolk," said Brian Routledge, an analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. "The court case will determine whether Norfolk can penetrate the legal barriers erected against their offer and the vote will show whether shareholders are willing to accept a lower offer from CSX."
But some analysts now are worried that the sale price for Conrail has escalated beyond reason. The gains from a merger with either CSX or Norfolk Southern are pushed further and further into the future, said Steven Lewins, an analyst at Gruntal & Company.
"The bidding has gotten beyond what even Maverick would go for," Mr. Lewins said. "From an economic and political standpoint, the shootout here at the O.K. Corral should be turned into a negotiation at the round table. Nobody loses if they sit down and talk. Everybody can lose if they don't."

HEADLINE: Dow Keeps On Ascending at Record Pace

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose to records in a late day rebound amid prospects for growing profits and low inflation, giving the Dow Jones industrial average its best weekly gain in more than three months.
The rise in the Dow was led by Merck & Company as the index rose 13.78, to 6,219.82, bouncing back after falling almost 25 points. 
 "The market has just been extraordinary," said Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer at New Amsterdam Partners, which manages $340 million. "Given the way the economy has shaken out, it's not surprising. Inflation seems to be under control. I don't see imminent recession signs. Profits have held up fairly well -- they will continue to hold up."
The Dow closed above 6,200 for the first time this week, buoyed by optimism for economic and political stability following Tuesday's election. The advance came as investors bought an estimated $6 billion of mutual funds in the last three days, according to Charles Biderman, an analyst at Mutual Fund Trim Tabs. Investments that high are equal to a $40 billion monthly rate, which has not been seen since January, he said.
Still, at near-record levels, the question is, "How much are people willing to pay for the big-cap, solid earnings stories?" asked Jon Hickman, lead portfolio manager for $2 billion in growth stocks at Wells Fargo Asset Management Group in San Francisco.
With the Dow industrials up 3.29 percent for the week and the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 Index up 3.84 percent in the last five days, "The market isn't going to do a whole lot more from here to year-end," Mr. Clayman said. "The market is in the fairly valued range."
Among broad indexes, the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index rebounded 3.17, to 730.82, after falling 2.43, to 725.22, setting its fourth straight record. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 3.37, to 1,257.51, within a point of its all-time high.
Major regional banks such as Nationsbank Corporation, based in Charlotte, N.C., retreated after the Government said inventories shrank in September and sales rose, suggesting the economy may pick up steam as companies replenish their stocks to satisfy consumer demand. Nationsbank fell 1/2, to 94 1/8.
"At some point you're going to get some unpleasant or surprising inflation numbers," said Larry Rice, director of research at Josephthal Lyon & Ross, before the report. That's likely to unsettle both bond and stock markets, which have been "stretched," on a valuation basis, by the latest recent rally, he said.
Stocks were helped this week as the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond plunged to eight-month lows amid signs of tepid growth in the economy.
Dime Bancorp Inc. bucked the trend, gaining 7/8, to 16, in trading of 3.8 million shares, more than nine times its daily average. Investors said the New York-based savings and loan is a prime takeover candidate. Trading in options to buy Dime shares at 17 1/2 by next Friday tripled.
Norfork Southern Corporation raised the stakes in the bidding for the Northeast railroad Conrail Inc., increasing its all cash offer to $10 billion, or $110 a share, some $17 more a share than the CSX Corporation offered for Conrail in cash and stock.
Earlier this week, CSX raised the cash portion of its bid to $110 a share. Conrail rose 3 3/8, to 96 3/8. Norfork Southern fell 3/8, to 86 5/8. CSX was unchanged at 44 1/4.
Shares of liquor companies such as the Seagram Company and the Brown Forman Corporation advanced after a trade group decided to lift a self-imposed ban on television and radio advertising to increase flagging sales.
Seagram, distiller of Chivas Regal and other liquors, rose 1 1/8, to 38 5/8. Brown Forman, which makes Jack Daniels, rose 1 1/8, to 45 3/8.

HEADLINE: Canada Tries to Shake Off Economic Doldrums

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Gordie Howe ruled hockey and Howdy Doody was a big man on TV the last time interest rates in Canada were as low as they are today.
Canada's central bank reduced rates for the 20th time in 18 months today, dropping the prime rate to 4.75 percent, the lowest it has been since 1956. The prime rate is used by commercial banks to determine mortgage and credit card interest rates as well as the rates for car, consumer and business loans. 
 But even such invitingly low rates have not been sufficient to get Canada's consumers spending again. Retail sales have been so depressed for so long that stores, desperate for a good Christmas season, set up seasonal displays and started advertising heavily weeks before Halloween.
Nor have the lowest rates in 40 years stimulated enough growth to reduce the country's high unemployment rate. Today, Statistics Canada reported that unemployment rose to 10 percent in October, matching its highest level in two years. But Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns in Toronto, said the figures were not as bad as they might appear at first glance. For one, she said, the jobless rate was distorted by the three-week strike at General Motors.
Still, experts see good times ahead. Canada has been undergoing a substantial revamping in government and in the private sector, much as did the United States in the 1980's and Mexico after its disastrous devaluation in 1994. Economists say that while today's announcements of lower rates and higher unemployment seem to be contradictory, they reflect painful steps already taken that will lead to a recovery, perhaps by early next year.
"Basically, there is a lag of about 12 to 18 months between the decline in interest rates and the response of the economy," said Carlos Leitao, an economist at the Royal Bank of Canada. Mr. Leitao is forecasting a growth rate for 1997 of 3 percent, almost double the expected rate for this year. Growth could be even stronger in subsequent years, he said.
In recent weeks Canada's economy has had a lot to celebrate. Besides the dwindling interest rates, inflation has been holding at 1.5 percent, about half the rate in the United States. The Toronto Stock Exchange has hit several record highs in the last two weeks and the Canadian dollar has gotten steadily stronger, rising from about 73 cents to one United States dollar in September to around 75 cents this week.
Though stronger, the Canadian dollar is still considered undervalued, and that has helped Canada post record levels of exports this year. In August, Canada recorded its largest trade surplus ever. Led by exports of vehicles and agricultural products, Canadian exports increased 2.7 percent and totaled a record $23.2 billion.
At the same time, imports dropped by 2.7 percent, with imports from the United States slipping most.
All this has delighted Canadian businessmen. "The Good Times are Back" is the splashy headline on this month's Canadian Business magazine. The optimism is partly fired by the actions of Canada's provincial and federal governments, which have aggressively cut spending and reduced deficits. Seven of the 10 provinces are already showing budget surpluses and it is expected that by 1998, the federal Government will not need to seek any new borrowing to balance its accounts.
Many economists now talk of a virtuous cycle in Canada in which government revamping allows interest rates to decline, which in turn enables governments to trim budgets even more, and so on.
But there is a down side. While lower mortgage rates have sent the sale of existing houses soaring, the construction of new houses plummeted 9.8 percent in October, a sign that builders remain unconvinced that a recovery has started. And two weeks ago civil service unions in the Toronto area helped organize one of the largest demonstrations in Canada's history to protest deep cuts in the Ontario provincial budget. Pensioners and savers have watched the return on their investments shrink as interest rates declined.
In a speech this week, the head of the central bank, Gordon Thiessen, rejected suggestions that the Bank of Canada should be willing to accept a higher rate of inflation to spark the economy.
"Inflation will work as a lubricant," Mr. Thiessen said, "only if it fools people into believing that they are better off than they really are."

HEADLINE: Religion Journal;
Voters of Various Faiths Return to Democratic Fold

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
Looking at a map of the Electoral College after Tuesday's election, one could begin to discern a certain broad religious division between the states won by President Clinton and those that went to Bob Dole.
The Republican candidate captured 19 states, most of them in the Great Plains and the Southeast, regions that form much of the heartland of Protestant America, in its mainline and evangelical varieties. 
 President Clinton, by contrast, triumphed in a more religiously diverse territory, taking states in the Northeast, upper Midwest and West Coast, as well as parts of the Sun Belt. Many of the states he won have very substantial Roman Catholic populations (Illinois, Louisiana and New Mexico, for example), large concentrations of Jewish voters (Florida, New Jersey and New York) or significant minorities of people who claim no religious affiliation at all (California, Nevada and Washington State).
Although this religious division between the two candidates' supporters is hardly precise, statistical evidence for it turned up in a nationwide poll taken among voters on Election Day.
The poll, in which Voter News Service surveyed 16,359 voters, indicates that Mr. Dole won the backing of 50 percent of the people who identified themselves as Protestants, while 41 percent of them supported President Clinton (who drew a lot of his Protestant support from Northeastern states).
Catholics presented an almost reverse image: 53 percent cast their ballots for the President, while 37 percent went for Mr. Dole, according to the poll.
Among the smaller groups, Jewish voters backed Mr. Clinton by a margin of almost 5 to 1, while voters who claimed no religious affiliation also favored the President over Mr. Dole, 59 percent to 23 percent.
The survey had two more categories that are very broad: people who said they belonged to a faith other than Judaism and Christianity, and people who described themselves as "other Christians" -- a very diverse group in itself that would include Orthodox Christians, Mormons and many others. More voters in both these categories said they voted for Mr. Clinton than for Mr. Dole.
Looking over the statistics, John Green, an authority on political trends among religious voters, said the Catholic results were the most interesting, as they recalled the margin of Catholic support Democratic Presidential candidates seemed to have lost years ago. "I think you'd have to go back to the 1970's to have that kind of division" of Catholics' votes, said Professor Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Center of Applied Politics at the University of Akron.
When it comes to voters' religious affiliations, the Republican Party has long counted on white Protestants -- Episcopalians, Presbyterians and the like -- to provide a core of its strength, especially in Midwestern states like Kansas (home, by the way, to Mr. Dole, a Methodist).
For several decades in this century, Democrats looked to a more diverse base: white Southern evangelical Protestants, who called themselves born-again Christians; Northern Catholics; Jews, and black Protestants. Majorities of these groups helped elect Roosevelt, Truman and Kennedy. But this fragile alliance fell apart in the 1970's.
Evangelicals began deserting the Democrats in droves, lured by the social and fiscal conservatism increasingly voiced by Republicans. Many have found the Republican Party a comfortable home. On Wednesday, the Christian Coalition, the conservative political group, released a poll of 1,030 people by Wirthlin Worldwide showing that born-again Christians who frequently attended church chose Mr. Dole over President Clinton, 53 percent to 36 percent.
Since the 1970's, Catholics, too, have shifted politically, but the picture they present is less clear. "There is no monolithic 'Catholic vote,' " wrote David C. Leege, a professor of government and international studies at the University of Notre Dame, in the magazine Commonweal two months ago. Older Catholics, whether they regularly attend Mass or not, tend to identify themselves more as Democrats, he wrote, while a younger generation -- more moderate on social issues and less likely to attend Mass -- leans Republican, largely for economic reasons.
Ronald Reagan won substantial Catholic support in 1980 and 1984. Four years ago, Mr. Clinton captured a plurality of Catholic votes, but President Bush was close behind.
That Mr. Clinton was able to draw such a wide margin of Catholic support this time may have resulted, Professor Green said, partly from negative reactions among Catholics to the Republican Congress's efforts to cut social welfare programs.
But does this mean that Mr. Clinton has reassembled the Democrats' old coalition? "If I was pressed," Professor Green said, "what I would say is what Bill Clinton was able to do was halt a certain progression away from ethno-cultural politics toward ideological politics."
He added that this might be only temporary. "Maybe this won't survive Bill Clinton," he said.

HEADLINE: Carolyn Agger, 87, Lawyer and Widow Of Justice Fortas

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Carolyn Eugenia Agger, a prominent tax lawyer and the widow of former Justice Abe Fortas of the Supreme Court, died on Thursday at her home in the Georgetown section of Washington. She was 87.
The cause was pneumonia, said the Washington law firm Arnold & Porter, where she retired two years ago as a senior partner and head of the tax practice section. 
 Ms. Agger was at the center of a rebellion that ruffled the world of big-ticket law offices in 1960 when she led an exodus of partners from the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. A partner in the firm's Washington office, she defected to Arnold, Fortas & Porter and took the entire Washington office with her.
At the time, Mr. Fortas was a member of the firm, now known as Arnold & Porter. And he was loath to give up his lucrative partnership when President Lyndon B. Johnson tried to cajole him into joining the Court in 1965. Mr. Fortas refused several times, but Mr. Johnson was not one to take no for an answer.
The assent to the bench meant a sharp financial loss, to $39,500 from an estimated yearly salary of $200,000, something that Mr. Fortas openly derided. It also angered Ms. Agger, suddenly the couple's principal breadwinner by far. It was Mr. Fortas, an Associate Justice from 1965 until resigning in 1969, who steered her into a legal career after their marriage in 1935.
Carolyn Eugenia Agger, who was born in New York City, graduated from Barnard College in 1931. After obtaining a master's degree in economics in 1932 at the University of Wisconsin, she worked in staff positions at various New Deal agencies.
She graduated from Yale Law School in 1938 and went into private practice when few women did. She was associated with Lord, Day & Lord and then advanced to a full partnership in Paul, Weiss before moving to Arnold, Fortas & Porter.
Mr. Fortas died in 1982 after 47 years of marriage. There are no immediate survivors.

HEADLINE: Japanese Premier to Name a High-Level Commission to Guide Promised Reforms

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto pledged today to appoint a blue-ribbon commission this month as the first step toward a major streamlining of the Government and deregulation of the economy.
"The first problem that I want to tackle with the new Cabinet is administrative reform," he said at a news conference, a day after he was formally re-elected in Parliament. 
 "It goes without saying that the socio-economic system that has sustained Japan for the last 50 years since the war is now showing its limits."
"Reforms will lead to a fundamental redesign of the public administration system in Japan," he added. He repeatedly emphasized his seriousness and suggested that the drive for restructuring was different from abortive attempts in the past.
But Mr. Hashimoto gave few specific examples of areas that could be streamlined or deregulated. Commentators and the public alike are skeptical that Mr. Hashimoto and his new Cabinet will really introduce dramatic restructuring.
Calls for political and economic change were a fundamental theme of the general elections last month, in which Mr. Hashimoto's Liberal Democrats won the largest number of seats. But Mr. Hashimoto's Cabinet, appointed on Thursday, seemed to have been chosen primarily on the basis of balancing rival political factions, and very few of the new Cabinet members have ever in the past shown zeal for sweeping change.
The centerpiece of Mr. Hashimoto's speech today was the promise of the new commission, which is to report back in a year. The commission will be directly under the Prime Minister and will cut across ministerial lines. Its members will be drawn from business and academia, with no bureaucrats allowed.
The proposals made by the commission are then to be presented to Parliament in 1998 and, ideally, will be put in place by 2001, Mr. Hashimoto said.
In the past, however, the problem has not been generating ideas for restructuring, but putting them into effect. Japanese libraries are full of studies and reports calling for change, but any of the proposals would harm powerful interests.
"In any bold reforms, resistance and opposition grow fierce," Mr. Hashimoto said, adding that his proposal would require tremendous political determination to carry out.
While his focus was on administrative reform, like reducing the number of ministries, he also talked about economic deregulation.
He especially emphasized the need to deregulate financial markets. "Over the last decade, the world's financial markets have been greatly reformed, but Japan's have been stuck in a rut," he said.
Asked about foreign policy, Mr. Hashimoto said his Government would work hard to reduce the burden of American military bases on Okinawa. In a sign of China's growing importance to Japan, he went out of his way to say his Government would also emphasize a good relationship with Beijing.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE ELECTION: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
President Makes It Official: He May Send More Troops to Bosnia Next Year

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that he was considering sending more American troops to Bosnia next year as part of a follow-on force to keep the peace, acknowledging something his aides have said for weeks.
NATO military commanders are drawing up detailed recommendations for what kind of force might be required after the current NATO mission, which includes some 16,900 American troops in a total force of about 50,000, expires on Dec. 20. Those troops are leaving gradually and will be out of Bosnia by mid-March, Pentagon officials say. 
 Under consideration is a new and smaller force, under a new mandate to preserve the peace. During the Presidential campaign, Republicans accused Mr. Clinton of waiting until after the election before disclosing his plans to put more troops into Bosnia. Last year, after the Dayton Accords brought peace to Bosnia, the Administration promised that all American troops would be out of Bosnia by this Christmas.
At his first news conference since the election, the President said he was still awaiting NATO's recommendation on what a new force should do, where it should be based and how large it should be.
"It is conceivable that we could participate," he said, "but it depends upon exactly what the recommendation is."
But before deciding, the President said, "we would like to see the proposed mission, we would like to see what our contribution would be. I'm going to assess the risks as I always do and the possible benefits, and then I will make a judgment."
The Atlantic alliance is studying options ranging from having no follow-on force at all to a heavily armed force like the current one. Defense Secretary William J. Perry has said he finds three options to be most plausible: complete withdrawal, without a follow-on force; a force capable of deterring the renewal of serious fighting, but relying on air power, without American ground troops in Bosnia; and a deterrent force also able to provide freedom of movement for Bosnians, which would require ground troops.
Most American officials and alliance diplomats think the last option is most likely. They suggest that a more lightly armed follow-on force of some 20,000 troops, including perhaps 5,000 Americans, could keep Bosnia stable and allow its new Government a better chance to take hold. Britain and France insist they will not field troops if the United States does not. But some American officials want to explore the possibility of keeping all or most Americans on standby outside Bosnia, in Germany, Croatia or Hungary, for example.
On other foreign topics, Mr. Clinton spoke optimistically about a larger Middle East peace once the Israelis and Palestinians can complete an agreement on an Israeli withdrawal of troops from most of the West Bank city of Hebron, where about 450 Israeli settlers live amid more than 100,000 Palestinians.
"If we can clear the Hebron hurdle -- it has such emotional significance to both sides as well as such practical significance -- I believe that will open the door to go on and fulfill all the other challenges that are there before us," he said.
He also promised to continue to work on bringing peace to Northern Ireland, but emphasized that "a genuine cessation of violence" was a prerequisite.
"All the parties have to be able to rely on one another not to start killing again, either in Northern Ireland or Great Britain, in order for this peace process to go forward," he said.
Mr. Clinton said he wanted a new Secretary of State who would have the qualities of a magician and an athlete, able to solve difficult issues from terrorism to expanding trade, and, like Warren Christopher, withstand "the rigors of intense travel, followed by intense meetings, followed by more intense travel."
The President said he would emphasize the building of "the first undivided democratic Europe in history," through a successful expansion of NATO that "solidifies our partnership with a democratic Russia, instead of undermining it"; peacemaking in the Middle East, Northern Ireland and Bosnia; handling the global threats of terrorism, organized crime and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and finally, "to take advantage of the extraordinary economic opportunities for the United States in building a global economic structure that is increasingly more open and fair, that will stabilize the rest of the world, and help America's prosperity to continue."
Mr. Clinton concluded his riff this way: "So I want a Secretary of State that can do all that. I guess that means I want a magician."

HEADLINE: The Tony Store That Poon Built;
Savior of Harvey Nichols Has His Eye on Barneys

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
The scene would be absolutely familiar to viewers of the British television show "Absolutely Fabulous." Edina and Patsy, the two vodka-swigging fashion-victim protagonists, are heading for Edina's office in her limousine, when Patsy tunes in to her inner voice, the one crying out: "I must go shopping!" She turns to Edina. Why not stop just for a minute, she wheedles, at Harvey Nicks?
The two always do go to Harvey Nicks -- or Harvey Nichols, as the sleek London department store is officially called -- emerging hours later tipsy with wine from the black-and-chrome bar and laden with $1,300-and-up clothes from designers like Christian Lacroix and Dolce & Gabbana. They have succumbed, it seems, to what their favorite department store itself proudly calls "the Harvey Nichols experience." 
 Why they head for Harvey Nichols and not, say, Harrods -- which stands like an enormous dowager ship just down Brompton Road in the tony Knightsbridge section of London -- is due more than anything else to the leadership of Dickson Poon, the flamboyant Hong Kong billionaire whose company, Dickson Concepts (International) Ltd., bought the store in 1991. Not only has Mr. Poon -- who has a 51 percent stake in Dickson Concepts -- presided over Harvey Nichols's transformation from a past-its-prime department store into a mecca for the trendily well-heeled, but he also has, in the space of five years, turned it into a true financial success story.
That combination presumably is what Mr. Poon figures he could bring to Barneys New York, the fashionable American chain in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings for which he reportedly bid $350 million this summer in Dickson Concepts' first foray into the United States.
Should the sale go through -- an outcome that is by no means certain, with Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and possibly others also looking at a deal -- Barneys would be just the latest acquisition in Mr. Poon's vast empire, an array of boutiques and restaurants spreading outward from Hong Kong into China, Taiwan, Indonesia and Japan.
Some people close to the Barneys situation say Mr. Poon, miffed over public disclosure of his interest, has grumbled that he just might not want to buy the New York retailer after all. But these people also say that negotiations are continuing full force.
In Britain, Mr. Poon has cause to be proud of Harvey Nichols's financial performance. In 1991, the company posted an operating loss of $6.3 million; for the fiscal year ended last March, it showed an operating profit of $14.9 million. Sales per square foot have steadily increased, to $945 in the 1996 fiscal year. (By comparison, Harrods did about $805 of sales per square foot for the fiscal year ended last January.) Meanwhile, net sales soared -- from $83.5 million in the 1993 fiscal year, to $137.1 million in the 1996 fiscal year.
In April, Mr. Poon floated 49.9 percent of the company on the London Stock Exchange at slightly above $4 a share, giving the company a valuation of $224.2 million -- or nearly triple his company's initial investment. Since then, the shares have risen to 342.5 pence.
This week, Mr. Poon announced plans to list its wholly owned S. T. Dupont subsidiary, a French manufacturer of men's wear and other items, on the Paris stock exchange, a step he said would add to Dickson Concepts' $90 million cash hoard for future acquisitions.
Harvey Nichols's contribution to this rosy financial picture is due, analysts and people in the fashion business say, to the impeccable retailing sense of Dickson Poon and the keen financial acumen of his top lieutenant at the store, Joseph Wan, the chief executive.
"Harvey Nichols has changed very dramatically in the last five years," said Hayley Owen, a 33-year-old bridal designer, shopping there at lunchtime earlier this week. "It was a little old-fashioned, a little staid. But now it's young, it's vibrant, it's trendy, and the clothes are of great quality. Plus, they have a brilliant food hall."
It was in 1991, at the height of Britain's grinding recession, that Mr. Poon defied conventional wisdom by paying some $157 million for the ailing Harvey Nichols. The store by then was a musty 178 years old, having started as a family-owned linen shop and then gradually expanding to become a 150,000-square-foot department store, focused on clothing. In 1985, the Burton Group, a retailer based in London, bought it from its then-owner, Debenhams, but its reputation remained second-rate and its financial outlook was poor.
"Everybody said he wouldn't be able to do anything with it," Amit Thakar, a small companies analyst with ABN Amro Hoare Govett, said of Mr. Poon. "And within three years the business was turned around totally."
Victoria Melendez, the Britain retail analyst for Morgan Stanley, which advised the company on the initial public offering, attributes the turnaround to three things: a multimillion-dollar modernization and refurbishment program, strict inventory and cost controls, and a changed sales mix that leans more heavily toward concession sales.
First off, Mr. Poon announced that he had had it with the store's dowdy, downscale image. "When Dickson took over, he said, 'I want you to make this the most up-market store in Europe,' " said Mary Portas, Harvey Nichols's marketing services director. "Under the Burton Group, rightly or wrongly, the store had gone more mass market. We went for the biggest market share of the smallest group."
The store was revitalized, floor by floor. On the top floor, traditionally considered a department store wasteland, the management closed down the sleepy carpet department and unprofitable beauty salon, and summarily moved the space-consuming executive offices to another building.
The move opened up some 25,000 square feet of retail space, which was transformed into a food fetishist's paradise, with a restaurant, coffee bar, and cafe that attract London's bold and beautiful (among them Harvey Nichols's highest-profile customer, the Princess of Wales herself). Mr. Poon also created a less unwieldy version of the famous Harrods food hall, with hard-to-find imported goods at steep prices (a 6-ounce . bag of Nestle's chocolate chips sells for nearly $5), expensive meat and produce, and an array of Harvey Nichols's own foods in silvery containers.
The other floors also underwent almost $17 million worth of repainting, refurbishing and reconfiguring. Big-name designers like Ralph Lauren, Moschino and Vivienne Westwood were brought in to help woo the store's target customers -- not the tourists who favor Harrods, but women who live within a 10-mile radius of the store and are willing to pay about $1,600 for, say, a velvet Vivienne Westwood skirt with an enormous bustle.
"Harvey Nichols became a directional, fashion-forward store," said Helen David, whose English Eccentrics label sells upper-end clothes, like $1,000 velvet devore black-and-silver evening wraps, at Harvey Nichols. "Their customers are the type who rush in at the earliest possible moment to see what's there. We can sell long velvet dresses in heat waves in June, because they're new in the store."
As the store upgraded its goods, it also spiffed up its image. It put up dramatic window displays, such as an enormous silver fish made of cans and extending across all the windows. It created sharp, witty advertisements, using a model dressed entirely in spaghetti to herald the opening of the food hall, for instance.
Unlike some cutting-edge stores -- Barneys comes to mind, with its sometimes scary ambiance -- Harvey Nichols is designed to welcome, not intimidate. "Retail comes down to gut feeling," Ms. Portas said. "You put glamour, sex, slightly radical and leading-edge images in the window, but when you get inside you've got to make people feel comfortable, that it's an environment they can feel safe in."
At the same time, all the new features were designed to create what Ms. Portas calls a "shopping experience" that encourages customers to proceed from coffee in the basement, through the fashion racks, to a fashionable meal on the fifth floor.
The store also began taking tough financial measures, including cutting payroll costs, trimming executive perks and bringing in more concessions -- individual retailers who sell their own products, using their own staff, in the store. (Presumably it is this kind of management prowess that Mr. Poon would bring to Barneys.) In return for the space, the concession-holders pay Harvey Nichols a service charge and a percentage of sales, subject to a guaranteed minimum amount.
Harvey Nichols now has about 70 concessions that account for about 40 percent of nonfood sales, a figure that is a bit higher than for comparable stores. While somewhat lowering the store's gross profit margins, analysts say, the increased concessions have given the store a steady stream of income and allowed it to drastically lower its inventory, reducing the need for money-losing discounting.
"There is a monitoring process that wasn't there before, with incentives for concessions to perform well," Mr. Thakar said approvingly. "If the concessions don't perform well, they're kicked out of the store."
But the arrangement seems to work for the concessions, too. "Harvey Nichols has very loyal customers who will go in to the store and do all their shopping, rather than walking up and down the street," said Nancy Oakley, a spokeswoman for Nicole Farhi, the London designer. "It's like a complete luxury, the idea of shopping there."
In recent months, Dickson Concepts has expanded in Britain, opening an already popular restaurant, Oxo Tower, on the South Bank of the Thames and, in October, opening a second Harvey Nichols store in Leeds, a city whose residents were apparently crying out for the chance to buy shiny Jean Paul Gaultier shirts for about $575 apiece. Though the company has not yet released sales figures, the early signs are good: on the first day, the store was so crowded that guards had to close the doors and let in customers in batches, every 30 minutes.

GRAPHIC: Photos: FIRST FLOOR -- Women's clothing is the largest segment of Harvey Nichols's business. Like much of the store, this floor has been redisigned. It has high profile designer and evening clothes that cater to well-to-do customers. BASEMENT -- Men's clothing, which is on this floor, has expanded twice since the store was acquired, adding 18 percent more retail space. It also sells more high fashion and casual clothes to match the mix of the rest of the store. TOP FLOOR -- The biggest change in the store was on this floor, which now has an expensive restaurant, a food market and a wine shop. Much of the office space that was here before the store was bought has been moved off the premises. (Photographs by onathan Player for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
For Japan's Auto Makers, Windfall From Yen

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 8

 BODY:
A sharp fall in the value of the yen in the last year has been providing an earnings windfall to Japan's major automobile companies.
Owing largely to currency fluctuations, the Toyota Motor Corporation reported today that net income for the first half of its fiscal year more than quadrupled as automobile exports surged. The Nissan Motor Company, meanwhile, recorded a first-half profit for the first time in five years. 
 Even with the help of currency, however, the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation reported a 26.3 percent first-half decline in net income as its sales in its home market declined.
Toyota, Japan's largest automobile manufacturer, said its unconsolidated net income for the six months ended Sept. 30 reached 131.5 billion yen, or $1.17 billion, its highest level since the tail end of Japan's bubble economy in 1990. Sales rose 9.6 percent, to 4.08 trillion yen, or $36.46 billion.
Operating income grew more than sevenfold, to 205.4 billion yen, or $1.83 billion. But 140 billion yen of that gain resulted from the fact that a given amount of dollar-based sales overseas was worth a lot more yen this year than last year. The currency rates averaged 108 yen to the dollar in the first half of this year compared with 89 yen to the dollar a year earlier.
The weakening yen also helped Toyota register a stunning 17.1 percent increase in exports, as measured by units, more than offsetting the company's slight decline in sales in its home market. Paced by strong demand for its 4Runner and RAV4 sport utility vehicles, Toyota's exports to the United States rose 12.1 percent, to 228,000 units in the half.
Auto exports from Japan have been declining steadily in the last few years as the yen had strengthened and as the companies moved production offshore. Now the export slide has halted, and might even be reversing, which could heat up trade tensions. Exports for the Japanese automobile industry as a whole, however, are nowhere near as strong as for Toyota and many executives say the long-term trend is still to move more manufacturing out of Japan.
Exports by Nissan, for instance, declined by 9.5 percent in the first half as measured in units. Its domestic vehicle sales also declined 2.8 percent.
Yet thanks to currency changes and cost-cutting it recorded a net profit of 11.6 billion yen, or $103.5 million, compared with a loss the year before of 13.4 billion yen. Sales were 1.74 trillion yen, or $15.5 billion, up 1.5 percent.
Mitsubishi said its net income was 7.90 billion yen, or $70.5 million, down 26.3 percent. Sales fell 8.1 percent, to 1.18 trillion yen, or $10.5 billion.
The results for all the companies were for the parent company only, meaning they excluded subsidiaries like Toyota's manufacturing operation in Kentucky and Nissan's in Tennessee. Nissan officials said the company had also returned to the black on a consolidated basis.
There are now signs the currency windfall will shrink. On Thursday the dollar tumbled more than 2 yen, to 111.6 yen, amid speculation that the United States and Japanese Governments would relax their support for a strong dollar. Toyota said it expected a further decline, with an average currency rate of 105 yen to the dollar in the second half.
Even without the currency tail wind, Toyota looks to be in a strong position. It has recently introduced several fast-selling vehicles in Japan. It revised upward its forecast results for the full year.
Nissan and Mitsubishi, however, revised some projections downward, saying it was difficult to sell in the fiercely competitive Japanese market. The two companies are losing out to Toyota and Honda, which is rapidly expanding its market share on the strength of its popular new sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and station wagons.
